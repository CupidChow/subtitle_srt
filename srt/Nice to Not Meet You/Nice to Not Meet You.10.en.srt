1
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,667
Thank you for the ride home.

2
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,587
Why do you have so many bags?

3
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,963
They're just my stuff.

4
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,049
Drive home safely, Mr. Lee.

5
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,801
Okay.

6
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,887
Thank goodness it's the weekend tomorrow.

7
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,805
Right?

8
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,727
- Are you kidding me?
- Sleep well.

9
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,104
And sleep in tomorrow.

10
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,191
Seriously?

11
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,108
Hey, it's Kang Pil-gu!

12
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,622
Hey, go ask him.

13
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,834
Excuse me.

14
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,293
Are you Kang Pil-gu?

15
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,461
Holy cow, it is!

16
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,261
Should we go home and watch <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>?

17
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,555
Yeah, let's rewatch the first season.

18
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,850
- Season one is boring.
- Season four is the best.

19
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,851
No, season two is good.

20
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,271
Let's watch season one
and go back to where it all began.

21
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,814
But season two is more fun.

22
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,107
You should head home now.

23
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,484
Okay. I'll get going, then.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,659
- That's boring.
- No, it's not.

25
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,369
Are they gone?

26
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,579
Yes, they're gone.

27
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,797
"His clothes are caked with dirt
as he stares coldly at the gang members."

28
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,882
Jeong-sin, are you home?

29
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,469
Jeong-sin, I went to the set today
to introduce myself.

30
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,637
And guess what happened?

31
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,308
My bro Pil-gu said hello to me first!

32
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,434
Really?

33
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,436
- Give it your all, you punk.
- Of course.

34
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,272
Hey, what about the <i>gimbap</i>?
Did you eat it? It was good, right?

35
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,315
Yeah, it was.

36
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,692
I really enjoyed it.

37
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,694
Jeez.

38
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,498
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,416
- Go Kang Pil-gu!
- Go Kang Pil-gu!

40
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,585
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

41
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,441
<i>Forget about that guy already</i>
<i>and come to me.</i>

42
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,694
And I'm still waiting for you.

43
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,088
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO

44
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,382
PRESIDENT LEE JAE-HYEONG

45
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,326
<i>It's not like it'll contain state secrets.</i>

46
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,871
Let's see here.

47
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,838
Gosh.

48
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,966
How old was she in these pictures?

49
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,801
She's so adorable.

50
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,052
Goodness.

51
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,140
How cute.

52
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,225
She's wearing her best dress.

53
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,686
WI JEONG-SIN

54
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,777
- Hey, Su-ji.
<i>- Yes, I'm listening.</i>

55
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,654
There's this woman I know.

56
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,700
<i>And I saw her with another man.</i>

57
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,785
But…

58
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,330
why does that bother me so much?

59
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:34,126
<i>Feeling angry in a situation like that</i>
<i>is a perfectly natural reaction.</i>

60
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,378
<i>However, it's important</i>
<i>to keep your emotions in check</i>

61
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,547
<i>and deal with it wisely.</i>

62
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,758
You always make
pointless remarks like that.

63
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,844
<i>First, take a deep breath</i>
<i>and calm your mind…</i>

64
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,054
I'm done listening to you today.

65
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,562
Darn it, why am I on this app again?

66
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,772
SOULISHERE

67
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,734
"If it'll help even a little,
I'd like to remain friends."

68
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,069
Goodness!

69
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,779
Don't you have any pride?

70
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,781
You have no problem
throwing insults at me!

71
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,574
Darn it.

72
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,271
What the heck?

73
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,191
He was the one who messaged me first.

74
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,193
Why isn't he replying now?

75
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,463
<i>Onion!</i>

76
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,975
<i>I hope I didn't pressure you again.</i>

77
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,560
<i>Please reach out</i>

78
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,103
<i>whenever you feel ready.</i>

79
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,823
EPISODE 10

80
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,233
What's this?

81
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,277
You know it's your jacket, Mr. Lee.

82
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,279
The one I got for your birthday.

83
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,950
Have you forgotten?

84
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,663
I guess so.

85
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,749
I forgot for a moment where it was from.

86
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,462
- Wi Jeong-sin likes someone.
- I know.

87
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,506
But there shouldn't be a problem
unless the feeling's mutual.

88
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,509
I guess I forgot for a moment too.

89
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,137
That you're like a dandelion,
stubborn and impossible to tame.

90
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,778
Hello.

91
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,363
I returned the jacket to Mr. Lee.

92
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,124
You have something to say?

93
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,628
I'm sorry, but can you send
someone else to cover <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>?

94
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,545
Why?

95
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,798
He's giving you an exclusive
on a silver platter.

96
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,883
- It makes me uncomfortable.
- What does?

97
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,510
- You mean, Lim Hyeon-jun?
- Yes.

98
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,846
Since when did reporters
get to choose easy coverages?

99
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,349
Did you leave your tenacity at the door
when you came here?

100
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,520
The truth is, I'm a fan of Kang Pil-gu.

101
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,647
Right, a fan… Wait, what?

102
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,483
Surgeons aren't allowed
to operate on those close to them,

103
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,860
and judges can file a motion for recusal
if a conflict of interest

104
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,487
prevents them from being impartial.

105
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,823
My situation is no different,
so I'm filing a motion for recusal.

106
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,870
- You're all done now.
- Thank you so much.

107
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,498
Mr. Lim, we'll head out to the set first.

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,916
- Okay.
- We'll see you soon.

109
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,629
<i>I hope I didn't pressure you again.</i>

110
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,464
<i>Please reach out</i>

111
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,049
<i>whenever you feel ready.</i>

112
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,553
<i>If you don't want to go in circles,</i>

113
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,848
<i>maybe it's time to choose a path</i>
<i>and stick with it.</i>

114
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,933
<i>It seems you've</i>
<i>already made up your mind anyway.</i>

115
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,023
Right. Okay, good.

116
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,403

117
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,243

118
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,495
YOUR ACTIVITY WILL BE DELETED PERMANENTLY
"YES"

119
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,788
YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DELETED

120
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,960
- Mr. Hwang.
- Yeah?

121
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,463
When is Ms. Wi arriving?

122
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,007
I don't know. Maybe around 2 o'clock?

123
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,592
Yeah, at 2 o'clock.

124
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,303
Mr. Lim, it's time.

125
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,180
- All right.
- Got it.

126
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,349
Let's go.

127
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,977
- Bro, have some coffee.
- What?

128
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,645
Oh, thanks.

129
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,856
Is Ms. Wi not coming?

130
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,024
She's coming at 2 o'clock.

131
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,567
Right, 2 o'clock.

132
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,570
Jeez, my lower back.

133
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,739
When is Ms. Wi coming?

134
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,700
At 2 o'clock. I already told you!

135
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,953
You did?

136
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,499
- Lunch is here.
- Okay.

137
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,209
Come eat.

138
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,461
Go ahead and eat.

139
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,588
- Why?
- I'll eat with Ms. Wi when she comes.

140
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,256
Forget him. Let's eat.

141
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,592
Maybe you should give Ms. Wi a call.

142
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,844
She might have taken a wrong turn.

143
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,471
Give her a call, will you?

144
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,891
- Ms. Wi?
- I'm so sick of this.

145
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,021
- Have you had lunch?
- Yes, I have.

146
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,234
We can't take this out.

147
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,902
They've got to understand.

148
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,779
- Bro, where are you going?
- Huh?

149
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,988
Where are you going?

150
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,574
- Is Ms. Wi not coming?
- What's wrong with your ears?

151
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:40,784
I told you 2 o'clock!

152
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,411
At 2 o'clock.

153
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,328
It's not 2 o'clock yet?

154
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,790
If it were, she'd be here by now.
She's not here because it's not time yet.

155
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,501
I'm just asking
because reporters usually arrive early.

156
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,463
What's wrong with you, bro?

157
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,882
Hey, do I look better buttoned up?

158
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,429
- Just cover yourself up like this.
- No?

159
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,856
Yes, sir.

160
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,649
Oh, really?

161
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,776
Thank you for letting me know.

162
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,819
- Bro, 2 o'clock is here.
- What?

163
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,903
I mean, the reporter is here.

164
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,865
- Right, okay!
- Mr. Lim, she's in the waiting room.

165
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,950
Okay. Makeup team, touch up my hair!

166
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:22,868
Let's go.

167
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,961
What brings you here, Ms. Yun?

168
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,840
We thought Ms. Wi would be coming instead.

169
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,009
I'm here to do some coverage.

170
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,303
Does it really matter who shows up?

171
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,888
You're right, of course.

172
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,433
Is there a reason why Ms. Wi didn't come?

173
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,684
Is she sick?

174
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,187
She didn't get into an accident, did she?

175
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,231
There's no other reason
for Ms. Wi not to be here.

176
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,108
She says she's a fan of yours.

177
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,112
She didn't think it was right to let
personal feelings influence the coverage,

178
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:00,989
so that's why I came instead.

179
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,830
Ms. Wi told you she's a fan of mine?

180
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,249
Yes, and she filed a motion for recusal.

181
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,712
Wait, does that mean
you'll be coming here from now on?

182
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,173
That can't happen. It wouldn't be right.

183
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,841
Is there a reason I can't be here?

184
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,801
No, that's not what I meant.

185
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,554
Never mind.

186
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,682
Do you have feelings for Ms. Wi?

187
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,351
No!

188
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,020
I mean…

189
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,064
Oh, my back.

190
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,068
Jeez, Ms. Yun.

191
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,028
Don't laugh too hard.
You'll hurt your back again.

192
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,658
You went too far with that joke, ma'am.

193
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,159
Come on, Ms. Yun.

194
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,163
- Mr. Hwang.
- Yes?

195
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,624
Could I talk to Mr. Lim privately
before the interview?

196
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,792
Yes, of course.

197
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,217
Gosh, that was a close call.

198
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,679
Man, that woman is really perceptive.

199
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,055
LIM HYEON-JUN

200
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,932
We totally fooled her, though.

201
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,695
You like Wi Jeong-sin, don't you?

202
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,115
Jeez.

203
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,618
Why do you keep asking that?

204
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,704
I told you that I don't.

205
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,082
Is that so?

206
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,838
Then I guess it wouldn't matter
if Ms. Wi and Mr. Lee started dating.

207
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,506
Are they dating?

208
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,842
It's only a matter of time
unless we stop them.

209
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,181
Why are you telling me this anyway?

210
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,558
I want you to team up with me.

211
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,143
I'll be honest with you.

212
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,561
I like Mr. Lee.

213
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,482
- Hello.
- Hello.

214
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,818
So what do you say?

215
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,111
Do you want to team up with me,

216
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,280
or see Ms. Wi with another man?

217
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,043
We're on the same team now.

218
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:25,258
I'll do everything in my power
to send her to the set of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>.

219
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,303
So you do everything in your power
to win her over.

220
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,391
I will.

221
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,939
DEPT. OF JOURNALISM & BROADCASTING
17TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL CONTEST

222
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:40,982
Wi Jeong-sin!

223
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,734
Hey!

224
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,779
So you're a professor now.
It suits you better than being a reporter.

225
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,533
I think I'm better suited
to teaching students too.

226
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,871
Anyway, the fact that you came
all the way here

227
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,831
means you have something to ask me.

228
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,628
It's about Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan.

229
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,047
Ha Gee-wan?

230
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,132
At the Financial Supervisory Service?

231
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,844
Is he familiar with Lee Dae-ho,
the chairman of Eunseongilbo?

232
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,180
You probably didn't know
since you were new to the political desk,

233
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,474
but there was a rumor at the time

234
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,769
that Assemblyman Ha received land
from Lee Dae-ho under a borrowed name.

235
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:19,896
You mean, in Cheongwon City?

236
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,981
It was just a rumor back then,
and it still is.

237
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,109
When the aide died,
there was no witness left.

238
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,863
Do you know if the aide had any family
other than his wife?

239
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:29,823
Why do you ask?

240
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,950
They say money comes before family, right?

241
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,080
I guess there may have been
a money-related issue

242
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,083
in Mr. Woo Young-suk's family
that I wasn't aware of.

243
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,211
I'm just speculating too.

244
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,340
Thank you so much. I'll look into it.

245
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,092
Wait.

246
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,470
With that said, can I ask you a favor too?

247
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:54,848
A favor?

248
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,519
I can't believe
I'm finally meeting you, Ms. Seong.

249
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,731
I used to watch your movies on repeat
when I was young.

250
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,110
You must've been mature for your age.

251
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,155
Well…

252
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,699
The artistic value of <i>Madam Walnut</i>
and <i>The Godmother</i>

253
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,828
was overshadowed by the nude scenes,
but they were both masterpieces.

254
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,748
I heard Seon-u was playing
the younger Pil-gu.

255
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,875
I know it's shameless of me to ask,

256
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,502
but is there any role I could play too?

257
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,420
Oh, right.

258
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,839
I actually learned about that today.

259
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,841
No wonder he looked
so similar to Hyeon-jun.

260
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,634
I'm sorry, Director.

261
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,681
Well, there is a role
for the wife of a rich family

262
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,308
where Pil-gu's aunt
works as a housekeeper.

263
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,393
She gets into a fight
with her cheating husband

264
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,187
and ends up killing him.

265
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,150
Director, I know I can do this
if you give me a chance.

266
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm positive I can pull off the role!

267
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,071
Of course, Ms. Seong.
I have no doubt about your acting skills.

268
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,823
I look forward to working with you.

269
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,221
This smells good.

270
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,856
- I'll go to the set of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>.
- You should go to the set of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>.

271
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,859
What changed your mind?

272
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,947
I couldn't bring myself

273
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,699
to give away what was already in my hands.

274
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:39,953
I'll do my best.

275
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,287
Okay.

276
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,796
<i>Where's Mi-yeong?</i>

277
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,840
Where is she?

278
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,347
What's the point of asking

279
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,266
when you're about to die?

280
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,684
Cut.

281
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,812
Why are you acting
when I'm recording Mr. Lim?

282
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,982
- What else am I supposed to do?
- It looks awkward.

283
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,359
Mr. Lim's manager?
Can I see you for a moment?

284
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,362
- When do we start shooting?
- Soon, sir.

285
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,739
- Why did I get called in so early?
- I'm sorry, sir.

286
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,408
There's probably a lot to set up.

287
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,243
Oh, right.

288
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,162
Bro, why did you call Ms. Wi over here?

289
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,998
What if she runs into Director Bak?

290
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,334
I'm not a fool.

291
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,129
The second unit director
is in charge today.

292
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,216
No wonder you seemed so relaxed.

293
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,761
Cheers to that.

294
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,306
Hello!

295
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,224
- Hello.
- How are you?

296
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,685
- Good morning!
- Hello!

297
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,728
Hello.

298
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,813
Mr. Lim, you're early.

299
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,109
The second unit director is in today,
so what brings you here?

300
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,737
Unfortunately, Director Oh caught the flu.

301
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,113
- No!
- What? Why?

302
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,865
Oh, never mind.

303
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,950
He came down with the flu this morning,

304
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,077
so I rushed over
before we could send out a notice.

305
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,914
Hey, come here.

306
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:06,831
What is it?

307
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,920
How could you change
the schedule like that?

308
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,297
We had plans, you know!

309
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,842
You could've at least
covered up in a mask and gloves!

310
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,010
- He's right!
- Come on.

311
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,723
If I'd known Ms. Wi was coming today,
I would've… Damn it.

312
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,183
No.

313
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,309
This won't work.

314
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,019
Cancel today's shoot right now.

315
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,897
We should be canceling the interview,
not the shoot!

316
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:32,857
Right.

317
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,944
Hey, tell Ms. Wi not to come today.

318
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,403
Okay, got it.

319
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,739
Mr. Lim! Ms. Wi is here!

320
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,368
- She's here?
- Damn it.

321
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,285
Hey, you…

322
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,455
Run!

323
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,207
It's that way…

324
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:52,835
Damn it.

325
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,757
Hello, Director. What brings you here?

326
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,052
Oh, hello there.

327
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,682
I just stopped by to say hello.

328
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,394
Hold on. In episode five,

329
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,729
there's that daydream scene.

330
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,647
Right.

331
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,818
I was curious how it'd look.
Could I try on the makeup beforehand?

332
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,236
You know, like a practice run.

333
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,696
For what, exactly?

334
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,781
The scene where
Kang Pil-gu pictures himself in 30 years.

335
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,282
DIRECTOR BAK BYEONG-GI

336
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,327
Who are you, sir?

337
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,246
It's me.

338
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,539
- Director!
- Director?

339
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,665
Is the stunt team here?

340
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:31,916
Hey, stunt team?

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,501
- But Director, why…
- Your hair…

342
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,628
Hello, Sports Eunseong readers.

343
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:39,382
Thank you for coming to the set
of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>'s fifth season.

344
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,050
Thank you.

345
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,760
Great, thank you.

346
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,388
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

347
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,980
Thank you for inviting me to the set today

348
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,190
and for offering me the interview first.

349
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,859
Goodness.

350
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,446
I should be the one thanking you
for coming all this way.

351
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,283
Have you visited a set before?

352
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,618
No, it's my first time.

353
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,457
There are more people than I expected.
It's pretty cool.

354
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,584
Right.

355
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,545
So could you share a spoiler
from this season of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>?

356
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,588
A spoiler?

357
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,968
It feels weird giving a spoiler myself.

358
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:25,720
Well…

359
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:31,642
Let's say you earned this spoiler
through really hard work, okay?

360
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,981
The biggest plot twist
in season five of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>

361
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,858
is Pil-gu going from the people's hero

362
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,360
to a corrupt detective.

363
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,906
That's it.

364
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,745
Can I get your autograph?

365
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,751
We've met so many times,
and now you want my autograph?

366
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,087
We're no strangers, so why an autograph?

367
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,838
How about we just take some photos?

368
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:01,756
It's not for me.

369
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,424
I'm doing a favor for someone.

370
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,429
My son is a huge fan of Kang Pil-gu.

371
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,473
You work at the entertainment desk, right?

372
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,809
Would you mind getting me his autograph?

373
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,353
His name is Jung Eun-chan,
and please write "Study hard" next to it.

374
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,563
I heard his dream is
to become a police officer,

375
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,024
and that he promised to study hard
if he got your autograph.

376
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,360
"Study hard"?

377
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,622
TO. JUNG EUN-CHAN
STUDY HARD

378
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,254
Thank you.

379
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,171
By the way,

380
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,215
will you watch the shoot before you leave?

381
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,550
Yes, of course.

382
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,510
Shoot coverage adds depth to the article.

383
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,555
Well…

384
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,932
When you're done with that,

385
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,143
will you be busy afterward?

386
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,227
Yes.

387
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,229
- You're busy?
- Yes.

388
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,273
I have a lot of article deadlines to meet.

389
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:04,110
It's just that there'll be
a small dinner gathering afterward.

390
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,863
If you join, you'd have the chance
to talk to other actors.

391
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,990
And if I get a buzz after a few drinks,

392
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,826
I might accidentally give away
another spoiler.

393
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,036
Are you sure you can't make it?

394
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,373
It's too bad,
but I hope I can join next time.

395
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,709
There's no next time.

396
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,879
- Excuse me?
- Today's your last chance.

397
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,385
Why are you so dense?

398
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,388
When I ask to see you later,
it means I'm interested in you.

399
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,764
I want you to join so I can talk to you.

400
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,057
How can you not get that?

401
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,726
Do you really need me
to spell it out for you?

402
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,819
I'm Melomaster.

403
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,866
I'm Melomaster.

404
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,494
I'm the one you texted all night,

405
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,829
opened up to,

406
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,247
and asked to meet in person.

407
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,833
I'm that Melomaster!

408
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,546
Oh, right.
Is Ms. Gwon Se-na not here today?

409
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,757
She doesn't have
any scenes to shoot today.

410
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,674
All right.

411
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,893
GWON SE-NA

412
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,610
<i>The person you are trying to reach…</i>

413
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,204
<i>I'm actually a fan</i>
<i>of Lim Hyeon-jun myself.</i>

414
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,665
<i>I love Kang Pil-gu.</i>

415
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,291
<i>Wow, I'm so glad we met!</i>

416
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,379
MELOMASTER

417
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,302
THE USER HAS DELETED THEIR ACCOUNT.

418
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,224
- Everything's set up, right?
- Yes, it is.

419
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,478
What's wrong?

420
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,396
Let's go.

421
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,189
Why? What is it, Director?

422
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,108
- Excuse me, Director.
- What's going on?

423
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,296
Ms. Wi.

424
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,589
- I have something to say--
- Mr. Lim!

425
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,757
The director wants you.

426
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,676
Okay.

427
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,303
- Huh?
- What?

428
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:37,555
- I just--
- Mr. Lim!

429
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,016
He wants you to see you now.

430
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,060
Let's talk later.

431
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,620
All right.

432
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,499
I'll be doing my own scenes today

433
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,043
without a stunt double.

434
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:07,960
What?

435
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,298
All right. Let's get started!

436
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,217
Mi-yeong!

437
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,181
Where's Mi-yeong?

438
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,975
What's the point of asking
when you're about to die?

439
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,519
They say you can't fix people.

440
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:27,813
But…

441
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,691
I do.

442
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,693
What are you waiting for?

443
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:33,694
Kill him!

444
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,202
Get him, boys!

445
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:47,666
Excuse me.

446
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,590
Damn it!

447
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,133
Get him, you bastards!

448
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:20,950
Mi-yeong!

449
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,745
Mi-yeong!

450
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,330
Mi-yeong!

451
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,136
Are you okay?

452
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,182
Are you hurt?

453
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,353
It's okay.

454
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,400
What do you think you're doing?

455
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,152
Answer me!

456
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,696
What do you think you two are doing?

457
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,406
Hey!

458
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,616
No.

459
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,163
You bastard!

460
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,457
No.

461
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,377
- There's a mouse!
- What the hell?

462
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,629
- There's a mouse!
- Cut.

463
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,049
It's okay.

464
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,801
It's just a mouse.

465
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,388
Let's go again. That's fine.

466
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,182
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

467
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,350
- I thought she meant leg cramp.
- Let's roll again.

468
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,393
Action!

469
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,603
What do you think you're doing?

470
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,732
Damn, the prop broke.

471
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,358
- What?
- This thing here.

472
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,485
- Cut.
- Cut.

473
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,778
Props team, switch it out.

474
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,823
Oh, it broke. That's fine.

475
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,575
- Action!
- What do you think you're doing?

476
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,244
- Hold on!
- What is it?

477
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,370
That really hurt.

478
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,288
Action!

479
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,296
- What the hell?
- Man, what was that?

480
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,760
Who left this lying around?

481
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,054
<i>Let's take a ten-minute break.</i>

482
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,266
Did I get too worked up?

483
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,852
Totally.

484
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,189
You were yelling at the top of your lungs.

485
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,899
"Who left this?"

486
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,317
Was I really that awful?

487
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,945
Totally.

488
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,281
Why did you insist on doing it
when you had a stunt double?

489
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,076
Are you that eager to impress Ms. Wi?

490
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,912
It's not like that.

491
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,247
Yeah, right.

492
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,791
Do you want to date Ms. Wi or something?

493
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,210
I said it's not like that.

494
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:40,214
I just don't want her
writing up another bad article.

495
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,468
I get how you developed feelings
through Onion or Green Onion or whatever,

496
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:48,097
but don't confuse
imaginary dating with the real thing.

497
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,598
Who said I was?

498
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,017
Besides, I deleted Onion.

499
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:52,977
So what if you deleted it?

500
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,020
Does that make Ms. Wi go away?

501
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,649
Be careful

502
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,401
unless you want
another dating rumor going around.

503
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,404
A dating rumor?

504
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,206
Please talk Mr. Lim out of it.

505
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,293
This cut will only show his back,
so we can use his double.

506
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,420
But he insists on doing it himself.

507
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,922
It's because Ms. Wi is here.

508
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:25,593
She's a Kang Pil-gu fan,
so of course, he wants to do it himself.

509
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,177
- Okay, fine.
- Byeong-gi!

510
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,807
What is it?

511
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:35,978
Come with me.

512
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,777
Damn it.

513
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,623
I just twisted it a little
during practice.

514
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,501
I told them I can't do any stunts today
because I hurt my ankle.

515
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,502
I really did.

516
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,673
- Pil-gu's stunt double, we need you now.
- I'll be right there.

517
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,591
Quickly, please!

518
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,884
Honey, they need me. Bye.

519
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,526
<i>All right.</i>

520
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,446
I'll be doing my own scenes today

521
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,490
without a stunt double.

522
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,379
<i>Ready.</i>

523
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,463
Action!

524
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,674
What do you think you're doing,
you bastard?

525
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:48,717
Damn you!

526
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:01,605
- Mr. Lim! Call an ambulance now!
- Okay.

527
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,483
Oh, damn it.

528
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,985
- Hurry and call an ambulance.
- I'm on it.

529
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,487
I heard something crack in his ankle.

530
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,617
Be careful.

531
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,578
Mr. Lim, please take care.

532
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,498
- Get home safely!
- Take care!

533
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,375
Don't worry about a thing.

534
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,252
- Make sure you go to the hospital!
- Don't worry.

535
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,879
Ms. Wi, you're still here?

536
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,632
Is your ankle okay?

537
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,051
It looked like you hurt your shoulder too.

538
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,721
Oh, I'm fine.

539
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,306
I just sprained it a bit. It's fine.

540
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,391
My shoulder's fine too.

541
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,935
Wait, why can't I lift it?

542
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,229
Just kidding.

543
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,899
You went through a lot today.
I hope you get it treated properly.

544
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,527
Come here for a second.

545
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,445
Come here.

546
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,406
Make sure to release the exclusive today,

547
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,032
about how I injured myself doing a stunt.

548
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,493
You're concerned about my article
at a time like this?

549
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:59,329
You came all this way,
so you should leave with an exclusive.

550
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,206
Word will spread
once I get to the hospital,

551
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,375
so write it up here
and release it immediately, okay?

552
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,127
How about a high-five?

553
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,009
Excuse us, Ms. Wi.
We need to get to the hospital.

554
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,552
I'm very sorry.

555
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,513
Let's get going.

556
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,081
Were you injured badly?

557
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,959
No, not at all. I don't really need this.

558
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,503
I'm just keeping it on for the day.

559
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:51,048
Didn't you say you'd confess your feelings
to Ms. Wi after today's shoot?

560
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,302
Confess my feelings?
Come on, we're not kids.

561
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,556
I wanted to get friendly
at the dinner gathering,

562
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,184
but who knew
I'd get injured like this today?

563
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,560
You should know,

564
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:07,981
Ms. Wi was very worried for me
when I hurt my ankle.

565
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,609
So today wasn't a total loss.

566
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,860
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

567
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,279
You've never dated anyone, have you?

568
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:15,864
What do you mean?

569
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,659
Or maybe it's been so long
since you last dated

570
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,369
that you've forgotten how it goes?

571
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,792
Why do you have to talk
in such a rude way?

572
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,086
Now that I think about it,
you and Ms. Wi are exactly the same.

573
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,255
No wonder you two get along.

574
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,631
Maybe that's why we're both competent.

575
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,010
If you're so competent,
why not manage your dating life yourself?

576
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,805
Why bother teaming up with me?

577
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,725
This would be over if things went well
between you and Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong.

578
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,187
You obviously can't do it on your own,
which is why you roped me into this.

579
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,356
It's always harder

580
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,527
to glue a broken relationship
back together.

581
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,738
Are you saying
that I have to put in the hard work,

582
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,824
while you reap the benefits?

583
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,410
I really wish that were the case,

584
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,621
but if I leave this up to you,
we'll both end up with nothing.

585
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,415
So I put together a simple plan.

586
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:11,879
It'd cause major problems in my life
if you can't win over Ms. Wi,

587
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,089
so do it right this time.

588
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,218
What's your plan?

589
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,514
I already wrote an exclusive
on Lim Hyeon-jun getting injured on set.

590
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,558
What more follow-up coverage do I need?

591
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,977
I'm not his personal paparazzi.

592
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,646
You said you were a fan of Kang Pil-gu.
Isn't this good for you?

593
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,399
I said I was Kang Pil-gu's fan,
not Lim Hyeon-jun's!

594
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:36,653
Please don't tell me
you told Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun about this.

595
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,322
I didn't.

596
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,949
Anyway, I keep my personal life
and work life separate.

597
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,242
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

598
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,036
Then why did you
file a motion for recusal?

599
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,079
- That was--
<i>- I'm serving an exclusive</i>

600
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,790
on a silver platter for you.
Shouldn't you thank me instead of arguing?

601
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,500
Want me to tie you
to the entertainment desk?

602
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,295
If I'm getting tied down,
I'll bring my own rope!

603
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,089
<i>Fine, then.</i>
<i>Come back to the office for now.</i>

604
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,718
Jeez, her and her threats.

605
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:03,680
I need you to adjust my schedule.

606
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,515
I'm doing my best to cooperate with you.

607
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,517
What do you mean, "cooperate"?
I'm exhausted.

608
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,562
- We're trying our best to enjoy shooting.
- Look…

609
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,689
How would I enjoy shooting
when my schedule's a mess?

610
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,026
- I'm trying my best to cooperate…
- Cooperate with who?

611
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,286
Stop that.

612
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,591
I can't believe he deleted his account.

613
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,054
Without telling me, too.

614
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,276
Hello?

615
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,196
Is this Onion's customer service center?

616
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,450
Can I get the phone number
of a user who deleted their account?

617
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,537
Right, I'm sorry for bothering you.

618
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,666
But why can't you tell me?

619
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,045
I got scammed on Onion!

620
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,506
The rice cooker…

621
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,052
I bought this rice cooker,
and the person who sold it…

622
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,388
But my rice cooker…

623
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,848
My rice cooker…

624
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:31,268
How could he do this to me?

625
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,733
How could he?

626
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,404
My rice cooker…

627
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,576
My rice cooker…

628
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,830
How could he do this?

629
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,107
Got you. Got you.

630
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,368
This is to make up
for the dinner I had with Mr. Lee.

631
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,380
Don't people usually give two tickets?

632
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,757
Do you have someone to go with?

633
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,218
No.

634
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,472
It's a VIP ticket sent to me in my name,
so there's only one.

635
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,808
Make sure you don't give it away
and go yourself.

636
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:55,852
I will.

637
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,354
I'm going to check if you actually went.

638
00:39:59,064 --> 00:39:59,940
Chief.

639
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,485
When you and Mr. Lee were together,

640
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,863
did you know about his family?

641
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,324
No matter how awful Lee Dae-ho may be,

642
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,202
it has nothing to do with Lee Jae-hyeong.

643
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,246
How can you be so sure?

644
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,497
I'm a reporter too.

645
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,750
I can easily find out that much.

646
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,210
Hey.

647
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,754
What brings you here, Ms. Wi?

648
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,340
That's my seat.

649
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,925
This one right next to me?

650
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:11,803
No way.

651
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,055
What in the world?

652
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,391
I mean,

653
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,310
what a coincidence.

654
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:22,564
Man, who would've thought, right?

655
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,025
I know.

656
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,776
My gosh.

657
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,653
How's your ankle?

658
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,865
Oh, it's totally fine.

659
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:35,243
I work out and stay in solid shape,

660
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,287
so I recover quickly from injuries.

661
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,246
Ms. Wi?

662
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,374
- So it is you.
- Mr. Lee.

663
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:42,792
Your seat is next to mine.

664
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,213
Let's sit down.

665
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,592
I'll take this as an apology
for not showing up to dinner that night.

666
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,385
I won't take no for an answer.

667
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:54,429
Okay.

668
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,139
Who's this?

669
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,392
Hello, I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

670
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,145
Mother, Ms. Wi is a very capable employee

671
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:03,438
who's very good at her job.

672
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:08,485
My mother has a cameo in this movie,
so I came to watch it with her.

673
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,527
I see.

674
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,528
Goodness.

675
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,864
Not only are you beautiful,
you're also good at your job.

676
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,533
Please take good care of my son.

677
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,827
And me too.

678
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,540
Ms. Oh, I'm here too.

679
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,126
Gosh, you're here too?

680
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,753
- When did you get here?
- Hello.

681
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,422
- Good to see you again.
- Likewise.

682
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,385
We have such an unusual connection.

683
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,389
<i>- You're done already?</i>
<i>- It was just club time, so I bailed.</i>

684
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,515
<i>No one will look for me anyway.</i>

685
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:42,102
<i>- Anyway, what's up?</i>
<i>- Tomorrow's your birthday.</i>

686
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,186
<i>We should get your ears pierced.</i>

687
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,563
<i>Why would I get my ears pierced</i>
<i>on my birthday?</i>

688
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,608
<i>What if your ears</i>
<i>actually fall off on your birthday?</i>

689
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,318
<i>What?</i>

690
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,947
<i>- You see, that's why…</i>
- What did you talk about?

691
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,367
It was about the movie.

692
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,995
Then why did you laugh?

693
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,162
Because it was funny.

694
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,039
Ms. Wi.

695
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,376
The three of us should have dinner
when you have the time.

696
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,888
<i>I'm here!</i>

697
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,056
<i>Hey, you're here.</i>

698
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,100
<i>- My friend's sleeping over.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

699
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,184
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

700
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,519
<i>Hello.</i>

701
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,732
<i>It's a VIP ticket sent to me in my name,</i>

702
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,942
<i>so there's only one.</i>

703
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,986
<i>Make sure you don't give it away</i>

704
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,654
<i>and go yourself.</i>

705
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,830
<i>The teacher complimented you,</i>
<i>saying you were funny.</i>

706
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,916
<i>That's unexpected.</i>
<i>He usually badmouths me.</i>

707
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:48,918
<i>Hey.</i>

708
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,505
<i>You can't drink after piercing your ears.</i>
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

709
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,049
<i>Why not?</i>

710
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,342
HWANG JI-SUN

711
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,094
- Oh, boy.
<i>- How much did you have to drink?</i>

712
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,638
<i>I didn't drink that much.</i>
<i>I'm totally fine.</i>

713
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,525
<i>I'm already getting flushed.</i>

714
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,615
What's going on?

715
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,117
I have something important to tell you.

716
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,118
I'll see you at home.

717
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,953
If it's important,
why are we meeting at home

718
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,872
instead of at the office?

719
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,207
Because it's important.

720
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,792
No, I can't.

721
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,710
I told you
I had to attend a movie premiere.

722
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,296
<i>It's almost over. I know you're not busy.</i>

723
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,925
I have a private life too, you know!

724
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,843
Whatever. Meet me at home.

725
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,641
What did he say? Is he coming?

726
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,060
He'll come. It's his home, after all.

727
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,438
Mr. Hwang.

728
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,858
I'm counting on you, okay?

729
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:54,818
All right.

730
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,323
What's the matter with him?

731
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,960
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

732
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,632
<i>Do you like him</i>
<i>enough to quit school and leave?</i>

733
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,969
She had something urgent come up and left.

734
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,095
I see.

735
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,431
<i>Still, you can't just leave like this.</i>

736
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,142
<i>You won't even explain anything to me.</i>

737
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:31,563
Thank you.

738
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:35,984
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,570
I couldn't answer
because I had a meeting that day.

740
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:40,405
It's okay.

741
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,740
You said you have something to tell me?

742
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:46,244
- You asked about Ha Gee-wan before.
- Yes.

743
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,205
I don't know the exact details,
but I know for a fact

744
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,126
that Ha Gee-wan and Lee Dae-ho
both love money.

745
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,341
That means the two are involved
in a suspicious financial deal.

746
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,010
Yes.

747
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,678
A big one, that is.

748
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,930
Why do you think my company
and Lim Hyeon-jun's company

749
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:07,640
decided to merge?

750
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,310
Are you saying
there was an ulterior motive to that?

751
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,619
I met with Wi Jeong-sin.

752
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,162
I told her what you wanted me to…

753
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,623
as if I was dropping a hint.

754
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,391
<i>Mr. Lim, here's a link</i>
<i>to Ms. Wi's article.</i>

REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN
SPORTS EUNSEONG

757
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,447
Where did she disappear to anyway?

758
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,784
Let go of me!

759
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,786
I don't care if it takes hours!

760
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,913
I'll stay like this until he forgives me!

761
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,045
What in the world is going on?

762
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,422
Mom?

763
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:24,842
- Seon-u.
- Yeah?

764
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,261
Why is Mr. Hwang kneeling?

765
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,684
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

766
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,813
What were you guys doing in my house
when I wasn't even home?

767
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:37,897
Bro,

768
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,316
I did something completely unforgivable.

769
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:41,943
- Oh, gosh.
- Mr. Lim.

770
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,946
Please relax and hear me out, okay?

771
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,325
How am I supposed to relax
when I don't know what's going on?

772
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,077
Will you guys say something?

773
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,204
This silence isn't helping anyone!

774
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,834
- Hyeon-jun.
- Yeah?

775
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,796
I got a role in <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>.

776
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,058
I don't care what you say. I'm doing it.

777
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:15,560
The director said it was fine.

778
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,978
Why…

779
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,356
Why is everyone doing this to me?

780
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,400
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

781
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,695
The whole world knows that Seong Ae-suk

782
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:29,407
is Lim Hyeon-jun's mother!

783
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,284
Now they're acting in the same drama?

784
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:32,827
Mom.

785
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,413
Seon-u's playing my younger self.

786
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,041
This isn't some family drama.
We'll be the laughingstock!

787
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,167
How does this make sense?

788
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,084
Well…

789
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,671
She won't be playing
your biological mother.

790
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,089
It's just a cameo…

791
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:48,051
And Ms. Seong's hasn't made
any public appearances lately,

792
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,927
so I'm sure
people won't even recognize her.

793
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,471
Right?

794
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,264
I look the same as I did back then,

795
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,183
so I'm sure they'll recognize me.

796
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,809
Mom.

797
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,314
Please let her do it, Mr. Lim.

798
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,317
I'm positive Ms. Seong will be
the scene-stealer of that episode.

799
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,569
- A scene-stealer?
- Yes.

800
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,780
Are you trying to use my family?

801
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,490
No, of course not.

802
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,454
Hyeon-jun took it better
than we thought, right?

803
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:18,581
Yes.

804
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:22,418
Getting on my knees and going full method

805
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,879
was a stroke of genius.

806
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,757
Oh, how are your knees?
You were really into it earlier.

807
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,217
They're fine. I'm used to kneeling.

808
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,387
Mr. Hwang.

809
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,138
I really appreciate you.

810
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,141
Oh, how about some green onion kimchi?

811
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,226
No!

812
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:43,272
From now on,
I refuse to eat onions, green onions,

813
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:44,941
or any other food that includes "onion."

814
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,317
Try some of this.

815
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:47,610
Get that onion out of the way.

816
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,280
Wait, there's onion in this.
I'm not eating it.

817
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,908
By the way, is Hyeon-jun not going to eat?

818
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,077
He says he's on a diet.

819
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:57,912
I get it.

820
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,789
Mom and I are
causing him trouble in turns,

821
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,041
so of course, he's not hungry.

822
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:07,839
Why did you have to get into acting
and make a mess of things?

823
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,549
Seriously.

824
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,386
Damn it.

825
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,557
Why would Pil-gu do something like this?

826
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,891
Seriously, it's Pil-gu.

827
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,018
It's absurd!

828
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,361
There's no way the viewers will like this!

829
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,742
Oh, boy.

830
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,702
Not this again, damn it.

831
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,799
SPORTS EUNSEONG

832
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,225
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

833
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,519
Hello, everyone.

834
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,400
Ms. Wi didn't come to work today.

835
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:16,157
Is something going on?
I haven't seen her in a while.

836
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,284
I might tell you
if you have lunch with me.

837
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,038
Lunchtime is still a long way off.

838
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:23,706
Brunch, then?

839
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,760
So, why didn't Ms. Wi come to work today?

840
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,679
- Did something happen?
- What's the rush?

841
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,101
Please eat.

842
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,286
Well?

843
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:07,041
You finished your meal,
had dessert, and even had tea.

844
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,334
When will you tell me?

845
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,629
I assigned Ms. Wi
to cover Lim Hyeon-jun exclusively.

846
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,548
She's been busy following him around.

847
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,590
Covering Lim Hyeon-jun exclusively?

848
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:17,260
You dragged this out just to tell me that?

849
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:20,513
Weren't you acting like
you were dragged here against your will?

850
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:23,057
I purposely took my time eating

851
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,892
because I wanted to spend time with you.

852
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,112
I've been curious for a while.

853
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,905
What's with you?

854
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:43,786
Now that I'm a mom,
there's nothing I'm afraid of.

855
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,788
Is that why you're being
so shameless with me?

856
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,999
Yes. I'm shameless now.

857
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,714
Why did you do that then?

858
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,383
Shall we get going?

859
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,343
I have a lunch appointment.

860
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,303
What?

861
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,846
You just ate.

862
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,306
I can eat again.

863
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,364
Weren't you acting like
you were dragged here against your will?

864
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,491
<i>I purposely took my time eating</i>

865
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:23,784
<i>because I wanted to spend time with you.</i>

866
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,670
- What?
- You have a lunch appointment too?

867
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:35,880
What the heck?

868
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,564
I already ate.

869
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,441
Just order something light.

870
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,568
I haven't eaten yet.

871
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,865
Fine, order whatever you want.

872
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:04,617
By the way,

873
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,371
why do you keep bringing me along
whenever you meet with agencies?

874
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,497
Are you complaining?

875
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,748
Not at all.

876
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,125
You seem to like me more than I thought,

877
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:14,251
so it feels a bit much.

878
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,006
I'll return to the political desk

879
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,467
at some point.

880
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,887
There was a time
when I thought the same about myself.

881
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,306
But life is unpredictable.

882
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,352
Are you cursing me?

883
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,106
<i>There's a lot of talk about the merger.</i>

884
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,901
People are grumbling about me
building a massive entertainment company,

885
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,403
but I don't pay attention to that.

886
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,614
That's their way of dealing with
not getting what they wanted.

887
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,409
I heard there are many who envy you.

888
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:48,577
Is that so?

889
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:56,335
You had an acting career
before your success as Kang Pil-gu, right?

890
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,839
Yes, I acted a bit.

891
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,048
But well,

892
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,510
I had to give it up quicky
because of some circumstances.

893
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:08,222
Would it be rude to ask
what those circumstances were?

894
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,933
No, but it wasn't anything special.

895
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,938
I wasn't getting any offers
and needed to make a living, so I quit.

896
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:24,321
<i>I'm in front of the restaurant.</i>
<i>I need to see you.</i>

897
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,495
I'm sorry to have you wait,

898
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:33,539
but could you excuse me for a moment?

899
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,041
- Of course.
- Go on and eat.

900
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,466
Let's eat.

901
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,675
Yes, thank you.

902
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,923
You must be all fired up,
coming all the way here.

903
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,049
I did what you told me to.

904
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,383
What are you planning to do?

905
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,887
Why? Does it bother you
that I'm getting close to Lim Hyeon-jun?

906
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,472
I can deal with that.

907
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,682
It's not that it bothers me.

908
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:34,725
It scares me.

909
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,105
Se-na, don't be like this.

910
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:40,481
Okay?

911
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,274
The more anxious you get,

912
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,112
the more I want to make things harder
for Lim Hyeon-jun.

913
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,241
Are you going to

914
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,201
kill him too?

915
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,830
The chairman seems very interested in me.

916
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:59,208
He probably wants to get closer
now that you're an actor in his company.

917
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,168
It's a little old-fashioned,

918
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:03,337
but some believe
you need to share personal details

919
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,839
to get to know each other better.

920
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,511
Well, I'd like to
get to know you better, Mr. Lee.

921
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,097
Could I ask a personal question?

922
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,849
Yes, go ahead.

923
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,812
Are you seeing anyone right now?

924
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,651
Well, I do have feelings for someone.

925
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:28,904
You have…

926
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,950
You have a crush on someone.

927
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,786
A crush?

928
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,329
You know,

929
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,667
having a long-term crush
can't be healthy for either side.

930
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,170
You lack for nothing
and have so much going for you.

931
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:47,506
Why have a crush on someone?

932
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,011
I'm lacking in many ways,

933
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:55,014
especially when it comes to
winning over the person I like.

934
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,309
I'll keep trying, though.

935
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,895
Even if I get struck out.

936
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,205
Ms. Wi!

937
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,124
Hello.

938
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,169
Hello.

939
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,962
What brings you here?

940
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:31,008
Oh, I had some business to handle.

941
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,264
If you're done eating,
would you like to have tea with me?

942
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:42,061
Shall we?

943
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,900
I'll join.

944
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,738
Me too.

945
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,532
I'll join too.

946
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,340
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

947
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,678
You know the date's been set for
our production press conference, right?

948
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,888
Wait, are you going?

949
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:01,890
<i>Every entertainment reporter</i>
<i>will be there!</i>

950
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:04,435
<i>How did I get caught up in this mess?</i>

951
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,354
<i>Bro, she's here. Ms. Wi is here!</i>

952
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,189
<i>What am I supposed to do now?</i>

953
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,443
<i>Mr. Lim, I can't keep hiding like this.</i>

954
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:13,610
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

955
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,279
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun, do you like me?

956
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,157
<i>I don't know. What is it that women want?</i>

957
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,329
<i>You heartless one</i>

958
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,543
