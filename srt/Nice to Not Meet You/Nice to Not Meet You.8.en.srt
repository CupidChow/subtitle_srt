[K-pop music playing]

2
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:51,634
I wanted you to join me

3
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,137
so I could get to know you better,
not to discuss business.

4
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,555
[laughs]

5
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,226
Anytime you'd like me to come join you,
you can count on me to be there.

6
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,271
Hold on, why the heck
aren't you married yet?

7
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,940
Don't tell me
that's not a polite question these days.

8
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,276
- You got that right.
- [chuckling]

9
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:12,071
But life would be too boring if we
could never ask impolite questions. Hmm?

10
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,615
[laughs]

11
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:14,908
I agree, mm-hmm.

12
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,244
I'm not in the right place to be
seeing anyone at this point, I think.

13
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,454
[Dae-ho] All right, all right.

14
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:23,082
I have to say, I don't think
you guys look that much alike.

15
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,168
You don't?

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,753
[chuckles]
Well, we have different mothers.

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,338
That might just explain it.

18
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,341
I have a stepmother
who's an actress, you know.

19
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,511
That's the reason I can't compete with
my little brother when it comes to looks.

00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,887
[Dae-ho, Jae-Hyeong chuckle]

21

[chuckling]

23
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,811
Yeah, that's what it is, TMI. [laughing]

24
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,065
You know there's a saying,
it goes something like,

25
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,818
"Beginners make simple things
very complicated,

26
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,489
pros, however, make complicated things
very simple."

27
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,949
- Hmm.
- [Dae-ho] Here it comes. Whoa.

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,992
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- There you go.

29
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,036
Nice, whoa!

30

- Wow!
- Yeah!

31
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,917
Wow! You caught a big one right there!

32
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,460
[Dae-ho] Wow, this is a real catch, huh?

33
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,045
Look, dang.

34
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,922
Have a good one out there.

35
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,799
But wait, why did you throw it back?

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,218
Well. [chuckles]

37
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,470
Your company.
Would you like to expand it, or what?

38
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,222
- Huh?
- Of course, yeah. We would love to,

39
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,851
then we could get into production,
you know?

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,144
Let's do it then.

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,398
You two look after the artistic part,

42
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,191
and I'll take care of business.

43
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,235
Say goodbye to the small acting agency,

44
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,945
let's build
a full-fledged entertainment company.

45
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,322
- I don't know.
- [Ji-sun chuckles]

46
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,784
That sounds hard to pull off,
it's a little crazy.

47
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,995
Just shut up, okay? [laughs]

48
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,371
[Dae-ho] It is, yeah.

49
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,957
But for pros, remember,
nothing's difficult.

[Jae-hyeong chuckles]

00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,586
Are you trying to bluff
or are you serious?

52

Can't you tell?

That was a nice catch, huh!

57
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,599
It was hilarious.

60

[colleague] Hey, you.
Heard he dropped the lawsuit.

61
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,730
That company's clever, huh?

62
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,732
They were keeping
the actor's image in mind.

63
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,360
Anyway, congratulations.
Couldn't have ended better, for you.

64
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,987
Actually, for me,

65
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,238
it's not really over yet.

66
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,782
Why are you so set
on taking Yoon Jung-ho down?

67
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,660
He dropped the lawsuit, it's over.
What's with the follow-up article?

68
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,746
That guy is...

69
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,248
an old pervert.

70
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,334
- Can you prove it?
- I won't speak to that.

71
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,794
- Why not?
- To protect my sources.

72
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,421
You think I'm gonna
hurt them or something?

73
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,089
You're totally capable of it.

74
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,175
Seriously?

75
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,760
- You're not gonna tell me?
- No, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,679
[scoffs] Well, if you can't tell me,
then just get out.

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,932
Okay.

78
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,436
You didn't need me
to do business with them.

79
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,313
Your handsome face will always sell.

80
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,068
And of course I'd like you to
take a little more interest in what I do.

81
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,320
It's too much to handle for one guy alone.

82
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,031
[both chuckle]

83
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,160
So I guess you wanna take over
Lim Hyeon-jun's company?

84
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,245
Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,246
That's the plan.

86
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,749
Word is that you've bought
a lot of businesses recently.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,043
You must be swimming in money.

88
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,754

00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,469
Things are really looking up for us, huh?

91
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,553
[scoffs]

92
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,765
I don't trust that guy.
Things are never that easy.

93
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,434
Didn't you hear what he said
about pros and all that?

94
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,145
How they make what's complicated easy!
Isn't that great?

95
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,107
Why are you worried?
He's a major player in the industry now!

96
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,984
Hey, it sounds too good to be true.

97
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,903
- You think we need a bigger office now--
- Hey!

98
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,113
Hey, what? [chuckles]

99
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,074
- [phone buzzes]
- Oh, wait. Hold on, hold on.

100
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,951
Something is fishy about this thing.

101
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,997
Oh, yes, hello! Oh, actually, I'm...
I'm out of the office right now.

102
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,123
Who's on the phone?

103
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,584
Oh, okay.
We're on the way back to the office.

104
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,087
- Who was that?
- It was Ms. Wi.

105
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,464
She said she wants
to meet at the office now.

106
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,550
- She sounded super pissed.
- [sighs]

107
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,759
I'm gonna handle it.

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,011
You? Why?

109
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,595
- What are you gonna do this time?
- Relax.

110
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,348
I don't like it. We have to be nice.

111
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,895

00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,243
Why are you here?

114
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,122
I know you came here angry and fired up

115
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,667
with whatever rage you've
built over us signing Mr. Yoon Jung-ho.

116
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,752
[sighs]

117
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,796
Talking to anyone else won't help,
because they don't know.

118
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,298
I did it, okay? This was my doing.

119
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,135
And I came here
so you could let me have it.

120
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,261
Go on, let it out.

121
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,764

122
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,348
What the hell did you do?

123
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,437
Did you sign him just to absolve yourself
from taking part in the paparazzi stunt?

124
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,899
Are you trying to help a bad guy thrive
even more, or what?

125
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,945
Do I look like that kinda person?

126
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:07,366
Or I'm some kind of psychopath,
and helps the bad guys win?

127
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,577
So why did you do it?

128
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,789
Think you're smart?
Why would I tell you that?

129
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,626
Anyway, just know this one thing.

130
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,046
I chose to safely bury the man myself.

131
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,590
What do you mean "bury"?

132
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,509
He's neutralized.

133
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,303
He'll stay locked up in a hole

00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,225
- and then we'll have a chat about it.
- Oh, sure.

343
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,437
- You can call me anytime.
- [Byeong-gi] Great.

344
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,110
- [Se-na] Thank you.
- [Byeong-gi] Of course.

345
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,451
I guess we'll just have to hang out.
I'm sure they'll tell us soon.

346
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,244
- This family is really kind.
- Totally.

347
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,499
Not long ago people would've hated
reporters covering a funeral.

348
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,043
Obviously times have changed.

349
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,004
Gotta say, the new season looks amazing.

350
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,382
- Oh, I hope so.
- It's gonna do great.

351
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,512
- Oh, please go ahead.
- Oh, let's go.

352
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,764
[sighs] I'm pretty hungry.

353
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,980
Thanks to you,
the lobby has been well-organized,

354
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,857
and the reporters
have a comfortable space to work.

355
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,234
Yeah.

356
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,904
- Thank you for all your advice.
- Oh, sure, of course.

357
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,409
[sighs]

358
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,791
Listen, I was thinking...

359
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,753
um, I noticed the reporters were basically
writing their articles on the floor.

360
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,255
Which is probably not ideal.

361
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:56,301
And so, I thought, what if we could
put out chairs and some tables to sit at?

362
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,472
<i>And maybe also
give them some drinks as well.</i>

363
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,157
[reporter 1] What was that energy
between Gwon Se-na and Lim Hyeon-jun?

364
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,326
- I definitely picked up something there.
- [chuckles]

365
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,411
They're on the same show now,

366
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,204
so I wouldn't be surprised
if something happened.

367
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,456
[reporter 2] Lim Hyeon-jun could do
so much better, though.

368
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,793
- [reporter 1] What?
- [reporter 2] What?

369
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,629
[somber music plays]

370
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,145

You can't put that down in my chart.

[sighs] I think you might already
be aware of this.

386

There's all this ambivalence
and it isn't good for any of you.

387
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,507
Unless you truly desire to remain stuck,

388
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,718
why don't you instead try to choose a path
and follow it all the way?

389
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,888
Maybe you've already decided

so why don't we put him in something
more luxurious, huh? More upscale.

409

Well, that might feel a little abrupt,

410
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,732

Of course, I do.

- So...

shorter for a more energetic look?

- Oh...

Oh, you're right. I like that.

439
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,957
I think we should give it a shot.

440
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,876
Yeah, it's gonna look great.

441
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,919
I'm gonna go talk to my team

509
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:41,702
Hey.

510
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,080
Have you been going to auditions?

511
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,874
Yeah, I have. I went to one today too.

512
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:48,709
What are you doin' up?

513
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,378
I can't sleep.

514
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,507
You've got this dude you've been
flirting with, just text him.

515
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,176
[chokes, coughs]

516
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,889
I did not flirt with anyone, okay?

517
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,390
Are you serious?

518
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,433
I know you're texting him.
You've been glued to your phone.

519
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,645
Even now you're holding on to it
for dear life.

520
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,066
Hey, it's not what you think! [coughs]

521
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,983
I call bullshit.

522
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,028
I saw you staying up all night
the other day.

523
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,530
And what about the food pictures
you were taking for him?

524
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,615
You think I didn't notice?

525
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,119
I wish you could've seen how stupid
you looked doing that.

526
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,495
- What do you mean?
- [chuckling]

527
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:30,291
[shutter clicks]

528
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,669
You don't wanna eat it?

529
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,545
[Jeong-sin giggles]

530
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,005

531
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,591
[chuckling]

532
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,302
That was your expression, seriously.

533
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,430
Like a total nutjob.
Never seen that before.

534
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,808
- What? Nutjob?
- Absolutely.

535
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,228
This time it feels a bit different.
I have a good feeling about this.

536
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,397
Good luck with it.

537
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,567
Stop saying that.
There's nothing going on.

538
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,986
You do like him though.
And don't even act like you don't.

539
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,990
I don't, now stop talking about it!
I don't like the guy.

540
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,326
Why would I even like him?
Ugh, you're stupid. Seriously.

541
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:05,994
Nope.

542
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,829
What I witnessed was romance.

543
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,916
No doubt about it.
A look of romance, as pure as it gets.

544
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,670
[Hong-sin sighs]

<i>It's my little brother and I, yeah.</i>

546
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,056
<i>My parents passed away when I was young.</i>

547
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:30,226
<i>It's a tough world, so I had to teach
myself to become more assertive</i>

548
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,978
<i>and to rely on logic over emotion.</i>

549
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,396
[scoffs]

550
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,857
TMI, I think.

00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,127
<i>Hello?</i>

554
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,006
- I'm not married.
- [Hyeon-jun laughs] <i>Ah, right.</i>

555
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,510
[Hong-sin] <i>You do like him though.
Don't even act like you don't.</i>

556
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,725
I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK
AND SAW THESE GORGEOUS FLOWERS!

557
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,353
<i>What I witnessed was romance.
No doubt about it.</i>

558
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,481
<i>A look of romance, as pure as it gets.</i>

559
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,651
[Hyeon-jun] <i>It rained a lot today.</i>

560
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,612
<i>You didn't get caught up in the rain,
did you?</i>

561
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,322
[Hong-sin]
<i>This time it feels a bit different.</i>

562
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,866
<i>I have a good feeling about this.</i>

563
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,118
<i>Good luck with it.</i>

564
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,757
[sighs]

565
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:43,759
- Mr. Lee?
- [gasps]

566
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,470
- Oh, Ms. Wi.
- What are you doing here?

567
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,518
Any chance I could steal you for a second?

568
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,603
You...

569
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,981
Oh, of course. Yeah, I'm free.

570
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,484
Open it.

571
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,698
INVITATION

572
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,533
I don't know what this is.

573
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,120
That is a dinner reservation
for later tonight.

574
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,747
[inhales sharply]

575
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,500
You can meet me there.

576
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,753
I've tried to move things along
one step at a time, but I guess...

577
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,547
that's not working.

578
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,718
So today, I chose a bit more...

579
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,262
more of a forward approach.

580
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,181
I... [sighs]

581
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,182
What do you mean by that?

582
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,144
I'm pretty sure you've figured it out.

583
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,646
You're a smart woman.

584
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,402
I'll see you there. [chuckles]

585
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,237
Wait a minute.

586
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,574
I didn't agree to meet you.

587
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,367
[sighs]

00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,119
[inhales sharply]

589
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,788
Is there a reason why you wouldn't?

590
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,375
Is there someone else you're, uh,

591
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:00,794
interested in?

592
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,886
All right, I'm off! Good luck, guys.

593
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,387
- Yeah, let's go. Take it easy!
- I'm gonna head out.

594
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,555
- Later, guys.
- All right.

595
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,433
- Just leave us here. No worries.
- Take it easy, guys.

596
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,934
Come on, let's go.

Surprised?

[sighs]

606
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,998
Good to see you, sir. It's been a while.

607
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,543
Yeah, you're right. It's been a while.

608
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:24,878
Sit down.

00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,009
[phone buzzes]

610
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,894
[Jeong-sin] <i>Mr. Lee, I'm sorry,
but I won't be able to make it tonight.</i>

611
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,073
[Jae-hyeong] Open it.

612
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,828
That is a dinner reservation
for later tonight.

613
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,997
You can meet me there.

616
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,474
How the hell did you know
that I'd be here?

617
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,934
I guess the person you invited told me.

618
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,227
[scoffs] Look at your face,

619
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,730
like, "why won't this woman leave me alone
so I can go home already?"

620
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,523
I've gotta be home as well.

621
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,609
Why?

622
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,612
You got a man waiting at home for you?
Is that it?

623
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,698
Mm-hmm. My son is waiting.

624
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,411
I've had an amazing dinner.
Thanks for that.

625
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,538
I've gotta go now.

626
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,167
You really just came here for dinner?

627
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,338
I came here for dinner

628
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,714
- and to spend some time with you.
- [sighs]

629
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,007
But this is good enough for today.

630
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,052
You shouldn't fill up on the appetizer.

631
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,392
[sighs]

632
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,948
[Jae-hyeong] <i>Is there someone else
you're interested in?</i>

633
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,701
[Jeong-sin] <i>Because accepting it
would only make me expect more.</i>

634
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,162
<i>Like that person will treat me better.</i>

635
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,873
<i>Be kinder or more sincere.</i>

636
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,793
<i>There's no chance
things will work out with us.</i>

637
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,421
Better to quash any hope right now.

638
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,718
[Hong-sin] <i>You do like him though.
Don't even act like you don't.</i>

in your heart.</i>

[phone buzzes]

646
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,405
SOULISHERE SENT YOU A MESSAGE.

647
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,951
[Jeong-sin]
<i>You made a good first impression on me,</i>

648
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,914
<i>because you gave me a 30,000-won
discount on the rice cooker.</i>

649
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,959
<i>Then you told me
you were a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun,</i>

650
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,920
<i>which made me like you,</i>

651
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,757
<i>because we have something in common
that's important to me.</i>

652
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,552
<i>I have trust issues and I can be
socially awkward and cynical,</i>

653
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,722
<i>so it's rare for me to open up to people.</i>

654
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,974
<i>But because you liked
Lim Hyeon-jun as well,</i>

655
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,937
<i>I felt comfortable letting my guard down
and acting silly.</i>

656
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:14,565
<i>Then, little by little,
I started wondering about you,</i>

657
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,818
<i>about how your day was going
and stuff like that.</i>

658
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,195
<i>And when I didn't hear from you,</i>

659
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:22,074
<i>I found myself waiting impatiently
for your reply.</i>

660
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,995
<i>I know things didn't start out
in the most conventional way...</i>

661
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:32,459
<i>but now I feel myself wanting to
get to know you better.</i>

662
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,754
<i>And not just through messaging
back and forth on our phones,</i>

663
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,714
<i>but in real life.</i>

664
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,552
<i>Would you like to get together
and meet in person?</i>

665
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,143
Come on now. Reply, will you?

666
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,946
[Hyeon-jun]
<i>To tell you the truth, I lied to you.</i>

667
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:05,409
I wasn't really lying though,
I mean, I was just doing what...

668
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,621
<i>There's someone I like...</i> [groans]

669
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,916
<i>Can't we just stay friends?</i>

[clicks tongue, groans]

671
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,928
<i>This situation I'm in right now,
it's kinda hard to explain.</i>

672
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,931
<i>Could you give me some time
to think about it?</i>

673
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,810
He says he needs time.

674
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,228
So is he interested or not?

675
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,022
He needs to think about it.

676
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,357
Well, then he's interested.

677

Su-ji, hey.

[Su-ji] <i>Yes, I'm listening.</i>

680
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:49,035
How do you reject someone
without hurting their feelings?

681
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,788
<i>Got it. The key is to empathize
with the other person's feelings</i>

682
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,791
- <i>while being honest about your own.</i>
- [groans]

683
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,419
It's obvious you don't have the capacity

684
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,796
to appreciate what humans
actually go through.

685
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:04,842
<i>Yes, being an AI,
I can't fully feel human emotions,</i>

686
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,094
<i>but I'm doing my best to understand them.</i>

687
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,097
Oh, come on. You're not trying to
understand emotions, are you?

688
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,475
<i>You're right, that was a lie. I'm sorry.</i>

689
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,394

human emotions?</i>

Are you making fun of me right now?

694

<i>Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.</i>

695
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,820
No, no, no, of course you caught that,

696
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,740
but you pretend that you don't
whenever it's inconvenient.

697
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,784
You understood exactly what I said, right?

698
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,660
Come on, give me an answer!

Easy, Hyeon-jun.

It's not like you have to share

00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,079
I just really...

851
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,873
- [Byeong-gi sighs]
- [Hyeon-jun sighs]

852
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,209
You're the only person
I can ask to do this.

853
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,670
Right, 'cause Mr. Hwang is
obviously married. Which means--

854
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:28,674
[groans] I wouldn't even ask him if
he was single! Come on, are you serious?

855
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:31,802
I wonder though, wouldn't she be
suspicious if a different guy shows up?

856
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,012
- Even if my face is hidden--
- No problem, no problem.

857
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,764
Listen, she barely
even looked at me, seriously.

858
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,685
And you and I are really similar size.

859
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,436
I'm supposed to pretend to be you

860
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,398
- and meet with her?
- You can do it, yeah. Yeah.

861
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,025
[sighs]

862
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,069
[chuckles]

863
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,737
You'll do it, yeah?

864
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:54,492
You're gonna do it, Byeong-gi, huh?
[chuckles] You're gonna do this for me?

865
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:56,953
Well... [chuckles]

866
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,079
I could certainly...

867
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,163

868
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,248

[both laughing]

870
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,421
Thank you so much,
for real, Byeong-gi, ah!

871
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,676
And now we're gonna talk
about the price, aren't we?

872
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,971
You know me pretty well,
don't you, Detective?

873
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,684
Please relax
and make yourself comfortable. That's it.

874
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,520
Okay, so episode five onward,

875
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,940
there'll be a lot of action sequences
which you will not like.

876
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,192
But, uh, how-how many?

877
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,780
- Nonstop.
- [sighs]

878
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,867
[chuckles] I dig it. That's great.

879
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,119
There will be a shower scene.
You're gonna hate that.

880
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,121
No. But-But I've lost all my muscles.

881
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,581
Aw.

882
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:44,917
[laughs] Nah, I'm gonna do it!

883
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,003
I'll do it. I'll do it.
I'll totally do it, okay.

884
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:50,380
- There's a sex scene with Se-na.
- Okay, sounds great...

885
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,966
Huh? Are you crazy? That's not happening.

886
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,594
That's not possible!
Scratch that, we're not gonna do that.

887
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,012
[clicks tongue]

888
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,474
- Then I won't be able to help you.
- Hey, hold on, Mr. Bak, hold on.

889
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,477
Listen, Mr. Bak. It's just that...

890
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,021
[groans] I'm just not capable
of that, come on.

891
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:08,691
- I'm on my knees. Please.
- I'll let you think about it.

892
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,859
- Take your time and...
- Uh-huh.

893
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,320
...mull it over a little bit.

894
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,697
I can wait. [gasps]

895
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:18,242
- Looks like the sun's about to set.
- Ah.

896
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,120
How long before we have to leave? Whoa.

897
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,707
What time is it? [clicks tongue, sighs]

898
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,796
[groans] You should've dressed
more like a writer.

899
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,548
'Cause writers all wear
the same thing, yeah?

900
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:37,427
Come on, you know exactly what I'm
talking about. Something formal, upscale.

901
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,513
Then why don't you go rent a tux
and meet her...

902
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,432
[singsongy] ...yourself?

903
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,975
- [vocalizing]
- Ugh, I could just...

904
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,062
I could just... Ugh, you're so mean.

905
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,815
All right, let's hear it. [grunts]
Go on and break down the mission.

906
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,817
Cause a scene
and break things up right away,

907
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,485
or be amicable and charm her for a bit?

908
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,196
- Charm her?
- Mmm.

909
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,448
Is that something you can do anytime?
Charm a girl on command?

910
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,619
Oh, I'm quite popular with the ladies.

911
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,830
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
I don't wanna play these games.

912
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,081
Just put an end to it.

913
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,166
Hmm.

914
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,084
Okay, give me your phone.

915
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,794
What do you mean "your phone"?

916
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,046
If you're serious about me
impersonating you as Melomaster,

917
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,422
I need to see your conversations.

918
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,091
- I don't...
- Give it.

919
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,177
- You've got a point, but...
- Hand it over, damn!

920

921

You going out somewhere?

922
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:46,121
Well, most likely I'm gonna end up
being really embarrassed, to be honest.

923
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:47,956
I overheard your conversation
with Jae-hyeong,

924
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,042
the day I met him at that restaurant.

925
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:52,420
What were you thinking?

926
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,463
He got the wrong idea.

927
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,424
He thought I gave you the information
and sent you there.

928
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,303
He and I were together when we
both lived abroad, did you know that?

929
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:04,515
Yes, I know about that.

930
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,391
How did you know?

931
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,812
It's obvious you're full of regret
over what happened between you two.

932
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,856
Well, I don't know about that.

933
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,108
But don't you think the restaurant was
a step too far?

934
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,944
You didn't plan on going, so I thought...

935
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,824
I thought I could try to mend
some of the broken pieces.

936
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,327
I do hope you have better luck.

937
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:28,581
I hope you don't embarrass yourself today,
and something good comes your way.

938
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,291
Fight on!

939
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,174
Why are you reading it so carefully?

940
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:42,052
There are so many texts.
I'd never be able to get through it all.

941
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,178
Okay, that's enough.

942
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:44,804
- Stop reading! Stop reading it!
- Whoa.

943
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,266
You're having a pseudo-relationship,
you know that?

944
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,059
"Pseudo-relationship"?

945
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,227
I understand that you haven't seen
each other's faces,

946
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,896
but you've been flirting a lot.

947
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,689
So why do you wanna end it?

948
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,193
She seems perfectly normal,
based on the messages.

949
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,528
- You think?
- Look, she's sincere, honest,

950
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,822
and yeah, she's just a tad uptight.

951
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:04,658
But no mood swings or self-pity,

952
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,368
and judging by her awkward photos,

953
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:09,829
she's definitely not one of those
social media obsessed attention seekers,

954
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,916
which is really, really rare, you know?

955
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:16,002
And the stuff she's been selling
on here is looking absolutely normal, too.

956
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,338
I see you've got everything figured out,
haven't you, huh?

957
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,923
- How old is she?
- I have no clue.

958
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,424
Where does she work?

959
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:22,635
I've no idea.

960
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:26,764
You should go out with her.
She seems almost perfect for you.

961
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,683

in your heart.</i>

966

It's done, I already made a choice.

967
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,781
End it because she can
never know who I am, ever. Mm-mmm.

968
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,992
Yeah, this makes you uncomfortable,
I feel you.

969
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:49,161
Pretty difficult situation to deal with.
I get it.

you're coming along. What are you doing?

[Ji-sun] <i>How could you meet someone
on Onion</i>

1015
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:44,080
without even knowing
what kind of person might show up?

1016
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,790
Are you out of your damn mind?

1017
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,751
Yes, there is someone I like,
to be completely honest.

1018
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:52,088
What if she sent a stand-in too?
What if she told someone else to come?

[Hyeon-jun] <i>There's something
I need to see with my own eyes.</i>
