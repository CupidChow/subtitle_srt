1
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,662
You asked me if I liked you.

2
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:52,762
You asked me if I liked you.

3
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,847
Yes.

4
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:56,766
I like you.

5
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,728
So forget Melomaster.

6
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,149
Start seeing me from now on.

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,783
You seem to like Melomaster more than me,

8
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,536
but I like Wi Jeong-sin
just as much as I like Soulishere.

9
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,079
Hold on.

10
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,665
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,251
How do you even know Melomaster?

12
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,461
Because it was me.

13
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,172
No, but I've met him before.

14
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,173
That's right.

15
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,469
The man you met at the N Seoul Tower
that day was someone else.

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,305
I had someone else go in my place.

17
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,100
But the first rice cooker transaction?

18
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:41,977
That was me.

19
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,988
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

20
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,870
My brother had listed the rice cooker,

21
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,664
but plans changed, so I came out instead.

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,750
I didn't recognize you back then either.

23
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,335
But when you said

24
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,003
you were a fan of mine,

25
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,047
I became interested.

26
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,675
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

27
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,262
Oh, thank you.

28
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,721
I have a whole box at home.

29
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:28,023
I know it'll take some time
to wrap your head around all this.

30
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,401
I can wait.

31
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,197
-Let's go.
-Go where?

32
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,574
Home, of course.

33
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,826
Right.

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,412
This is the umbrella I gave you.

35
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,372
The Kang Pil-gu umbrella.

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,002
Let's get going.

37
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,132
You must be really surprised.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,095
I mean, I tried to…

39
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,930
Jeez.

40
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,059
You probably can't process
a word I'm saying…

41
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,478
but I'm sorry.

42
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,481
I was really surprised too.

43
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,403
I was so shocked
that I couldn't say anything.

44
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,269
Well, take the rice cooker back.

45
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,272
You said it worked fine.

46
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,651
It may be big and expensive,
but it's a good fit for your home.

47
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,695
And we're a good fit too.

48
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,743
Where did that even come from?

49
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,831
When I said it wasn't a good fit,

50
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,167
I just meant that it's too big.

51
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,420
For a family of two, the rice cooker

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,881
isn't a good fit for our home…

53
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:19,760
So I'm saying,
don't sell off the rice cooker

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,303
and use it until it breaks down.

55
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,722
No, even if it breaks down,
fix it and use it.

56
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,808
No, I mean…

57
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,601
I'll deal with the rice cooker!

58
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:28,560
Okay.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,733
Well, go inside and get some rest.

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,902
-Get home safely.
-All right.

61
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,155
-I'll be in touch then.
-You can borrow the umbrella.

62
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, thank you.

63
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,035
I'll be in touch.

64
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,788
-Here…
-I can take care of it myself.

65
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,644
EPISODE 12

66
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,319
You're back.

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,074
Wait, why'd you bring
the rice cooker back?

68
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,826
-Was it a no-show?
-No.

69
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,494
Did they not want it?

70
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:28,662
Can we use it then?

71
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,540
Can we?

72
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,375
Why aren't you…

73
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,837
What's the matter with her?

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,631
Her mood swings
have been really bad these days.

75
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,860
You asked me if I liked you.

76
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:01,945
Yes.

77
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,199
I like you.

78
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,493
Start seeing me from now on.

79
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,179
"What's your name?"

80
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,308
This is a fun script.

81
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,580
SOULISHERE

82
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,424
And we're a good fit too.

83
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,687
SOULISHERE

84
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,367
I'll be in touch.

85
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,760
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

86
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,220
SOULISHERE

87
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:02,941
Jeez.

88
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:26,965
I like you.

89
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,508
Onion!

90
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,761
I'll be in touch.

91
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,934
I wanted to tell you again

92
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,186
that I'm sorry
for unintentionally lying to you.

93
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,023
I couldn't meet you that day
because people would've recognized me.

94
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:43,982
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,823
Onion!

96
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:57,621
And from now on,

97
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,958
I'll message you
instead of using the Onion app.

98
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,259
Sweet dreams.

99
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,598
It was me, Melomaster.

100
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,810
I was Melomaster,

101
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,144
and Melomaster

102
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,188
was me.

103
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,245
MELOMASTER (DELETED USER)

104
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,918
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
MY HEART'S POUNDING.

105
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,886
HE'S MANLY,
YET STILL HAS THAT BOYISH CHARM

106
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,442
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

107
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,485
Do you like Lim Hyeon-jun?

108
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,653
Yes, I do.

109
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,823
Kang Pil-gu Season 5 is coming out soon.

110
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm so looking forward to it.
My heart's pounding.

111
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,785
Have you seen Kang Pil-gu in person?

112
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,870
I have.

113
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,997
-What did you think of him?
-He was really cool, of course.

114
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,500
He's manly,
yet still has that boyish charm.

115
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,046
You can be old and still be cool.

116
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,590
Everyone has their own kind of charm
that suits their age.

117
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,010
You really do sound
exactly like Lim Hyeon-jun.

118
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,180
Can you say a line from Kang Pil-gu?

119
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,182
"They say you can't fix people."

120
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,017
"But I do."

121
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,021
Wow, how are you so good at impressions?

122
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,065
I just discovered
Lim Hyeon-jun's fan page.

123
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,025
You should join it too, Melomaster.

124
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,109
We can take part together.

125
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,444
No way!

126
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,572
Lim Hyeon-jun replied to
one of my posts on the fan page.

127
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,741
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited!

128
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,243
Melomaster, you should post something too.

129
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,662
Who knows?
Lim Hyeon-jun might leave a reply.

130
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,917
It's the first time in my life.

131
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:09,795
I've never liked someone…

132
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,714
so unconditionally.

133
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,178
What?

134
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:50,687
Hello?

135
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:52,814
What?

136
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,358
Right now?

137
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,776
But…

138
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,239
Yes, of course.

139
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,326
Okay, I got it.

140
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,827
Just give me a second.

141
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,496
Hold on.

142
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,623
There you are.

143
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,043
You don't look so well.

144
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,755
Did you not get any sleep?

145
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,716
Are you really Melomaster?

146
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,223
-Yes, I am.
-Really?

147
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,018
How can this all be a coincidence?

148
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,771
How could something like this happen?

149
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,439
I'm not sure either.

150
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,733
-Were you playing me?
-I don't…

151
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,735
Was it fun watching me
make a fool out of myself?

152
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,154
Why would you think I played you?

153
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,865
Everything I said to you
as Melomaster was genuinely…

154
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,824
Are you okay?

155
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,537
-I'll call 119…
-No, my legs just gave out.

156
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,122
-You should go to the hospital.
-I said I'm fine!

157
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,336
Then at least let me take you inside.

158
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,301
Careful.

159
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,928
Watch the steps.

160
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,765
Here, sit down.

161
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,267
-Can I get some water?
-What?

162
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,186
-Water, please.
-Water? I got it.

163
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,106
Water. Right, water.

164
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,612
Water.

165
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,572
Here we go.

166
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,490
No, wait.

167
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,005
A bowl of soup would be nice.

168
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,757
Some soup.

169
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,701
Are you really Melomaster?

170
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,703
Were you playing me?

171
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,955
Was it fun watching me
make a fool out of myself?

172
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,090
It looks like Crime Revolution
will be the biggest topic

173
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,008
at next week's press screenings.

174
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,096
Jung Ji-seok will be attending
the press screening for Crime Revolution,

175
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,431
so ask him if he's settled
with the bullying victim.

176
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,142
If he avoids the question,
ask the director why he cast Jung Ji-seok.

177
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,769
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,607
Where's Wi Jeong-sin?

179
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,151
She didn't come in today.

180
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,945
Without notice? Have you called her?

181
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,155
Did you try calling?

182
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,033
-No.
-I don't know her number.

183
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,160
What's the matter with you all?

184
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,038
Your colleague didn't show up for work,

185
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,289
but none of you called her?

186
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,584
She wrote an article in the ER
despite having a burst appendix.

187
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,253
Do you think she'd skip
the weekly meeting without notice?

188
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,423
What are you waiting for?

189
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,632
Call her right now.

190
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,621
Hello?

191
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,498
Hello?

192
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,085
Hello? Isn't this Wi Jeong-sin's phone?

193
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,214
Hello?

194
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,843
What's going on? Did she pick up or what?

195
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,681
Excuse me? Hello? Hey, Wi Jeong-sin.

196
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,143
Hello?

197
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,604
Damn it.

198
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,064
Wi Jeong-sin, answer me.
Is everything okay?

199
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,275
Hello?

200
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,370
Hello?

201
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,873
You've called Ms. Wi Jeong-sin's phone.

202
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,792
Oh, I'm not her.

203
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,878
She can't come to the phone right now.

204
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,798
All right, thank you.

205
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,763
She can't come in because she's sick.

206
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,515
Did Wi Jeong-sin say that?

207
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,599
No.

208
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,850
Her younger brother answered.

209
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,063
She must be really sick
if she can't even answer the phone.

210
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,942
-Start the weekly briefing.
-Yes, ma'am.

211
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,985
Let's begin.

212
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,073
The name we need to take note of
is Yun Tae-ju.

213
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,992
-Come to my office for a minute.
-We're going to cover him in depth.

214
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,620
-Ho-cheol and Seong-min will take this on.
-Sure.

215
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,377
Has the K-pop trend report

216
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,297
from our last discussion been completed?

217
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,632
It's still ongoing.

218
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,969
It's still in the early stages,
so there's nothing further to report.

219
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,971
We only started two days ago, after all.

220
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,558
Right. Two days.

221
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,938
Are there any issues
in the editorial department?

222
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:07,856
No.

223
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,607
Should there be?

224
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,860
Well, that's good to hear.

225
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:12,986
Will that be all?

226
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,696
Well…

227
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,656
how's Jae-ha?

228
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,075
Is he feeling better?

229
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,957
Yes, he's doing better.

230
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,835
He seemed like a cute kid.

231
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,004
And nice too.

232
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,214
He's sweet.

233
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,675
It's tough sometimes, but he's sweet.

234
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,969
"Sweet" doesn't even begin to cover it.

235
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,512
You seem happy.

236
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,766
I'm still not used to you being a mom,

237
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,101
but you look happy.

238
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,352
That's good to hear.

239
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:48,813
By the way,

240
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,358
I noticed your kid's name is Yun Jae-ha.

241
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,736
Was "Yun" your ex-husband's last name,

242
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,863
or did he take your surname?

243
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,325
Does he see his dad from time to time?

244
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,035
Why do you want to know?

245
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,037
Oh…

246
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,665
Was that rude to ask?

247
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,918
Just because you took me to the hospital

248
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,712
doesn't give you the right
to ask about my private life.

249
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,547
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:16,674
I shouldn't have asked.

251
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,183
The way you quickly back down
and apologize

252
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,684
hasn't changed at all.

253
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,977
How cute.

254
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,520
Cute?

255
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,899
I like that you're showing me interest.

256
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,751
Jae-ha.

257
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,961
Mom!

258
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,797
Are you okay? You must've been so scared.

259
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,714
Yeah.

260
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,509
I was a little scared, but it was okay.

261
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,803
Did you cry, Mom?

262
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,304
Yes.

263
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,599
I cried because I was afraid
you were badly hurt.

264
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,767
Good job.

265
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,896
You said that it's okay to cry
when you're scared, remember?

266
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,025
Anyway, who's that man over there?

267
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,111
What?

268
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,655
Oh.

269
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,865
Hi there.

270
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,956
Who the hell is this ex-husband bastard?

271
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh, boy.

272
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,571
HWANG JI-SUN

273
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,800
Hello?

274
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,594
Bro, where are you?

275
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,015
Look, I'm really sorry.

276
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,685
Can you clear my schedule for just today?

277
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,480
What excuse can I make up
to clear your schedule at the last minute?

278
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,440
Just tell them that I'm sick.

279
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,275
Who'll believe that? Would you believe it?

280
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,446
I was planning on showing up if I could.

281
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,781
But sometimes in life,

282
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,576
situations come up
that are just out of your control.

283
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,579
Mr. Hwang.

284
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,707
Today is that day for me.

285
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,084
Come on, seriously?

286
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,044
Fine, I got it.

287
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,087
But listen, bro.

288
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,714
This is the last time, okay?

289
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,259
All right. Thanks.

290
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,470
You're the best.

291
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:12,600
Seriously…

292
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,232
Are you kidding me, Mr. Hwang?

293
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,651
He wants to clear
his entire schedule for the day?

294
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,945
I'm truly sorry, Director.

295
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,614
Most of the scenes
scheduled for today are Mr. Lim's.

296
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,991
If he's not here,
we'll have to wrap up after two scenes.

297
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,119
I know.

298
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,247
But I swear, his fever's hit 48 degrees.

299
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,498
Forty-eight--

300
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,756
He'd be dead if he had a 48-degree fever.

301
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:47,844
Here.

302
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,721
I heated up the soup.

303
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,433
Thank you.

304
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,813
Have some bread and the banana too.

305
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,902
I also ordered some rice porridge.

306
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:06,946
Tell me if you want some.

307
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,905
You had

308
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,741
so many chances to come clean.

309
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,745
Empathy isn't my strong suit,

310
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,330
but I thought long and hard.

311
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,749
I tried to put myself in your shoes

312
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,626
and racked my brain.

313
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,628
When I said…

314
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,258
When I said I was a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun…

315
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,304
I could see why you got curious about me.

316
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,389
-But that--
-Let me speak.

317
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,643
-Okay.
-I joined your fan page,

318
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,061
spoke to you on the phone,

319
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,813
asked you to do an impression,

320
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,525
and mustered up my courage
to ask you to meet me,

321
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,403
yet you sent someone else in your place.

322
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,074
I mean…

323
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,493
I just…

324
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,914
I've never felt like
such an idiot in my life.

325
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,624
I don't understand this feeling.

326
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,501
I don't even know how to explain it!

327
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,050
Listen, it was a complete shock for me too

328
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,469
when I saw you
at the N Seoul Tower that day.

329
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,387
My mind went completely blank.

330
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,182
But then…

331
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,352
the more I thought about it,

332
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,395
the more I realized

333
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,439
that this whole time…

334
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,985
I've had feelings for you.

335
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,863
That's why I deleted Onion.

336
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,783
So that means
you had no feelings for Soulishere.

337
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,078
No, that's not true.

338
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,204
Hearing that I was a fan,

339
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,831
you must've messaged me just for fun.

340
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,209
I told you it wasn't like that.

341
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,546
I like both Soulishere and Wi Jeong-sin.

342
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,173
That's called two-timing!

343
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,759
No, that would only apply
if there were two different people.

344
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,928
You and Soulishere are the same person.

345
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,012
So you're proud of what you did?

346
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,565
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

347
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,901
I told you earlier

348
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,737
that it'll take time
to wrap your head around this.

349
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,155
It took me a while too.

350
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,992
I know you're impatient,

351
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,578
but don't rush
and take your time to think about it.

352
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,998
I can wait as long as you need.

353
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,792
Everything about it makes me angry.

354
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,878
Are you leaving like this again?

355
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,505
Eat something before you go.

356
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,673
I can't eat anything right now.

357
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,341
Then let me take you home--

358
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,509
No, thank you.

359
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:34,969
I want to go alone.

360
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,139
Come on, Ms. Wi.

361
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,682
I'll leave by myself.

362
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,370
How can I get her to stop being mad?

363
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,333
I mean, I wouldn't blame her
if she never wants to see me again.

364
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,419
Wait.

365
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,756
Maybe I shouldn't have
confessed empty-handed.

366
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,550
Should I have gotten her
a new rice cooker?

367
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,052
Jeez, you idiot!

368
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,429
The rice cooker isn't the issue, you fool!

369
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,520
If I give this back to her now,
she'll never see me again.

370
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,397
WI JEONG-SIN

371
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,572
-This boxed lunch is delicious.
-Is she really sick?

372
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,074
-Ms. Wi is here.
-Yeah, it's good.

373
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,951
-Hello, Ms. Wi.
-Do you feel okay?

374
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:41,869
Are you okay?

375
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,997
We heard you were sick.
You should rest some more.

376
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,457
Have you eaten yet?

377
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,793
-Are you okay?
-She doesn't look okay.

378
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,962
I've never seen her like this before.

379
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,172
Should we tell the chief?

380
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,592
Leave her alone.
She can take care of herself.

381
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:01,514
I like both Soulishere and Wi Jeong-sin.

382
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,599
I told you earlier

383
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,103
that it'll take time
to wrap your head around this.

384
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,479
It took me a while too.

385
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,481
I know you're impatient,

386
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,068
but don't rush
and take your time to think about it.

387
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,737
I can wait as long as you need.

388
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,489
What's going on?

389
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,161
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

390
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,454
She must really be sick.

391
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,385
Wi Jeong-sin.

392
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:44,890
Are you all right?

393
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,726
Yes, I'm fine.

394
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,187
But you're not acting like yourself.

395
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,023
Get some more rest if you're sick,
or get it together and get to work.

396
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,608
Choose one or the other.

397
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:55,901
I'm sorry.

398
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,404
I'll get it together and get to work.

399
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,221
I…

400
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,515
like you.

401
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,199
Time to take out the trash.

402
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,242
-Let's go!
-You're home.

403
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,585
I'll wait for you.

404
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,719
I like you.

405
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,266
So, Detective.

406
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,810
I see you like flowers.

407
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,521
I like them.

408
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,064
Please just stop!

409
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:18,859
Sister.

410
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,908
I'm going to sell that! I really am!

411
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,409
Box it up right now!

412
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,369
I'll wait for you.

413
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,204
And this…

414
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,374
Yeon-ju said to give this to you.

415
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,923
I'm so pissed that I got fooled,

416
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,466
but I can't stop thinking about him!

417
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,929
I like you.

418
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,847
I'll wait for you.

419
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:50,599
I like you.

420
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,268
I'll wait for you.

421
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,442
He really

422
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,236
likes me?

423
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,405
Lim Hyeon-jun likes me?

424
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,075
Open wide.

425
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,618
LIM HYEON-JUN & REPORTER W OPENLY DATING

426
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,079
A reporter should be
covering stories, not dating.

427
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,831
They're not a good fit.

428
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,083
Honestly, I'd be a better fit.

429
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,169
Get away from my man.

430
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,672
I'd rather see him with Jin Su-a again.

431
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:25,217
Don't you think
he's way out of her league?

432
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,724
You lost this major exclusive
to another media outlet?

433
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:32,850
But Chief…

434
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,312
Another outlet beat us to the exclusive
about you and Lim Hyeon-jun!

435
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,566
Take this money

436
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,401
and stay away from my son.

437
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,903
-Mother…
-Who are you calling "Mother"?

438
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,531
My son is destined for greater things.

439
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,450
How dare you stand in his way?

440
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:54,121
But we genuinely love each other.

441
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,541
Mother!

442
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,709
Break up with him this instant,

443
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,336
or I'll slap you with kimchi next time!

444
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,795
But Mother…

445
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,050
Have I really lost it?

446
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,885
I like you.

447
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,095
Snap out of it!

448
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,889
Come on, Jeong-sin!

449
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:12,973
I'll wait for you.

450
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,934
It's not true.

451
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,937
It's not true.

452
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,564
It's not true.

453
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:21,899
-It's not true.
-I like you.

454
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,150
It's not true.

455
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,152
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

456
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,654
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

457
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:27,696
Thank you.

458
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,032
-I'll take the smallest one.
-Move along.

459
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,367
-Keep handing these out.
-Got it.

460
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,494
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

461
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,496
-Thanks so much!
-You're welcome.

462
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,873
-Thank you.
-When did you prepare this?

463
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,957
It's nothing.

464
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,251
-Is it to make up for skipping the shoot?
-Come on.

465
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,463
-Thank you!
-Thanks so much!

466
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,341
-Season six, here we come!
-This is awesome!

467
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,759
They really love it.

468
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,678
I need to stop by the restroom.

469
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,346
What's gotten into him?

470
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,099
-Hey, he's gone.
-Really?

471
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,894
Man, the letters are huge.

472
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,813
As if we'd ever wear these out.

473
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,981
Right? I'd rather he not skip a shoot

474
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,025
than try to make up for it
with these T-shirts and caps.

475
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:05,943
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

476
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,989
-Twist the arm.
-And block.

477
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,409
Duck once, duck twice.

478
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,493
Then punch.

479
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,411
Hold on.

480
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,579
I need to see Seok-ho alone.

481
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,415
-Come with me.
-You didn't like it?

482
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,751
-Mr. Lim, I'll rehearse with you.
-Sounds good.

483
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,963
-Is your ankle okay now?
-My ankle?

484
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,965
Yes, you hurt your ankle last time.

485
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,592
I told them I can't do any stunts today
because I hurt my ankle.

486
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,844
I really did.

487
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,974
I'll be doing my own scenes today

488
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,600
without a stunt double.

489
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,560
Does that mean

490
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,354
you did your own stunts that day,
knowing I was hurt?

491
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,817
Are you okay now?

492
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,318
Yes, I'm fine now.

493
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,862
That's good to hear.

494
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,697
All right, let's rehearse our moves.

495
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,907
-Right, let me explain how it goes first.
-Okay.

496
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,117
-Seok-ho will…
-Wait,

497
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,994
so what's the deal with the ballpoint pen?

498
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,204
When Seok-ho attacks you with the pen,

499
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,999
you twist his arm
and force him to drop it.

500
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,418
-Then follow up with a punch and a kick.
-Do it precisely.

501
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,837
Sorry, I'll be the one throwing the punch.

502
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,172
Okay, got it.

503
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,258
All right, let's start from the beginning.

504
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,551
Sounds good.

505
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:27,983
Damn it!

506
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,949
-Cut!
-Cut!

507
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:37,826
-Oh, man.
-Jeez.

508
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,661
-Did that hurt?
-Are you okay?

509
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,413
No, I'm not okay.

510
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,207
-Did he hurt his back?
-Step out for a minute.

511
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,125
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh, my back.

512
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,586
Hey, help him up.

513
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,131
We'll take a quick break.

514
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,300
-Let's break briefly!
-We'll take a quick break!

515
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,510
-Mr. Lim.
-Yes?

516
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,887
You rehearsed the sequence earlier, right?

517
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,930
Of course.

518
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,808
You twist his arm
and force him to drop it.

519
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,851
Then follow up with a punch and a kick.

520
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,396
In this scene,
you're supposed to block Seok-ho's attack,

521
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,733
force the pen out of his hand,
and then kick the pen away.

522
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,320
Oh, kick the pen?

523
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,449
We'll resume shooting
after you rehearse with the stunt team.

524
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,597
Lim Hyeon-jun is unbelievable.

525
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,807
"Exceptional love for his crew"?

526
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,475
He handed out those gifts
for this article.

527
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,394
Sang-hyeok,
share the link in our group chat.

528
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,312
Hey, that's enough.

529
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,981
I'm sure Mr. Lim
gave out the gifts because he cares,

530
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,482
not for some article.

531
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,692
He wouldn't do that.

532
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,530
You're too kind, Director.

533
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,575
We're behind schedule
because he skipped that shoot,

534
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,202
and we lost so much money
leaving the set early that day.

535
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,162
Mr. Lim had his reasons--

536
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,291
He should've at least rehearsed properly
to make up for things then.

537
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,002
He ended up hurting an actor,
so now there's another delay.

538
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,503
This isn't right.

539
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,465
He says his arm hurts?

540
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,886
How high is his fever?

541
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,638
Did you give him a fever reducer?

542
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:24,933
Okay.

543
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,562
It's just that I can't leave right away,

544
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,023
and Jae-ha's nanny
isn't scheduled to come in today.

545
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,860
I'll make sure to get there by 5 p.m.

546
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,748
I'd like you to take a moment
to think about how you really feel.

547
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,542
At the end of your gaze,

548
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,920
it was always the chief.

549
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,257
As if she were a child
you left behind and couldn't forget.

550
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:10,812
Mom!

551
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,481
Jae-ha.

552
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,888
This smells great.

553
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,232
Thank you.

554
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,946
I won't be able to go
to the set of Kang Pil-gu,

555
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,990
so please send another reporter.

556
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,701
Why'd you change your mind again?

557
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,161
Well, I can't get into the details.

558
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,288
But I have my reasons.

559
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,582
And what are those reasons?

560
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,252
Did Lim Hyeon-jun
confess his feelings or something?

561
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,007
How did you know?

562
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:21,800
Is it true?

563
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,345
No, it's not like that.

564
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,305
In any case, I can't go there myself.

565
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,516
So please send someone else. I'm sorry.

566
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,025
I guess it was worth teaming up with him.

567
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:44,573
This is great.

568
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:46,950
"Is this place a joke to you?"

569
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,996
"If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!"

570
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,540
"Why'd you post photos of…"

571
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,129
Hi.

572
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,884
"Why'd you post photos of the office?"

573
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,999
LIM HYEON-JUN

574
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:36,917
LIM HYEON-JUN

575
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,005
LIM HYEON-JUN

576
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,805
"Is this place a joke to you?"

577
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:55,852
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

578
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,624
Hello?

579
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,793
It's me, Wi Jeong-sin.

580
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,670
Yes, I know.

581
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,840
You have a shoot today, right?

582
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,508
Hong-sin told me.

583
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,884
Yes, I do.

584
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,138
When will you be done?

585
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,431
I want to see you.

586
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:34,766
What?

587
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,644
Are you busy today?

588
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,854
-Then maybe another--
-Wait.

589
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,981
No, no.

590
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,149
Today works fine.

591
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,193
I have a morning and night shoot today,

592
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:47,028
so I have some time in between.

593
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,698
How about 4 o'clock?

594
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,615
Wait, no.

595
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,325
How about 3 o'clock?

596
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,703
I'll see you at 3 o'clock then.

597
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,914
Let me know where,
and I'll meet you there.

598
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,877
Okay. I'll see you later.

599
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,503
Okay.

600
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,216
I want to see you.

601
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,104
So suddenly?

602
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,189
I want to see you.

603
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,571
Hey, bro.

604
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,160
-Bro, what are you doing?
-Huh?

605
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,077
You okay?

606
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:36,995
Yeah.

607
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:44,753
Is it another panic attack?

608
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:47,923
I don't think so.

609
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,219
Mr. Lim, let's do a quick rehearsal.

610
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,553
-Right.
-Okay.

611
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,096
-Yeong-gi, you need to watch.
-Yes, sir.

612
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,014
Good.

613
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,600
-Get it together.
-Okay.

614
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,354
Pil-gu walks through the entrance
looking angry.

615
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,980
And as soon as he sees Yeong-gi,

616
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,524
he runs, grabs him by the collar,
and delivers his lines.

617
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,652
Yeong-gi is caught off guard,
so he just takes it.

618
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:09,903
-Got it, sir.
-Good.

619
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,241
I want to see you.

620
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,619
-Mr. Lim.
-What?

621
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,162
Did you get that?

622
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,873
Grab him by the collar?

623
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,416
Yes, and then deliver your lines.

624
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,876
-Okay.
-Good.

625
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,880
Okay? Okay, let's get ready.

626
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,548
-Now?
-Get ready to roll!

627
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,509
All right, ready…

628
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,551
Ready!

629
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,220
-Action!
-Action!

630
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,182
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

631
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,226
You idiot!

632
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:45,605
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos…

633
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:46,690
Wait.

634
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,318
-Why am I kneeling?
-Cut.

635
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,403
Action.

636
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,863
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

637
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,740
You idiot!

638
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,952
Wait a minute. Why is he so tall?

639
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,495
Wait.

640
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,497
That was a great take.

641
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,165
Was it?

642
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,083
I'm sorry.

643
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,459
Let's try that again.

644
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,545
Action!

645
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,882
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

646
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:13,800
You idiot!

647
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,553
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

648
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,097
Why'd you post photos of the office?

649
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,893
Because of you, all the files got leaked…

650
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,563
They got leaked, you idiot!

651
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,897
-Leaked…
-Cut.

652
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,692
-Damn it.
-Someone read Mr. Lim his lines.

653
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,653
-Read it out to him.
-"Is this place a joke to you?"

654
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:34,988
Action!

655
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,532
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

656
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,491
You idiot!

657
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:42,871
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

658
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,748
Why'd you post photos of the office?

659
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,378
Cut.

660
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:51,629
Hold on.

661
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,006
-Cut.
-I feel dizzy.

662
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,634
Hey, what's the next line?

663
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:57,677
Can he not see this?

664
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:58,720
Damn it!

665
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:03,141
-Guys, feed me the lines quickly, okay?
-Okay.

666
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,517
-Right, sir.
-Sorry.

667
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,353
-No, not at all.
-Let's hurry it up!

668
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,395
I'm sorry.

669
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,106
-I'm very sorry.
-Right.

670
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,107
It's okay.

671
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,693
Ready!

672
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:17,781
Action!

673
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,950
You punk! Is this place a joke to you?

674
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:21,910
You idiot!

675
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,288
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

676
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:29,292
Why'd you post photos
of the office, you punk?

677
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,169
Is this place… You punk!

678
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,962
Why you… You idiot!

679
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,799
Seriously, what's the matter with me?

680
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,926
Cut!

681
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,347
Mr. Lim, let's take a five-minute break.

682
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,486
When will you be done?

683
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,321
I want to see you.

684
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,002
Bro, what's going on?

685
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:14,671
What?

686
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,761
Bro, you look totally out of it.

687
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:22,679
Do I?

688
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:23,972
The way I see it,

689
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,307
there's no way
you're delivering your lines today.

690
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,143
That's not true.

691
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,146
I know all my lines,
but my mind just goes blank.

692
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,439
Be honest with me.

693
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,607
Is it a panic attack? Or dementia?

694
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,485
I can't help you if you don't tell me.

695
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,697
At this rate, we won't get through
half of today's scenes.

696
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,327
I suppose it's a panic attack then.

697
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:50,874
All right.

698
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,251
I'll work something out.

699
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:07,932
Ready.

700
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:09,809
Action!

701
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,186
You punk!

702
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,314
Is this place a joke to you? You idiot!

703
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,317
If you wanted to post photos,
you should've posted food photos!

704
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,360
Why'd you post photos of the office?

705
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,405
You think this is
your personal playground to show off?

706
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,158
Because of you, the files got leaked,

707
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,620
and we lost the suspect
we've been tracking for a whole year!

708
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,246
And an innocent person had to resign!

709
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,999
This whole place is a mess right now,

710
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,542
yet you posted more photos?

711
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,587
And you call yourself a detective,
you damn idiot?

712
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:40,131
Get out.

713
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,967
Get the hell out of here!

714
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,344
Okay, cut!

715
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,012
On to the next scene.

716
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,889
Let's move out
into the hallway for Scene 53!

717
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,807
Let's move out
into the hallway for Scene 53!

718
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,434
Good job, bro.

719
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,562
Oh, boy.

720
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,524
Come on, get up.

721
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,736
Man, that was some intense acting.

722
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:04,906
We're getting there.

723
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,242
Gil-su, bring him some water.

724
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,454
When will you be done?

725
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,373
I want to see you.

726
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,042
Yes, we're done!

727
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,169
-The night shoot is in Gangnam, right?
-Yeah.

728
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:21,548
You two take that car.
Let me borrow yours.

729
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,259
-My car?
-Yeah.

730
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,094
-What for?
-Oh, it's for…

731
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,680
An appointment in Gwanghwamun.

732
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,931
What appointment?

733
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,350
-With a friend.
-What friend?

734
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,601
I know all your friends.

735
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,478
Mind your own business!

736
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,563
Can I borrow it or not?

737
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,608
-Fine. Here.
-It'll take about two hours to get there.

738
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:43,319
-I'll drive you there.
-No, it's okay.

739
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:47,824
Also, my mom and Ms. Oh Mi-ran
will be shooting a scene together later.

740
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,200
You should be there, Mr. Hwang.

741
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:51,327
Keep an eye on them
in case something happens.

742
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:55,081
Come on, they're both professionals.
Relax, nothing will happen.

743
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,376
How can you say that after last time?

744
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,087
Wait, which scene are they shooting today?

745
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,839
I think it's the slapping scene.

746
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:04,799
The slapping scene?

747
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,761
Who's slapping whom?

748
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:13,016
I think it's your mother
slapping Ms. Oh Mi-ran.

749
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,403
Cut! Nice job.

750
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,155
Let's roll with this vibe.

751
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,948
-Was that okay, Director?
-Yes.

752
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,116
Let's roll again.

753
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,076
-Let's roll again!
-Let's roll again!

754
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:40,251
-All right. Ready?
-Yes.

755
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:41,377
Ready.

756
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,296
Action.

757
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,758
I can't quit like this, ma'am.

758
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,428
If I do, it'll make
everything you heard look true.

759
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,430
If I have to quit, then so be it.

760
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,974
But I want to clear up
the misunderstanding before I go.

761
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,101
Why you…

762
00:48:57,185 --> 00:49:00,772
How dare you act all high and mighty,
you homewrecker!

763
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,359
Do you really think
I don't know you're only trying to stay

764
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,779
so you can seduce my soft-hearted husband?

765
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,155
Ma'am.

766
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,157
I have my own taste in men.

767
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,159
Your husband is not my type.

768
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,787
What did you say?

769
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,330
Why you…

770
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,375
Not your type?

771
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,382
-The scene called for one slap, not two.
-It's once, right?

772
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,300
She's totally into character.

773
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:33,888
Damn you!

774
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:35,890
What's going on?

775
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,893
This doesn't seem right.

776
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,811
Cut.

777
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,397
-Cut!
-Cut!

778
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,899
Cut!

779
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,192
-Stop!
-Oh, damn it!

780
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,319
-Cut!
-Cut!

781
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:51,072
-Cut!
-Stop them!

782
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,158
Stop them! Break them up!

783
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,966
Ma'am, please calm down!

784
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,555
Director!

785
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,004
When will you be done?

786
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,214
I want to see you.

787
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,260
Let me know where,
and I'll meet you there.

788
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,495
I'm here. Take your time.

789
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,024
I'm here. Take your time.

790
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:32,733
You're here.

791
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,443
Please sit.

792
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:38,739
Why are you sitting
where everyone can see you?

793
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,408
So you can find me easily.

794
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:42,910
At least put on your hat.

795
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,373
I took it off so you'd recognize me.

796
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,710
Are you worried
about a dating rumor again?

797
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,171
Who'd start a dating rumor
when you're with a reporter?

798
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:03,347
Do you want a drink?
I'll go and order for us.

799
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,016
-No, I'll go.
-No.

800
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,809
I'll go.

801
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:07,977
What would you like?

802
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:09,896
An iced Americano.

803
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,063
An iced Americano?

804
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,862
-Please order when you're ready.
-Thank you.

805
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,989
-Hello.
-Hello.

806
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,741
-I'm a huge fan!
-I love your show!

807
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,034
-Can I get a photo with you?
-Sure.

808
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,703
-Thank you.
-Can I get one with you too?

809
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,496
No way.

810
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,581
-Your order?
-An iced Americano, please.

811
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,124
Sure, two iced Americanos.

812
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,420
Thank you so much.

813
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,672
-I've never seen a celebrity before.
-Me too!

814
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:41,886
Thank you.

815
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,768
Jeez, come on.

816
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,561
What's the matter with him?

817
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,481
-Hello?
-Bro, where are you?

818
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,398
Why?

819
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,400
Our biggest fear came true.

820
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:57,360
Where are you?

821
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,612
Where else? I'm on set, of course.

822
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,615
You need to get here.

823
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:03,950
Right now?

824
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:07,453
It was a huge fight
full of hair-pulling and slapping.

825
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:09,163
It was total chaos.

826
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,083
The camera was still rolling
when the director called cut,

827
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,418
but they were at each other's throats.

828
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,254
If word of this gets out,
we're in big trouble.

829
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,423
We have to make sure
the crew keeps their lips sealed.

830
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,634
But the bigger issue
is that neither of them

831
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,553
is willing to apologize,
and they won't continue shooting.

832
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:26,514
They won't listen to the director or me.

833
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,517
No one can stop moms.
Bro, just get over here.

834
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,893
We need you here now!

835
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:31,936
Director Bak.

836
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,730
How could you cast her
without discussing it with me?

837
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:37,358
You're not the director!
Why would he need it discuss it with you?

838
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,527
Then is Lim Hyeon-jun the director?

839
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,779
He has no right
to pull strings for his mom like this!

840
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,115
-What did you just say?
-It wasn't like that, ma'am.

841
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,742
You heard that, right? Get over here now.

842
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:47,994
All right.

843
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,037
-How could you bring her on board?
-Are you done talking?

844
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,062
-The coffee…
-Oh.

845
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,355
I brought the coffee.

846
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:21,610
I'm sorry. I had to take that call.

847
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,572
Did something happen?

848
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,616
No.

849
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:33,164
Did you ask to meet today
because you had something to tell me?

850
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,123
I wanted to say--

851
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,793
-Mom!
-Are you okay? Hey!

852
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,963
-Oh, no!
-Are you okay?

853
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,343
Mom!

854
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,806
-What happened?
-Mom!

855
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,808
-Mom!
-Weren't you watching them?

856
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,727
Mr. Lim?

857
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,437
What's wrong?

858
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,315
Are you okay? Mr. Lim!

859
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,241
Let's get out of here.

860
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:26,634
Are you okay?

861
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:30,638
Yes.

862
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:36,852
I'm sorry.

863
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:40,898
There's no need to apologize.

864
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,484
It's a sunny day today.

865
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:26,944
My head…

866
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:30,865
feels warm already.

867
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:31,991
If you'd like,

868
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,869
I can share a simple feel-good method.

869
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:38,080
Go outside on a sunny day
and simply stand there.

870
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:39,206
That's it?

871
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,083
After standing for a while,

872
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,502
your head will start to feel warm
from the sunshine.

873
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,546
When that happens,

874
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:48,549
it feels like someone
is gently stroking your head.

875
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:03,063
Nobody does that for you anymore
once you become an adult.

876
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,232
So I like to think

877
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:09,111
that my parents are the ones
gently stroking my head.

878
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,948
It makes me feel better.

879
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,732
I tried your feel-good method today.

880
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:50,152
I stood outside in the sun.

881
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,279
What you said about
celebrity and non-celebrity couples

882
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:34,488
always ending in disaster…

883
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,198
Do you really believe that?

884
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,659
Do I really have to teach you everything?

885
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,160
You need to give her reassurance.

886
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,538
There's someone I like.

887
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,374
Just go on ten dates with me.

888
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,709
If that goes well,
we'll keep seeing each other.

889
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,212
-Listen, I--
-Just shut up!

890
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,549
I like Wi Jeong-sin!

891
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,344
She's totally into me.
