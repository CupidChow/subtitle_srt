00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,280
I've been holding onto this case
for a long time,

3
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,657
and I want to get to the bottom of it.

4
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,579
Set up an interview for me.

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,831
Make sure the interview
is on a reputable program

6
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,501
that will give our story real credibility.

7
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,680
Hi, I'm here.

8
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:37,598
Yeah.

9
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,227
Why are you here at this hour, though?
Did something happen?

10
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,395
You said to call if I needed your help.

11
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:46,982
What is it?

12
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,943
What do you need my help with?

13
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:49,985
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

14
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,698
Let's take him down.

15
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,118
Together.

17
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,211
We'll wrap up the pre-interview here.

18
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,384
It's my first time on live news,
so I'm really nervous.

19
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,886
The anchor will make you feel at ease.

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,181
By the way, ma'am.

21
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,393
Can I ask you a favor?

22
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,019
If we release this…

23
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,356
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na
are the faces of the company.

24
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,607
Won't they take a hit?

25
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,401
I assume they have
shares in the company too.

26
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,194
They won't be able to
avoid a hit entirely.

27
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,073
But for now, I've taken
the best possible measures.

28
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,200
Actually,

29
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,452
I'm more concerned for Mr. Lee.

30
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,581
Are you sure about this?

31
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,087
It does weigh on me,

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,631
but I've decided it's something I must do,

33
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,466
so I'm willing to take any risk necessary.

34
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,013
Then let's run this article as it is.

35
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,975
Oh, also…

36
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,394
I wanted to express my gratitude
to both of you.

37
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:07,980
Thank you.

39
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,061
I went for a solemn look today.

40
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,273
Well, this is my solemn look.

41
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:52,858
Oh, yeah?

42
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,692
I'm going to say

43
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,612
some solemn things today.

44
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,407
-Get ready for standby.
-Okay.

45
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:02,785
Shall we go?

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,204
You're watching our star interview
on YTM News.

47
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,789
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na from

48
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,458
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
are here with us today.

49
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,918
It's nice to meet you both.

50
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,211
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

51
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,296
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun,

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,507
and I play Kang Pil-gu
in Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

53
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,550
Hello.

54
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,053
I'm Gwon Se-na, and I play Seo I-su

55
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,180
in season five
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

56
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,598
All right.

57
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:29,770
It's ready to go.

[EXCLUSIVE] THE UGLY TRUTH
BEHIND ENTERTAINMENT MOGUL LEE DAE-HO

59
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,030
PUBLISH REQUEST SENT!

60
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,367
The last question is for you, Mr. Lim.

61
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,996
What do you think
Kang Pil-gu from season five

62
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,164
has taught you?

63
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,543
Kang Pil-gu always made the right choices

64
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,211
and never regretted them.

65
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,088
From now on,

66
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,925
I want to live
just as sincerely and confidently.

67
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,012
Ms. Gwon, I hear that you have

68
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,390
something important to share
with our viewers today.

69
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,894
Yes.

70
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,025
The truth is--

71
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:16,942
Wait.

72
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,486
May I go first?

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,489
Let's do that, then.

74
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,077
A few months ago,
Ms. Gwon's agency merged with mine.

75
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,122
Many people hoped
the integration would be beneficial,

76
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,540
and I hoped the same.

77
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,875
But I recently found out

78
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,044
that Chairman Lee Dae-ho of Eunseong Group

79
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,837
has been using our agency

80
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,174
as a means to launder money.

81
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,970
I apologize for raising an issue like this
during our drama promotion segment.

82
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,222
But as a co-production partner
on Kang Pil-gu,

83
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,932
I've invited a guest today

84
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,894
to shed more light
on the details of this case.

85
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,588
Hello.

86
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,050
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

87
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,137
I'm here today

88
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,141
to expose the ugly truth
behind the political and business circles.

89
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,768
This case traces back seven years,

90
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,271
to the death of an assemblyman's aide.

91
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,856
Chairman Lee Dae-ho of Eunseong Group

92
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,150
-put company funds in an illegal PE fund.
-Damn it!

93
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,194
And in order to obtain information on
the Cheongwon City redevelopment project,

94
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,196
he solicited favors from Ha Gee-wan,

95
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,657
a former assemblyman
and the current FSS director.

96
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,867
FINALE

97
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,004
Everything will be okay.

98
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,756
I'll see you on the set.

99
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,432
You know, I came here today

100
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,809
ready to expose everything.

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,729
That's bold of you.

102
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,898
Chairman Lee Dae-ho

103
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,151
will stay out of sight for a while.

104
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,321
Things will get quite messy for some time.

105
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,656
I'm ready for it,

106
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,283
so you should brace yourself.

107
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,287
Well, both of you.

108
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,417
Oh, by the way…

109
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,586
Thank you.

110
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,359
You did great.

111
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,197
I'm kind of worried, though,

112
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,199
now that your face has been exposed.

113
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,577
I know, right?

114
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,080
Everyone saw my pretty face
on live national TV.

115
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,540
I'm sure it caused a stir.

116
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,878
What? I'm serious.

117
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,882
I'm more worried about you, though.

118
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,801
We did all that
while Kang Pil-gu is still on air.

119
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,054
You're talking to Lim Hyeon-jun.

120
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,558
I'm Kang Pil-gu, the symbol of justice.

121
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,026
We did the right thing today.

122
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,987
People will acknowledge it.

123
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,493
Shall we go?

EUNSEONG GROUP CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO
ARRESTED FOR ILLEGAL PE FUND

127
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,054
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO ARRESTED
IS THIS THE FALL OF EUNSEONG GROUP?

128
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,140
TURMOIL IN THE EUNSEONG FAMILY,
ALL EYES ON WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL

129
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,643
Hey, it's Chairman Lee Dae-ho!

130
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,023
Do you admit to the allegations
made so far?

131
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,194
-Do you feel any remorse?
-Anything to say to the public?

132
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,154
Any comment
on the prosecution's investigation?

133
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,532
Can we get a statement?

134
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,575
Do you have any comments on the slush fund

135
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,494
tied to the Cheongwon City
redevelopment project?

136
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,169
Lim Hyeon-jun helped this woman
expose Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

137
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,964
During a Kang Pil-gu season five
promotion segment, no less.

138
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,924
Now, why do you think
he helped this woman?

139
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:06,148
Remember when Lim Hyeon-jun said
he liked someone at the press conference?

140
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,774
Everyone was barking up the wrong tree

141
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,609
when it was really Wi Jeong-sin all along.

142
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,363
Does that mean she used her boyfriend
to take down Chairman Lee?

143
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,073
Not just the chairman.

144
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,826
Kang Pil-gu and Gwon Se-na
both took a hit.

145
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,412
I heard Lim Hyeon-jun faces billions
in penalties for breaking ad contracts.

146
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,664
Man, he's done for now.

147
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,584
Wi Jeong-sin is the only one
who benefited from it all.

148
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,710
She got an exclusive,

149
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,712
made a name for herself,
and even has Mr. Lee in her corner.

150
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,006
So none of you knew about this?

151
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,049
Of course not.

152
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,967
Wow, she's really something.

153
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,274
Can you ring me up?

154
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,650
Sure thing.

155
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,195
Excuse me.

156
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,863
Can I take that?

157
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,325
Sure, go ahead.

158
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:14,925
LIM HYEON-JUN, SIGNATURE

159
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,804
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

160
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,526
You're Kang Pil-gu, right?

161
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,070
Yes, that's me.

162
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,284
Seeing how you're
putting the building up for a quick sale,

163
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,911
I take it you need cash quickly.

164
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,915
Yes, I guess so.

165
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,470
Stop polishing it.

166
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,140
The car's already sold,
so what are you shining it up for?

167
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,436
Come on, if it looks nice and pretty,
the new owner will treat it better.

168
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,229
This is so frustrating.

169
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,648
Hey, enough with the sighing.

170
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,150
It's my car I'm selling, not yours!

171
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,860
And it's my building
I'm selling, not yours.

172
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,155
Did Ms. Wi know things would get this bad
when she started all this?

173
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,825
How many times do I have to tell you
I'm the one who asked her to go on TV?

174
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:22,826
I'm glad you brought that up.

175
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,703
You're not a reporter, she is.

176
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,289
Thanks to that damn live broadcast,

177
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,999
our company got raided,

178
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,877
and you had to sell your building and car
to cover the ad contract penalties!

179
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,671
And what about Kang Pil-gu now?

180
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:39,176
Jeez, if people enjoy Kang Pil-gu,
the ratings will bounce back.

181
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,929
And the ad deals will come back
once my public image is restored.

182
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,393
It won't be long
before people find out the truth.

183
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,979
I'm sure of it.

184
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,151
Why couldn't you just wait until
the drama was over to release the article?

185
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,527
Why do it while it's still airing?

186
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,238
The ratings are low as they are.

187
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,032
Why couldn't you just promote it
like you were told?

188
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,742
Hey, it did help promote the show.

189
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,701
It caused a buzz, no?

190
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,744
No.

191
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,370
Oh, really?

192
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,502
Why didn't you talk him out of it, Ms. Wi?

193
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,423
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can say.

194
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,635
How's…

195
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,720
Mr. Lim doing?

196
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,138
He's going through a lot.

197
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,390
He's selling off his building and car

198
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,975
and took out a mortgage on his home

199
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,478
to pay the penalties
for breaking his ad contracts.

200
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,189
Are the penalties that steep?

201
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,900
With that being said,

202
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,985
about the article you promised to release.

203
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,737
Could you get it out as soon as possible?

204
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,866
Article releases are all about timing.

205
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,786
If we release it immediately,

206
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,914
people will accuse Mr. Lim
of trying to avoid responsibility.

207
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,876
I suggest we hold off and publish it
when things are at their worst.

208
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,212
That way, public opinion
will turn dramatically.

209
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,338
Will it, though?

210
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,215
Money is one thing.

211
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,884
But his public image as an actor
has taken too much of a hit,

212
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,928
and he's no longer getting
any new project offers.

213
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,012
At this rate,

214
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,598
we might just end up
running a print shop again.

215
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,107
He's selling off his building and car

216
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,567
and took out a mortgage on his home

217
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,277
to pay the penalties
for breaking his ad contracts.

218
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,883
[EUNSEONGILBO] RECRUITMENT NOTICE:
SERIA TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT

219
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,932
How are you holding up, Ms. Wi?

220
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,059
Yes, I'm fine.

221
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,770
Everyone's asking to confirm
your relationship with Lim Hyeon-jun.

222
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,940
In fact, why don't you let us
write about your dating rumor?

223
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,567
I know I'll do a good job.

224
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,776
Jeez.

225
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,861
What?

226
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,240
Mr. Lee.

227
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,910
I saw the Seria
temporary assignment notice.

228
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,037
Has the position been filled?

229
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,165
No, I believe no one has applied yet.

230
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,542
Then I'll go.

231
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,127
-What?
-No, you can't do that.

232
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,005
If you're worried about
going straight to the political desk--

233
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,923
It has nothing to do with that.

234
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,884
It's fine if I never go back.

235
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,969
Then why do you insist on going
to that dangerous place?

236
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,390
If I let things go on like this,

237
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:36,394
everyone will assume all the rumors
about Mr. Lim are true.

238
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,105
The dating rumor will break out
no matter what we do,

239
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,484
and Chairman Lee Dae-ho's case
will get overshadowed and ignored.

240
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,569
It may never fully come to light.

241
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,281
You both know that the media
is already trying to spin this.

242
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,575
Even so, you going to Seria

243
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,661
won't resolve anything.

244
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,578
You're right.

245
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,374
But it'll at least shut down
the dating rumor.

246
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,875
That way,

247
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,753
things will settle faster.

248
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,572
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

249
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
Why is it so hard to get hold of you?

250
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,455
Is something wrong?

251
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,417
You have it worse than I do, Mr. Lim.

252
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,003
I heard filming has resumed.

253
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,880
Aren't you busy?

254
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,049
Exactly. I'm the one who's busy,

255
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,802
so why is it so hard to reach you?

256
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,761
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,097
Do you have some time?

258
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,307
Of course, I do!

259
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,436
-Jeez, where are we going?
-Just come. Hurry up.

260
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,563
It's right here.

261
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,606
-We're here.
-A video arcade?

262
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,486
Look, it's Kang Pil-gu!

263
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,530
You have to lower the claw
around the body.

264
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,031
-Come on.
-Have you never done this before?

265
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,538
-Darn it!
-Come on.

266
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,458
-It's all about accuracy. Try again.
-Okay.

267
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,626
Yes, right there. Just a bit more…

268
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,088
-No, I got it!
-You have to aim higher!

269
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,382
Just trust me. Right now!

270
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,178
Oh, come on!

271
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,930
Seriously?

272
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,724
Don't do that.

273
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,435
Jeez, this is how you do it.

274
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,027
Yes!

275
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,875
Why is this place so empty?

276
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,210
I rented out the whole place.

277
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,170
What?

278
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,215
I can't rent out a place for free
like you can,

279
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,967
but adults are at work,
and students are at school

280
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,385
on a weekday like this.

281
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,471
So I rented it at a low price.

282
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,307
Why did you spend money on this?

283
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,434
Let's go and take some photos.
There's a booth over there.

284
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:23,978
Let's go.

285
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,898
Right, photos are what last.

286
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:31,861
Smile!

287
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,203
-Me?
-Here you go.

288
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,955
There.

289
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,540
Smile!

290
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,210
Try these on too.

291
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,591
Smile!

292
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,470
Smile!

293
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,562
LIM HYEON-JUN & WI JEONG-SIN

294
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,693
Here.

295
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,079
Man, it's been ages since I've had
ramyeon at a convenience store.

296
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,747
So I guess you're fine with this.

297
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,167
You grumbled so much
when we had ramyeon at the Hangang River.

298
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,505
Only teenagers come here to eat ramyeon

299
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,923
and make memories over it.

300
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,301
I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

301
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,137
I tend to grumble even if I'm happy.

302
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,764
I really enjoyed that day, you know.

303
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,194
What about today?

304
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:56,863
Did you enjoy it too?

305
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,575
You said what you envied the most
was an ordinary life.

306
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,370
That's why I wanted to
spend an ordinary day with you,

307
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,747
just like everyone else.

308
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,291
So how was it? Did you enjoy it?

309
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,876
It couldn't have been better.

310
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,210
It was a date, after all.

311
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:15,965
The truth is…

312
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,843
there's something I need to tell you.

313
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,971
Seria?

314
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,556
You're going to a war zone?

315
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,766
Are you insane?

316
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,477
I know it's dangerous,
but I've been there before--

317
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,437
Exactly, you've been there already!

318
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,897
So why go back to a war zone?

319
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,315
To return to the political desk.

320
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,402
Also,

321
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,822
did you even consider me
when you made that decision?

322
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,785
Is that why
you took me to the arcade today?

323
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,161
Are you some cruel mom

324
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,789
who takes her kid to the park
before abandoning him?

325
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,458
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

326
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,085
A cruel mom who abandons her kid?

327
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,753
How could you say that to me?

328
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,588
I wanted us to have a good time,

329
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,924
so I spent all day thinking about
how to make it enjoyable for us.

330
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,927
Why would you dismiss the effort I put in?

331
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,429
Why are you getting angry at me?

332
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,430
So you think

333
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,432
pulling a stunt
like going to Seria was smart?

334
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,475
"Pulling a stunt"?

335
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,935
Of course, it's a stunt!

336
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,312
Are you showing off
or just being reckless?

337
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,648
How does it make any sense for you to say

338
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,692
that you're going back there again?

339
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,695
Do I look like someone
who would go there just to show off?

340
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,739
I'm going there to work, not to have fun!

341
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,616
I don't get it.

342
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,536
Why are you doing this?

343
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,705
You don't have to go!

344
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,665
But I do.

345
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,044
It's already been decided.

346
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,467
Come on!

347
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,761
Damn it!

348
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,224
But why…

349
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,351
You don't have to go.

350
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,103
I mean…

351
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,908
Seriously!

352
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,535
Go.

353
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,954
Just go! Leave!

354
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,752
Don't you ever call me again!

355
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:16,669
If you do, I'll…

356
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,558
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF
MONEY LAUNDERING, SOLICITING MURDER…

357
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,164
GWON SE-NA

358
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,292
WOO YOUNG-SUK, AIDE

359
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,419
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO

360
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,583
LIM HYEON-JUN

361
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,652
You don't have to go!

362
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,154
But I do.

363
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,199
It's already been decided.

364
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,249
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin?

365
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,628
May I have a moment of your time?

366
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,809
It's the first time in my life.

367
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,436
I've never liked someone…

368
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,481
so unconditionally.

369
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,295
I like you.

370
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,510
I haven't liked anyone
for a very long time.

371
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:55,930
But…

372
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,267
I have a feeling I'll like you…

373
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,020
for a long time to come.

374
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,317
Are you okay?

375
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,660
Did you even consider me
when you made that decision?

376
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,453
Are you some cruel mom

377
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,664
who takes her kid to the park
before abandoning them!

378
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,667
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

379
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,506
So how was it? Did you enjoy it?

380
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,133
It couldn't have been better.

381
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:33,759
It was a date, after all.

382
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,182
Even so, you going to Seria

383
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,059
won't resolve anything.

384
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,022
If I let things go on like this,

385
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,401
everyone will assume all the rumors
about Mr. Lim are true.

386
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,839
LIM HYEON-JUN

387
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:36,947
If you go, when will you be back?

388
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,200
I don't know for sure yet.

389
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,995
How can you not know that?

390
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,538
Then what am I supposed to do?

391
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,589
Don't you hate me?

392
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,925
You lost all your ad deals,

393
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,177
and even your reputation hit rock bottom.

394
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,805
I was the one who suggested it.
Why do you keep talking like it's on you?

395
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,310
You can't possibly be okay.

396
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,980
On top of all those articles
attacking you personally…

397
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,943
even Kang Pil-gu is getting criticized.

398
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:15,945
I don't regret what I did.

399
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,744
I'm sorry about earlier.

400
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:25,913
For getting mad at you.

401
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,874
I was the one who raised my voice first.

402
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:31,627
I'm sorry.

403
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,967
So you're not mad at me anymore?

404
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,053
I was never mad at you.

405
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,351
I'll wait for you.

406
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,648
-Mr. Lim--
-No.

407
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,317
Waiting for you is my choice.

408
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,153
You made your own choice to leave too.

409
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,283
You're leaving the day after tomorrow?

410
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,160
Yes.

411
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,330
That's the last day of shooting
for Kang Pil-gu, right?

412
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,879
Then today's our last day.

413
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,258
Why would you say that?

414
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,801
Like we'll never see each other again?

415
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,646
Take care while I'm gone, okay?

416
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,427
What if I begged you not to go?

417
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,306
Would you still leave?

418
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,769
Yes.

419
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,465
Move that over there.

420
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,395
LIM HYEON-JUN & WI JEONG-SIN

421
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:01,986
Hey, can you bring that over?

422
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,072
-Hey.
-Where does this go?

423
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:05,990
Bro.

424
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:07,950
It's time to finish up your makeup.

425
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,285
Okay.

426
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,161
Jeez.

427
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,872
Ms. Wi must be on her way
to the airport by now.

428
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,083
Let's go.

429
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,632
I said I'd come with you.

430
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,467
Forget it. Give me that.

431
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,764
Take care of yourself.

432
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,517
If you get hurt like last time,
I won't make it.

433
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,643
Okay, I heard you.

434
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,071
-Hello.
-Hello.

435
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,699
Mr. Lim couldn't come,
so he asked me to take you to the airport.

436
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,326
No, that's okay.

437
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,994
Ms. Wi, if you don't get in,

438
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:52,911
I'll get fired.

439
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,379
I'll get in, then.

440
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:03,339
Thank you.

441
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,544
What am I going to do?

442
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,213
Cut. Okay!

443
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:37,808
Mr. Lim, that was great.

444
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,102
Huh?

445
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,230
Here.

446
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,900
All right, that's a wrap
for Good Detective Kang Pil-gu Season 5.

447
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,318
Thank you for all your hard work.

448
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,528
Thank you!

449
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,618
-Mr. Lim.
-Yeah?

450
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,787
Thank you for all your hard work.

451
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,207
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

452
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,876
I mean it.

453
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,253
Come on, Mr. Lim. Stop that.

454
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,255
Byeong-gi…

455
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,967
Mr. Lim, your acting today was phenomenal.

456
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,471
Thank you.

457
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,556
-Great work.
-You too.

458
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,487
Bro!

459
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,155
Look.

460
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:35,032
Look at this.

461
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,618
LIM HYEON-JUN & GWON SE-NA
ALREADY CUT TIES WITH CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO

462
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,914
-Oh, it's been published.
-Ms. Wi really is something.

463
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,916
She'd been thinking a step ahead

464
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,918
to make a move
and turn the situation around.

465
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,422
The advertisers have been
calling nonstop to apologize.

466
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,342
When Ms. Wi said
we should donate our shares,

467
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,052
what was your response again?

468
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,930
Once Chairman Lee Dae-ho is exposed,

469
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,723
it could cause a big problem
for the company

470
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,225
and for both of you as well.

471
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:02,976
So I was thinking…

472
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,270
How about we do this?

473
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,271
Do what?

474
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,857
The two of you will take
all of your company shares

475
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,235
-and donate them.
-Sure.

476
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,278
-What?
-Let's do it.

477
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,197
Come on, let's do it.

478
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,200
You want us to donate our shares?

479
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,118
-Like, all of it?
-Yes.

480
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,620
Where should we donate it?

481
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,289
What do you mean,
"Where should we donate it?"

482
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,707
I can't do that!

483
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,709
Come on.

484
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,254
I donated it all anyway.

485
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,382
Anyway, Ms. Wi saved us both.

486
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,550
Right?

487
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,093
But I wonder why

488
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,011
she released the article
under Ms. Yun's name.

489
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,346
Because it'd look too set up?

490
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,854
How could we possibly read into
Ms. Wi's master plan?

491
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,150
By the way, I looked into that thing.

492
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,987
There was an issue with
how your dismissal as CEO was handled.

493
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,572
So you can actually be reinstated.

494
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,156
-Seriously?
-Quiet.

495
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,658
Hey, keep it down.

496
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,035
-Seriously?
-Yes, but…

497
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,788
Since you don't own a single share
of company stock,

498
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,540
you could get fired at any time.

499
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,710
So do a good job, okay?

500
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,711
Got it?

501
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:12,796
Okay.

502
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,340
KANG PIL-GU SEASON 5
VIEWERSHIP RATINGS

503
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,466
RATINGS EXCEED 20%
A TRIUMPHANT FINALE

504
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,426
A SLOW START,
BUT SOARS TO 20.6%!

505
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,510
THE KANG PIL-GU CREW
IS REWARDED PAID VACATION AGAIN!!

506
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:19,761
KANG PIL-GU 5 CONCLUDES
WITH RECORD RATINGS

507
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,430
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

508
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,057
As this is said to be
the final season of Kang Pil-gu,

509
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,601
the viewers are deeply disappointed.

510
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,060
Is it truly over?

511
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,187
Yes.

512
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,480
That's the case for now.

513
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,650
It can't continue
just because I want it to.

514
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:35,736
But…

515
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,780
if there's a chance down the road,

516
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,159
I'd love to meet Kang Pil-gu again.

517
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:46,955
Wow.

518
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,375
Deep down,

519
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,628
I already miss him.

520
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,341
Well, Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

521
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,052
Is there anyone else that you miss
or would like to see right now?

522
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:02,596
Yes.

523
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,142
There is.

524
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,705
AT NUNGNAE STATION

525
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,709
A PLACE WHERE LONGING GATHERS LIKE SNOW

526
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,005
AND TENDER GREETINGS GATHER
LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES

527
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:35,480
If you'd like, I can share
a simple feel-good method.

528
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,693
Go outside on a sunny day
and simply stand there.

529
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:40,861
That's it?

530
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:43,155
After standing for a while,

531
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,615
your head will start to feel warm
from the sunshine.

532
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,993
When that happens,

533
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,537
it feels like someone
is gently stroking your head.

534
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,212
It feels warm.

535
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,478
Kang Pil-gu is

536
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:18,190
really, really special.

537
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:22,027
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

538
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,154
How lucky is that?

539
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,710
Wow, what's this?

540
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,754
-What's all this?
-Goodness.

541
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,255
-You're back already?
-Yes.

542
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,466
I was going to leave
right after making dinner,

543
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,676
but I forgot to make you soup.

544
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,844
What kind of soup?

545
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,429
Oh, seaweed soup.

546
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,098
That sounds delicious.

547
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,891
Sit down. Let's eat together.

548
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,727
-Together?
-Yes.

549
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,070
So, is that nice lady reporter

550
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,404
still not back from Seria yet?

551
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,407
How do you know her?

552
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:11,535
Oh, well…

553
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,787
I came by once

554
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,040
and found her here
while she was recovering from the flu.

555
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:17,958
I see.

556
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,837
Mom, you didn't
say anything weird, did you?

557
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,422
Of course I didn't.

558
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,760
When she gets back,

559
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,637
could you introduce me to her?

560
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,185
Okay.

561
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,311
Really?

562
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,688
Yeah.

563
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,232
I'll bring the soup.

564
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,953
Can you please stop nagging me?

565
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,539
I told you I couldn't call
because I lost my phone.

566
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,708
Are you sure you're not lying?

567
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,042
I'm not lying.

568
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,420
I had a hard time
borrowing this phone to call you.

569
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,046
Are you badly hurt?

570
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,466
I was told your injury was pretty severe.

571
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,384
I'm fine.

572
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,844
Get better and come home.

573
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,555
Is there anything you want to eat
when you return?

574
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:15,724
It'll be my treat.

575
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,616
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

576
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,120
Gosh, she's heartless.

577
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,706
She hasn't texted me once.

578
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,221
WI JEONG-SIN

579
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:19,537
She's so cute.

580
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:25,961
You were adorable.

581
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,598
My phone!

582
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,939
Oh, man.

583
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,236
It's on.

584
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,237
It's working.

585
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,581
It's working.

586
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:09,838
LIM HYEON-JUN

587
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,506
HOW ARE YOU? THE WEATHER IS NICE HERE.
COME BACK SOON.

588
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,174
I WENT TO THE HANGANG RIVER TODAY.
I MISS YOU.

589
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,980
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, RIGHT?
I'LL TELL MYSELF THAT NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS

590
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,494
ONION

591
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,251
MELOMASTER
A LONELY SINGLE KANG PIL-GU SOCK

592
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:00,347
I found a single Kang Pil-gu sock
all by itself in Hannam-dong.

593
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,182
It's being kept safe at the moment.

594
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,268
If you have lost it,
please contact me promptly

595
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:08,063
and rescue this Pil-gu sock
from loneliness.

596
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,648
I can be reached anytime.

597
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,649
However,

598
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,860
transactions are strictly in person.

599
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,278
PRICE: 1,000,000 WON

600
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,037
This is hilarious.

601
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:28,833
It's too much.

602
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,406
Huh?

603
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,158
Hey, Seon-u!

604
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,953
Seon-u!

605
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,413
Yeah? What is it?

606
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,123
-Get over here.
-What's going on?

607
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,624
This right here.

608
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,919
This is an email
inviting me to their audition, right?

609
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,172
YOU ARE ONE OF THE
FINAL CANDIDATES FOR THIS ROLE.

610
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,715
OUR PRODUCER, MARK JONES,
WILL BE VISITING SEOUL.

611
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:18,675
Right?

612
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,135
Yeah, you're right.

613
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,346
It's not just an audition.
You're a final candidate.

614
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,517
Hyeon-jun, they're coming to see you!

615
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,484
"For the role of Kevin Kim."

616
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,820
So my name will be Kevin Kim?

617
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:39,988
Onion!

618
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,292
Do you still have the single sock?

619
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:58,673
Yes, I still have it.

620
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:02,969
I think that sock's mine.

621
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,556
I think that Kang Pil-gu sock
belongs to me.

622
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,852
You need to bring
the other sock to verify it.

623
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:11,895
Okay.

624
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:12,937
I'll bring it.

625
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,903
When can we make the transaction?

626
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,863
The poorsock is so lonely,

627
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,157
it's on the verge of depression.

628
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,910
Oh, dear.

629
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,078
I'm overseas at the moment.

630
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,623
How about next month on the 23rd?

631
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,874
The 23rd?

632
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:40,006
The 23rd.

633
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,218
You're making me wait too long.

634
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:44,928
If this deal falls through,

635
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,388
I'm sure the other buyers
will be thrilled.

636
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:48,556
No, wait!

637
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,517
I promise I'll buy it.

638
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,646
SCHEDULE A TRANSACTION

639
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,398
AN APPOINTMENT HAS BEEN BOOKED

640
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,109
Where would you like to meet
for the transaction?

641
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,403
How about the N Seoul Tower?

642
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,821
That sounds good.

643
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,868
I actually had a bad experience
at N Seoul Tower once.

644
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,204
But I want to put it behind me now.

645
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,040
Then meet me on the 23rd at 8 p.m.,

646
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,251
by the love locks at the N Seoul Tower.

647
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,129
You won't send
someone else in your place, will you?

648
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,674
If you're curious, hurry up and come.

649
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,633
Let me look at you.

650
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,344
You didn't get hurt?

651
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:50,928
I missed you.

652
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,142
Didn't you miss me?

653
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,062
Of course, I missed you!

654
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:03,066
Jeez, how could you not text me once?

655
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:07,278
I lost my phone, and something came up.

656
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,656
I'm sorry.

657
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,702
It's okay. I understand.

658
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,915
I've been doing pretty well.

659
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,584
Things aren't as bad for me as I expected.

660
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:25,213
A lot of people told me
that I did what Kang Pil-gu would've done.

661
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,674
I knew it.

662
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,008
It's the truth, after all.

663
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,114
Wait, is it okay for us to be like this?

664
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,616
Stop worrying about what others think.

665
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,326
Who cares what they think?

666
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:14,011
HYEON-JUN & JEONG-SIN

667
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:38,661
Will you be leaving again?

668
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,707
Why? Are you afraid I might?

669
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,708
Hey.

670
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:47,545
I won't let go of your hand
if you go somewhere dangerous again.

671
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:49,756
Where should I go?

672
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:50,673
What?

673
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:52,842
So you'll leave again?

674
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,428
I'm not going anywhere.

675
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:57,138
Are you sure?

676
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,766
-Fine, I'll go then.
-Hey.

677
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,772
Home sweet home.

678
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,565
There's no place like home.

679
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,373
GWON SE-NA ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT
AND LEAVES FOR A FASHION SCHOOL IN THE US

680
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,806
Wow, is this for real?

681
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,475
I can't believe
you're going to be in a Hollywood movie.

682
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,853
All of our effort has finally paid off.

683
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,688
I know, right?

684
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:52,193
Back when we recorded your audition tape
and you were doing lines from Goblin,

685
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,570
I wondered what the hell we were doing.

686
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:57,573
Who would've thought
a day like this would come?

687
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:02,036
They say the road less traveled
is never easy.

688
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,833
By the way, Mr. Hwang.
Why have you been so busy lately?

689
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,167
I never see you around.

690
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,712
He's been really busy because of Hong-sin.

691
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,089
"But I do!"

692
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,842
Very nice.
Raise the handcuffs a bit higher.

693
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,094
Let's go for a more intense gaze
and a different pose.

694
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,180
-That's great.
-Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

695
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,348
Right, King's Back does need

696
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,560
a new actor to follow in the footsteps
of Lim Hyeon-jun.

697
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,063
Speaking of which, Seon-u…

698
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,608
He's holding up as an intern right now.
He won't turn to acting again, will he?

699
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,777
Of course not!

700
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:38,114
He's too busy with his internship
at the hospital.

701
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,157
Please save him!

702
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,285
Secure his airway
and get ready to intubate him.

703
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,786
The intubation kit is ready.

704
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,580
I have to say, he's really smart.

705
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,749
He realized his path early on
and went for it.

706
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,919
He's smart because he takes after me.

707
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,422
By the way, I saw you reading a script.

708
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,548
Was it for me?

709
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,010
The thing is,

710
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,805
we did get a streaming series script, but…

711
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,393
Gosh, how do I explain this?

712
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:09,937
It's just that…

713
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,732
-Let's see it.
-Yeah.

714
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,817
It's titled Double Investigation.

715
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,445
And it's another detective series, I know.

716
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,281
I read it too
and thought it was really good.

717
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,657
It's really good.

718
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,118
So a detective?

719
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,536
Me, as a detective?

720
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,706
Yes, you'd play a detective,
but it's a really good…

721
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,041
-It's good.
-It is.

722
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,083
Like, totally.

723
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,418
It's totally good.

724
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,212
It's total…

725
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,799
These TV station guys are total jerks!

726
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,885
He was great as Kang Pil-gu,
but they can't keep giving him

727
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,346
-the same old detective roles!
-Right.

728
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,014
We should just tear this script apart.

729
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,891
No, let me see it.

730
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,684
No, I'm so offended right now.

731
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,895
I mean, it is a really good story!

732
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,313
But we need to tear it up!

733
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,399
-Fine, I heard you. Give it to me.
-Why?

734
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:57,318
Not all detectives are the same.

735
00:53:58,194 --> 00:53:59,528
I'm a different kind of detective.

736
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,155
I'll give it a read.

737
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,452
Bro, you've totally changed.

738
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,496
Hey, should I ask Mr. Bak

739
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,706
to write a new season of Kang Pil-gu?

740
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,793
I think he's busy writing something else.

741
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,171
"Like a scene from a painting,

742
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,007
their silhouettes
fade into the city lights…"

743
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,218
THE END

744
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,970
NICE TO NOT MEET YOU
SCRIPT

745
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,847
"A connection destined by fate,
born from a rice cooker transaction."

746
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,058
What kind of nonsense is this?

747
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,685
Come on, Mr. Son.

748
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,728
The buzzword these days is "harmlessness."

749
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,397
I've moved on from crime stories

750
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,816
to ones that are
lighthearted and harmless.

751
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:39,944
It only makes sense
that a script that's written by you

752
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:44,323
has cars flipping left and right
and metal pipes flying everywhere.

753
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:45,992
But "Nice to Not Meet You"?

754
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,494
Jeez, even the title is tacky.

755
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:50,454
It's retro.

756
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,665
And what about the cast?

757
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,543
Who'd want to be in a rom-com
written by the writer of Kang Pil-gu?

758
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,460
Kang Pil-gu himself?

759
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,171
That's not a bad idea.

760
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,518
Be careful when you're running.

761
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,436
Okay.

762
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,314
Here.

763
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,402
FAMILY RELATIONSHIP CERTIFICATE

764
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,653
WIFE: YUN HWA-YEONG, CHILD: LEE JAE-HA

765
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,950
It looks like
Yun Jae-ha is now Lee Jae-ha.

766
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,121
It makes me a little sad.

767
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:34,665
It's like you've stolen my son.

768
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,335
He's my son, too, you know.

769
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,258
Don't be so sad.

770
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,802
You got yourself
an amazing husband in return.

771
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:49,805
You're right.

772
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,312
-Jae-ha.
-Yes?

773
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,355
-Are you having fun?
-Yes.

774
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,360
Here, I'll do it for you.

775
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,622
Hey, Su-ji. Are you sleeping?

776
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,623
Of course not.

777
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,584
I'm awake at all times for you, Mr. Lim.

778
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,134
There's a woman I'd like to propose to.

779
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,302
Who's this skank?

780
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:32,640
-What?
-I'm just kidding.

781
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,266
Please continue.

782
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,522
There's a woman I really like.

783
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,233
What would be
the best way to propose to her?

784
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:47,863
Su-ji?

785
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,741
-Su-ji?
-I didn't quite get that.

786
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:51,992
Hey, Su-ji!

787
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,285
What's wrong with her?

788
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,126
Why are you suddenly playing trot music?

789
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,045
Hey, Su-ji!

790
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,755
Su-ji…

791
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,766
"ASK ME ANYTHING"

792
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,019
Give me a dramatic

793
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:23,065
and fail-proof idea to propose to someone.

794
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,610
The key element is sincerity.

795
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:29,363
How about expressing your feelings

796
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,198
in a place where they felt most genuine?

797
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:32,116
If you would like,

798
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,827
I can give you step-by-step instructions.

799
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,289
Wow.

800
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:40,791
You understand me right away.

801
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,503
All right,
walk me through it step by step.

802
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,739
Did you see the article this morning?

803
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,658
Well, it was bound to happen.

804
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,996
The chief called me and gave me an earful.

805
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,289
Hey, Wi Jeong-sin.

806
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,373
Have you lost your mind?

807
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:23,709
How could you let another outlet
publish this exclusive?

808
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,879
Come on, don't let it bother you.

809
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,047
Don't worry about it.

810
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,716
I dreamed of coming back to Korea

811
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,720
and sitting on a park bench like this,
basking in the sun as much as I wanted.

812
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:36,639
I love it.

813
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,432
And I'm right here, next to you.

814
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,226
Right in front of me, too.

815
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,733
I thought it'd be a huge deal

816
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,611
if an ordinary person like me
dated an actor.

817
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:53,322
-But it really isn't.
-Of course, it's not.

818
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,825
Why was I so intimidated
by the idea back then?

819
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:58,786
Somebody once said

820
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,163
that it's the simple,
everyday life that saves us.

821
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:06,919
Life is easiest
when it's simple and calm like this.

822
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,421
What else is there in life?

823
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,340
The greatest happiness
is just being comfortable.

824
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:13,550
Wow, that's lame.

825
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:17,805
Shall we walk?

826
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:33,445
Catch me if you can!

827
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,246
SEONGIL STATION

828
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,458
Jeez, what's taking them so long?

829
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,672
I'm sure they'll find me on their own.

830
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,215
Wow, it's that scene now.

831
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,758
-Onion!
-"Onion"?

832
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:58,762
Onion?

833
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,194
You're here from Onion, right?

834
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:15,362
What?

835
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,406
Oh, that's right. Onion.

836
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,365
Is this it?

837
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,369
I just sent you 320,000 won
through Onion Pay.

838
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:24,371
Excuse me?

839
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:25,914
How was I supposed to know what that is?

840
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,710
I'm a fan of Seo U-jin.

841
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,087
-Thank you.
-All right, then.

842
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,298
Excuse me.

843
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,347
Do you like Seo U-jin?

844
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,892
Do you like…

845
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:47,311
Lim Hyeon-jun?

846
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,771
Yes, I do.

847
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,816
It's the first time in my life.

848
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:56,195
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

849
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:02,284
Why did you tell him about this part?

850
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:03,577
-Why not?
-I can't…

851
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,787
Could you keep it down?

852
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:05,704
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

853
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,459
Hey, it's Lim Hyeon-jun.

854
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,169
-Really?
-It's Lim Hyeon-jun.

855
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,254
It's Lim Hyeon-jun!
