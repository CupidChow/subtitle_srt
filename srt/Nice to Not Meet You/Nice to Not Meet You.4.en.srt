00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051

00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,637
[anxious music playing]

3
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,156
[chuckles]

4
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,117
[knock on door]

5
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:27,880
[music stops]

6
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,507
Would you like to see the menu, sir?

7
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,135
Ah, uh… [chuckles] …yeah, thanks.

8
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:37,973
-Good work, everyone!
-[clamoring]

9
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,017
Great session, thank you.
Nice to see you all!

10
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,062
-Have a great week, I'll see you soon!
-[student] Wanna grab a coffee?

11
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,563
[sighs]

12
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,568
I wonder how it's going. Funny,
my sister's the one on a blind date,

13
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,987
-so why do I have butterflies?
-[chuckles]

14
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,198
I hope it goes well, brother-in-law.
Don't you?

15
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,449
Sure.

16
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,536
Hey, your sister is
strong mentally, right?

17
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,620
Any heart issues?

18
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,580
The Ukraine war, for example,

19
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,123
the Israel-Palestine conflict.

20
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,377
It's frightening that the world is
becoming desensitized to these wars.

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,713
No one seems to realize that the world
order which was once very stable,

22
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,340
is now coming apart.

23
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,968
And that's the reason
there have been so many

24
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,803
-World War III predictions.
-Sorry, I just…

25
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,848
I was under the impression
you're a flight attendant,

26
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,350
but… [scoffs] …you seem
really interested in world politics.

27
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,643
Flight attendant?

28
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,729
A stewardess?

29
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,317
[inhales sharply] Oh, wait.
Aren't you a detective?

30
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,278
A detective?

31
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,072
No. No, I'm a civil servant.

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,866
-I work at City Hall.
-Civil…

33
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,118
Aren't you a flight attendant
with Asia Airlines?

34
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,953
-You think that I…
-[knock on door]

35
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,749
[comedic music playing]

36
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,051
[music stops]

37
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,512
God. [chuckles]

38
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,473
I've got no sympathy for women
who show up late to a date.

39
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,933
Seriously!

40
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,351
She calls herself a journalist.

41
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,937
Since when are journalists
so frickin' late?

42
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,690
You wanna leave a good first impression
on a blind date.

43
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,942
[sighs] Look at the clock. This is insane!

44
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,111
Well, we've found out
why the girl's single.

45
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,530
And I didn't get any contact info.

46
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,824
So, what am I supposed to do here?

47
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,701
Seon-u, what the hell? Should I just go?

48
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,245
Ah, shit!

49
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,749
[Jeong-sin] Can you let that guy know
I'm running late because of traffic?

50
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,585
-Wait, you haven't met him yet?
-This is why I should've gotten his cell.

51
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,421
I ended up in a room with some man
who works at City Hall.

52
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,797
Ugh, later!

53
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,549
-Not helping one bit.
-[phone beeps]

54
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,344
[sighs] Well, that started off wrong.

55
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,805
What is it? So, they haven't even met yet?

56
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,351
No, she told me she got stuck in traffic
and she's gonna be like half an hour late.

57
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,269
-Can you call your brother?
-Sure.

58
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,650
You said she might be surprised
when she meets him.

59
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,984
What does that mean?

60
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,361
Oh, that.

61
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,322
Uh, yeah, there's this one thing
about my brother.

62
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,823
Huh?

63
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,908
[laughs]

64
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,994
Seriously, that's the lamest
excuse possible.

65
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,872
Wow, the traffic is just so terrible.

66
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,501
Wow, I gotta give it to her.
That's ruthless.

67
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,211
[scoffs] Seriously.

68
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,630
[breathes deeply]

69
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:18,968
Yeah?

70
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:23,973
Oh.

71
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,558
[enchanting music playing]

72
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,604
Uh…

73
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,153
[heartbeat thumping]

74
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,125
You? Uh.

75
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,626
[music fades]

76
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,796
Uh, what are you doing here?

77
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,716
Did I just walk into the wrong room again?

78
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,344
I hear he looks a lot like my bro Pil-gu.

79
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,388
Lim Hyeon-jun.

80
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,308
-[echoing] Lim Hyeon-jun.
-[chuckles]

81
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,145
Hello?

82
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,107
You don't remember?

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,401
[stammers] Remember?

84
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,532
I think your face does look a little, uh…

85
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,994
familiar. Do I know you?

86
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,540
Journalist. Hanguk University.

87
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,668
[echoing] Journalist.

88
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,171
[shouting, gasping]

89
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,508
What the… [grunts]

90
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,763
-[Seon-u] Are you all right?
-[chuckles] Okay, so…

91
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,931
so, your brother's Lim Hyeon-jun?

92
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,019
And so the man my sister's
on a date with is Kang Pil-gu?

93
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,270
Kang Pil-gu from the show?

94
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,106
See, I wasn't lying
about him being a detective.

95
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,608
[chuckles]

96
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,697
[gasps] Oh, no. This is not good.

97
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,491
What? Why?

98
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,203
God, isn't it such a small world?

99
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,622
-Who would've thought, right?
-You're right.

100
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,874
[knock on door]

101
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,548
-So, are we ready to order?
-Yes.

102
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,925
It's lunchtime anyhow.

103
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,135
-So, I guess we'll take, uh… Yeah.
-Iced Americano, please.

104
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,678
Same here, iced Americano please.

105
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,055
[server] Right away, sir.

106
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,641
Given the situation,

107
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,227
I thought you didn't really want to
have lunch together.

108
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,229
[scoffs] I appreciate you
picking up on that.

109
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,565
[Hong-sin]
I've got this buddy in med school.

110
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,567
His brother's a detective.
Might be a good match.

111
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,695
-I was told you were a detective.
-Kang Pil-gu's a detective.

112
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,197
And he's my alter ego. So…

113
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,365
[sighs]

114
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,408
Are you gonna turn this
into an article too?

115
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,369
"Myself and Actor Lim Hyeon-jun
on a Blind Date."

116
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,621
I'm not petty enough
to write an article like that, all right?

117
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,915
[scoffs] Oh, I don't know.

118
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,876
'Cause I recall
you actually being so petty,

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,379
that you dug through
my social media, because…

120
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,673
you wanted to search my dating history.

121
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,343
I was…

122
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,220
blinded by revenge back then.

123
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,431
[sighs] Well, thank you
for admitting that.

124
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,936
Anyway, as I understand it
our brothers are friends.

125
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,521
So, is your brother also in med school?

126
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,440
No, my brother's a theater major.

127
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,735
A theater major? Really?

128
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,613
If my bro Pil-gu finds out where we met,

129
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,240
he's definitely gonna lose it.

130
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,741
It's a cruel world, isn't it?

131
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,952
[both sigh]

132
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,830
Brother's in theater.
Is that somehow a problem for you?

133
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,040
Not at all.

134
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,377
That doesn't mean I like him
hanging out with my little brother.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,671
-It's not his fault.
-You don't like your med-student

136
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,548
hanging around a wild child
like my brother.

137
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,883
I suppose you must feel insecure

138
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,218
because your brother
doesn't do well in school.

139
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,803
-[scoffs]
-[chuckles]

140
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,266
Whatever, I'm not sure if it's fate
which brought us together here.

141
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,935
-But it's pretty weird.
-[scoffs] Did you say fate?

142
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,146
So, I guess it's best
if we just go our separate ways?

143
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,689
You got that right.

144
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,984
Wait, I'm going first.

145
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,239
[thunder rumbles]

146
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,033

[sighs heavily]

151
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,194
Where's she going?
She doesn't even have an umbrella?

152
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,863
I don't care. Whatever, do your thing.

153
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,745
[comedic music playing]

154
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,754
Oh, no. She's getting soaked.

155
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,257
Just look at that new dress,
it's completely wet.

156
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,593
There are taxis all around.
Why doesn't she get a taxi? Come on.

157
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,891
Huh?

158
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,435
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

159
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,980
Go ahead. Yeah, get an umbrella.

160
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,859

[music continues]

162
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,206
Come on, just get it.

163
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,001
Just buy a frickin' umbrella.
They're so cheap here.

164
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,968
No, she shouldn't be running around
like that after the surgery!

165
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,594
Her stomach must be hurting.

166
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,722
[sighs]

167
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,766
Okay then, I'll give her a ride.

168
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,105

-[music fades]

172
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,364
[Hong-sin] Hey, there.

173
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,408
-Whoa, easy!
-What did you say?

174
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,202
-I can trust you completely?
-Hey, calm down!

175
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,703
Seriously, calm down, sis.

176
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,247
I swear, I had no idea
his brother was Pil-gu.

177
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,000
He said if you swap contact info
or photos beforehand,

178
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,752
it's easy to find
each other's social media.

179
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,379
And it takes away from the excitement.

180
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,048
I didn't know he was trying to hide
his brother's identity.

181

183
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,232
You wanna tell me how the date went?

184
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,692
-How do you think, genius?
-[chuckles]

185
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,529
Well, you walked in looking all beautiful
and Pil-gu fell for you

186
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,197
-the moment he laid eyes on you.
-What?

187
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,035
I mean, you wrote
a nice article about him.

188
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,620
Not to mention,
the man literally saved you.

189
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,539
-[scoffs]
-I thought you two would really hit off,

190
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,998
you know?

191
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,458
Why are you all wet?

192
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,669
You mean to tell me
he didn't offer you a ride?

193
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,256
[scoffs] And why the hell
would he do that?

194
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,384
Such a shame.

195
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,262
I could've been Pil-gu's brother-in-law.

196
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,847
Okay, stop! [scoffs]

197
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,598
You know what?
I'll show you brother-in-law.

198
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,975
-Come here, you little jerk!
-Stop it!

199
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,018
Why would you hit me?
I'm just trying to help!

200
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,232
[chuckles] I wasn't aware that
you already knew my friend's sister.

201
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,151
Oh, no, we're not discussing that.

202
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,070
Let's talk about
your buddy Hong-sin instead.

203
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,405
Where'd you meet that kid?

204
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,116
-Uh, why?
-Just tell me. Answer the question!

205
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,661
-Why ask, when you already know?
-[scoffs]

206
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,955
So it's true.
You really wanna be an actor?

207
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,083
Have you gone crazy, huh?

208
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,211
I didn't wanna say this
because I feel bad for taking credit.

209
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,506
However, I had to pick up delivery jobs
while I worked at the print shop,

210
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,676
just so you, my smart little brother,
wouldn't miss out on medical school

211
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,136
because we couldn't afford it.

212
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,804
So I pushed myself to keep you going.

213
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,682
-Did you know that?
-I did. Yeah.

214
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,644
I know you paid for those lessons
even though we were poor,

215
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,440
and that you bought me nice clothes so
I wouldn't feel small around my friends.

216
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,275
I'm grateful for you
stepping up like that.

217
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,277
I know it was difficult.

218
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,820
So you knew about that?

219
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,656
Apparently, it didn't stop you
from doing this.

220
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,200
What about Mom?

221
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,284
Sorry for lying.

222
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,453
I just… I really wanna be an actor.

223
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,537
[sighs]

224
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,207
You think it's easy, right?
Because I do it.

225
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,584
Do you even know the amount of people
who wanna be actors

226
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,170
because they have a famous relative,
and then fail?

227
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,047
I don't intend to use your name
to get ahead.

228
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,091
And our relationship
is much better kept hidden.

229
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,637
Being half-brothers
is nothing to brag about.

from that US agency or what?

Oh, man. Hey, did you…

250
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,138
did you read the article Ms. Wi wrote?

251
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,766
It completely tossed out
the bad publicity about you,

252
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,602
including that whole trip thing
and the dating rumors.

253
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,104
-Really?
-Listen, the article's outstanding.

That reporter, she's an amazing talent.

255

She connects to Kang Pil-gu's character
in great detail

256
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,236
and the article's so tasteful.

257

I tell you, man,
this woman is on another level.

258
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,700
So maybe buy her dinner
one of these days to thank her.

then brings me back to life
and plays the hero. [clicks tongue]

I worked with him when I was a rookie.

288
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,031
He verbally abused me.
And I said never again. No.

289
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,908
Then what about, uh, Cha Dong-man?

-Uh.

He's an awful director.

292

get ready for the shoot!

the least of my worries right now!

00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,668
This variety show did a special

348
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,879
on sexy stars from back in the day,
and it was a hit.

349
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,381
So I came up with a feature
on actresses who were sex symbols

350
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,300
back in the seventies and the eighties.

351
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,218
[all gasp]

352
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,263
So I picked the three most important
sex symbols from back then.

353
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,182
Have a look at this.
Everyone knows this film.

354
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,683
The Debauched Woman.

355
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,060
[colleagues chuckle]

356
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,979
Hmm, I still look pretty good.

357
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,024
-Oh.
-What?

358
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,443
I think that woman
is Lim Hyeon-jun's mother.

359
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,197
-Yeah, she was in his hospital room.
-[colleague 1] No way.

360
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,866
[colleague 2] You know, now that you
mention it, I can see the resemblance.

361
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,576
Especially in the eyes and the smile.

362
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,080
-Oh, wow.
-It's definitely there.

363
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,208
-They really do look alike.
-You think he's really her son?

364
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,293
-I can see the resemblance.
-Yeah, I can see it.

365
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,836
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

366
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,381
So you don't know if she's actually
his mother. Am I right?

367
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,549
Hard to tell from just this photo.

368
00:20:58,633 --> 00:20:59,884
I'd need to take a closer look.

369
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,137
[Hwa-yeong] Not much is known
about Lim Hyeon-jun's personal life.

370
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:07,058
But if a former erotic actress
turned out to be his biological mother,

371
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,644
then that would be big news indeed.

372
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,396
Take a closer look.

373
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,481
-Huh?
-Couch it as a feature,

374
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,234
"Uncovering Secrets
of the Entertainment Industry".

375
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,443
Okay, I'm on it.

376
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,197
[Hwa-yeong] Next.

377
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,536
Boss!

378
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,332
What is it? You've got something to say?

379
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,293
I feel like we're bothering
Lim Hyeon-jun a lot lately.

380
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,505
Do you have some kind of grudge
against him?

381
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,632
And if I do? What's the difference?

382
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,509
Is there something going on?

383
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,345
Wait.

384
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,680
Did you guys date?

385
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,851
You're a journalist, come on.
I thought you'd have more imagination.

386
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:54,355
Uh… I'm going to a promotional event
he's doing later.

387
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,149
Don't bother.

388
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,693
Once the story's out, it's gonna be
better to avoid him, I think.

389
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,777
Uh, but…

390
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,114
[sighs]

391
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,827
I heard my outdoor clothing brand ad
went to someone else.

392
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,495
So who is it?

393
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,122
Byeon Woo-seok.

394
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,374
[sighs]

395
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:17,003
This is why I say I should be
doing luxury brand ads instead,

396
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,880
or formal wear,

397
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,340
not making hand hearts
for a ramyeon commercial.

398
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,633
Hey, don't say that.

399
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,303
I mean, your contract was only
for six months and they extended it

400
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,472
and they're paying you more now
than they were before.

401
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,890
You should be grateful for that.

402
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,934
I believe they should be grateful for me
being the face of the brand.

403
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,979
Tons of reporters will be there.

404
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,689
I was worried there'd only be a handful.

405
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:37,940
Why worry about that?

406
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,609
[mug rattles]

407
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,652
What are you looking at? Go.

408
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,993
[tender music playing]

409
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,629
-[both] Hello, sir.
-Ah, hello.

410
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,713
-Hello there, sir.
-Hello, sir.

411
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,131
Hello there. Hello.

412
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,633
Hello, sir.

413
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,718
-Hello, sir.
-Good to see you.

414
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,895
[comical music playing]

415
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,909
-[gasps]
-[moaning on monitor]

416
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,119
-My lady.
-What is going on?

417
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,912
Uh, no. Don't get the wrong idea.
This isn't…

418
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,872
I won't be able to control myself
any longer.

419
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,916
-You feel so soft…
-[moaning]

420
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,377
Uh, th-this isn't…
It's just… I can explain…

421
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,003
-[chuckles]
-So soft, my lady.

422
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,463
I-I can't…

423
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,548
Uh…

424
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,509
[chuckles]

425
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,179
[Jeong-sin] So…

426
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,515
Uh… So what are you doing here?

427
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,267
[chuckles]

428
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,774
That day, you dropped this
as you rushed out of the airport.

429
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,359
Oh…

430
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,653
Uh… Thanks a lot.

431
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,322
How'd you know I was here?

432
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,658
Did you stop by
just to give me the badge, or…

433
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,704
The truth is,

434
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,581
I work here as well, so…

435
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,042
I joined Sports Eunseong
as the new CEO recently.

436
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,586
Lee Jae-hyeong.

437
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,921
Oh…

438
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,173
So I guess, um…

439
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,760
-you're a wealthy heir?
-[laughing]

440
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,971
Would it have been more dramatic
if I said I was?

441
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,348
My brother is the wealthy heir.

442
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,559
I'm just a CEO on a salary.

443
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,895
Tomorrow I could just as easily get fired.

444
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:43,232
Ah… Well, I gotta say
I'm surprised to meet you again.

445
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:46,068
So these things do happen,
I guess. [chuckles] Kinda neat.

446
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,362
[chuckles] Yeah, it's true.

447
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,323
Uh… By the way,

448
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,492
why were you watching that movie earlier?

449
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,827
Ah…

450
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,997
That was research. I was watching it
for a special feature I'm doing.

451
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,541
"Sex Symbols from the Past",
or something like that.

452
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,293
-[chuckles]
-Ah…

453
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,173
Ah, at the airport, you got hurt.
Is everything okay?

454
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,468
Yeah, I'm all healed up now.
[chuckles] You helped me out.

455
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,386
-Thank you.
-[chuckles]

456
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,847
Well, I suppose I'll see you around here.

457
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,516
[chuckles]

458
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,111

459
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,205
SEONG AE-SUK,
THE MYSTERIOUS ACTRESS

460
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,207
AND THE THREE SHADOWS
SHE LEFT BEHIND

461
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,212
"THE GODMOTHER," MOTHERLY LOVE
OR A BUSINESS TRANSACTION?

THE SCENT OF THE MIRROR

[pensive music playing]

466
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,250
ACTOR LIM HYEON-JUN REVEALED
AS SON OF '70S SEX ICON

467
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,919
Okay, Lim Hyeon-jun's new promo event
will begin at 7:00,

468
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,462
and press conference is at 8:00.

469
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,465
So I'm going to wait
and publish the article at 7:50,

470
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,801
then he can't prepare his responses.

471
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,932
Why do you look so worried
all of a sudden?

472
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,893
Hold on a second.

473
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,439
Shouldn't we confirm all the facts
before publishing?

474
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,066
-I've already done so.
-So it's true?

475
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,276
Yes.

476
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,988
Oh… King's Back Entertainment
isn't gonna like this.

477
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,574
You have a connection with Mr. Hwang,
don't you? You sure it's all right?

478
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,658
Listen to me.

479
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,745
After his suicide attempt scandal,
he repaired his image

480
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,622
by carrying you back to the hospital,
and got tons of ads.

481
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,167
So what, his mother
used to be in adult films.

482
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,795
Is he a K-pop idol
or a rich kid out of Hankuk University?

483
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,923
No, he's not. He's the rough and righteous
"detective Kang Pil-gu",

484
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,426
an everyday guy
who stepped up as a breadwinner

485
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,887
and turned his family's life around
for the better.

486
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,139
The man has a very thick skin.

487
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,142
He might not have anything to lose,

488
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,978
but it's gonna cause some family drama.

489
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:29,607
You should stop your wasting time worrying
about these things and just do your job.

490
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,737
Oh! And change Lim Hyeon-jun's photo,
okay? The more dejected, the better.

491

-Hello, welcome!
-Hi, how are you?

495
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,671
Hi there.

496
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:57,176
Wow, so many people here. [chuckles]

497
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,854
-Is she not here?
-Huh? What, who?

498
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,606
-Huh?
-Who?

499
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,775
Oh, uh, it's nothing. Nothing.

500
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,068
Oh, where's the green room?

501
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,028
-Over there.
-It's right over there.

502
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,113
Yeah.

503
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,449
-[artist] Okay, you're all set.
-Oh, yeah, thanks.

504
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,159
I'm very happy, thank you. Great job.

505
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,286
Thanks, well done.

506
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,039
[grunts] All right.
How are you feeling? All good?

507
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,124
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

508
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,500
[Hwang] You don't look so good.

509
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,837
-Calming herbs, huh?
-[sighs]

510
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,215
-Sure, gimme one.
-All right. That's good, yeah.

511
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,342
-Come on, no need to be nervous.
-Oh, no, no.

512
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,718
-It's all good.
-[knock on door]

513
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,679
-I'm not nervous.
-[crew] Mister Lim, please stand by.

514
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,763
Ah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,101
-You're gonna kill it! You've got this.
-Yes!

516
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,312
[host] Let's give a big round of applause
to actor Lim Hyeon-jun,

517
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,273
the face of Artisan Ramyeon!

518
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,899
[cheering]

519
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,408
Happy to be here.

520
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:03,993
[chuckles]

521
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,095
[Jae-hyeong] Huh?

522
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,180
I see you're still here.

523
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,432
Oh, yeah.

524
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,934
Is everything okay?

525
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,936
What's the long face about?

526
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:33,606
What?

527
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,649
-Did you do something wrong?
-No!

528
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,901
[chortles]

529
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,238
Would you like to have dinner,
if you haven't eaten yet?

530
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:47,912
[sighs]

531
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,463
Why do you keep checking the time?

532
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,341
-Checking the…
-You keep looking at your watch

533
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,718
constantly, followed by a big sigh.

534
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,513
Am I that boring to be around?

535
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,473
Oh, no. [chuckles] Not at all.

536
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,392
An article I wrote
is about to be published.

537
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,311
What is it, a big story?

538
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,855
Yeah, probably.

539
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,107
-It's bound to cause quite a stir.
-I'm sure it will.

540
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,861
It'll stir up a lot of noise
around Lim Hyeon-jun.

541
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,493
-Isn't he a famous actor?
-Yeah.

542
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,040
You know, my mother
is a pretty famous actress.

543
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,546
There was this vicious reporter
who wrote all these scathing articles,

544
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,339
specifically about my mom.

545
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,217
God, I truly hated that man's guts.

546
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:47,555
But one day, by pure chance, I ended up
talking to him in a casual setting.

547
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:51,392
And honestly,
he turned out to be a really nice guy.

548
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,768
That's when I realized,

549
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:57,064
"Ah… He was doing
what he had to do, his job,

550
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,400
just like my mom did what she had to do."

551
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,364
All I'm saying is
you were doing what you had to do.

552
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,825
You were doing your job, that's all.

553
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,789
Listen, um…

554
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,624
You're a wonderful person, Mr. Lee.

555
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,502
That day we first met, you seemed

556
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:23,674
like you were just someone who had decided
to be a good person to me

557
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,385
for no reason whatsoever.

558
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,264
Thank you so much.

559
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:34,852
I'll be on my way, then.

560
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,228
-Thank you for dinner.
-Mmm, yeah.

561
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,479
[chuckles]

562
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,359
[line beeps, rings]

563
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,820
Hi, is this the office
of King's Back Entertainment?

564
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,739
This is Wi Jeong-sin,
from Sports Eunseong.

565
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,200
I have to talk to Lim Hyeon-jun
but I'm unable to reach Mr. Hwang.

566
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,161
I need to talk to him immediately.

567
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,205
It's very important. It's regarding
a story we're about to publish.

568
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,958
Yeah, I understand.

569
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,543
[line clicks]

570
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:00,919
[sighs]

571
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,768
PUBLISH REQUEST

572
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,852
APPROVED

573
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,649
[reporter] Yeah, it came out
just a second ago.

574
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,568
[reporter 2] That's wild!
They would've planned to do that.

575
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,239
Sure, you need to go at him.

576
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,413
[host] May I kindly ask everyone
to be silent now?

577
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,083
Then we can begin
with the press conference, thank you.

578
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,503
Mister Lim, if you would take a seat
at the table, please?

579
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,430
Any questions? Questions?
Please raise your hands.

580
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,015
Yes, you over there.

581
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,768
I heard season five of Good Detective
Kang Pil-gu got the green light.

582
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,144
Has this been confirmed yet?

583
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,270
[laughs]

584
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:04,441
Actually, I'm here to introduce
Artisan Ramyeon today.

585
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:08,696
So, I would appreciate it if we could save
the Kang Pil-gu questions for next time.

586
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,072
[host] All right. Next please.

587
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,158
Hyeon-jun, do you have any special tips
on getting the most out of your ramyeon?

588
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,412
Ramyeon has some instructions
written on the back.

589
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,081
-It tastes great when you follow them.
-He's funny, huh?

590
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,833
Those instructions are there
for good reason.

591
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,209
[host] Yes, you in the front row.

592
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,920
Sunday Sports, Park Seung-won, uh…
I'm just curious,

593
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,505
have you seen what was just published?

594
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,675
The article says your mother is
erotic film actress Seong Ae-suk.

595
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,759
[reporters murmuring]

596
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,429
Were you gonna reveal that your
biological mother worked in erotic films?

597
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,848
Is it true? Is Seong Ae-suk
your biological mother?

598
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,224
Are you in touch with Miss Seong Ae-suk?

599
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,811
[distorting] When did you learn that
Miss Seong Ae-suk was in erotic films?

600
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,438
[voices fade]

601
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,588
[groans]

602
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,309
-[door opens]
-[Ji-sun] Hyeon-jun!

603
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,977
-Hey, what's wrong?
-[Gil-su] Hyeon-jun!

604
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,772
What happened? Look at me!
Hey, quick! Call an ambulance!

605
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,565
-Got it.
-Hyeon-jun! [inhaling, exhaling]

606
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,233
-[Hyeon-jun] Hey, G-- Gil-su.
-Yeah, yeah!

607
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,570
Don't call them, please.
Don't call them, please don't call them.

608
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,821
-[both sigh]
-Shit.

609
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,242
[Ji-sun] Hey, Hyeon-jun.
Talk to me, are you all right?

610
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,578
Massage his arms. Massage his arms.

611
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:42,998
[panting]

612
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,773
Were you gonna reveal that your
biological mother worked in erotic films?

613
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,691
Is it true? Is Seong Ae-suk
your biological mother?

614
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,027
What do you think
of Miss Seong Ae-suk's controversial past?

615
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,988
-…that your mother was an erotic actress?
-Are you proud of your mother?

616
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,997
[Ji-sun] What? What is it? What's wrong?

617
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,542
-Mr. Hwang.
-Hold on! Whoa!

618
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,002
Oh, God.

619
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:30,838
[sighs]

620
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,968
-Hey, Mr. Hwang.
-Right here, yeah.

621
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,388
Where's that clinic?
I need to go there right now.

622
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,192
[nurse] Mister Lim Hyeon-jun?

623
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,945
-Mister Lim Hyeon-jun?
-[Hyeon-jun] Yes!

624
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,072
-Please head to the consultation room.
-Okay, thanks.

625
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,328
[psychiatrist] Your anxiety score is
twice as high as a normal person's,

626
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,372
-and as for depression--
-It's a panic disorder?

627
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,333
One panic attack might just be that.
A panic disorder is a whole other thing.

628
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,294
But I imagine your daily life
has been difficult?

629
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,129
You mentioned your heart
suddenly began to race,

630
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,839
-and you had trouble breathing?
-Yeah.

631
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,717
I thought I was gonna die
because I couldn't breathe.

632
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,220
And I kept thinking, "Ooh, is this it?
This is really the way I die?"

633
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,390
Luckily, there were some friends around,
but if no one had been there,

634
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,642
I'm pretty sure I would've died for real.

635
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,477
So tell me,

636
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,854
if this happens again,

637
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,981
don't you think I could really die?

638
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,109
No, sir. We don't die
because of panic attacks.

639
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,612
I know it feels like you can't breathe,
but that's not true.

640
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,239
Your body will keep on breathing,
'cause it has to.

641
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,285
How much do you sleep on average?

642
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:45,996
Well,

643
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,166
around, I'd say, three or four hours.

644
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,044
The quality of your sleep will determine
if there will be more panic attacks

645
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,087
-in your future.
-I need to know, Doctor.

646
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,006
Could this be caused by a…

647
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,799
a traumatic experience I had?

648
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,760
'Cause I went to a restaurant recently…

649
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,219
PLEASE SAVE ME!

650
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:04,222
A man grabbed a knife and threatened
a woman at the restaurant,

651
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,099
and everyone was looking at me.

652
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,435
But I'm not Kang Pil-gu, you know!

653
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,855
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun. How could I possibly
face off against a guy wielding a knife--

654
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,023
[psychiatrist] Mister Lim?

655
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,108
-Yes?
-Talking about your trauma history

656
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,569
won't really help treat a panic disorder.

657
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,989
And treating mental health is
a difficult and lengthy process.

658
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,825
So why don't we talk more about
everything when I see you next?

659
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,828
-[typing]
-What? Uh…

660
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,497
When you see me next?

661
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,831
That was it? Wait.

662
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,417
We're done?

663
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,294
Yes, sir. That's our time for today.

664
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,555
-[Ji-sun] So, how was it?
-[Hyeon-jun grunts]

665
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,392
What kind of doctor are you?

666
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,935
I thought this would go differently.

667
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,604
Why is her field
the pathology of the human mind

668
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,523
-if she refuses to even look into it?
-Oh, wow.

669
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,983
-Was she that bad?
-Awful!

670
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,943
I need to see a different psychiatrist.

671
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,655
She must've known who I was.

672
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,783
That reporter,

673
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,451
Wi Jeong-sin, where is she?

674
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,286
I need to speak to her.

675
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,247
Oh, uh…

676
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,707
Actually…

677
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,924
[Jeong-sin] Listen, um…
You're a wonderful person, Mr. Lee.

678
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:24,511
You seemed like someone who had
decided to be a good person to me

679
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,139
for no reason whatsoever.

680
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,566
[Hyeon-jun] Good evening.

681
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:41,570
Please, get in.

682
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,155
[Ji-sun] Uh…

683
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,995
[Hyeon-jun] What are you,
an erotic film connoisseur?

684
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,372
You saw my mother
and immediately put it together?

685
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,917
I recognized a photo of her
for a special feature.

686
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,586
Fine, whatever.

687
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,005
If you had any conscience whatsoever,

688
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,382
then shouldn't you be apologizing
at the very least?

689
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,801
The thing is, I…

690
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,388
Shouldn't we confirm all the facts
before publishing?

691
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,848
I've already done so.

692
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,852
You don't want an apology, do you?

693
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,187
You wanna yell.

694
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,522
Yeah…

695
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:21,485
Wow. I knew you were a mean person
but now I'm shocked.

696
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,030
Why the hell would you choose
to drag my family into this?

697
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,158
You have parents,
I'm guessing, right? [scoffs]

698
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:32,037
You think all reporters just write
positive things, like we're your PR staff?

699
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,874
That article would've been written
by anyone, at some point.

700
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:36,958
-[scoffs]
-Honestly,

701
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,878
I think it's better to be upfront
with these kinds of things.

702
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,756
Now you suddenly act like you care?

703
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:44,800
I don't think

704
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,302
that's something to hide.

705
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,972
Do you wanna hide your mother that much?

706
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,226
[sighs]

707
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,478
It's 2025, isn't it?

708
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,481
Voluntary single motherhood
and same sex marriage are supported now.

709
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,733
And people are more relaxed about it all.

710
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,944
You're so old-fashioned.

711
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,196
What? "Old-fashioned"?

712
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,116
-You're weird.
-[scoffs]

713
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,200
Right.

714
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,160
That's how you justify
your own double life.

715
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,245
Isn't that convenient?

716
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,706
In this day and age, there's no such thing
as an undignified job, so…

717
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,751
so everyone should also
be celebrating your trade.

718
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,379
Uh, what do mean by "my trade?"

719
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,716
You don't remember, do you?

720
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,593
I'm not talking about the red carpet.

I don't mean the airport.

[fans cheering]

725
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,818
Have I run into you somewhere else?

726
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,029
Yeah, the men's room
at the exclusive club.

727
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,199
I'm really sorry. I'm gonna step over you.

728
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,535
Huh? [screams]

729
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,745

731
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:58,915
You were…

732
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,209
So, you were the one in the men's room.

733
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,295
[chuckling]

734
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,589
Does it ring a bell now?

735
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,716
That's right. I was the one.

-I have to apologize to you for that.
-[scoffs]

00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,889
I'm really sorry about that, I'm sorry,

740
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,974
-I really didn't…
-[sighing]

741
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:18,977
[Hyeon-jun]
Do you really work as a journalist?

742
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,145
-It's a fake card!
-Huh?

743
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,272
You know what happens
if you impersonate a journalist?

744
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,607
Huh?

745
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,816
No way.

746
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,402
Zero chance this one's a journalist.

747
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,528
But…

748
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,283
Did you believe I was one
of the escorts working there?

749
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,243
[scoffs] Okay, come on.

750
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,246
I'm pretty sure you weren't there
for some undercover activity

[sighs]

756
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:00,685
I'm the one who should be angry.
I don't understand why she acts like that.

Do you wanna hide your mother that much?

763
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,967
[groans] That was some day.

764
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,264
Let's see.

[smacks lips] Well, all right.

771
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,495
You can't win every time,
that's not realistic.

Here we go.

to be up front with these kinds of things.

Reporters aren't obligated to
only write nice things about me though.

825
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,089
When you were in the hospital she actually
wrote a really nice article about you.

826
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,010
[exhales sharply] She should stay
out of my way, I can tell you that.

Listen, you can stop hiding now,
thanks to that article.

If anything, shouldn't you be grateful
for what she did?

Excuse me, are you siding
with that nasty reporter now?

-Mm-hmm.
-Why?

836
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,288
You took too many of your sleeping pills
and ended up in the hospital.

837
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,998
So we need someone to keep an eye on you.

838
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,208
Come on. I'm a grown up.

839
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,626
He's staying.

840
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,879
Just let him stay with you
for 30 days or so.

841
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,881
If something like that
ever happened again,

842
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,300
I'll be on my way to an early grave.

843
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,220

I'll just stay outta your way.

Yeah, sure.

Now go unpack, okay?

Who's my father?

00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,786
-Your father's dead, you know that.
-Come on.

851
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,580
I don't mean Seon-u's dad. Not my stepdad.

852
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,374
My real biological dad.

853
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,837
Ugh, your real dad died too.
I already told you that.

854
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:42,342
Then what are the rumors of you having
a child with some rich business guy

855
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,093
and then retiring, hmm?

856
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,930
[grunts] If you were a rich man's kid,

857
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,973
you think I would've
just let him go like that?

858
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,018
You don't think I did everything I could
so you boys didn't have to struggle?

859
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,939
[chuckling softly]

860
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,489
[phone buzzing]

861
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,923
[Hyeon-jun] Fine. Whatever.

862
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,175
If you had any conscience whatsoever,

863
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,970
then shouldn't you be apologizing
at the very least?

864
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,055
-Ugh.
-[buzzing continues]

865
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,562
Wi Jeong-sin speaking.

866
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:37,772
Yes.

867
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:40,984
Sorry, who's this?

868
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,279
[Hyeon-jun sighs]

869
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,407
[air blasting]

870
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,706
When are you gonna be done with this?

871
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,040
I've only just started.

872
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,293
-Hey, you're in the way, kid.
-Okay.

873
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,796
[sighs]

874
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,716
I won't tell Mom about
the whole acting thing.

875
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,050
But you better go back to school.

876
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,344
Let me try it for one year
before I go back.

877
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:10,054
I'm telling you, it's not worth it.

878
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:13,558
I know better than anyone how hard
you've been studying, every day and night.

879
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,561
To give all that up for something
that likely has no future?

880
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,105
I really don't like it. [sighs]

881
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,733
Ugh, just go back after the break.

882
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,152
[clicks tongue]

883
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:27,822
Okay, I'll give it some thought.
Gimme a couple of days.

884
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,574
[sighs]

885
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,910
Okay.

886
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,664
Oh hey, by the way.

887
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,958
Do you wanna go out again
with that reporter?

888
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:40,835
She's totally your type.

889
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,545
Smart, intelligent, resourceful.

890
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,422
-[scoffs]
-Looks-wise, too.

891
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,840
She's your type, right?

892
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,679
You know my type?
What are you talking about?

893
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,432
Yeah, right. You think you know my type?

894
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,184
[exclaims]

895
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,268
Are you okay?

896
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,318
MESSAGES

897
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,236
[inhales deeply]

898
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,823
[typing]

899
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,750
[Seon-u] You need to be
more careful, Hyeon-jun.

900
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,210
-Get some rest, okay?
-[groans]

901
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,461
[Hyeon-jun] All right.

902
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,342
[groaning]

903
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,719
-Why is nothing going my way?
-[door closes]

904
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:33,971
Should I go see a fortune teller?

905
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,056
THE CARD OF DESTINY

906
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,766
"Online tarot card reading"? Hmm.

907
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,185
So it's possible to do that online?

908
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:41,437
[chuckles]

909
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,563
OK-JI

910
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,858
Hello, I'm Ok-ji,
your personal tarot counselor.

911
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,070
Oh, yeah, uh… [stammers] Hi there. Hello.

912
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,780
Okay, so what do you want to know?

913
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,449
Things have been a little rough recently.

914
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:56,828
So, um, tell me,
when will things get better?

915
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,872
I think you mean in relationships,
as well as your work, right?

916
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:00,998
Uh, yeah.

917
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,292
[Ok-ji] Do you see the tarot cards
appearing on the screen?

918
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,795
-Yes.
-Good. Pick nine cards.

919
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,550
[Ok-ji] Hmm.

920
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,677
Do you see that one card?

921
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,887
These men are holding clubs
and they're fighting each other.

922
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,723
This represents what
you're currently going through.

923
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,307
It means war is on.

924
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,018
It's a dog fight,
and there's no end in sight,

925
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,062
whether it's external
or internal, correct?

926
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,564
Yeah, absolutely spot on.

927
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,274
-That's it.
-The second one tells us your future

928
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,525
three months from now.

929
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,611
It tells us you'll experience heartache.
As if swords were piercing your heart,

930
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,697
or you were struck by bullets.
Bang, bang, bang.

931
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,407
Oh, all right.

932
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,284
So what do you think I need to do?

933
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,162
Well, this one, the third one,
is also very important,

934
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,998
and what I see is that you
should actually be more selfish

935
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,666
-than considerate right now.
-[sighs]

936
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,586
Oh, also, do you have
a bad back by any chance?

937
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,088
Oh, yeah. How'd you know that, though?

938
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:52,925
People who have back problems, um,
they tend to pick the Ten of Swords.

939
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:56,429
[chuckling] Good Lord! You're so good,
I'm starting to get a little scared.

940
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,638
Don't be scared.

941
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:01,893
Anyway, so the cards are telling me
that your complicated situation

942
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,729
is unfortunately not quite over yet.

943
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,190
[sighs]

944
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,693
Um, there's just one more question.

945
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,487
The work I'm doing is going really well,

946
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,739
but I really wanna try something else.

947
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,491
I don't think there's room for growth.

948
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,243
Not with what I'm doing now.
I just feel like I'm stuck somewhat.

949
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,996
Stuck and unable to lean in
and move forward.

950
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,583
Should I…

951
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:30,004
go for it and start something new?

952
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,424
[Ok-ji] Right now, it would be better
to just keep doing what you're doing,

953
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:35,551
instead of venturing out
too far professionally.

954
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:38,179
-[scoffs]
-Don't let greed get the better of you.

955
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,265
The cards tell me that if you succeed
in what you're currently doing,

956
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,893
it will lead to better opportunities
down the road.

957
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:47,396
[sobbing] What do you know?
You don't know anything.

958
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,109
[phone buzzes]

959
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,865
[Soo-jung] Meet me at Rozan Cafe at 8 p.m.

960
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,200
[whispers] 8 p.m., Rozan.

961
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,535
[sighs]

962
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,412
So, you're really not gonna do that movie?

963
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,914
No, I'm not gonna do it!

964
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,499
-Just because Se-na's in it?
-Cut it out!

965
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,292
You gotta do Kang Pil-gu, then.

966
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,336
Do what?
First they've gotta get a director.

967
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,880
Glad you brought it up,

968
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,174
'cause I think we should have
a meeting with the director first.

969
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,300
And which director?

970
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,510
Can't we just meet them?

971
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,846
I know you'll wanna pull out of it
if I tell you who it is.

972
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:22,014
Let's just have the meeting
and we'll talk after, okay?

973
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:25,059
God, I'm so stressed out
being caught in the cross fire.

974
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,394
You do this every time.

975
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,313
You always call me here
when you have something to whine about.

976
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,232
[Ji-sun sighs]

977
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,652
Don't let greed get the better of you.

978
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,697
The cards tell me that if you succeed
in what you're currently doing,

979
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,074
it will lead to better opportunities
down the road.

980
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,661
I really wanted to quit this time,
no matter what.

981
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,789
But for your sake I'll do it.

982
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,500
All right, I get it, it's your choice.

983
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:51,669
Wait, what?

984
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,796
[stammers] You said you're gonna do it?

985
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,964
Yes, I will.

986
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,883
Huh? You're sure, yeah?

987
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,260
I've gotta make a recording of this.
Hang on a second.

988
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,344
I'm recording, yeah?

989
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,763
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah!
-Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? You said so.

990
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,599
I'll hit the record button, now say it.

991
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,726
You will agree to season five?

992
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:10,980
I, Lim Hyeon-jun, will agree to do
Kang Pil-gu season five.

993
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,440
No matter what.

994
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,484
Nice! Okay. [laughing]

995
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,447
You're way too excited.

996
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,203
[sighs]

997
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,206
[suspenseful music playing]

998
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:37,924
[Jeong-sin] Hey.

999
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,306
[sighs]

1000
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,560
[Jeong-sin] Are you Bahn Soo-jung?

1001
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,020
How do you know who I am?

1002
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,939
Thank you for doing this.

1003
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,733
But why did you decide
to get in touch with me?

1004
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,403
You seemed like
the kind of person I could trust.

1005
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,615
[Jeong-sin] I know about
your 12-year-old sibling,

1006
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,242
who's been bedridden
due to a rare illness.

1007
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,453
You should contact this place.

1008
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,122
There's gotta be a way
to take care of them without working here.

1009
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:16,420
Thanks to you, my sibling
is receiving treatment now.

1010
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,714
-So you've left that job, yeah?
-Yeah.

1011
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,591
Anyway,

1012
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,718
why am I here?

1013
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,179
Uh…

1014
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,806
I know something, which I'm…

1015
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,475
I'm too afraid to keep to myself.

1016
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,521
Remember that video I sent you?

1017
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:37,233
[manager] Seriously, the script
for the new season is just incredible!

1018
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,735
Mister Bak is
such an amazing writer, isn't he?

1019
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:41,112
-[chuckles]
-I know. What a twist.

1020
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,531
That the good detective
Kang Pil-gu falls from grace

1021
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,408
and turns into a corrupt cop.

1022
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,909
-So creative, so compelling.
-It truly is.

1023
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,452
Hyeon-jun, I want you to know

1024
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:52,081
how deeply grateful all of us are
for you making this decisive call.

1025
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,542
Seriously, Hyeon-jun, you did,
you saved us all!

1026
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,919
At his age, who's casting him
in a rom-com or a drama?

1027
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:59,171
Kang Pil-gu's all he's got.
What else can he do?

1028
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:02,717
[chuckling]

1029
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,844
[sighs] That's very sweet of you.

1030
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:05,928
[chuckles]

1031
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:07,805
But I'm more grateful.

1032
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,932
Oh, no. No! [chuckles]

1033
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,394
So, um, where's the director?

1034
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,063
And also where's Mr. Bak?

1035
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,609
Oh, um… [clears throat]
They're arriving together.

1036
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,736
-Yeah.
-[Ji-sun] Aren't they?

1037
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,821
-Together?
-Mm-hmm.

1038
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,490
Stop! I'm so curious now. Guys, come on.

1039
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,118
Just say it. Tell me who it is already.

1040
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,870
-Mr. Hwang?
-[Byeong-gi] Hello, hello.

1041
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,538
Uh, oh… [chuckles]

1042
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,582
-Come in. Have a seat.
-Evening.

1043
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:36,876
What about the director?

1044
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,627
Weren't you coming together?

1045
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,964
So I guess you haven't told him?

1046
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,884
Tell me what exactly?

1047
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,763
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

1048
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,140
What is happening?
Why are you all acting weird suddenly?

1049
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,315
Hmm…

1050
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,276
No, you didn't…

1051
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:10,993
I don't believe it, hmm?

1052
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,164
This isn't what I think is it?

1053
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,749
Mr. Bak is gonna do it, yes.

1054
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,920
He's doing it? [chuckles]

1055
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,339
Doing what?

1056
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,760
Direct the show.

1057
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,138
[manager] He'll be writing and directing
the new season of Kang Pil-gu.

1058
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,890
It's already decided. It's done.

1059
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:39,605
[groans]

1060
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:41,482
You've…

1061
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,526
[wheezes]

1062
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:45,903
You're directing it?

1063
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,613
[Hyeon-jun groans]

1064
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:49,240
I will do my best, Hyeon-Jun!

1065
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,742
Yeah, take it. Take your pill now.

1066
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,161
[Byeong-gi, echoing]
Cut. Cut. Let's try that again.

1067
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,246
Cut!

1068
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,747
Ready. Action!

1069
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,250
Cut. Ready. Action!

1070
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,334
[thuds]

1071
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,920
Cut! Don't stop. If I don't call cut,
just let it keep going.

1072
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,046
Just let it play out.

1073
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,966
It seems like you haven't had enough time
to fully analyze your character.

1074
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,343
Let's reshoot the scenes another time.
Don't flatter yourself.

1075
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,637
You've never worked
with Bong Joon-ho or Park Chan-wook.

1076
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,013
Action!

1077
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,308
Honestly, sir, I wouldn't have begged if I
had known you were such a terrible actor.

1078
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:17,935
One more thing…

1079
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:22,565
You little bastard! I never wanna see
your freaking face again!

1080
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,732
[Soo-jung] Remember that video I sent you?

1081
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,068
There is somebody
who doesn't appear in the video.

1082
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,154
[tense music playing]

1083
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:19,330
It's someone very famous.

1084
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,465
Gwon Se-na.

1085
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,741
[no audible dialogue]

1086
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,039
[music continues]

1087
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:20,766
[theme music playing]

1088
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,129
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

1089
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,717
It's your first time at a stadium, right?

1090
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,927
Let's watch the game together
after the interview.

1091
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:58,262
Sure.

1092
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,805
How am I supposed
to write a proper article

1093
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:02,433
if you're only giving me one word answers?

1094
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,226
I'm meeting Ms. Wi. Are you coming?

1095
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,979
The shoot's gonna finish
before six, right?

1096
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,480
-[Gil-su] It's 6 o'clock.
-It's 6 o'clock?

1097
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,190
-[shouts]
-How much further is it?

1098
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,483
When are we gonna be there?

1099
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,693
Can you hurry up a little?

1100
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,945
It's been a while.

1101
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:16,905
I know another place. It's good.

1102
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,615
It's dark and secluded.

1103
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,201
[Hyeon-jun, echoing] Where, where…
