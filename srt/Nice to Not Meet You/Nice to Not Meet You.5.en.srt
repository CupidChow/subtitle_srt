1
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,953
This will make you happy.

2
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,914
I'll only be getting

3
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,374
half of what you get paid.

4
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,338
You said you'd do it
for double my pay, remember?

5
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:38,808
Let's go.

6
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,688
Hello.

7
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,150
I'm Gwon Se-na, and I'll be joining
the cast of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

8
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,109
Wow!

9
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,913
About that video I handed over to you…

10
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,916
There was one more person
who wasn't in it.

11
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,960
Someone really famous.

12
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:07,920
Gwon Se-na.

13
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,219
I'm just too scared
to keep this to myself.

14
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,812
POSSIBLE 3RD-PARTY INVOLVEMENT?

15
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,375
Bro, are you okay?

16
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,252
What's wrong? Can you not breathe again?

17
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,046
-Try exhaling.
-It's not that.

18
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,131
Breathe! Come on!

19
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,883
I said it's not that!

20
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,885
It's not that I can't breathe.

21
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,931
I'm just too pissed off to breathe!

22
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,895
I only just found out about Se-na myself.

23
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,855
You really didn't know?

24
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,481
I swear, I didn't know!

25
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,694
-Why would I risk it and lie to you?
-How the hell could you not know?

26
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,030
I guess since we turned down the movie,

27
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,073
they kept it a secret
so it wouldn't fall through again.

28
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,950
Stop lying!

29
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,994
Okay, listen to me, bro.

30
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:34,924
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,844
But I can't film the drama

32
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,597
with Ms. Gwon Se-na.

33
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,391
I like Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

34
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,191
You know we used to date, right?

35
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,611
You didn't know?

36
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,862
Am I the only one who didn't know?

37
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,240
I was awful to him when we broke up,

38
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,867
so Hyeon-jun is very angry with me.

39
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,662
I want to use this as an opportunity
to make up with him.

40
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,914
You'll help me, right?

41
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,931
In the story, Ju-ri and Hun-seok
meet through a dating app.

42
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,558
Have you used one before?

43
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,646
Do girls really meet guys
through dating apps?

44
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,231
Isn't that what f****** losers do?

45
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,359
I'm so f****** exhausted.

46
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,945
Hey, can you pass me that?

47
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,330
I'm sorry, everyone.

48
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,791
I'm still hungover, you see.

49
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,334
Don't be mad at me!

50
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,595
I'm so f****** tired.

51
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,892
I'm so sorry.

52
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,936
I worked late last night
and didn't get any sleep.

53
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,022
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,189
Don't be mad at me!

55
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,067
By the way,

56
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,945
-can I get one of those too?
-What?

57
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,572
This interview is so boring

58
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,074
that I need one of those to wake up.

59
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,039
I'm so sorry!

60
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,458
Hey, hand me my phone.

61
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,508
I'm glad that's off my chest.

62
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:44,970
You want to make up?

63
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,638
You and me?

64
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,225
What made you even think of
being in this drama?

65
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,894
I knew you'd never drop Kang Pil-gu.

66
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:52,936
Then what about that movie?

67
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,564
I turned it down after you did.

68
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,358
Is that so? Yay for me!

69
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,070
Then I'll drop Kang Pil-gu
and do that movie instead.

70
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,905
Then I'll do that movie too.

71
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,283
What are you up to?

72
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,035
I told you.

73
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,788
I still have feelings for you
and want to make up.

74
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,666
Gwon Se-na, snap out of it.

75
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,836
How can we possibly work together
on the same project?

76
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,589
We can't possibly work together
on the same project.

77
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,092
I really need this role.

78
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,470
Do you want me to disappear entirely
from this industry?

79
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,432
Yes.

80
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,892
It'd be great if you disappeared.

81
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,186
I was horrible, wasn't I?

82
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,562
I was too young to know better.

83
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,730
Don't make excuses.

84
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,192
I was young too,
and I was desperate for that role.

85
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,948
I don't want to apologize
or ask for your forgiveness.

86
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,492
I stopped making
pathetic excuses like that ages ago,

87
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,827
so I can't even say it.

88
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,080
Can't you just think of it this way?

89
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,791
Let's pretend we're meeting
for the first time today.

90
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,544
Like we're starting over again.

91
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,881
Do I look like I have amnesia?

92
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,019
Are you just now getting to work?

93
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,273
I'm coming back from an interview.

94
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,067
How's the job going?

95
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,112
I'm trying to adjust.

96
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,117
I hear you'll be covering
the baseball game tomorrow.

97
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,451
The first pitch, I mean.

98
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,495
Oh, yes.

99
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,997
How about going together?

100
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,541
Excuse me?

101
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,792
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,211
Did that sound too flirty?

103
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,337
Not at all.

104
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,506
I never said that.

105
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,550
That's too bad,
because I meant to sound flirty.

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
What are you doing?

107
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,602
I want to be that thing you said.

108
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,731
Someone who's decided
to be a good person, no matter what.

109
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,818
Mr. Lee, you're a very good person.

110
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,654
It's as if you decided
that you'd always be a good person to me,

111
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,031
no matter what.

112
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,953
Looking back on it,
I really liked what you said.

113
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,208
So I really want to try
being that kind of person.

114
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,631
If we happen to run into each other
at the baseball stadium tomorrow,

115
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,134
wouldn't that be really nice?

116
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,136
Right, yes.

117
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,145
-Shall I call now?
-Yeah.

118
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,358
-I'll see you tomorrow, then.
-Okay.

119
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,530
-You're late.
-There was traffic.

120
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,366
What were you and Mr. Lee talking about?

121
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,659
He said he'd see you tomorrow.

122
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,371
Do I have to answer that?

123
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,289
Isn't that the purpose of a question?

124
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,125
We were just…

125
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,294
We were talking about some personal stuff.

126
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,810
I asked around…

127
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,188
and found out that Se-na turned down

128
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,984
a bunch of movie offers
and took a huge pay cut to do Kang Pil-gu.

129
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,237
Everyone's saying she must really want to
get back together with Hyeon-jun

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,615
since there's no other reason
she would take a supporting role.

131
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,159
-She says she still has feelings for me.
-What?

132
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,870
-She wants to start over again.
-Seriously?

133
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,290
It looks like she'll turn up
in every project I do.

134
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,916
So what are you going to do?

135
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,587
Now isn't the time to talk about that.

136
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,464
Forget Gwon Se-na for now.

137
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,258
Didn't we agree never to meet again

138
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,677
as director and actor?

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,768
I know what you're worried about, Mr. Lim.

140
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,813
But things are different now.
I don't have much say in things anymore.

141
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,942
And you said you didn't want to do it
because of Ms. Gwon, not me.

142
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,652
I'm glad you brought that up.

143
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,656
Then drop Ms. Gwon
before you approach me, Director.

144
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,367
Why would I drop a global star like her?

145
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:18,910
Then how about this?

146
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,248
In the first episode,
I chase a suspect in a car

147
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,042
and then get into a huge accident.

148
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,378
So I undergo a face swap
and come out completely transformed.

149
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,214
That way, another actor
can take over as Kang Pil-gu.

150
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,341
Mr. Lim.

151
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,677
I'll film up to that scene,
for old times' sake.

152
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,432
I'm sorry to interrupt,

153
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:45,479
but now's the time to play this.

154
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,233
I, Lim Hyeon-jun, swear to perform

155
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,651
-in season five of Kang Pil-gu,
-Damn you!

156
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,320
no matter what!

157
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,294
"Right now, I think it's best
that you continue what you're doing

158
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,923
rather than trying something new."
That's what the cards say.

159
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,883
Let's pretend we're meeting
for the first time today.

160
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,967
Like we're starting over again.

161
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:20,931
I, Lim Hyeon-jun, swear to perform
in season five of Kang Pil-gu,

162
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,932
no matter what!

163
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,372
What was that?

164
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,794
Why did my mind jump to that
for no reason?

165
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,381
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

166
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,685
I owe her an apology.

167
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,980
It's really weighing me down.

168
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,608
Bro, are you okay?

169
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,947
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yeah?

170
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,283
Can you go and apologize
to someone for me?

171
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,285
Bro, apologies
and caring for your folks are on you.

172
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,422
I guess this season will be a megahit
if Gwon Se-na is in it.

173
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,469
-That goes without saying.
-Mr. Hwang.

174
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,013
I'm being serious right now.

175
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,307
If you tell me to do Kang Pil-gu
one more time,

176
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,892
I'll find a different agency.

177
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,854
This is the last time, and I mean it.

178
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,273
Wait, you'll do it?

179
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,194
-Bro, you'll really do it?
-Yeah.

180
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,362
You sure you're okay
working with Gwon Se-na?

181
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,697
Of course, I'm not okay.

182
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,908
But I will be,

183
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,659
because I'm a better person than her.

184
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,328
Good call, bro!

185
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,747
I don't care
if she still has feelings for me.

186
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,415
I'm going to focus on my work.

187
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,959
-I like the serious act.
-It's not an act.

188
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,506
That said,

189
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,758
I have a few conditions.

190
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,218
Conditions?

191
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,594
-First.
-First.

192
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,640
There will be no romantic storyline
with Gwon Se-na.

193
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,391
No physical intimacy whatsoever.

194
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,309
Second.

195
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,439
Only five scenes
with Gwon Se-na per episode.

196
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,358
No more than that.

197
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:37,776
Third.

198
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,194
The second unit will start the shoot,

199
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:43,198
and I'll only work with its director,
not with Director Bak Byeong-gi.

200
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,533
Fourth.

201
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,703
After this season, Lim Hyeon-jun
will no longer appear in Kang Pil-gu.

202
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,207
Go ahead and drink it.

203
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,501
You've always wanted to try it.

204
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,051
Those are my conditions.

205
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,011
If you agree to these conditions,

206
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,973
-he says he'll do it.
-What if we don't?

207
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,225
If you don't agree to them,
then he won't do it.

208
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,978
How about we agree for now
and change our tune later?

209
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,604
-Right!
-Right.

210
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,314
If you change your tune,
then he won't do it.

211
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,526
They agreed to the conditions?

212
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,652
All of them?

213
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,196
What did Byeong-gi say?

214
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,157
Mr. Bak… I guess he's Director Bak now.

215
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,201
Anyway, he agreed to everything.

216
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,787
You know he's not
the two-faced type, right?

217
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,664
I think we can trust him.

218
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,957
He's changed a lot.

219
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,586
He's not the same
indie-film-making fanatic anymore.

220
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,629
He takes one-on-one Pilates lessons

221
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,799
and sips 20,000-won coffee
while having brunch.

222
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,176
He's not the same Bak Byeong-gi
from back in the day.

223
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,971
Bro, you own a supercar
worth hundreds of millions of won,

224
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,973
while bossing around
the director and production company.

225
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,435
And you eat salad with chicken breast
instead of just fried chicken.

226
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,687
Do you think you're still the same?

227
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,606
Fine, whatever.

228
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,319
Oh, and about that blind date
with no celebrities or reporters…

229
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,323
I know someone who's really great.
Should I go ahead and set it up?

230
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,407
A blind date?

231
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,494
Sure, maybe after all this is over.

232
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,038
Jeez, you were begging not too long ago.

233
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,040
Anyway, I'll see you
at the baseball stadium later.

234
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,958
Hey, hold on.

235
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,795
They'll probably send a sports reporter
for today's first pitch event, right?

236
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,590
Hey, bro, I'm getting a call right now.

237
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,300
See you later!

238
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,314
You're going on a blind date?

239
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,024
Man, you scared me.

240
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,069
Yeah, so what?

241
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,071
I really liked that reporter.

242
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,908
If you like her that much,
you should go out with her instead.

243
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,910
Have you even seen her before?

244
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,662
I met her when I went to Hong-sin's place.

245
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,206
She seemed really cool
and passionate about her job.

246
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,625
Are you still hanging out with him?

247
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,127
Do I need your permission
to see friends at my age?

248
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,465
And Hyeon-jun.

249
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,801
I'm saying this because I care about you,

250
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,594
but you need to meet someone

251
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,971
who likes you for who you are,
not because you're an actor.

252
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,520
Not that you'd find someone like that
with your sense of judgment.

253
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,067
What's wrong with my sense of judgment?

254
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,122
Wow, there are so many people here.

255
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,124
Wind it up and pitch!

256
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,542
Why are you so excited?

257
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,127
Why wouldn't I be excited?

258
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,295
I never come because I'm so busy
waiting on you hand and foot.

259
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,631
Hand and foot?
Stop talking like I'm some mother-in-law.

260
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,800
You're worse than that.

261
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,845
Can I go and get player autographs later?

262
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,346
Fine, go ahead.

263
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,264
But come right back.

264
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,099
-All right.
-It's awkward being alone.

265
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,100
Let's hurry along.

266
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,856
RESTRICTED AREA
COACHING STAFF ONLY

267
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,442
I look forward to today's game.

268
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,569
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

269
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,446
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

270
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,406
Jeez!

271
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,325
Man, why am I pitching worse?

272
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,453
Darn it.

273
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,172
You're in great form.

274
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,968
-What?
-You must've played baseball before.

275
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,139
-Let's get into pitching form.
-Okay.

276
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,390
-Start your windup.
-Okay.

277
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,727
-Now stop.
-Stop?

278
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,354
The important thing is
to keep your back foot planted.

279
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,398
-Engage your glutes to hold position.
-Okay.

280
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,025
Use your glutes to stay balanced.

281
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,027
As you move forward,

282
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,361
-extend your front hand,
-Okay.

283
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,738
and then throw with your back hand.

284
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,740
-Right.
-But don't throw with your arm.

285
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,367
Use your body rotation to throw the ball.

286
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,328
-Should I give it a try?
-Yes, go ahead.

287
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,287
All right.

288
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,541
-Nicely done.
-Wow, that felt different.

289
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,378
Are you a baseball player?

290
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,131
I was, a long time ago.

291
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,549
Hold on…

292
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,638
Have we met before? You look familiar.

293
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,183
I just have one of those faces.

294
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,899
-Why don't you throw again?
-Okay.

295
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,867
Ms. Wi!

296
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,702
-Hello.
-Hello.

297
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,538
You must be doing the interview today.

298
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,956
Yes, that's right.

299
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,582
I got lost because the stadium is so big.

300
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,585
Mr. Lim is practicing
his first pitch right now.

301
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,379
-Really?
-Come with me.

302
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,839
-Shall I?
-Yes, come on.

303
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,933
Wow, very nice.

304
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,602
You're a very fast learner.

305
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,814
I wish it had landed
more in the strike zone.

306
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,023
Mr. Lim.

307
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,780
You're Lee Jae-hyeong, aren't you?

308
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,408
This is amazing. Can I shake your hand?

309
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,869
You took me by surprise.

310
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,288
Ms. Wi, you're finally here.

311
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,873
So you really did come.

312
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,000
Of course.

313
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,919
Remember how I said
we might happen to run into each other?

314
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,090
Bro, how come you're getting coached
by Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong?

315
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,842
What an honor.

316
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,678
Who knew I'd get to see
Lee Jae-hyeong in real life?

317
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,558
Don't you know who he is?

318
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,976
Holy cow.

319
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,186
He played in the majors
for the New York Hartz!

320
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,688
Oh, come on.

321
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,481
Of course, I know who he is!

322
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,401
How could I not know Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong?

323
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,406
Well, I'm just a corporate worker now.

324
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,909
My goodness, just a coporate worker?

325
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,328
You're the president of Sports Eunseong.

326
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,622
-Right, Ms. Wi?
-Yes.

327
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,415
I'm just here for the game today.

328
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,084
Ms. Wi, you said it's your first time
at a baseball stadium, right?

329
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,377
Yes.

330
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,047
Then let's watch together
after the interview.

331
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,342
These stadiums seem huge,
but you can actually see things up close.

332
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,011
You can even see
the players' faces clearly.

333
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,012
Shall we, then?

334
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,265
If my team wins today,

335
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,475
I'll buy you dinner.

336
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,019
Okay.

337
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,736
Is this your first time
throwing the first pitch?

338
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,197
Yes.

339
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,086
You must be happy to throw the first pitch
for your favorite team.

340
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,924
Yes.

341
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,065
What's your mindset going into today?

342
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,150
"Do your best."

343
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:19,737
"Just do your best."

344
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,490
-Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.
-Yes?

345
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,410
How am I supposed to write the article

346
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,245
if you only give me short answers?

347
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,918
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

348
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,259
That's it for the interview.

349
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,386
What?

350
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,514
You told me to figure it out
with your short answers, so I will.

351
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,559
You know that's not what I meant.

352
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,476
-I…
-Ms. Wi.

353
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,730
-Are you done with the interview?
-Yes, I am.

354
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,314
Wait, I…

355
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,525
Let's go now, then.
The game's about to start.

356
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,278
Excuse me, Ms. Wi?

357
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,822
Good luck with your first pitch, Mr. Lim.
You've got this!

358
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,574
I've got this.

359
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,328
Hey, bro.

360
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,374
We're watching the game
after the first pitch, right?

361
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,419
Come on, they gave us VIP seats!

362
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,464
When's the next time
I'll be able to watch a game from there?

363
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,967
Right, Ms. Wi and Mr. Lee
will be there too.

364
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,177
I've got to get his autograph.

365
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,971
An autograph? Seriously, act your age.

366
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,223
Why are you in a bad mood? What happened?

367
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,933
Can I get an autograph?

368
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,518
What a pretty name.

369
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,230
No, but really,

370
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:39,484
my daughter is a huge fan
of Mr. Lee Jae-hyeong.

371
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,527
You retired too early.

372
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,947
Jeez.

373
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,951
I wondered where I'd seen him before.

374
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,790
So you used to be a baseball player?

375
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,254
I played in the pros for a bit.

376
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,008
I was pretty famous, you know.

377
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,135
Could you show some more interest?

378
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,018
What should we have for dinner later?

379
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,062
What do you like, Ms. Wi?

380
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,398
Didn't you say you'd buy dinner
if your team wins?

381
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,817
I'm rooting for both teams.

382
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,362
One of them will win.

383
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,242
-Dig in, please.
-All right.

384
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,293
Bro, you okay?

385
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,797
-What?
-Are you okay?

386
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,006
Yeah.

387
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,303
Now, the star
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

388
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,722
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
will throw the first pitch!

389
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,854
LIM HYEON-JUN
TODAY'S FIRST PITCH GUEST

390
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,533
Hello, everyone!

391
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,411
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun,
the actor who plays Kang Pil-gu

392
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,871
in Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

393
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,414
Thank you!

394
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,679
He nailed that throw.

395
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,100
It was worth giving him a crash course.

396
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,003
What's wrong? Do you feel ill?

397
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,172
No, I'm okay.

398
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,476
BAHN SOO-JUNG

399
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,145
Mr. Lee.

400
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,438
I'm sorry,

401
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,483
but I won't make it to dinner tonight.

402
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:28,694
But…

403
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,580
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

404
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,415
It's okay.

405
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,462
But you don't look so well.

406
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,630
I haven't been able to sleep.

407
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,134
Soo-jung, is there something
you're hiding from me?

408
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,763
Ms. Wi.

409
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,974
Can you pretend you never saw

410
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,309
the video I handed over to you?

411
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,062
And forget you ever heard
Gwon Se-na's name.

412
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,273
Why? What's going on?

413
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,990
The truth is,

414
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,285
another hostess who was there that night…

415
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,706
asked that man for money.

416
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,502
She thought he and Gwon Se-na were dating,

417
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,921
so she said she'd expose them
if he didn't pay.

418
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,674
But he gave her a huge amount.

419
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,593
She was so scared
that she promised to return the money

420
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,429
and not to expose them.

421
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,474
But he said you can't undo
what's been done,

422
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,353
and that if word gets out,
he'd come after her.

423
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:47,481
I haven't been able
to reach her since then.

424
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,317
Ms. Wi.

425
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,779
That man is seriously dangerous, isn't he?

426
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:57,783
If you want this to end,

427
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,329
you have to tell me the truth
about everything.

428
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,207
Everything about that man,
and about Gwon Se-na as well.

429
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:18,262
When you were at the Geumsang Arts Awards…

430
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,139
That night,

431
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,142
the chairman you asked questions to…

432
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,895
It was him.

433
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,774
That's the man who dated Ms. Gwon Se-na.

434
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,924
EUNSEONGILBO'S CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO
AT THE GEUMSANG ARTS AWARDS

435
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,707
LEE DAE-HO

436
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:31,836
LEE DAE-HO
EUNSEONG GROUP (CHAIRMAN)

437
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,674
YOUNGER BROTHER
LEE JAE-HYEONG

438
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,386
I recently joined Sports Eunseong
as the new president.

439
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,303
Do you run a conglomerate?

440
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,347
My brother's the one who runs it.

441
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,183
I'm just a salaried president.

442
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,989
So the passcode's the same
as your last place.

443
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,082
How did you find this place?

444
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,667
Why pretend to live modestly

445
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,211
when you can be in a mansion?

446
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,173
Get out.

447
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,759
Barging into your ex's place like this
is considered trespassing.

448
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,722
Did we break up?

449
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:25,931
Why? When?

450
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,349
What are you up to?

451
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,768
If you don't want to break up with me,

452
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,312
then get a divorce.

453
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,897
Hey, Gwon Se-na.

454
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,277
Listen carefully.

455
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,446
You're not stupid,
so I won't repeat myself.

456
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,742
We're an economic community.
You know what that is, right?

457
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,535
That means you and I

458
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,164
can't break up that easily, okay?

459
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,343
I was worried you'd have a panic attack.
I'm glad you didn't.

460
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,555
Look, I'm stronger than you think.

461
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,307
Right.

462
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,100
By the way,

463
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:13,062
why did Ms. Wi take off
without watching the game?

464
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,856
You have Ms. Wi's number, right?

465
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,900
Yeah, I think I got her business card.

466
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:18,859
Give it to me.

467
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:20,736
Why?

468
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,238
Because the interview went badly?

469
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,283
No, it's because
I said something I shouldn't have.

470
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,327
What did you say?

471
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,247
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

472
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,289
Jeez.

473
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,542
Are you saying you were dressed like that

474
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,878
to do some undercover reporting
or something like that?

475
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,174
What if I was?

476
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,760
Bro, have you lost your mind?

477
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,638
Even if you had suspicions,
you should've kept them to yourself.

478
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,182
Why would you say that to her face?

479
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,351
Do you think

480
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:54,770
she got really offended?

481
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,189
Totally.

482
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,067
I would've sued you immediately.

483
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,026
Come on.

484
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,112
Was it that bad?

485
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,030
Totally.

486
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,708
Jeez, I'll lose face if I call her first.

487
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:18,627
All right.

488
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,963
I'll save her number first.

489
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,215
Wait a minute.

490
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,260
If I save her number,
she'll see my name when I message her.

491
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,137
Darn it.

492
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,015
Goodness.

493
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,808
-Hello.
-Hello.

494
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,226
I saw you throw the first pitch.

495
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,228
You looked amazing.

496
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,313
-Thank you.
-By the way,

497
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,232
I heard your mother is
actress Seong Ae-suk.

498
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,068
You must've gotten
your acting genes from her.

499
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,742
-Please go ahead. I have a call to make.
-Come on.

500
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,285
-Let's go up together.
-No, it's okay.

501
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:52,995
Go ahead.

502
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,670
-It says your mother is Seong Ae-suk,
-Did you plan on revealing that your…

503
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,047
Do you still keep in touch with Ms. Seong?

504
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,424
How long have you known
that Ms. Seong was in erotic films?

505
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,635
Why did you hide this?

506
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,678
If I hadn't given birth to you back then,

507
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:13,724
I could've escaped my sexy public image,
and my career would've taken off!

508
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,611
So you had another panic attack?

509
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,528
Yes.

510
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,784
I'm always aware of my anxiety
when I have to be around a lot of people.

511
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:35,287
But I had an attack near the elevator
in my apartment building.

512
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,872
What kind of situation was it?

513
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,750
I was with some neighbors I usually greet.

514
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,670
They said something that bothered me,

515
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,173
and the second I heard it,
I couldn't breathe all of a sudden.

516
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,425
I knew I was having another panic attack.

517
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,514
Right, so…

518
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,141
Should I just wrap it up again?

519
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,561
There's no one in the waiting room today,
so you can keep going.

520
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,604
I see.

521
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,024
I've been very curious about this.

522
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,235
How on earth did I get a panic disorder?

523
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,986
I just can't understand it.

524
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,987
In what way?

525
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,992
My career was once ruined
because of a woman,

526
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,577
my mom got into money trouble,

527
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,038
and I had to make money
for my brother's tuition.

528
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,708
Even though I'd stay up all night
binding books at the print shop,

529
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,209
I was totally fine.

530
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,378
I'm in a much better place now
than I was back then.

531
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:28,132
I can have or do whatever I want,
and I'm living a life anyone would envy.

532
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,759
So how can I get a panic disorder
over something so petty?

533
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,428
If someone like me gets a panic order,

534
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,681
then wouldn't nine out of ten people
in this country have it as well?

535
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,059
It's common for panic to set in
once people return from battle,

536
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,936
rather than during the actual battle.

537
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,358
Then what else can I do
to make myself better

538
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,026
other than taking meds?

539
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,528
Sleep well and eat well.

540
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,698
And avoid drinking
alcohol and coffee for now.

541
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,241
And when it comes to mental health,

542
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:57,035
it helps to have positive relationships.

543
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,329
Then…

544
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,542
By any chance,

545
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,003
do you think dating…

546
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,839
could be helpful?

547
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,635
Of course, meeting the right person
can definitely help.

548
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,972
But don't expect your panic to get better
just because someone cares for you.

549
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,475
Love is better when it's reciprocated.

550
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,352
It's the same as hyperventilating
if you think about it.

551
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:26,023
People think that breathing a lot
will make the suffocating feeling go away.

552
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,567
Similarly, people think
that building a bond with someone

553
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,488
and feeling loved and cared for
will make things better.

554
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,989
But that's not true.

555
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,824
Inhale.

556
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,619
And exhale.

557
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,289
Just as we breathe in and out,

558
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,626
love has to be both given and received.

559
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,512
Hello.

560
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,723
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

561
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:00,974
Nice to meet you too.

562
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,186
Mr. Lim, what's your MBTI type?

563
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,314
My MBTI type?

564
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,609
Well, I'm INFJ--

565
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,569
No, you're INTP.

566
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,404
Is that so?

567
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,532
You know better than I do.

568
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,661
You're naturally very energetic
and can't stand injustice.

569
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,081
So I thought you were an extrovert,
but you're the total opposite.

570
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,624
I see.

571
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,420
Well, that's because Kang Pil-gu
is just a character I play.

572
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,256
Where do you live, Mr. Lim?

573
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,591
Oh, I live--

574
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:37,594
I saw online
that you live in the Hannam Dia.

575
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,930
Isn't that place super expensive?

576
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,892
That information shows up online?

577
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,561
Yes, of course.

578
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,189
Have you met Byeon Woo-seok?
How about Cha Eun-woo?

579
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,191
I bet they're so handsome in person.

580
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,361
Yes, of course.

581
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:55,821
Right.

582
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,990
Are you really Lim Hyeon-jun?

583
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,826
I'm such a huge fan!

584
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,829
I watched every season of Kang Pil-gu.

585
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:04,997
-Thank you--
-Snap!

586
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,498
"They say you can't fix people."

587
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:07,708
"But I do."

588
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,917
That's the line, right?

589
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,752
Yes, right.

590
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,299
Gosh, it feels like
I should give you an autograph.

591
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,342
Yes, please. And I want a photo.

592
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,803
I can post it on my social media, right?
Thanks!

593
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,096
Hold on, I…

594
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,097
Smile!

595
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,275
Mr. Lim, did you get home safely?

596
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,070
It was a real pleasure and honor
to meet you today.

597
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,657
Honor, my ass.

598
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,703
Hyeon-jun, are you home?

599
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,542
Hey, how do kids these days
meet people to date?

600
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,627
Why do you ask?

601
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,505
My friends use dating apps.

602
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,216
Dating apps?

603
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,053
What's the world coming to?

604
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:04,306
It won't be long
before AI takes over the world.

605
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,391
You're one to talk.
Su-ji is your best friend.

606
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,519
And people used to meet as pen pals
and then get married.

607
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,105
Focus on your studies
instead of lecturing me, you punk.

608
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,774
Jeez.

609
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,736
By the way, what's in those boxes?

610
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,406
Those are the rice cookers that I promote.

611
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,951
The advertiser sent them as a gift,
but I have no one to give them to.

612
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,244
They look expensive.

613
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,080
Can I sell them on Onion?

614
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,123
Onion?

615
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,417
Oh, that secondhand platform?

616
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,128
-Do whatever you want.
-Awesome.

617
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,090
Oh, right.

618
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,968
-My account got suspended.
-Why?

619
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,595
I sold a few of the down jackets
you received as gifts,

620
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,555
and someone reported me
as a commercial seller.

621
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,642
Oh, boy.

622
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,227
Let me borrow your phone.

623
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,273
Hey, how do you know my passcode?

624
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,567
It's my birthday.

625
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,490
ENTER NICKNAME: KANG PIL-GU
NICKNAME TAKEN

626
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,866
Why are there so many Kang Pil-gus?

627
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,201
What are you doing?

628
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,204
I downloaded the Onion app,
but there are too many Kang Pil-gus.

629
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,247
This won't do.

630
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,128
How much of my stuff did you sell
for your account to get suspended?

631
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:20,382
Hey!

632
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,427
What are you doing with my phone?

633
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,562
Of course, meeting the right person
can definitely help.

634
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,943
You need to meet someone

635
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:41,862
who likes you for who you are,
not because you're an actor.

636
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,243
Onion!

637
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,670
What, already?

638
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,798
Hello, do you still have the rice cooker?

639
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:03,508
Of course, I do.

640
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,554
-Yes, I do.
-Can you give me a 30,000 won discount?

641
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,347
Thirty thousand won?

642
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,435
Sure, do whatever you want.

643
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,728
Yes, I can do that.

644
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,150
That punk set my nickname as "Melomaster."

645
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,068
SOULISHERE, MELOMASTER

646
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,158
Melomaster…

647
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,953
Can I get a veggie sandwich
on Parmesan oregano bread

648
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,040
with lettuce, tomato, cucumber,
bell peppers, and onion?

649
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,876
And the sauce… Can you recommend one?

650
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,211
-Sure thing.
-Thank you.

651
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:48,261
Wow, I went with your suggestion,
and it tastes great!

652
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:51,014
See? I eat this all the time
when I'm on a diet.

653
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,102
By the way, how did the blind dates go?

654
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,354
They were okay, I guess.

655
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,272
What's wrong? You didn't like any of them?

656
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,526
No, it just felt like

657
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,737
I was holding one-on-one fan meetings.

658
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:08,323
This is all your fault!

659
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,535
I need to be in rom-coms or melodramas
if I want a dating life!

660
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,122
Why do you always blame me for everything?

661
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,082
Seriously. Oh, right.

662
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,334
The article about you doing Kang Pil-gu
is going out today.

663
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,837
-That's okay, right?
-Yeah.

664
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,964
I'm meeting the chief of Sports Eunseong
and Ms. Wi.

665
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:24,965
Are you coming?

666
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:26,800
Do I have to be there?

667
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,052
I guess you're busy
with the commercial shoot.

668
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,932
Did you think
I was one of the hostesses there?

669
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:35,433
Actually, no.

670
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,812
I'll make some time.

671
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,397
Okay, then.

672
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,542
-Hello?
-It's me.

673
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,335
Thank you.

674
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,379
Don't thank me.

675
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,758
I'm not doing it
because you still have feelings for me.

676
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,804
I just don't want to
sink to your level as a person.

677
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:14,890
So don't take it the wrong way.

678
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,895
-Are you listening?
-Yeah.

679
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,022
I heard everything you said.

680
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,481
I'll call you later.

681
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,823
Oh, hey.

682
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,910
-The director wants to explain
-Yeah?

683
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,578
the concept for today's shoot,

684
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,038
-so he's waiting outside.
-Oh, okay.

685
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,497
-Tell him to come in.
-Okay.

686
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,750
But he mentioned the concept has changed.

687
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,127
-Yeah, okay.
-Is that okay?

688
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,046
-Yes, tell him to come in.
-All right.

689
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,547
-Right, Gil-su.
-Yes?

690
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,007
Today's shoot will finish
before 6 p.m., right?

691
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,384
-Yes, likely so.
-Good.

692
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,680
Director.

693
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,183
Hello, Mr. Lim!

694
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,685
-Hello.
-It's an honor to work with you again.

695
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,021
Not at all. I look forward to it.

696
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,065
Let me explain the concept for the shoot.

697
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,651
-Did something change?
-Just a little bit.

698
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,195
-I see.
-If you see here, this is a ballet outfit…

699
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,696
Hold on.

700
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,742
I really shouldn't eat
since I'm on a diet.

701
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,577
If it's tasty, it's zero calories!

702
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,537
Why is this so salty?

703
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:22,290
I might kick the bucket eating this.

704
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,291
Sir.

705
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,961
Artisan Ramyeon's soup is light and mild,

706
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,963
so you won't kick the bucket!

707
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,715
Man, I'm kind of hungry.

708
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,094
But I'll probably regret eating ramyeon.

709
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,681
Detective, if you don't eat it now,
you'll regret it until tomorrow.

710
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,848
ARTISAN RAMYEON
MILD FLAVOR

711
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,396
Worried it's nighttime?
Worried it's past midnight?

712
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,524
Don't worry
Artisan Ramyeon is all good

713
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,735
You can enjoy it without worries

714
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,405
Tasty Artisan Ramyeon

715
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,448
Let's all enjoy Artisan Ramyeon

716
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:56,658
Artisan!

717
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,867
I'm not doing it!

718
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,744
Wearing a ramyeon packet costume
is bad enough as it is!

719
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,038
Why does it always have to end
with Kang Pil-gu?

720
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:05,625
Call Mr. Hwang, damn it.
Tell him I won't do this commercial!

721
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,252
Come on, please. They'll kill me.

722
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,462
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not doing it.

723
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,756
If it's tasty, it's zero calories.

724
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:13,883
Artisan Ramyeon is…

725
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,469
Cut! Let's go again.

726
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,023
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,358
Something urgent came up,
and the chief won't make it.

728
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,985
Oh, really?

729
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,946
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun is filming
a ramyeon commercial right now.

730
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,991
The shoot is running longer than expected,
so he might not be able to make it.

731
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,117
I'm so sorry about this.

732
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,076
It's okay.

733
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,121
-Please go ahead and order.
-Thank you.

734
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,541
Let's all enjoy Artisan Ramyeon

735
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,959
Artisan!

736
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,044
Cut!

737
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,546
We're losing steam, guys.

738
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,547
Let's go again!

739
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,050
Ready.

740
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,728
…Artisan Ramyeon has chewy noodles,

741
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,606
and the soup is absolutely delicious!

742
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,066
Cut!

743
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,195
Let's take a break, everyone!

744
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,835
-Hyeon-jun, it's time to head back in.
-Okay.

745
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,254
What time is it, Gil-su?

746
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:34,589
It's 6 o'clock.

747
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,717
-It's 6 o'clock?
-Yes.

748
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,344
Let's film this already.

749
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:43,723
I got this!

750
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,892
-Yes!
-Let's go.

751
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:50,647
Detective, if you don't eat it now,
you'll regret it until tomorrow

752
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,651
because Artisan Ramyeon has chewy noodles,
and the soup is absolutely delicious!

753
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,904
Cut! Great job. That's a wrap!

754
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,075
Great job!

755
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,910
Hey, help me with this.

756
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,245
Let's hurry up and go!

757
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,957
-Gil-su.
-Yes?

758
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,208
How much further?

759
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,043
We're almost there.

760
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,254
All right. Just hurry, okay?

761
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,214
How much longer?

762
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,050
Not that much,
but the estimated time keeps increasing.

763
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,009
Let's hurry up, okay?

764
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,178
-I'll go as fast as I can.
-Okay, hurry up.

765
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,063
Go ahead and leave!

766
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,315
Wait, not there! It's over here.

767
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,694
Okay, go home!

768
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,654
What's the matter with him?

769
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,704
Ms. Wi, the reason I wanted to see you…

770
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,540
Oh, here you are.

771
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,625
What? Is the shoot over?

772
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,752
-Bro, how did you--
-Hey, bro.

773
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,756
Come on, bro. Take a seat.

774
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,967
-But Hyeon-jun--
-Come on, bro.

775
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,094
-How did you get here, Hyeon-jun?
-Well…

776
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,762
I thought the shoot was running late.

777
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,432
Well…

778
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:10,518
The shoot ended early
because it turned out well, bro.

779
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:11,978
Oh, I see.

780
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,272
Right, little bro.

781
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,524
-There wasn't any traffic on the way?
-None at all.

782
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,151
Right, I see.

783
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:22,489
It's been a while.

784
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,907
Yes, hello.

785
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,534
I thought you couldn't make it.

786
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,411
No, I made it.

787
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,289
Since it's about me,

788
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,584
I came here to tell you myself.

789
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,634
-Bro, did you tell her already?
-Tell her what?

790
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,761
-My news.
-No, not at all.

791
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:47,096
-Go ahead and tell her.
-Okay.

792
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,390
Oh, I'm getting a call.

793
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,142
-I have to take this.
-Okay.

794
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,200
Have you been well?

795
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,619
Yes.

796
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,329
Right.

797
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,624
-Have you been doing well?
-Yes.

798
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,501
Of course, I have.

799
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,422
Ms. Wi, I'm terribly sorry.

800
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,049
Something urgent came up,
so I have to leave right now.

801
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,884
The keywords for the article…

802
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,553
Right. Little bro, you can tell her.

803
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:27,929
-Me?
-Yes, that's right.

804
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,056
I'll see you later, then.

805
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,766
-Hey, but--
-Later!

806
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,105
Oh, go ahead.

807
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,526
What's the rush?

808
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,153
Let's eat before we begin.

809
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,199
But I'm done with dessert.

810
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,872
I haven't eaten yet, though.

811
00:47:55,373 --> 00:48:00,336
The last order was 8 o'clock,
so the kitchen is already closed.

812
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,088
I'm very sorry, sir.

813
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,466
Do you know any nearby restaurants?

814
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,722
My manager drives me around everywhere,

815
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:15,810
and I've been on a diet lately,
so I don't know any good restaurants.

816
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,854
I know a place we can go.

817
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,355
Where…

818
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,609
It's dark

819
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,444
and secluded.

820
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:29,574
Jeez.

821
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:34,329
Only teenagers come here
to eat ramyeon and make memories over it.

822
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,623
I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

823
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,875
Then would you be okay
if someone took a photo

824
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,377
of just the two of us eating at this hour?

825
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:47,091
At least you got me
the ramyeon I'm promoting.

826
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,222
You never watched Kang Pil-gu
or showed any interest in me,

827
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,974
so how did you know to get this?

828
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:56,809
It was a coincidence.

829
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:04,025
Now, go ahead and tell me.
What's the story?

830
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:11,574
Season five of Kang Pil-gu
has been confirmed.

831
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,827
And Gwon Se-na is joining the cast.

832
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,666
I guess it's good for the drama
that a global star is on board,

833
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,877
but the main character has been
and always will be Kang Pil-gu.

834
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,921
I don't want my fans to worry
that her character

835
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,631
will take the spotlight from mine.

836
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,425
Work that into the article, will you?

837
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,806
I'll get started on the article.

838
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,109
-What is it?
-What?

839
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,278
Do you have something to say?

840
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:31,821
No.

841
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,992
Well,

842
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,202
I'm thirsty.

843
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:39,746
So?

844
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,710
Do you have any water?

845
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:49,756
I don't.

846
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:55,887
Is your foot okay?

847
00:50:58,014 --> 00:51:00,933
You hurt your foot
breaking the window to help me.

848
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,227
Wait, you remember that?

849
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:05,688
Vaguely.

850
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,150
It healed a long time ago.

851
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,110
It's fine.

852
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:17,658
So…

853
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,204
I have

854
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,165
something to say.

855
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:32,799
I'm sorry about before.

856
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,054
For assuming that you worked as a hostess.

857
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,182
I apologize for that.

858
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,822
Hey, say something.

859
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:59,700
I'm offering a sincere apology,
and I'm totally embarrassed.

860
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:02,495
Do I have to accept your apology?

861
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:04,997
Excuse me?

862
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:06,082
I mean,

863
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,335
it's only natural to accept an apology

864
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,170
if someone owns up to their mistake.

865
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:14,173
I didn't do anything unforgivable.
It was just a misunderstanding.

866
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,635
It's only natural to apologize
if you did something wrong.

867
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,971
But accepting the apology
is up to the other person.

868
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:21,848
Unbelievable.

869
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:24,892
I forgave you
for storming into the bathroom stall

870
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,812
and humiliating me
while I was taking care of business.

871
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,648
I even forgave you for spying on me
in my hospital room

872
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,316
and gave you an exclusive.

873
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,902
And I let you off the hook
for that article about my mom.

874
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,404
You know what?

875
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,199
After saying all that out loud,
I sound like a complete doormat!

876
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,701
So?

877
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,537
You really won't accept my apology?

878
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,456
Even though
I'm personally giving you an exclusive

879
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,208
and expressing how sorry I am?

880
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:50,167
That's right.

881
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,129
I don't want your apology.

882
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,352
Seriously?

883
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:15,067
Stop glaring at me and focus on the road!

884
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,403
I have every right to glare at you!

885
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,573
I forgot my wife's birthday today

886
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,993
and finally got her to forgive me
after begging for hours,

887
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,661
but then you called me back out!

888
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:28,122
Gil-su couldn't come
because he was drinking!

889
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,750
You could've called a driver
instead of your CEO!

890
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,376
Or you could've driven yourself!

891
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,962
I called you
because I have so much pent-up rage!

892
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,881
Jeez.

893
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,427
What is it now?
Did you fight again with Ms. Wi?

894
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,304
Who said we had a fight?

895
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,223
I apologized for thinking
that she worked as a hostess,

896
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,142
but she wouldn't accept my apology.

897
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,270
I bet you acted all high and mighty
and gave a lousy apology.

898
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:55,107
That's not true. I gave a sincere apology
for the first time in a while.

899
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,152
Onion!

900
00:53:58,736 --> 00:53:59,695
What was that?

901
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,239
Are you on Onion?

902
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,159
I put something up for Seon-u, that's all.

903
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,037
Seriously, the things you do…

904
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,387
Go wash up and sleep.

905
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,805
How are you getting home?

906
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:29,266
I'm taking a taxi, of course.
You think I'll rent a scooter instead?

907
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:32,061
Here.

908
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,854
What's that?

909
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,149
-Your wife's birthday gift.
-What?

910
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,569
-What's this?
-Press the button.

911
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:52,581
It's a bribe to keep her
from divorcing you over me.

912
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,876
Oh, bro!

913
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,130
-Bro, thanks so much!
-Jeez, go away.

914
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,840
Gosh, would you look at that?

915
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,969
Holy cow, it's a luxury car!

916
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,513
I finally get to ride in one of these!

917
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:12,893
Jeez.

918
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,771
Are you home?

919
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:22,987
Are you scared?

920
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:26,991
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 2

921
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,409
Damn it.

922
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,749
Change your clothes first.

923
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,542
I think I caught a cold.

924
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,543
You caught a cold?

925
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,172
That's why you need to dress warmly.

926
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,758
Drink some water.

927
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,551
Okay.

928
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:48,220
Jeez, you're such a handful.

929
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,061
Take two of these before you go to bed.

930
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,235
What a bummer.

931
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,987
I heard my bro Pil-gu
went on a blind date.

932
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,239
-A blind date?
-Yeah.

933
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,741
-With whom?
-How should I know?

934
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,618
He probably has women lining up for him.

935
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,244
Are you going to write about that too?

936
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,916
I mean, it'd be better if I wrote it
and build up my track record.

937
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,793
Jeez, you're really something.

938
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,253
Don't you regret missing out on him?

939
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:23,923
I mean, he's got the face,
the body, and the fame.

940
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:25,508
Listen.

941
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,384
How would you feel

942
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,096
if you gave someone a genuine apology,

943
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,057
but they refused to accept it?

944
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,686
Did they do something really terrible?

945
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,358
No, it wasn't that bad.

946
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,777
I'd cut ties with them, then.

947
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,742
Was it you who apologized,
or was it the other way around?

948
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:53,661
It was me.

949
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,455
I didn't accept the apology.

950
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:57,414
Why not?

951
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,836
Because when you accept an apology,

952
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,255
it makes you expect more.

953
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,301
That they'll treat you nicer,

954
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,262
or that they'll be friendlier to you.

955
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,015
It was never going to work out anyway,

956
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,686
so I figured
I'd nip that expectation in the bud.

957
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,108
Do you know what people call that?

958
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,568
Putting up walls.

959
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,445
If you keep putting up walls like that,

960
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,698
you'll live alone forever.

961
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,950
Whatever. I'm not taking these.

962
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,126
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

963
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:46,797
I've been in a bad mood
since this morning.

964
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,257
Again?

965
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:51,719
What do you mean "again"?

966
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,853
Why would someone not accept an apology?

967
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,481
I can't think of a good response.

968
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,444
It figures.

969
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,947
If I don't know the answer to that,
how would an AI assistant like you know?

I don't want your apology.

976
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,367
Hey, I read an article
about Gwon Se-na joining your drama.

977
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,618
Is it true?

978
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,536
Right.

979
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,248
So you read the article.

980
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:05,084
You couldn't stand her at all.
Are you getting back together?

981
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:06,543

I'm just keeping
work and personal life separate.

Where are you going anyway?

984
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:15,719
My friend's grandfather passed away,
so I'm going to the funeral.

985
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:20,015
But you've got an Onion deal today!

-It's almost time.
-Jeez.

989
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,604
Can you go instead?

990
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,607
I can't go out and sell a rice cooker.

991
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,276
Everyone knows my face.

992
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,527
It's dark out.

993
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,945

00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:36,031
-No, absolutely not.
-My friend's waiting downstairs.

995
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,574
Just grab it and head out, okay?

996
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,160
-No way! I can't do it!
-Come on, help me out!

997
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,412

01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,671
Yes, I do.

ours is the worst.

I can share some with you if you'd like.

1038
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,481
You seem like a bigger fan than me.

1039
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:22,693
I actually look a lot like Lim Hyeon-jun.

1040
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,403
You're joking.

1041
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,529
Want to check for yourself?

1042
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,197
How about this Friday?
