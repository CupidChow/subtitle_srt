Stop complaining and serve the rice.

One bowl?

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,978
Two bowls.

What the heck?

7
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,775
The rice isn't cooked.

Yes, I do.

Sure, do whatever you want.

I have a cold, and I keep coughing.

Hey, where's my handcart?

29
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,066
It's next to the shoe cabinet.

Lim Hyeon-jun?

41
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,924
Yes, I do.

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,348

so unconditionally.

-What are you doing?
-I'm checking to see if it's cooking.

50
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,588
I'm sure it'll cook on its own.

51
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,174
What if it doesn't work?
I'll have to ask for a refund.

52
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,138
Your delicious white rice is ready,
cooked on high heat.

53
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,515
-Please stir the rice carefully.
-Yes, it worked!

Nice, it works.

00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,102

56
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,648
Does the rice cooker work?

If it doesn't,
I'll give you a 100% refund.

Let's see.

59
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,670
The rice cooker works well.

60
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,672
Thanks to you,
I got a brand new item at a low price.

61
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,590
Thank you.

62
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,928
She already used it?

63
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,184
I'm actually a fan
of Lim Hyeon-jun myself.

64
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,062
-Seriously?
-I love Kang Pil-gu.

65
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,189
Wow, I'm so glad we met!

66
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,442
It was nice meeting you earlier too.

67
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,361
Kang Pil-gu Season 5 is coming out soon.

68
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,113
I'm so looking forward to it.
My heart's pounding.

69
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,868
Her heart's pounding.

70
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,793
I actually have a friend
who's a crew member for dramas.

71
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,922
Oh, really?

72
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,342
So I have some Kang Pil-gu merch.

73
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,303
Umbrellas, T-shirts,
portable chargers, and things like that.

74
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,765
I would've brought some with me
if I'd known you were a fan.

75
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,101
I can share some with you if you'd like.

76
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,645
Yes, please! Could you…

77
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,690
Say that you want some.

78
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,400
Oh, that's okay.

79
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,486
Thank you for offering, though.

80
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,491
Look at you, trying to act cool.

81
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,744
-Thank you for…
-Thank you for today.

82
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,121
I hope you have a good night.

83
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,958
Thank you. You too, Soulishere.

84
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,710
Have a good night.

85
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,643
I do want some, though.

86
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,770
Maybe I should've asked for a few.

87
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,068
I should leave a review.

88
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,155
Jeong-sin, dinner's ready!

89
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,406
Okay!

90
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,201
"Friendly and has good manners."

91
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,327
"Responds quickly."

92
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,495
"The product is in good condition."

93
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,038
"Arrives in a timely manner."

EPISODE 6

95
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,680
Now, the star
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu,

96
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,016
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
will throw the first pitch!

97
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,359
Me?

98
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,319
That's right.

99
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,237
This is for you.

100
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,134
Let's have our meeting.

101
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,058
-Start us off, Ha Seong-min.
-Yes, ma'am.

102
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,184
Park Jun-woo's fans are saying

103
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,479
that he's dating Jin Su-a,
based on the photos he's been posting.

104
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,855
They're barking up the wrong tree.

105
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,274
Park Jun-woo doesn't date celebrities.
He goes after non-celebrities.

106
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,735
But didn't his ex move abroad?

107
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,780
Yes, she set off marriage rumors
but was treated like a stalker.

108
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,074
She probably felt humiliated,
so she used studying abroad

109
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,325
as an excuse to leave.

110
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,996
Why trust what an actor says?
He's amazing at acting.

111
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,791
Celebrities and non-celebrities
always end in disaster.

112
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,757
Mr. Hwang,
I know you like my green onion kimchi.

113
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,884
You made green onion kimchi, Ms. Seong?

114
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:12,928
Ta-da!

115
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,097
-It looks amazing, right?
-It looks so good.

116
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,141
This is all you need
to make a bowl of rice disappear.

117
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,352
Mr. Hwang.

118
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,314
I swear I'll make you
green onion kimchi until you die.

119
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,401
So help me
land some acting roles, will you?

120
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,736
Ms. Seong.

121
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,739
You see, I truly do want to help you,

122
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,367
-but getting work is--
-Mr. Hwang!

123
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,872
Ae-suk, what brings you here?

124
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,291
I could ask you the same.

125
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,625
This isn't even your agency.

126
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,627
Why do you think I'm here?

127
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,923
Mr. Hwang, you should've had
those articles taken down.

128
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,383
Because of all the articles

129
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,094
about Hyeon-jun and Ae-suk,
I'm being dragged into the public eye too.

130
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,306
I'm too embarrassed to look at my sons.

131
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

132
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,726
Why are you apologizing, Mr. Hwang?

133
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,688
Look, I portray a devoted mother
in the weekend drama I'm acting in.

134
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,815
But because of you and Hyeon-jun,

135
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,152
people will look at my face and think,
"It's that erotic film actress."

136
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,321
An actor's public image is everything.

137
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,158
It's not like you're being
accused of something you didn't do.

138
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,661
Why blame us for people gossiping about
you going nude in a movie?

139
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,872
If you didn't want that,
you shouldn't have done it at all!

140
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,832
Are you done talking?

141
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,209
What do you know
about the life of an actor?

142
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,127
"Life of an actor"?

143
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,006
You've got some nerve
talking about the life of an actor!

144
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,341
Back in the day,
you barely got to play my maid,

145
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,926
only because
I hooked you up with the role!

146
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,556
What?

147
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,767
"Hooked me up"?

148
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,610
Ma'am!

149
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,237
You crazy…

150
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,244
Why, you!

151
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,997
You crazy…

152
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,083
Hyeon-jun, let go of me!

153
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,920
Seriously, Mom?
When did you even get here?

154
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,422
-You're going to drive me crazy.
-Let me go!

155
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,635
Why did you come alone?
You should've come with me.

156
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,347
Mother, you got a lot on your dress.

157
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,556
Goodness.

158
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,601
Hello.

159
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,103
Hello.

160
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,855
Let's go, Mother.

161
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:29,898
I'm so upset.

162
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,193
-Let's go, Mother.
-Wait!

163
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,988
I'll go, but not before
I clear up the misunderstanding.

164
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:37,989
Misunderstanding?

165
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,325
What misunderstanding?
I saw what happened!

166
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,370
And what brought you here
in the first place?

167
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,039
-I'm so embarrassed by you!
-I'm proud of you, Mother.

168
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,792
So don't be so upset.

169
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,048
Jun, I really want to act again.

170
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,051
Please ask Mr. Hwang to help me out.

171
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,469
Let's go.

172
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,390
But I want to act again!

173
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,103
-Gwon Se-na?
-Yes.

174
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,939
Do you know if
Gwon Se-na is seeing anyone?

175
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,274
Why do you ask?

176
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,609
I want to spark a dating rumor.

177
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,114
I did hear that she has a sponsor.

178
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,324
The chairman you asked questions to…

179
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,118
It was him.

180
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,287
That's the man who dated Ms. Gwon Se-na.

181
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,081
But she's at a level
where she doesn't need a sponsor.

182
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,834
Who's the guy?

183
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,963
She's obviously here
because she doesn't know.

184
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,006
Right.

185
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,592
I did think it was odd
that her career had just taken off,

186
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,969
yet she bought a unit
in an upscale luxury apartment.

187
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,888
I heard she was really poor
before her fame.

188
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,307
Chief.

189
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,435
Do you think
I could get Ms. Gwon's number?

190
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,692
-Hello?
-Hello?

191
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,277
Is this Ms. Gwon Se-na?

192
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,739
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

193
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,367
The reason I'm calling
is to request an interview.

194
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,328
How did you get my number?

195
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,164
I'm incredibly sorry
for calling so suddenly,

196
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,249
but I can explain everything
when we meet--

197
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,752
Hello?

198
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,560
So? Did she agree to meet with you?

199
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,229
She hung up on me.

200
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,396
That's a shame.

201
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:34,898
Now what?

202
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,568
I'll have to make her come to me.

203
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,820
AUDITION WAITING AREA

204
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,700
Mr. Wi Hong-sin?

205
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,369
-Yes?
-Please come in.

206
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:48,828
Yes, sir.

207
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,255
He gets extra points for that.

208
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,722
Hello!

209
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,391
My name is Wi Hong-sin.

210
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,433
It's nice to meet you.

211
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,814
Mr. Wi Hong-sin?

212
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,815
Yes, my bro!

213
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,526
Oh, I'm sorry.

214
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,612
I feel like I already know you, so…

215
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,574
I like the friendly vibe.

216
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,785
Show us what you prepared, little bro.

217
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,036
Yes, sir.

218
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,330
Auntie, should I become a cop?

219
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,208
Do you think anyone can become a cop?

220
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,086
Are you saying your nephew,
Kang Pil-gu, is just "anyone"?

221
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,255
That's disappointing.
What if I get into the police academy?

222
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,465
If you get in, I'll eat my hat.

223
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,178
I can't let you eat your hat,
so I guess I won't become a cop.

224
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,221
That's enough.

225
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,933
Your naturalistic acting was good.

226
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,478
And you look oddly similar to Kang Pil-gu.

227
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,564
Thank you, sir!

228
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,190
However…

229
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,694
You changed up the lines.

230
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,821
Right. I'm sorry.

231
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,158
I forgot my lines
because I was distracted by your gaze.

232
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,748
Not knowing the lines for your scene
isn't something to be proud of.

233
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,500
Then what about
"I can't let you eat your hat,

234
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,961
so I guess I won't become a cop"?

235
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,465
I didn't forget those lines.

236
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,510
I thought if I were Kang Pil-gu,
I'd be more affectionate with my aunt,

237
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,512
so I changed it up a little in my own way.

238
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,061
Changing the script to suit yourself

239
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,481
only works if you have
a solid understanding of the character.

240
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,734
Relying on your instincts
and improvising on the spot

241
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,695
is very inconsiderate to the other actors.

242
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,696
Also,

243
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:52,077
how can a newbie actor
have so much confidence in their acting?

244
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,038
That's bizarre to me.

245
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,594
Jeez.

246
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,514
Did you see your mother off?

247
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,767
Don't even think of helping my mom
if she shows up at your office again.

248
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,560
All right.

249
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,272
But bro,

250
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,234
she must really want to act again
to come see me like that.

251
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,985
I mean, to be honest,

252
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,822
your mother's acting skills are
much better than yours.

253
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,116
Are you trying to get me riled up?

254
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,660
Give me back that car key. Give it back!

255
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,954
Fine, I got it.

256
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,581
There's nothing pettier
than taking back a gift, bro.

257
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,502
Anyway,

258
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,004
that baseball player was
Ms. Oh Mi-ran's son?

259
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,133
I know, right? What a small world.

260
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,636
Man, he's got the family background,
the looks, the skills…

261
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,012
Did you see how he was?

262
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,141
How can someone be so sweet to their mom?

263
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,184
Gosh, he's so perfect.

264
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,396
Being born to good parents isn't a skill.
It's just luck.

265
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,732
Right. Of course, it's luck.

266
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,358
It's no skill at all.

267
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,276
Oh, right.

268
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,612
That kid you failed
in the audition earlier.

269
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,864
Do you think he's--

270
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,782
He's Ms. Wi Jeong-sin's younger brother.

271
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,284
Wi Jeong-sin. Wi Hong-sin.

272
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,663
I knew it. I just knew it!

273
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,582
Hold on.

274
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,127
-Did you deliberately fail him?
-Don't be ridiculous.

275
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,088
I was a fair and impartial judge.

276
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,719
That's a lie.

277
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,847
You're saying all this will fit inside?
I can't believe it.

278
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,265
That's a lie.

279
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,934
Cut! Okay.

280
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,019
-Nicely done.
-Good job.

281
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:44,898
Can you hand me my phone?

282
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,317
She can't see this article.

283
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,111
-Ms. Gwon can't see this.
-I know, right?

284
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:52,781
What is it?

285
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,074
GWON SE-NA LIES TO REPORTERS
AT THE AIRPORT

286
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,284
SUPERSTAR ON A POWER TRIP?

287
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,287
GWON SE-NA FAILS OVERSEAS,
RETURNS TO KOREA

288
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,039
GWON SE-NA HUMILIATED,
IS IT HER WIDE SHOULDERS OR HER BIG FACE?

289
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,545
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

290
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,423
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

291
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,093
The reason I'm calling
is to request an interview.

292
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,386
Is she crazy?

293
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,222
Damn it!

294
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,645
Thank you for meeting me,

295
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,272
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

296
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:27,899
Not at all.

297
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,653
I was surprised
you reached out first, Ms. Gwon.

298
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,029
It was very unexpected.

299
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,992
Isn't that precisely why
you published all those articles?

300
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,036
If that's how you saw it,

301
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,247
you're very clever.

302
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,923
What is it that you want to ask me?

303
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,716
I hear you're seeing
someone rather influential.

304
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,010
Do you plan on leaking a dating rumor?

305
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,764
I'm not sure if "dating rumor"
would be the way to word it.

306
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,141
An affair rumor sounds more appropriate.

307
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,436
Call it whatever you want,
but don't bother writing it.

308
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,313
I'm breaking up with him anyway.

309
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,108
That's amusing.

310
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,193
Why don't you write about
a new dating rumor

311
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,738
instead of one that'll be over soon?

312
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,156
A new dating rumor?

313
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,785
I'm joining Kang Pil-gu, you see.

314
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,121
"Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na
Said to Be Dating."

315
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,999
I'll make sure you land an exclusive
within two months.

316
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,767
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

317
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,068
I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

318
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,362
I have a whole box at home.

319
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,289
What is it?

320
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,249
Well…

321
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,334
Something you want to say?

322
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,669
No, I just…

323
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,466
Did your friend tell you
he failed the audition because of me?

324
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,926
No, that's not it.

325
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,640
Well, he didn't say much,
but I think you really hurt his feelings.

326
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,226
-You think he's got talent, don't you?
-Yeah.

327
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,812
But he fails every audition, doesn't he?

328
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,481
-Yeah.
-I'm sure he thinks

329
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,067
he just hasn't had the chance
to show what he can do,

330
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,111
but he'd be amazing if he did, right?

331
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,446
But he's wrong.

332
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,865
Your friend is overconfident.

333
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,326
There's a paper-thin line
between confidence and arrogance.

334
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,495
Knowing your place
is essential for actors.

335
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,875
Then maybe you should
give up on melodramas.

336
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,127
What?

337
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,837
You're getting old,
and no one's sending you new scripts.

338
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,131
So maybe you should
stick with Kang Pil-gu.

339
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,759
You said knowing your place
is essential for actors.

340
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,723
How could you say that to me?

341
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,437
Damn it.

342
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,814
Ms. Gwon Se-na.

343
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,190
Is this some kind of joke?

344
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,900
Does Mr. Lim know you're a two-timer?

345
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,277
Why can't you end a relationship
before starting a new one?

346
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,946
Put yourself in the other person's shoes!

347
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,869
Why are you getting so worked up
over someone else's relationship?

348
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,371
Fine.

349
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,918
We'll wait and see
if Mr. Lim ends up being your boyfriend.

350
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,005
I'm more interested in
your current boyfriend.

351
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,717
I don't care about writing an article
about your affair.

352
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,095
Just tell me about him.

353
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,142
Assemblyman Ha Gee-wan.
You know him, right?

354
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,645
Assemblyman Ha and your boyfriend

355
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,856
seem to know each other well.

356
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,277
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

357
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,154
Do you have a life to spare?

358
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,449
I've looked into you a bit.

359
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:08,703
You were looking into my boyfriend
and then got transferred to the tabloid.

360
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,204
If you keep digging into him,

361
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,458
it won't end with you
getting kicked off the political desk.

362
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,252
Whether I get kicked off
the political desk or fired,

363
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,171
that's my business.

364
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,255
However,

365
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,050
now that you've met me,

366
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,886
you'll need to tell me
everything about him.

367
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,014
And why exactly

368
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,141
would I do that?

369
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,393
You already know.

370
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:37,815
That man's a damn bastard
who harms the greater good

371
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,609
and moral decency.

372
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,199
You weren't expecting

373
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,951
to get what you wanted
all at once today, were you?

374
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,048
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

375
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,760
Let's get to know each other, shall we?

376
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:19,899
Sure.

377
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,071
That being said,

378
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,282
I'll give you a tip
before my dating rumor gets leaked.

379
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,701
I'm sure you'll find this amusing.

380
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,538
It's a blockbuster scandal.

381
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:39,961
She's insane.

382
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,673
Who does she think she is,
saying he'll date her?

383
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,802
Did you find out anything?

384
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,974
Nothing in particular.

385
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,227
Nothing? How about staying
at the entertainment desk for good?

386
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,813
Damn it.

387
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,611
You're home early.

388
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,529
Yeah.

389
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,666
At least wash your hands first.

390
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,134
-Hey, where did you buy the rice cooker?
-Why?

391
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,844
My friend who lives alone wants one.

392
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:30,761
It's expensive.

393
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,640
Jeez, you don't have to say it like that.

394
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,561
MELOMASTER

395
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,817
CHATS
MELOMASTER

396
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,989
MELOMASTER'S ITEMS FOR SALE

397
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,210
He hasn't marked it as sold.

398
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,463
Is he a commercial seller?

399
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,931
Onion!

400
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,515
ONION
SOULISHERE SENT YOU A MESSAGE.

401
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,813
Would it be possible
to buy another rice cooker from you?

402
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,608
I noticed a few more boxes in the photo.

403
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,818
Yes, of course.

404
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,946
Wait. No, I can't.

405
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,323
I sold a few of the down jackets
you received as gifts,

406
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,492
and someone reported me
as a commercial seller.

407
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,413
MELOMASTER:
OH…

408
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,331
I'm sorry.

409
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,459
I gave away the rest as gifts to friends.

410
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,378
So he's not a commercial seller.

411
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,507
I noticed it wasn't marked as sold,
so I thought I'd ask.

412
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,926
It was my first time using Onion,
so I didn't know.

413
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,680
You seem to stay up late.

414
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,473
I usually do.

415
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,811
I was watching Kang Pil-gu.

416
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,188
I'm rewatching it
to brush up for the new season.

417
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,650
You seem like a bigger fan than me.

418
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,491
Have you seen Kang Pil-gu in person,
by any chance?

419
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,326
I have.

420
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,661
Really?

421
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,246
So have I!

422
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,914
Seriously?

423
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,499
Is that so?

424
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:26,752
What did you think of him?

425
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,131
He was very…

426
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,468
He was really cool, of course.

427
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,595
He's manly,

428
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,306
yet still has that boyish charm.

429
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,560
Do I really?

430
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,480
Come on.

431
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:47,857
Come on.

432
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,068
He's getting up there in age.

433
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,194
I thought he looked…

434
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,614
pretty old.

435
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,951
Come on.

436
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,204
You can be old and still be cool.

437
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:46,123
Everyone has their own kind of charm
that suits their age.

438
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,793
Do you think so?

439
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:49,794
Do you think so?

440
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,671
By the way,
why do you need another rice cooker?

441
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,840
My younger sibling's friend needs one.

442
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,010
Do you live with your younger sibling?

443
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,346
I live with my younger sibling too.

444
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,847
Oh, really?

445
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,433
Same here.
It's just my younger sibling and me.

446
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,268
Our parents passed away at an early age.

447
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,776
That must've been tough.

448
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,281
I've been the man of the house
since I was young, so I get it.

449
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,911
I used to be timid when making decisions,
but now I'm really decisive.

450
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,456
Growing up in the real world
without anyone to look out for me

451
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,958
forced me to act tough.

452
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,378
Why am I telling him this?

453
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,554
Ms. Kim?

454
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,222
Excuse me, sir.

455
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,103
We need to cancel
all the afternoon appointments.

456
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,398
-Please tell the patients that I'm sorry.
-Of course.

457
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,774
You know actor Yoon Jung-ho, right?

458
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,152
He's a mature, charismatic actor
known for his strong acting.

459
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,946
There are rumors going around
that he's dating a psychiatrist

460
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,490
who is 30 years younger than him.

461
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:46,035
Word got out because he recommended
his young girlfriend's clinic

462
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,411
to a bunch of celebrities.

463
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,208
I'm telling you, I'm here!

464
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,834
I have to get
my prescription refilled anyway.

465
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,211
Don't worry, Mr. Hwang.

466
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,004
I came fully prepared
so no one would recognize me.

467
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,548
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

468
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,640
What the heck?

469
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,438
-Damn it.
-Hey!

470
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,564
What's going on?

471
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:30,120
How did you find out about this place?
I haven't told anyone!

472
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,040
Did you bug my house and my phone?

473
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,500
No, that's not it.

474
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,043
-I came here to…
-How can a newbie actor

475
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,337
have so much confidence in their acting?

476
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,632
That's bizarre to me.

477
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,760
I'm sorry, sir.

478
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,345
I get it now.

479
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,347
Are you here for revenge?

480
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,309
Now do you understand how awful it feels
when your family gets dragged?

481
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,687
What are you talking about?
I'm just here to--

482
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,356
This is why you should
always be nice to others!

483
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,732
I came here for something else!

484
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,818
Don't lie! I won't fall for it!

485
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,279
The director here is dating an actor,
and I'm here to cover the story,

486
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,697
you idiot!

487
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,490
"You idiot"?

488
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,033
That's right!
You were rude first, you idiot!

489
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,493
Now you're calling me an idiot?

490
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,245
-Wow.
-Jeez.

491
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,373
Are you telling the truth?
You're not here for me?

492
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,542
I just said that wasn't the case!

493
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,921
Hold on a second!

494
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,464
What are you doing?

495
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,174
Wait, 4451? That's the car.

496
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,676
-Start the car.
-Why?

497
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,304
-I have to follow that car!
-That has nothing to do with me.

498
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,430
You dragged me out!

499
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,099
-Start the car--
-Get out!

500
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,642
Where's your car key? Hurry up!

501
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,145
-Hey, hands off!
-Grab the steering wheel!

502
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,647
-Get going!
-Damn it.

503
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,320
Don't follow them too closely.
They might notice.

504
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,781
Are you ordering me around
because I'm an idiot superstar?

505
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,825
Why are you following that doctor anyway?

506
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,911
Do you promise not to tell anyone?

507
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,331
Seriously?
You're telling me to keep a secret?

508
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,875
You know actor Yoon Jung-ho, right?

509
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,002
They're dating.

510
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,087
No way!

511
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,965
That's at least a 30-year age gap!

512
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:08,135
Hold on. I know both of them.

513
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,763
I can't do this.
Get out of my car, and I'll be on my way.

514
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,389
-I don't think you can.
-Hey.

515
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,226
They're going on the highway! Now what?

516
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,811
What else? Follow them!

517
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,897
No, I'm making a U-turn.

518
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,733
-You can't do that on a highway! Just go!
-No!

519
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,069
SPORTS EUNSEONG

520
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,278
Leaving work?

521
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,156
Yes.

522
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,159
Buy me dinner.

523
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,496
We're at work.

524
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,082
Please buy me dinner, Mr. Lee.

525
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,625
I'm feeling hungry after working late.

526
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,004
The chef here

527
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,091
first studied design in New York,
but then turned to cooking.

528
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,678
Remember the restaurant near Hamilton Park
that we used to go to?

529
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,429
The taste and atmosphere
are pretty similar here.

530
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,806
You liked the steak there.

531
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,849
That place closed down.

532
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,810
The married couple who ran the place
worked well together

533
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,396
until the wife's affair
led to their divorce.

534
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,024
Maybe that's why the food went downhill
and the place went under.

535
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,947
Why does it sound like
you're badmouthing me?

536
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,658
I was talking about that couple.

537
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,326
Not us.

538
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,661
Don't you think I had a reason…

539
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,415
for leaving the way I did?

540
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,918
When the man you love
is on the brink of death,

541
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,170
and you marry just three months later,

542
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:28,924
no reason can justify that.

543
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,846
So, have you forgotten me completely?

544
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,940
That accident

545
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,569
basically shattered my right leg.

546
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,863
I thought I'd never stand again,

547
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,573
but somehow, like magic,

548
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,701
I was able to walk after a while.

549
00:33:56,744 --> 00:34:00,247
After more time passed, I was able to run.

550
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,752
My right leg still hurts
when the weather is bad,

551
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,879
but it's fine because I can run now…

552
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,049
despite thinking I'd never stand again.

553
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,764
Does that answer your question?

554
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,220
Why trust what an actor says?

555
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,973
Celebrities and non-celebrities
always end in disaster.

556
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,531
Get it together, Wi Jeong-sin.

557
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:18,867
This guy is Lim Hyeon-jun,
not Kang Pil-gu.

558
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,911
And I'm a reporter,
not a Kang Pil-gu fangirl.

559
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:21,829
Snap out of it.

560
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,626
Snap out of it.

561
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,089
What are you saying?

562
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,508
It's nothing.

563
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,719
I can't believe you can sleep
at a time like this.

564
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,848
-Where are we?
-Gangneung!

565
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,559
What? We came all the way to Gangneung?

566
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:47,187
I've been thinking while driving.

567
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:49,398
You're passed out next to me,

568
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,942
I'm a superstar tailing a veteran actor,

569
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,735
and I'm trying to figure out
how to make sense

570
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,529
of this ridiculous situation.

571
00:35:56,572 --> 00:36:00,659
Sure, I'm mostly to blame
for driving off in the first place.

572
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,494
But now that it's come to this,

573
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,162
I'll go along with the tailing

574
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,707
and make sure to pull it off flawlessly.

575
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,500
-Really?
-But in return,

576
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,586
you need to do something for me.

577
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,421
Just this once,

578
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,049
-write an article I ask you to.
-What?

579
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,343
You wrote so many articles about me

580
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,220
that I became
the center of the gossip mill.

581
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,098
But I'm willing to let all that go
for a single article.

582
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,726
I'm making this offer
because I feel generous right now,

583
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,978
so if you have a conscience,
just agree to it.

584
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,566
I never take requests for articles,

585
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,985
but I'll make an exception
under the condition

586
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,778
that it's absolutely true

587
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,655
and newsworthy.

588
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,073
Good.

589
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,534
From this point on, you owe me an article.

590
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,827
What's it about?

591
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,037
I don't know yet.

592
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,457
Maybe a night's stay at a hotel?

593
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,833
What?

594
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,210
Are you crazy?
Why would I spend the night with you?

595
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,296
I meant those two!

596
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,132
Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

597
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,384
Look, that car is heading into a hotel!

598
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,096
Jeez.

599
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,739
Man, I can't believe
they got past that age difference.

600
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,243
Jeez, I never thought of him as the type.

601
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,664
-Look at this hotel.
-No, my battery is dead!

602
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,959
-Can you give me your phone?
-Why?

603
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,418
-Just give it to me!
-Absolutely not!

604
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,212
What do you want with it?

605
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,129
They went inside!

606
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,632
Are you telling me
to take photos of them now?

607
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,801
I bet the dashcam caught them. Let's see.

608
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,594
I sent my dashcam in for repairs.

609
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,012
-Don't touch it.
-What?

610
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,306
That means we have to camp out!

611
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,683
How is that my fault?

612
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,767
Wait a minute.

613
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,186
Do you mean we have to wait
until they come out?

614
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,982
-We didn't come all this way for nothing.
-What does that have to do with me?

615
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,650
Get out.

616
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,777
-Just get out!
-No, I can't!

617
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,201
First, you just climbed into my car.

618
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,828
Now, you just made yourself comfortable.

619
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,162
You're the one who put me in here.

620
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,711
Do you want me to
get some coffee and gimbap?

621
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,879
No, thank you.

622
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,136
As far as cursed connections go,
ours is the worst.

623
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,513
You stormed into the restroom
while I was taking care of business,

624
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,681
wrote a dating rumor piece,

625
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,767
wrote a string of articles trashing me,
and exposed my mom's private life.

626
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,230
I've been trying to rise above so much
these past few months

627
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,065
that I might start floating any second.

628
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,235
You got me demoted to entertainment
because of the red carpet fiasco,

629
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,778
kicked me out of a press conference,

630
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:42,988
and thought I was a hostess.

631
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,282
You're equally challenging.

632
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,909
That's why I said
we're a cursed connection.

633
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,912
There's a fine line
between cursed and fated--

634
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,248
Don't say that! It made my blood run cold!

635
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,791
-I bet it really woke you up.
-It did.

636
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,628
Are you just going to sit here?

637
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,339
You had no problem
sneaking into my hospital room.

638
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,091
So why are you just waiting now?

639
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,302
This hotel is 20 stories tall.
What else can I do but wait?

640
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,387
So we're just going to sit here
and do nothing?

641
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,764
We need to at least try something.

642
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,724
Should I start a fire, then?

643
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,526
Damn it.

644
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,374
Fire!

645
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,502
You're insane!

646
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,504
Have you lost your mind?
Did you really start a fire?

647
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,463
They're coming out!

648
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,471
Your phone! Where's your phone?

649
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,555
Give it to me.

650
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,613
Are you kidding me?

651
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,739
Seriously?

652
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:13,453
You didn't cover a story.
You committed a crime!

653
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,913
It wasn't me!

654
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,833
I just went in to check their floor
when it went off!

655
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,326
Who believes what the paparazzi say?

656
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,870
-What? Paparazzi?
-Jeez.

657
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,413
That poor man.

658
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,248
Even at 70, he's not free to date.

659
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,209
In the US, people would just say
he's impressive and move on.

660
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,086
Now, people are going to curse him out

661
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,129
because of you.

662
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,089
It's not my fault
this country isn't the US.

663
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:09,593
I bet part of you is doing this
because you're jealous of others dating.

664
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,554
When you see a happy couple,
do you feel the urge to rip them apart?

665
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,347
Do I seem that extreme to you?

666
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,099
Is there any proof that you aren't?

667
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,644
Be honest.

668
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,856
You've never dated anyone, have you?

669
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,107
I bet you've been single since birth.

670
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:25,609
No, I'm not!

671
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,195
I can't blame you for being in denial.

672
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,571
Let's say you're not.

673
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,865
How many guys
have you dated after college?

674
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,658
I guess about…

675
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:35,911
Six?

676
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,831
Six guys?

677
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,293
-That's hilarious!
-I'm not lying!

678
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,087
Seriously? Six?

679
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,007
Man, that's even weirder.

680
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,470
So are you saying
you went through six guys since then?

681
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,387
Seriously?

682
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,014
Holy cow.

683
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,017
In any case, guys always hit on me first.

684
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,186
I have the looks, you know.

685
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,356
Man, that's hilarious.

686
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,899
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.

687
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,238
I just can't make it
past the two-month mark.

688
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,199
Why is that?

689
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,076
People keep talking about
the rights of perpetrators,

690
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,954
but I want to ask them
what they think human rights mean.

691
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,163
Our country is turning into a place

692
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,499
where perpetrators have rights
but victims don't.

693
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,750
What do you think, Yong-u?

694
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:27,087
In terms of defining human rights,
especially victims' rights…

695
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,423
I'm naturally interested in social issues
because of my job.

696
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,426
Stand up, hold, engage your arms.

697
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,928
Now, go down slowly.

698
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,596
Just like that.

699
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,765
Now, hold the tension…

700
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,141
What? Sexual harassment?

701
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,811
I asked how they harassed the victim,
you little shit!

702
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,020
You don't know?

703
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,148
You should at least f****** know
if they touched her chest or butt,

704
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,566
you f****** idiot!

705
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,944
What the hell did you cover all day?

706
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,030
Didn't I say we need to rip apart bastards
who sexually harass people?

707
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,323
Do your damn job or quit!

708
00:42:58,952 --> 00:42:59,786
Hey, honey!

709
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:04,124
The only thing I did wrong
was doing my best at my job.

710
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,876
I wanted to act with integrity,

711
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,795
but men with no integrity
never gave me a shot.

712
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,465
Jeez, don't try to sugarcoat it.

713
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,426
You basically did whatever you wanted

714
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,469
and then got dumped within two months.

715
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,486
I won't deny it,
and everything is a two-way street.

716
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,324
I suppose I'm partially to blame
for them not liking me anymore.

717
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:40,243
You talk about having integrity,
yet you denied the dating rumor.

718
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,412
That was three years ago,
and I saw her for a month.

719
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,914
-Jeez.
-Are most celebrities like that?

720
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:48,043
Can't you just admit you're dating
and go about it naturally?

721
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,920
It's not that easy for people like us.

722
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:54,090
I'm sure that's what you think,
but people are all the same.

723
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:58,136
The second you think you're special,
that's when trouble starts.

724
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,223
"Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na
Said to Be Dating."

725
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,643
I'll make sure you land an exclusive
within two months.

726
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,232
So you basically test the waters
with non-celebrities

727
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,527
but then secretly date a superstar
like Gwon Se-na.

728
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,367
Gwon Se-na?

729
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,454
I saw her when you were in the hospital.

730
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,206
She came to see you.

731
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:29,959
Who are you?

732
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,844
Don't worry.

733
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,263
If I wanted to write a dating rumor,
I would've done it then.

734
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:50,730
You dig up what people
absolutely want to keep private

735
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,900
and make them uncomfortable.

736
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,026
Well, that's what my job--

737
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:55,985
Let's go.

738
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:58,279
But…

739
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,491
What happened today wasn't deliberate,
but I'm sorry all the same.

740
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:47,829
Get home safely.

741
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:52,333
Ever since I met you,
my life has been a mess.

742
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,879
Whether it's your fault or not…

743
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,382
let's never cross paths again.

744
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,137
It all ends today.

745
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,398
I'm sure that's what you think,

746
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,234
but people are all the same.

747
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,695
The second you think you're special,
that's when trouble starts.

748
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,288
So you basically test the waters
with non-celebrities

749
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:16,292
but then secretly date a superstar
like Gwon Se-na.

750
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,383

751
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,052

and make them uncomfortable.

754
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,961
YOON JUNG-HO

755
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,590
"YOUR CAVITIES ARE UNDER ARREST!
EXTRA-STRENGTH WHITENING INVESTIGATOR"

756
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,345
Let's never cross paths again.

757
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,888
It all ends today.

758

"YOUR CAVITIES ARE UNDER ARREST!

759
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,873
Onion!

760
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:41,919
Are you asleep?

761
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:47,550
Not yet.

762
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,969
Why are you still up, Melomaster?

763
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,971
I just…

764
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,725
I had something upsetting happen today.

765
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:57,894
Me too.

766
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,147
Did something happen to you, Soulishere?

767
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,027
It was one of those days

768
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,488
that made me think,
"Who am I? Where am I?"

769
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:13,618
It sounds like
you're fed up with your job.

770
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,579
You hit the nail on the head.
How did you know?

771
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,999
People are pretty much the same, right?

772
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,210
Melomaster,

773
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,171
are you who you dreamed of
becoming as a kid?

774
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,808
If you're asking
if my childhood dreams came true,

775
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,476
I guess they did.

776
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,977
You're lucky.

777
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,939
What did you dream of becoming as a kid?

778
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,525
I wanted to be like my mom.

779
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:52,115
"Mom"?

780
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:54,075
Your mom?

781
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,285
When I was really young,

782
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,162
I got a lot of attention
because of my mom.

783
00:49:58,246 --> 00:49:59,122
Let's go again.

784
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,958
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

785
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:03,751
I won again.

786
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,420
Jin-hui, are you having fun?

787
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,214
Goodness, you must be
Ms. Seong Ae-suk's son.

788
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,465
You look just like her.

789
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,092
Do you know my mom?

790
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,886
Of course.
Your mom is a very famous actress.

791
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,304
I didn't know at the time

792
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,307
that it was curiosity masked in kindness.

793
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,894
When I grew older
and discovered the truth,

794
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,313
the shock has stayed with me to this day.

795
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,108
-Seriously, Mom!
-Hyeon-jun, let go of me!

796
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,819
My mom gave me a dream,

797
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,572
but she also got in the way of it.

798
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,240
I heard your mother is
actress Seong Ae-suk…

799
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,493
It says your mother is Seong Ae-suk,
an erotic film actress from the '70s.

800
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:41,289
Sometimes, my family makes life harder
than anyone else.

801
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:44,167
Maybe that's why I'm so obsessed

802
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,836
with how others see me.

803
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:52,925
Why am I saying all this
to someone I don't even know?

804
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,344
I envy that, though.

805
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,472
I envy that, though.

806
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,808
You envy me?

807
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:07,190
I wish my family
would rely on me financially.

808
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:08,941
On paydays,

809
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,862
I wish I could treat my family
to tons of snow crab.

810
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,448
And on days like my mom's birthday,

811
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,618
I want her to ask me for a luxury bag
and make me pay for it over 24 months.

812
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:19,952
I dream of such things.

813
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:24,373
I wish my family
would use me like that, even once.

814
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,919
I guess I was immature.

815
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,131
I actually

816
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,217
look a lot like Lim Hyeon-jun.

817
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,718
What? Really?

818
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:37,428
I even sound like him,

819
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,347
to the point where everyone falls for it.

820
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,556
You're joking.

821
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:43,643
I'm telling the truth.

822
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,937
It sounds really similar.
Want to check for yourself?

823
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,317
If you schedule a transaction on Onion,

824
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,444
you can talk on the app for 30 minutes.

825
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,071
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL MELOMASTER?
"CALL"

826
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,489
I guess I'll find out.

827
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,490
How about this Friday?

828
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:58,783
At 10:30 p.m.

829
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:08,459
AN APPOINTMENT HAS BEEN BOOKED.
"SCHEDULE"

830
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,766
-Honey, have you seen this video?
-Yeah?

831
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,393
-What video?
-Yoon Jung-ho is in it.

832
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,937
He's dating a doctor
30 years younger than him.

833
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,606
-She's 30 years younger?
-Yeah, he's a piece of trash!

834
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,859
Jeez, it's something you'd see
out of Hollywood.

835
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,069
Can you believe it?
She's 30 years younger!

840
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,248
It says "in love,"
but I read it as "senile."

841
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,875
Do they think they're in Hollywood?

842
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,293
The doctor's already been doxxed.

843
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,627
When Yoon Jung-ho
was on his second divorce,

844
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,254
she was crawling around in diapers.

845
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,006
It's none of your business
if they like each other.

846
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,341
An article about his fifth divorce
will be released three years from now.

847
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,010
Who believes what the paparazzi say?

848
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,720
That poor man.

849
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,513
Even at 70, he's not free to date.

850
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:05,433
Now, people are going to curse him out
because of you.

If you come up with ten useful scoops

I'll get you back to the main paper

You're leaving?

It hasn't even been three months,

00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,672
I'm sorry.

859
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,215
Do you hate it that much here?

860
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,427
It feels like

861
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,971
my self-esteem is slipping.

862
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,851
Ms. Wi, did you always possess
weak self-esteem?

863
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,147
I guess so.

864
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,274
Fine.

865
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,985
You should go
if your self-esteem is slipping.

866
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,529
But…

867
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,158
-Are you okay, Chief?
-What do you mean?

868
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,578
You were an economic reporter
for quite some time.

869
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:09,830
I left all that behind.

870
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,291
You need to be humble
if you have something to lose.

871
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,918
If you had nothing to lose back then,

872
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,045
would it have been much different now?

873
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,382
I'd be living like you,
not knowing to be afraid.

874
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,758
And not knowing…

875
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,553
that there are things
more precious than my own life.

876
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,891
It was a short time,

877
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,060
but I learned a lot from you.

878
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,605
Enough. You're making me cringe.

879
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:39,568
Here we go.

880
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:43,280
She wasn't with us long,
but here's to Ms. Wi!

881
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,408
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

882
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,450
Thanks for your hard work.

883
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,537
I'm sad you're leaving.

884
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,707
-You did well.
-I'm sad to see you go.

885
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:54,792
Drink up.

886
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,210
Ms. Wi, are you okay?

887
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,504
Ms. Wi, wake up.

888
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,592
Here, sit up.

889
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,427
Have some water.

890
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,512
-Drink this.
-Jeez.

891
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,681
You can't drink it?

892
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,809
If it's too much, do you want to go home?

893
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:55,770
Yes.

894
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,063
Despite the late hour

895
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,273
and the short notice,

896
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:03,736
I'm very grateful to all the reporters
who could make it here today.

897
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:07,656
I have called this press conference

898
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,034
to address the dating rumors
involving a female doctor.

899
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,830
The person identified as my partner
in an exclusive report

900
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:17,208
is actually my biological daughter.

901
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,882
Okay, here we go.

902
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:38,270
Regarding Sports Eunseong,
the media outlet behind the article,

903
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,022
and Reporter Wi Jeong-sin,

904
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,526
I will be suing them for defamation.

905
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,116
Hello?

906
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,252
Hello?

907
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,419
Hello?

908
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,422
SOULISHERE (ONION FRIEND)

909
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,677
Hello?

910
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:15,891
Hello?

911
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,602
Hello?

912
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,524
Hello?

913
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:25,818
Is anyone there?

914
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,172
Was that her boyfriend?

915
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,465
Is she married?

916
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:38,057
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

917
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,269
Take care of this yourself.

918
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,438
If he doesn't drop the lawsuit,
don't even think of coming in.

919
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,565
Did he say he'd drop the lawsuit?

920
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:48,400
Just start by apologizing.

921
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,819
Did you call because you were concerned?

922
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,949
You really do sound
exactly like Lim Hyeon-jun.

923
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,200
Thank you.

924
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,411
There's this total jerk
who's been giving me a really hard time.

925
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,247
Get in.

926
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,790
Pride doesn't put food on the table.

927
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:03,958
You don't understand!

928
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:07,878
Are you interested in me?

929
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,051
