1
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,111
Hey, Byeong-gi!

2
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,159
Byeong-gi, the pink dress!

3
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,215
Soulishere?

4
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:15,886
It feels strange meeting you
after only talking on the app.

5
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,555
How should I put it?

6
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,599
It's like seeing an animated character
from my imagination

7
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,643
come to life.

8
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,438
I can't quite believe
you're the same person as well.

9
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,608
It might take some time
to get used to this.

10
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,526
Of course.

11
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,027
It's our first time
meeting face to face, after all.

12
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:34,822
Technically,

13
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,574
it's not our first time.

14
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,785
We briefly met
when I bought the rice cooker.

15
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,706
Oh, that's right.

16
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,250
- We saw each other for a moment.
- Yes.

17
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,044
Go ahead and answer your phone.

18
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,212
Excuse me for a moment, then.

19
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,673
MR. LIM HYEON-JUN

20
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,604
It's okay. It's not an important call.

21
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:07,980
You know,

22
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,691
your voice sounds different
than it does on the phone.

23
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,067
Really?

24
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:15,404
You sounded exactly like Kang Pil-gu
when we talked on the phone.

25
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,157
Your Kang Pil-gu impression was so good,

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,367
I wondered if you really were him.

27
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:25,289
That's right,
I did a Kang Pil-gu impression.

28
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,294
Don't you remember?

29
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,050
I think that was our first phone call…

30
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,013
The thing is…

31
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,390
Then,

32
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,477
do you remember the station
where we met for the rice cooker deal?

33
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,480
The station where we met
for the rice cooker transaction?

34
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,068
Seongil Station!

35
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,611
That was Seongil Station, right?

36
00:03:56,362 --> 00:04:00,574
Then, do you remember
which season of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>

37
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,867
I said was my favorite?

38
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,120
Your favorite season of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i> was…

39
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,165
The best one, Season three.

40
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,125
Okay, last question.

41
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,627
Go ahead and ask.

42
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,711
- Let's circle back.
- Okay.

43
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,880
When we first talked on the phone,

44
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,841
what was the Kang Pil-gu impression
you did for me?

45
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,219
Let me think…

46
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,941
"You…"

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,369
<i>What did you do? What was it?</i>

48
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,588
"They say you can't fix people."

49
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,216
"But I do."

50
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,094
That's right!

51
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,055
So you do remember.

52
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,391
That's my favorite line.

53
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,149
- I'm sorry, but I need to message someone.
- Of course.

54
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,904
<i>Mr. Lim, why don't you go home?</i>

55
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,781
<i>I'll take care of this.</i>

56
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,411
The weather is so nice today.

57
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,748
Gosh, look over there.

58
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,249
The sky looks amazing today.

59
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,838
Wow, are those all stars?

60
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,301
Damn it.

61
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,649
<i>You're here from Onion, right?</i>

62
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,610
<i>I'm a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.</i>

63
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,403
<i>Have you seen Kang Pil-gu in person?</i>

64
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,280
<i>- I have.</i>
<i>- What did you think of him?</i>

65
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,948
<i>He was really cool, of course.</i>

66
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,035
<i>He's manly,</i>
<i>yet still has that boyish charm.</i>

67
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,579
<i>I'm not married.</i>

68
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,626
It's nice to hear your voice.

69
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,880
I feel the same.

70
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,050
<i>Can you say a line from </i>Kang Pil-gu<i>?</i>

71
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>Wow, how are you so good at impressions?</i>

72
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,053
<i>My gosh, you sounded just like him.</i>

73
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,681
But she sounded like
a completely different person.

74
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,683
<i>Of course, I don't intend to apologize.</i>

75
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,852
I don't even want an apology anymore.

76
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,271
It's ridiculous to cater to every tantrum

77
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,856
of a middle-aged man acting like a diva!

78
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,402
I can destroy you
with nothing more than my writing.

79
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,362
That's right.

80
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,280
I don't want

81
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,032
your apology.

82
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,743
Seriously?

83
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,830
She was that rude to me,
when she was my fan all along?

84
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,665
How does that make sense?

85
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,250
<i>It's the first time in my life.</i>

86
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,336
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

87
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,548
<i>We got off to a bit of an unusual start,</i>

88
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,217
<i>but I want to get to know you better.</i>

89
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,137
<i>Will you meet me in person?</i>

90
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,143
I've been curious about something.

91
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,395
Why is your nickname "Soulishere"?

92
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,732
You see, my name is Wi Jeong-sin.

93
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,486
I thought "Jeong-sinishere"
would sound a little strange,

94
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,280
so I went with "Soulishere" instead.

95
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,785
Oh, I see.

96
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,121
Your name is so unique.

97
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,123
I'm sure anyone who hears it once
would never forget it.

98
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,208
My name is Bak Byeong…

99
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,336
Byeong?

100
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,257
It's Jun-gi.

101
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,385
By the way…

102
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,640
Thank you

103
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,392
for meeting me today.

104
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,188
It took some courage
to ask you to meet me,

105
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,732
but I'm sure it took courage for you
to show up today.

106
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,860
When you asked for some time
to think it over,

107
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,905
I was really nervous
waiting for your response.

108
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,161
I actually have something to tell you.

109
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,290
That's why I came here today.

110
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,545
Jeez.

111
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,047
Is everything going okay?

112
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,716
Darn it.

113
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,261
He writes dramas for a living,
so he's probably handling it fine.

114
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,166
I was engaged to someone before.

115
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,168
While preparing for the wedding,

116
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,754
we bickered over household goods,
the wedding venue,

117
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,590
and our honeymoon destination,
which turned into arguments.

118
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,051
Then our arguments
led to our parents arguing.

119
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,972
Eventually, it got to the point
where both families opposed the marriage.

120
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,227
To be honest with you,

121
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,064
I don't think I'm ready
to be with someone new.

122
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,316
Seeing someone while I'm still healing

123
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,610
would be unfair to that person.

124
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,991
So that's why you asked for time to think.

125
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,829
Thank you for reaching out to me first,

126
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,747
but I'm afraid

127
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,708
I'll have to say no.

128
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,050
Why the hell didn't you answer your phone?

129
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,552
Do you know how many times I called?

130
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,178
It would've thrown me off!

131
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,847
I told you I'd take care of it.

132
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,890
Why couldn't you just sit tight and wait?

133
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,350
It was an emergency situation!

134
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,435
An emergency situation!

135
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,603
Like what?
Was she someone you knew or something?

136
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,604
Yes!

137
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,564
What?

138
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,571
EPISODE 9

139
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,869
You're home.

140
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,454
<i>They say you can't fix people.</i>

141
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,456
What's wrong with you?

142
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,874
<i>But I do.</i>

143
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,834
Jeong-sin, I have amazing news!

144
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,085
I passed my audition.

145
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:30,630
And it was for <i>Good Detective Kang Pil-gu</i>!

146
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,216
<i>- Kang Pil-gu?</i>
- Yeah, I'm a rookie detective.

147
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,259
Awesome, right?

148
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,555
Good for you.

149
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
Congratulations.

150
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,477
That's it? This is worthy of an exclusive.

151
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,229
Not everything can be an exclusive.

152
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,233
Something happened today, didn't it?

153
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,485
No.

154
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,028
Congratulations.

155
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,450
Maybe she got turned down
looking like that.

156
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,829
Jeong-sin, did that guy turn you down?

157
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,999
Yeah, he definitely turned you down.

158
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,834
Jeez.

159
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,588
Mr. Lim, can I please
write a script about this?

160
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,633
Come on, Bak Byeong-gi.

161
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,177
Man, how could something like this happen?

162
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,595
It's like a movie.

163
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,349
A top actor does a secondhand trade
and meets the buyer in real life.

164
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,643
But it turns out, it's someone he knows.

165
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,896
My gosh, Wi Jeong-sin.

166
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,981
Right.

167
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,275
I knew her name sounded familiar.

168
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,445
She's the reporter who wrote
all those articles about you, right?

169
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,490
- Yes.
- Right.

170
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,619
Isn't this actually a good thing?

171
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,913
You know exactly who she is.

172
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,584
I can't tell
if this is a good thing or not.

173
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,087
The two of us
don't get along in real life,

174
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,964
but we like each other on Onion.

175
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,549
I know that woman is this woman,

176
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,926
but that woman doesn't know
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun.

177
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,428
This is just…

178
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,348
It's just a total mess.

179
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,980
Why are you smirking like that anyway?

180
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,648
What did you and Ms. Wi talk about?

181
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,692
Oh, right.

182
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,610
I ended it smoothly
without going overboard.

183
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,197
The way I see it,

184
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,367
you won't get closure on this right away.

185
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,536
Take your time untangling the mess,

186
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,205
and in the meantime,
let's focus on this week's shoot.

187
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,625
I added some more action sequences
to the scenes.

188
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,628
Do you really want to talk about
action scenes at a time like this?

189
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,007
Do you think I'm in my right mind
to talk about action scenes?

190
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,427
Did you forget our promise already?

191
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,890
Do I have to play back
the recording from earlier?

192
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,518
Why do you punks
record everything these days?

193
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,146
Hey, Mr. Lim!

194
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,147
What?

195
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,940
What is it now?

196
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,610
Isn't it possible she sent someone else,

197
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,028
just like we did?

198
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,281
I just got chills.

199
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,741
I did too.

200
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,291
INVITATION: PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR THE DRAMA "IMPERFECT LOVE"

201
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>Thank you for reaching out to me first,</i>

202
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,131
<i>but I'm afraid</i>

203
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,925
<i>I'll have to say no.</i>

204
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:34,314
<i>I'll have to say no.</i>

205
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,864
<i>I'll have to say no.</i>

206
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,421
<i>I'll have to say no.</i>

207
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,514
Darn it, I forgot again.

208
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,563
SPORTS EUNSEONG

209
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,483
<i>It rained a lot today.</i>

210
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,610
<i>I hope you didn't get caught in it.</i>

211
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,542
<i>It's supposed to rain today.</i>

212
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,419
<i>Did you bring an umbrella?</i>

213
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,307
Why has it been raining so much lately?

214
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,042
Mr. Lee.

215
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,710
Are you just getting off work?

216
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,629
Take this with you.

217
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,922
It's okay. You should take it.

218
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,007
Just take it.

219
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,556
Thank you.

220
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,482
Get home safely.

221
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,420
<i>Does the rice cooker work?</i>

222
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,422
<i>If it doesn't,</i>
<i>I'll give you a 100% refund.</i>

223
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,800
<i>It was nice meeting you earlier too.</i>

224
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,845
What are you doing?

225
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,433
Serve up the rice.

226
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,352
I'm not eating.

227
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,270
What? You're not…

228
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,856
Why won't you eat? I already made dinner.

229
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,280
<i>There was a nude scene in the movie.</i>

230
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,408
Were those the actor's real buttocks?

231
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,870
No, we used a body double for that scene.

232
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,456
Mr. Kim Dong-jun, I heard
you and your co-star didn't get along.

233
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,916
Could you clear up the rumors?

234
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,502
Those rumors aren't true.

235
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,045
Your face looks a little different.

236
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,005
Did you get Botox or fillers?

237
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,218
I just went on a strict diet.

238
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,096
You've been in a long-term relationship
with actress Baek Da-yeon,

239
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,432
but there are rumors
saying that you recently broke up.

240
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,225
Can you confirm if that's true?

241
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,354
We're here today

242
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,524
to talk about the movie
<i>Jobless and in Love.</i>

243
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,026
So I'm afraid I'll have to pass
on personal questions.

244
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,697
So you'll admit to the dating rumors
but stay silent about the breakup rumors?

245
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,823
We'll move on to my question.

246
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,533
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

247
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,912
Your character, Hyeon-su, appears to be
completely abandoned by society

248
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,874
and struggles with self-compassion.

249
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,336
I imagine you had your own struggles
preparing for this role.

250
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,590
Can you share how you brought
Hyeon-su to life on screen?

251
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,469
The first thing I did
after deciding to do this film

252
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,345
was to cancel my plans with everyone.

253
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,556
I did that because in the movie,

254
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,225
Hyeon-su leads a socially isolated life.

255
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,270
The first thing I wanted to
communicate to the audience

256
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,064
when I chose to work on this film…

257
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,735
Hello.

258
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,197
Hello.

259
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,656
I'm from Sports Eunseong--

260
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,657
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin, right?

261
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,327
Could I get your business card?

262
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:58,745
Of course.

263
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,790
Here you go.

264
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,750
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN
SPORTS EUNSEONG

265
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,961
Thank you for your great question today.

266
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,590
I wanted to give a thoughtful answer,
so I had to think it through.

267
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,176
I was afraid my response
wouldn't measure up to the question.

268
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,137
To be honest, I was kind of scared.

269
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,223
Was my answer okay?

270
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,475
Read my article and you'll see.

271
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,520
The next time you work on a good project,

272
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,021
can I interview you again?

273
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,106
You'll be the first person I contact.

274
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,235
By the way…

275
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,073
my girlfriend and I are still together.

276
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,369
Technically, we're somewhere
between dating and breaking up.

277
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,914
But I really love her,
so I'm going to try harder.

278
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:45,875
Is that

279
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,294
something that's possible just by trying?

280
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,713
I don't know.

281
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,049
I'm just going to do my best

282
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,926
so I don't regret it later.

283
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,563
<i>Is that something</i>
<i>that's possible just by trying?</i>

288

<i>All right, let's do this!</i>

289
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:24,956
We're all set, Director.

290
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,166
- We're rolling now.
- Rolling!

291
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,710
Ready.

292
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,627
Action.

293
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,964
Wow.

294
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,549
It's just as I heard.

295
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,677
You're not a cop.
You're just a thug with a badge.

296
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,263
It slipped my mind for a moment.

297
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,264
What?

298
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,516
They say you can't fix people.

299
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,810
But I do.

300
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,480
Nobody's a match for me
when it comes to fixing people.

301
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,446
Damn it!

302
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,415
What the hell?

303
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:11,920
Come here.

304
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,589
Cut!

305
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,260
That was great.

306
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,474
Mr. Lim, this scene will be in slo-mo,
so try to look cooler.

307
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,809
You're a bit too upright right now.

308
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,645
I'll show you how it's done.

309
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,730
You're avoiding the attack
like this right now.

310
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,066
I need you to stay in the position,
but sink down lower.

311
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,444
Don't hit the floor, though.
Stop right before it.

312
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,779
And then do a front flip.

313
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:41,950
Like that.

314
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,120
Seok-ho, just trust Mr. Lim
and go all in when you attack him.

315
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,289
- Lower?
- Yes.

316
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,041
Okay, let's go again!

317
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,084
- Go for it!
- You can do it!

318
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,543
You've got this!

319
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,587
- All right. Ready.
- Ready!

320
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,049
- Action.
- Action!

321
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,468
Darn it. No hands, right?

322
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,854
How was that?

323
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,106
Was it okay?

324
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,607
- Cut.
- Cut!

325
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,611
- Again. Action.
- Action!

326
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,033
- Cut.
- Cut!

327
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,743
Are you okay, Mr. Lim?

328
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,745
Yes, I'm fine.

329
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,789
Okay, let's try that one more time!

330
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,124
- Let's try it one more time!
- Hold on.

331
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,209
- Mr. Lim, get down a bit lower.
- Be careful.

332
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,168
Hold on.

333
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,629
- All right. Ready.
- Ready!

334
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,173
- Action.
- Action!

335
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,508
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

336
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,389
Hey, are you okay?

337
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,227
I don't think this will work.

338
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,983
Bro, are you sure you're okay?

339
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,610
I'm fine.

340
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,571
I just tweaked my back.

341
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,281
Tweaked, my ass.

342
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,742
It sounded like
a bamboo branch snapping earlier.

343
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,244
Jeez, I said I'm fine.

344
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,413
Hey, that's good.

345
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,123
Forget it. We'll go with a stunt double.

346
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,541
What?

347
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,917
We can't do that.

348
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,127
There are a lot of
medium close-ups in this scene,

349
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,087
so Mr. Lim has to do it himself.

350
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:19,964
- Mr. Lim.
- Yes?

351
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,674
You can do this, right?

352
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,261
Yeah.

353
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,435
Let's go. Oh man.

354
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,686
Bro, what was that?

355
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,146
What do you mean?

356
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,272
Come on, you're acting weird.

357
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,066
Does the director have something on you?

358
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,067
Of course not.

359
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,860
It's me you're talking about.

360
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,988
Listen, Kang Pil-gu is me,
and I'm Kang Pil-gu!

361
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,240
Do you know how important this scene is?

362
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,950
You…

363
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,870
- Are we shooting?
- Come out when you're ready!

364
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:51,829
All right.

365
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,168
Something smells fishy, right?

366
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,252
Yes.

367
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,300
Do you want some more?

368
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,385
What's wrong with you?

369
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,897
ONION

370
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,402
<i>Is that something</i>
<i>that's possible just by trying?</i>

371
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,987
<i>I'm just going to do my best</i>

372
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,656
<i>so I don't regret it later.</i>

373
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,242
I JUST ARRIVED.
I'M WEARING A PINK DRESS.

374
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,000
Why are you just picking at your food
and staring into your phone?

375
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,418
No, I'm not.

376
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,106
Have some fried chicken, everyone!

377
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,528
You must be getting hungry by now.

378
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,612
Please enjoy this together.

379
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,701
- Thank you!
- We'll definitely enjoy it!

380
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,204
- This smells amazing!
- I've been craving fried chicken.

381
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,206
Have some fried chicken, guys!

382
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,042
This is so good!

383
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,546
- Anyway, last time…
- Yeah?

384
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,464
Did you hear that crunch?.

385
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,049
Right? It's so crispy.

386
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,094
So, is it good?

387
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,971
- Yes!
- It's delicious!

388
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,598
- It's tasty.
- Dip it in the sauce.

389
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,767
- It's so good.
- You sure can eat.

390
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,768
It's seriously good.

391
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,732
Hey, so we meet again.

392
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,153
- Is the fried chicken good?
- Yes, Mr. Lim. It's really good.

393
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,531
Come on, there's no need to be so formal.

394
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:53,659
What happened to the
"I feel like I already know you" vibe?

395
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,412
I didn't know any better then.
I'll be careful from now on, Mr. Lim.

396
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,580
You don't have to be careful!

397
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,457
Just relax, okay?

398
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,584
- Don't be so tense.
- I'm relaxed, sir.

399
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,127
- That's right. Relax.
- Hey, everyone.

400
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,545
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

401
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,964
- Hey, have some fried chicken.
- I've already eaten.

402
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,509
Mr. Lim, let me introduce you
to our new cast members.

403
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,262
- This is…
- That's our rookie detective

404
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,722
at the Gangseo Police Station,
Wi Hong-sin.

405
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,057
I'm Rookie Detective Wi Hong-sin, sir.

406
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,769
- The rookie detective?
- Yes.

407
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,020
Wait, then…

408
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,272
Who's playing the younger Pil-gu?

409
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,649
The younger Pil-gu?

410
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,193
Pil-gu… Where did he go?

411
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,861
- You auditioned for the younger Pil-gu.
- Yes.

412
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,154
- Did your roles switch?
- Yes.

413
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,239
There he comes.

414
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,157
- Why?
- Mr. Lim, over there.

415
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,325
Hello, everyone.

416
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,411
I'm Lim Seon-u, and I'll be playing
Kang Pil-gu's younger self.

417
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,830
I look forward to working with you.

418
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,672
I told you not to cast him!

419
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,216
Why bother asking me
if you were going to choose him anyway?

420
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,217
Mr. Lim.

421
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,719
We're on set right now.
There are crew members watching.

422
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,263
Look, Director.

423
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,265
If you were going to do
whatever you wanted,

424
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,184
why did you ask my opinion to begin with?

425
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,978
I tried to go along with your wish,

426
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,855
but Wi Hong-sin just didn't resemble you.

427
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,732
It'd look as if he'd become
a completely different person.

428
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,818
- It just wouldn't convince the viewers.
- The viewers--

429
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,819
But luckily,

430
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,281
Hong-sin was a good fit
for the role of rookie detective.

431
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,740
Try to be more understanding.

432
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,117
Good fit or not, he--

433
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,702
What's your problem
with Lim Seon-u, anyway?

434
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,830
He'll be playing your younger self,
so you won't even have to act with him.

435
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,039
I mean,

436
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,833
it's not that I have a problem with him--

437
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,460
Look, Mr. Lim.
We have a lot of scenes to shoot today,

438
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,212
so I have to get ready.
I hope you understand.

439
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,549
Wait, Director Bak,
you can't just leave like this!

440
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,342
Bro, have a cold drink.

441
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,054
You really didn't know?

442
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,890
I didn't know. I just found out myself.

443
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:40,933
Are you sure?

444
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,019
Yes, I'm sure.

445
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,980
When I saw Seon-u on set,
I went over to say hello.

446
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,274
Then he panicked
and told me to keep quiet.

447
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,403
Turns out, he got the role
he secretly auditioned for!

448
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,283
Darn it, I never should've done this!

449
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,703
I should have refused to do <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>
once I made up my mind!

450
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,165
Tell them to find
another actor for the role.

451
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,458
Come on, bro.

452
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,586
Tell the production company and Byeong-gi
that Seon-u is my younger brother

453
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,754
and to switch him out!

454
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,966
If we do that, they'll just say,
"Score! What a lucky break!"

455
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,343
Articles will be leaked,

456
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,219
and they'll use Seon-u for publicity!

457
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,355
Seriously.

458
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,564
Come on, bro.

459
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,068
Calm down and just keep filming.

460
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,653
That character doesn't even get
much screen time anyway.

461
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,197
Just let Seon-u do it.

462
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,450
Like the director said,
you two don't even share any scenes.

463
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,328
So I'm just supposed to
act like I don't know him?

464
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,704
You're an actor, bro.

465
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,164
A veteran actor, at that!

466
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,582
Right?

467
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:47,917
Right.

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,795
So calm down and take a sip.

469
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,129
Have a nice cold drink.

470
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,047
There you go.

471
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:54,715
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY MOTHER!

472
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,597
Thank you for all your hard work.

473
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,265
- Thank you.
- Enjoy!

474
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,476
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the drink.

475
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,603
WE SUPPORT ACTRESS OH MI-RAN
AND THE CREW OF GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

476
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,646
Thank you so much.

477
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,147
- Please take good care of my mother.
- Thank you.

478
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,607
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

479
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,322
Jeez.

480
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,492
He's so over the top.

481
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,829
Why? I think it's nice to see.

482
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,206
Sending a coffee truck is too much.

483
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,958
Hold on, we need to pose.

484
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,252
He's such a sweet guy.

485
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,338
He's just nice through and through, right?

486
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,215
Look at him. My gosh.

487
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,511
"Pil-gu leaps over a heap of scrap metal."

488
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,471
Hey.

489
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,683
Do you really think I can leap over
a heap of scrap metal

490
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,184
with the state of my lower back?

491
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,270
Tell them to use a stunt double.

492
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,605
I'm just reading the script.

493
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,443
Excuse me. Ms. Oh is here.

494
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,444
Really?

495
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,904
Ma'am, how are you?

496
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,281
Hello.

497
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,658
- Mr. Lee, we meet again.
- Yes, hello.

498
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,035
Please have this while you get ready.

499
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:06,996
We've already had some.

500
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,414
Right.

501
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,707
My son prepared it for me.

502
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,545
How is Ae-suk doing?

503
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,965
Oh, yes.

504
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,342
She's… Well…

505
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,429
You know,
humans are such fickle creatures.

506
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,016
I'd rather not see anyone
who remembers me from my struggling days.

507
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,103
Ae-suk probably wouldn't feel the same way
because she was in her prime back then.

508
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,565
Hyeon-jun, just make sure
we never have to cross paths again.

509
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,279
- Right, I'll…
- Goodness,

510
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:45,034
I can't believe how handsome your son is!

511
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,328
He looks more like an actor
than most actors do.

512
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,330
No, not at all.

513
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,081
Mr. Lim is much more handsome.

514
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,416
No, I'm not.

515
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,003
Well, please take good care of my mother.

516
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,130
I'm going to need
your guidance myself, ma'am.

517
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:02,051
Sweetheart, don't call me "ma'am."

518
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,803
It makes me feel old when you say that.

519
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,766
Oh, then…

520
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,476
Call her Mi-ran, then.

521
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,895
- Mi-ran.
- I like that.

522
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:13,979
Got it, Mi-ran.

523
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,572
Jeez, you're only getting better
at paying lip service.

524
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,657
How ridiculous.

525
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,953
"You're even more handsome than an actor!"

526
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,204
Then you called her Mi-ran.

527
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,873
I felt embarrassed just listening to you.

528
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,376
You truly embarrass me.

529
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:39,213
That was no different from you
asking me not to call you "bro."

530
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,840
How's your lower back?

531
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,593
I just tweaked it, that's all.

532
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,220
Jeez.

533
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:50,766
By the way, why do you want to see Ms. Wi
when there's nothing to talk about?

534
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,018
I can always
make something up to talk about.

535
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,064
Is there anything worthy of an exclusive?

536
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,401
Why don't you just announce
that you're retiring then?

537
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,861
There's something I need to check

538
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,738
personally.

539
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,158
Isn't it possible she sent someone else,
just like we did?

540
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,544
How have you been?

541
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,755
Good. It's been a while.

542
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,132
Yes.

543
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,385
You could say it's been a while,
or maybe it hasn't.

544
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,386
What?

545
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,721
What?

546
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,557
I mean…

547
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,977
Right, so…

548
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,354
You must've been surprised
we called out of the blue.

549
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,816
Well, newsworthy things
tend to happen out of the blue.

550
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,192
So why are we here?

551
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,403
Before we get into that,

552
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,614
I brought a gift.

553
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,948
Oh, right.

554
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,200
Goodness, this is just…

555
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,163
- This is…
- Here we go.

556
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,623
And this too.

557
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,584
This right here…

558
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,754
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

559
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,422
There's also this.

560
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,133
This is a limited edition.

561
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,176
And here's this.

562
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,012
Yes.

563
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,603
<i>It's the first time in my life.</i>

564
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,982
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

565
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,197
<i>If she likes me so unconditionally,</i>
<i>what's with the reaction?</i>

566
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,493
I suppose it'd be awkward to admit
that she's my fan in this setting.

567
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,454
I understand.

568
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,539
- What?
- What?

569
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,126
Never mind.

570
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,421
You brought <i>Kang Pil-gu</i> merch.

571
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,008
They're little things,

572
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:51,136
but they're practical items
that can come in handy.

573
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,222
Since Ms. Yun probably doesn't need these,

574
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,641
why don't you take them all, Ms. Wi?

575
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,518
Okay. Thank you.

576
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,312
By the way,

577
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,732
- what's this?
- You don't know what it is?

578
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,276
This is Kang Pil-gu's signature item.

579
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,698
"They say you can't fix people."

580
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,866
"But…

581
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,535
I do."

582
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,454
What are you doing?

583
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,626
Goodness.

584
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,212
He never does that.
I don't know what's gotten into him.

585
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,965
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,220
You didn't look too well,
so I thought you could use a laugh.

587
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,264
I need to use the restroom.

588
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,724
Yes, of course.

589
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,775
Hello?

590
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,529
Hello?

591
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,574
Oh, you need me to move my car? Of course.

592
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,492
I'll move it right away.

593
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,329
But I have the car keys…

594
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,101
<i>Onion!</i>

595
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,986
<i>Did you get home safely that night?</i>

596
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,713
Jeez.

597
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,635
Wow, look at all these dishes.

598
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,678
Everything looks fresh.

599
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,934
So how did King's Back Entertainment
and Purple Line Company

600
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,310
end up merging?

601
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,021
As you know, Chairman Lee Dae-ho

602
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,566
has been investing heavily
in the entertainment industry.

603
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,944
He saw the value in our company,

604
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,447
so we're now joining forces
with Purple Line.

605
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:19,576
Does that mean Mr. Lee Dae-ho
will take an active role in management?

606
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,079
No, he has bigger priorities to attend to.

607
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:26,083
Why would he bother managing
such a small agency?

608
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,127
People call Mr. Lee Dae-ho a media mogul,

609
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,631
but his newspapers make no profit
and are essentially empty shells.

610
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,176
Do you even know where
the investment funds are coming from?

611
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,306
No.

612
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,267
I didn't look into that…

613
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,728
What do we know about management?

614
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,647
Management is a job for the experts.

615
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,358
- We don't know much about that.
- Right, we don't know.

616
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,362
Then shall we switch up the subject
from business to entertainment?

617
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,531
Now that the two companies

618
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,741
representing Lim Hyeon-jun
and Gwon Se-na have merged,

619
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,161
and since you're both in the same drama,
some wonder if you're dating--

620
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,413
We're not!

621
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,629
I mean, it's not true.

622
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:17,050
The drama and the merger
are completely unrelated.

623
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,969
That's a strange assumption to make.

624
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,888
My goodness, Ms. Yun.

625
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,847
It's not true.

626
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,395
Chief.

627
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,193
Do you know much about Mr. Lee Dae-ho?

628
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,072
I know enough since he's the one
who signs my paychecks.

629
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:41,617
Don't do it.

630
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,204
Want to get kicked out our department too?

631
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:48,999
Of course not.

632
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,418
All right, then.

633
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,211
By the way,

634
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,631
wasn't Lim Hyeon-jun acting weird today?

635
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,342
I'm not sure.

636
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,302
I didn't notice anything weird.

637
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,554
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na.

638
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,390
Is there really
nothing going on between them?

639
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,559
He said there wasn't,
so I'm taking his word for it.

640
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,686
Reporters should approach
with skepticism, not trust!

641
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,854
Especially without fact-checking!

642
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,608
I'm sorry. I'll look into it again.

643
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,612
Get in.

644
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,789
Something's definitely going on.

645
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,419
Excuse me.

646
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,505
Here's the report you wanted.

647
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,428
Ha Seong-min, Lee Ho-cheol.

648
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,847
- Come here.
- Okay.

649
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,534
<i>Did you get home safely that night?</i>

650
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,373
<i>Is that something</i>
<i>that's possible just by trying?</i>

651
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,416
<i>I don't know.</i>

652
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,625
<i>I'm just going to do my best</i>

653
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,460
<i>so I don't regret it later.</i>

654
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,216
<i>I was wondering how to respond,</i>

655
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,843
<i>so it took me a while to reply.</i>

656
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,636
MELOMASTER
SOULISHERE

657
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,890
<i>I've been feeling a bit down</i>
<i>ever since that day.</i>

658
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,226
<i>Your mom's waiting for you.</i>

659
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,228
<i>Let's go.</i>

660
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,148
Wait till I get my hands on him…

661
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,627
"That jerk hit me first!"

662
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,756
That's not the right tone.

663
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,431
"That jerk hit me first!"

664
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,936
"It's not just me.
He bullies and swears at other kids too."

665
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,565
"I was just trying to stop him
from taking their money."

666
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,033
<i>Are you saying your nephew,</i>
<i>Kang Pil-gu, is just "anyone"?</i>

667
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:29,785
<i>That's disappointing.</i>

668
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,412
<i>What if I get into the police academy?</i>

669
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,623
<i>If you get in, I'll eat my hat.</i>

670
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,709
<i>I can't let you eat your hat,</i>
<i>so I guess I won't become a cop.</i>

671
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:58,647
<i>Onion!</i>

672
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,485
<i>I was wondering how to respond,</i>

673
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,278

<i>Melo… I mean, Jun-gi.</i>

677
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,205
<i>Hearing about your broken engagement</i>

678
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:16,957
<i>made my heart ache.</i>

679
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,625
What the hell?

680
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,759
"Broken engagement"?

681
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,595
That little bastard.

682
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,558
I can't ease all your pain,

683
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,812
- Bak Byeong-gi! You bastard!
- but if it'll help even a little,

684
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,274
- Bak Byeong-gi!
- I'd like to remain friends.

685
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:47,863
Bak Byeong-gi!

686
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,199
What the hell did you say to her?

687
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,451
A broken engagement? Are you kidding me?

688
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,370
You told me to end it,

689
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,790
so I made up a plausible
yet typical and clichéd story!

690
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,918
"A typical and clichéd story"?

691
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,171
I was engaged to someone before.

692
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,463
Opposed the marriage…

693
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,673
I don't think I'm ready…

694
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,674
I'm afraid…

695
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,927
I'll have to say no.

696
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,140
Why'd you turn me into some guy
whose engagement got called off?

697
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,517
And to top it off,
I'm still not over my ex-fiancée?

698
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,977
I'm a totally chill guy!

699
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,813
I didn't know that woman and Ms. Wi
were one and the same,

700
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:22,939
so I was trying to end it!

701
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,483
Had I known,
I wouldn't have told a romantic story.

702
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,485
I would've gone with
an open-ended thriller

703
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,322
or a more unique, mystery-like story!

704
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,365
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, that's expensive!

705
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,617
Hold it.

706
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,169
What did I just hear?

707
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,545
Why are you here?

708
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:46,922
I forgot Mr. Hwang was here.

709
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,299
I'll explain why I'm here later.

710
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,135
What was that all about?

711
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:54,971
What woman?

712
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,306
And what about Ms. Wi?

713
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,934
And who's this ex-fiancée?

714
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,018
Bro, were you engaged?

715
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,854
It's not like that, Mr. Hwang.

716
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,358
If you'll just let me explain…

717
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,618
I WAS WONDERING HOW TO RESPOND,
SO IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO REPLY.

718
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,497
Why isn't he replying again?

719
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:25,585
MY LITTLE BROTHER

720
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:27,837
What is it?

721
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,714
<i>Hey, you're coming home early, right?</i>

722
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,383
- I'm working late. Don't wait up for me.
<i>- What?</i>

723
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,676
<i>- You're working late? Wait--</i>
- Yeah.

724
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,595
But I'm making something delicious today!

725
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,223
How am I going to eat all this?

726
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,352
Darn it, Wi Jeong-sin!

727
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,149
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

728
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,109
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

729
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,114
What's this?

730
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,118
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

731
00:42:58,702 --> 00:42:59,953
There are all sorts of things.

732
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,080
Hey, a towel.

733
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,665
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

734
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,757
What in the world?

735
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,217
Here we go.

736
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,892
Yes, this is good.

737
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,146
Can't forget the handcuffs.

738
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,825
A true fan of mine
would totally love this.

739
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:13,860
No way.

740
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,905
"They say you can't fix people."

741
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,031
"But…

742
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,450
I do."

743
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,919
Bro, have you lost your mind?

744
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,838
How could you meet someone on Onion
in this day and age

745
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,840
without even knowing who might show up?

746
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,467
What are you, a child?

747
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,469
I thought only young actors were at risk

748
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,305
of getting caught up in
school bullying or dating rumors.

749
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:46,184
Man, I never imagined
you'd drop a bombshell like this.

750
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,061
It's not a bombshell.

751
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,522
Gosh, they say late starters
really come on strong.

752
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,107
Were you trying to make up for lost time

753
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,775
since you couldn't have fun
when you were younger?

754
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,902
- Mr. Hwang, calm down--
- Stay out of this, Mr. Bak!

755
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,030
You're no different!
Both of you are so immature.

756
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,659
You should be grateful
that the woman turned out to be Ms. Wi.

757
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,203
What would've happened
if you'd met some lowlife?

758
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,539
Hold on.

759
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:08,915
So, you're saying

760
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:13,586
when you were grinning
and texting on your phone,

761
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,838
you were actually on Onion.

762
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,340
And that woman was Ms. Wi?

763
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,510
I get it now!

764
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:24,472
That's why you wanted to
give her an exclusive story!

765
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,266
Mr. Hwang, it wasn't like that.

766
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,434
Hush!

767
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:28,810
It wasn't like that, my ass!

768
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,647
Man, you really fooled me.

769
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,732
Look at you, bro.

770
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,610
So, what are your plans now?

771
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:38,653
Well…

772
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,365
I don't really know what to do next.

773
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,491
Hold on.

774
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:44,617
Wait a second.

775
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,287
Didn't you say Ms. Wi was your fan?

776
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,748
- Yes.
- Then why'd she give you such a hard time?

777
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:51,708
I know, right?

778
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,252
I don't get it, either.

779
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,715
The truth is…

780
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,594
The truth is what?

781
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,138
It's fine. Tell the truth.

782
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,432
You said you were a fan of Lim Hyeon-jun.

783
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,976
I have an acquaintance
who knows Lim Hyeon-jun.

784
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,395
Would you like to visit the set sometime?

785
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,232
Do you mean the <i>Kang Pil-gu </i>crew member?

786
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,320
Right, I already told you about this.

787
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,114
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

788
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:26,659
Is it because
you've stopped being his fan?

789
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,827
No, it's not that.

790
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:30,955
Now that I think about it,

791
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,251
I think I was fooling myself.

792
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:39,214
Someone who's strongest
in front of the bad guys.

793
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:48,014
<i>Someone who's soft and caring</i>
<i>to the weak and vulnerable.</i>

794
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,767
<i>Someone who acts like Superman</i>
<i>and chases down bad guys</i>

795
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,353
<i>who harass the elderly or children.</i>

796
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,648
<i>Someone who looks rough</i>
<i>but has a big heart…</i>

797
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,567
<i>full of tears,</i>

798
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:00,985
<i>and loves flowers.</i>

799
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,613
<i>I think that's the Kang Pil-gu I liked.</i>

800
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,031
The one I fell for

801
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,784
was Detective Kang Pil-gu,
driven by justice,

802
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,119
not the actor Lim Hyeon-jun.

803
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,705
Go ahead. Say it.

804
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,250
Can you both leave now?

805
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,544
I have a shoot tomorrow,
and a ton of work to do.

806
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,128
- Director Bak.
- Please leave.

807
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:20,046
- Director Bak.
- Please go.

808
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,172
Okay. Follow me out.

809
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,466
If you won't leave,
I'll help you out the door.

810
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,510
Jeez, why did you spill so much water?

811
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,012
Now, please leave.

812
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,807
Oh, man.

813
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,017
Jeez.

814
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:35,979
Gosh.

815
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,945
Oh, man.

816
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:49,242
Man, I'm so exhausted.

817
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,538
Gosh, what a long day.

818
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,873
Too long.

819
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,054
WI JEONG-SIN

820
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,039
- Hey, Su-ji.
<i>- Yes, I'm listening.</i>

821
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:37,999
It's been a while.

822
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,668
<i>I've always been here</i>
<i>waiting for you, Hyeon-jun.</i>

823
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,506
I found a USB,

824
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,092
and I want to check its contents.

825
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,135
What do you think?

826
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,970
<i>If the USB belongs to someone else,</i>

827
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:54,849
<i>it's very likely that it contains</i>
<i>personal information of that person.</i>

828
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,976
<i>Therefore, checking it without permission</i>

829
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,312
<i>would not be considered ethically right.</i>

830
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,106
So it's unethical?

831
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,107
<i>Yes.</i>

832
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,529
I suppose that's true.

833
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,156
Right.

834
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,537
Then is there a moral
and ethical way to look at this?

835
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,707
<i>Why don't you ask for</i>
<i>the USB owner's permission?</i>

836
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,167
Are you kidding me?

837
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,212
You're so rigid,
maybe because you're an AI.

838
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,630
<i>Thank you for the compliment.</i>

839
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,384
<i>From now on, I'll provide</i>
<i>even more ethically sound information.</i>

840
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,052
Right.

841
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,138
- I should listen to you, Su-ji.
<i>- It's an honor--</i>

842
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,264
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

843
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,814
It's not like it'll contain state secrets.

844
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:59,372
MY LITTLE BROTHER

845
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,667
Why the hell isn't she answering?

846
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,672
Come on, answer your phone!
I came all the way here for you.

847
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:12,552
- What reporter doesn't answer her phone?
<i>- The person you are trying to reach…</i>

848
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,845
How do I even get in?

849
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,305
Seriously.

850
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,065
Excuse me.

851
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,109
Do you happen to know
Reporter Wi Jeong-sin?

852
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,026
Yes.

853
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:30,987
I know her.

854
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,447
What a relief.

855
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,534
The thing is, I tried calling her,
but I guess she's busy.

856
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,453
Would you mind giving this to her?

857
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:39,954
I packed her a meal.

858
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,417
How do you know Ms. Wi?

859
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,626
I'm her younger brother.

860
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,714
I'm her one and only
younger brother, Wi Hong-sin.

861
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:51,299
Nice to meet you.

862
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,176
Oh, is that so?

863
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,177
Yes, sir.

864
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,013
- Here, give me that. I'll take it to her.
- Thank you.

865
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,973
Gosh, you've got a good personality.

866
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,809
I have a great personality,
unlike my sister.

867
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:07,023
I didn't know Ms. Wi
had such a handsome brother.

868
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,442
Are you close with Jeong-sin?

869
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,403
I guess you could say
I'd like to get close.

870
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,697
I see.

871
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,699
May I ask your name?

872
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,576
Oh, I'm sorry.

873
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,869
My name is Lee Jae-hyeong.

874
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,496
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, sir.

875
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:23,956
Nice to meet you.

876
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,458
My sister's single, you know.

877
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,753
- Excuse me?
- She was flirting with some guy,

878
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,296
but I think he turned her down.

879
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,466
I never asked, though.

880
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,092
For some reason,

881
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:38,095
I got the feeling
it would be good to tell you.

882
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,014
- See you tomorrow, sir.
- See you.

883
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,540
<i>I think she's been working harder lately</i>

884
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:09,377
<i>to get over that guy who dumped her.</i>

885
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,045
<i>She's never been through a proper breakup,</i>

886
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,131
<i>so she might be bottling up</i>
<i>everything inside.</i>

887
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,380
I'm going back to Korea.

888
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,591
I'm sorry that I'm leaving
when you're like this.

889
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,677
Forget about everything
and focus on your treatment.

890
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:02,263
Hwa-yeong…

891
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,110
WI JEONG-SIN

892
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,876
When should I return this?

893
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:54,607
Damn it.

894
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,676
<i>Jeong-sin, work hard</i>
<i>and make lots of money!</i>

895
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,938
SPORTS EUNSEONG

896
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,608
Everyone else left work hours ago.

897
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:39,860
Why are you still here?

898
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,612
Mr. Lee.

899
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,156
I had a lot of work.

900
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,492
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

901
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,045
I thought you were taking me home.

902
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,506
I never said I was taking you home.

903
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,886
Seriously though,

904
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,265
are you sure you won't regret
missing out on a catch like me?

905
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:11,809
The truth is,

906
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,146
there's someone I like.

907
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:18,941
Does that person

908
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:20,693
like you too?

909
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,366
Seeing you can't answer,
I'll take that as a no.

910
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,953
Doesn't that mean I have a chance?

911
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,707
Forget about that guy already

912
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,666
and come to me.

913
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,836
I'm right here in front of you.

914
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,379
I've always been here for you.

915
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,923
And I'm still waiting for you.

916
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:51,557
I'm curious.

917
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,560
How do you come up with lines like that?

918
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,146
You really seem like a player.

919
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,362
Jeez.

920
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,699
Seriously.

921
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,177
<i>The person you are trying to reach…</i>

922
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:43,901
<i>The person you are trying to reach…</i>

923
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:47,238
Gosh, what reporter
doesn't answer her phone?

924
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,048
<i>The person you are trying to reach…</i>

925
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,334
Thank you for the ride home.

926
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,212
Why do you have so many bags?

927
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:46,881
They're just my stuff.

928
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:48,841
Drive home safely, Mr. Lee.

929
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:50,593
Okay.

930
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,679
Thank goodness it's the weekend tomorrow.

931
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:54,597
Right?

932
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,019
- Are you kidding me?
- Sleep well.

933
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,440
- And sleep in tomorrow.
- Seriously?

934
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:05,900
Hey, it's Kang Pil-gu!

935
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,208
Hey, go ask him.

936
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,252
Excuse me.

937
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:26,837
Are you Kang Pil-gu?

938
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,053
<i>I saw her with another man.</i>

939
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,139
But why does that bother me so much?

940
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,516
You like Wi Jeong-sin, don't you?

941
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:22,851
<i>We're on the same team now.</i>

942
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,938
I'll do everything in my power
to send her to the set of <i>Kang Pil-gu</i>.

943
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,857
Bro, why did you call Ms. Wi over here?

944
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,693
<i>What if she runs into Director Bak?</i>

945
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,069
Mr. Lim! Ms. Wi is here!

946
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,821
Damn it. Run!

947
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,156
<i>Why are you so dense?</i>

948
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,158
Do you really need me
to spell it out for you?

949
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,744
I'm Melomaster.
