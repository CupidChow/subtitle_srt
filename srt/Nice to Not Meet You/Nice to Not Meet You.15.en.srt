1
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,371
Mr. Lim, I heard you
recently got back together

2
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:53,471
Mr. Lim, I heard you
recently got back together

3
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,057
with an actress you dated in the past
after being apart for a long time.

4
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,727
Could she be here with us today?

5
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,741
I'm sorry, but please refrain
from asking personal questions.

6
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:14,658
No, that's fine.

7
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,203
I'll answer the question.

8
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,499
You asked if the person I like
is here today.

9
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:25,461
Yes, she is.

10
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,186
I can't tell you who it is,

11
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,604
but the person I like…

12
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,440
is here today.

13
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,367
I haven't won her over completely,

14
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,244
but I'd like to use this opportunity

15
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,913
to let her know how I feel.

16
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,877
Oh, just to be clear,

17
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,672
the person I'm referring to
isn't Ms. Gwon Se-na.

18
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,924
It really isn't.

19
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,261
I hope there's no misunderstanding.

20
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,195
"LIM HYEON-JUN'S SUDDEN CONFESSION"

21
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,572
HE FIRMLY DENIES DATING GWON SE-NA

22
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,991
"The person I like is here today"?

23
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,200
What does that mean?

24
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,743
If it's not Gwon Se-na,

25
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,370
is it a crew member or something?

26
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,748
-Maybe it's just to create a buzz.
-Either way, Lim Hyeon-jun is blowing up.

27
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,083
The press conference paid off.

28
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,306
LIM HYEON-JUN

29
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,351
-Hello?
-Why are you still here?

30
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,358
Why are you staying behind?

31
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,777
Well, I just dropped a bombshell,

32
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,030
so I'm keeping an eye on you

33
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,698
in case you pass out.

34
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:19,909
What?

35
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,955
-Were you shocked?
-Yes.

36
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,918
I was so shocked
that I couldn't even write my article.

37
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,837
Why did you do that?

38
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,173
I told you a number of times,

39
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,592
but you seemed to brush it off every time.

40
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,552
So I just made it official.

41
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,021
No way. Have you seen this?

42
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,356
"Kang Pil-gu's girlfriend."

43
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,899
I hear she's a scriptwriter.

44
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,567
I heard she's with the costume team.

45
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,653
I heard it's the executive producer.

46
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,404
-What?
-I heard that too.

47
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,615
No, I heard Lim Hyeon-jun's girlfriend is

48
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,575
Director Bak Byeong-gi.

49
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,786
-What?
-No way!

50
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,288
Director Bak can't be his "girlfriend."

51
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,458
Guys, you have to drop your prejudice
and open up your minds.

52
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,087
Mr. Bak Byeong-gi was just a writer
until season four,

53
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,672
and then he suddenly became the director.

54
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,839
Why do you think that was?

55
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,717
The way they looked at each other
went beyond bromance.

56
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,094
-No way!
-Come on.

57
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,721
Not a single one of them got it right.

58
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,600
There were more than
just crew members there.

59
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,061
There were dozens of female reporters too.

60
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,688
They weren't exchanging
romantic looks, though.

61
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,272
-I know, right?
-Yeah.

62
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,692
You know, they really do
look like a couple in these pictures.

63
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,403
-I definitely saw sparks flying.
-Exactly.

64
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,033
-Seriously?
-I think we went too far.

65
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:43,951
AIDE WOO YOUNG-SUK'S SISTER-IN-LAW

66
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,077
MS. WI, CAN YOU COME
TO THE RESTAURANT TOMORROW?

67
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,125
SOME SAY LIM HYEON-JUN'S GIRLFRIEND
IS DIRECTOR BAK BYEONG-GI.

68
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,419
-Is this for real?
-You make a good couple.

69
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,586
EPISODE 15

70
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,717
I'm bummed enough
about not having a girlfriend.

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,051
Do I have to deal with this too?

72
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,594
I'm getting married next year,

73
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,722
and my boyfriend's parents
would call nonstop.

74
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,056
-Really?
-Yes.

75
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,224
They asked if I was two-timing him.

76
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,769
Come on, we don't have time for this.

77
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,730
Let's get ready for the shoot
before Mr. Lim arrives.

78
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,815
Mr. Lim arrived a while ago.

79
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,026
What? Where?

80
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,070
This is what the script
should've looked like to begin with.

81
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:24,283
Man, I knew Kang Pil-gu
was never a corrupt detective.

82
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,953
He just pretended to be one
to take down the drug ring.

83
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,581
It was all part of his plan!

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,753
The director had a plan all along.

85
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,550
Did we really have to
come to the set so early, though?

86
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,802
There's at least an hour left
before they call you up.

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,681
This is the last time
I'm playing Kang Pil-gu,

88
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,725
so I have to give it my all until the end.

89
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,769
Why didn't you just come yesterday, then?

90
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,314
Finding your original spark
and giving it your best is great and all,

91
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,651
but will you please act more rationally?

92
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,195
During the press conference,

93
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,364
my blood ran cold at the thought of you
confessing your feelings to her in public.

94
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,825
Come on, I would never
confess my feelings in public.

95
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,786
I just wanted to
give her a small surprise.

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,788
Whatever.

97
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,666
Keep your dating life aside
and focus on your work on set.

98
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,585
Try to be considerate of the crew, okay?

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,920
What do you mean?

100
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,005
Do they not like me?

101
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:20,964
No.

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,383
They really don't like you.

103
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,427
"Really"?

104
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,345
Yeah.

105
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,931
Why "really"?

106
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,225
I did everything they asked me to.

107
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,851
Do you want me to jog your memory?

108
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,728
-Go ahead. Let's hear it.
-All right.

109
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,854
-Listen closely.
-Okay.

110
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,023
Right from the start,

111
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,192
you forgot your lines,
so we had to hold them up…

112
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,569
You call yourself a detective,
you damn idiot?

113
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:43,654
Get the hell out of here!

114
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,115
Wait, you're not really leaving, are you?

115
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,576
So?

116
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,370
Do you remember now?

117
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,206
Once they watch
this season of Kang Pil-gu,

118
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,875
it'll all make sense

119
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,253
why I did what I did.

120
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,804
SPORTS EUNSEONG

121
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,888
Have you

122
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,182
given it some thought?

123
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,226
I called you here because of that.

124
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,478
I wanted to tell you

125
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,063
that I'll do whatever I can to help.

126
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,151
Thank you.

127
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,694
Why didn't you tell me back then?

128
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,363
-Tell you what?
-That accident.

129
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,282
If you'd told me the truth then,

130
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,492
I would have found a way somehow.

131
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,747
All that time I spent resenting you…

132
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,376
feels so pointless.

133
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,669
Back then,

134
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,339
I was terrified
because I thought I'd ruined your life.

135
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,718
Maybe I used the excuse of protecting you

136
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,553
to run away from it all.

137
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,764
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,938
I'm really sorry.

139
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,239
I hate to ask, but I need to know.

140
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:11,909
Jae-ha…

141
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,827
Is he my son?

142
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,835
I know that anything we say
will sound like an excuse,

143
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,087
but we were only terrified

144
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,839
that we'd end up like Young-suk.

145
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,091
After losing him like that,

146
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,719
I was so full of guilt
that I could hardly breathe.

147
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,315
These are all the recordings we kept
of our conversations with Assemblyman Ha,

148
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,859
along with a written agreement
that we signed with him.

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,986
We believe this can be entrusted

150
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,947
to someone like you, Ms. Wi.

151
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,074
Thank you very much.

152
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,992
The documents you provided

153
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,245
will serve as the most crucial evidence.

154
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,371
Ms. Wi.

155
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,290
Please find out why my brother
had to die like that…

156
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,085
and expose it to the world.

157
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,425
I've gathered a lot of evidence
about the things

158
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,885
Chairman Lee Dae-ho has done.

159
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,262
That's good.

160
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,181
I want this to be over soon.
I'm so anxious.

161
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,349
Chairman Lee Dae-ho

162
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,768
doesn't suspect you, does he?

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,145
I'm an actress.

164
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,106
Acting is what I do for a living.

165
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,691
He knows

166
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,651
that we've been meeting.

167
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,989
You can't release the article about him
right away, can you?

168
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,534
No, not yet.

169
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,328
But I'll release it, no matter what.

170
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,917
Then I guess I'll have to
play along with him for now,

171
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,795
at least until you're ready.

172
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:49,923
By the way…

173
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,510
why are you making
such an effort to help me?

174
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,307
Because I want to escape him,
once and for all.

175
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,018
I've tried to do it on my own,

176
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,185
but it's not enough.

177
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,814
I guess you could say
I'm taking out an extra policy.

178
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,275
Don't worry.

179
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,777
I've got you covered.

180
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,577
I met with Wi Jeong-sin.

181
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,287
I told her what you wanted me to…

182
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,914
as if I was dropping a hint.

183
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,458
I did what you told me to.

184
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,961
Does it bother you
that I'm getting close to Lim Hyeon-jun?

185
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,212
It's not that it bothers me.

186
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:30,964
It scares me.

187
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,683
These are documents from the shell company
Lee Dae-ho set up under my name.

188
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,477
He not only laundered money

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,646
but also faked sales
to embezzle company funds.

190
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,232
Thank you.

191
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,485
I know this wasn't easy for you.

192
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,198
You'll need solid evidence like this
to send him to jail.

193
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,494
That way, I can be free of him.

194
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,662
Seeing how he even fired
Mr. Hwang from King's Back,

195
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,498
there isn't much time left.

196
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,666
You have to release it soon.

197
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,212
That's how we can protect ourselves
and King's Back.

198
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,421
Don't you get the feeling

199
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,882
that I'll be ruined this time?

200
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,220
I told you that I have you covered.

201
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,181
Regardless of your personal life,

202
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,517
you're my informant, and I'll protect you.

203
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,102
That's why

204
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,437
I'd like to make a suggestion.

205
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,565
Because I don't want you to end up ruined.

206
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,154
Jeez, Gil-su.

207
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,990
Why did you leave
such important documents in the car?

208
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,450
Where are the car keys?

209
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,743
They should be in the car.

210
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,620
You didn't lock the car?

211
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,372
I'm sorry. I've been all over the place.

212
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,417
Well, it's not like anyone
would steal this car.

213
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,876
Just wait a second.

214
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,173

What's this?

218
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,233
Mr. Lim, did you find it?
It's there, right?

219
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,901
Why is this here?

220
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,445
Hello?

221
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,030
Mr. Lim, did you find it?

222
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,826
-Hey, Gil-su.
-Yes, Mr. Lim?

223
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,411
I'll call you back in a bit.

224
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,495
All right.

225
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,541
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN, EUNSEONGILBO

226
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,542
Who are you?

227
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,171
What the hell?

228
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,505
-What's going on?
-You scared me.

229
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,007
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

230
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,719
I'm really sorry.

231
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,263
Fine, then.

232
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,808
Accusing an innocent person of kidnapping…

233
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,102
Unbelievable.

234
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,732

00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,489
will you give me a call?

240
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,545
This is unbelievable!

241
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,673
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN, EUNSEONGILBO

242
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:19,758
No way!

243
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,515
Hello?

244
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,183
Hello? Where are you?

245
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,563
-What?
-There's a very good reason

246
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,565
why we absolutely must meet up today!

247
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,651
It's something huge!

248
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,070
What do you mean? What is it?

249
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,406
I found undeniable proof
that we were brought together by fate!

250
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,491
What?

251
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,575
Meet me in front of your place!

252
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,413
Fate?

253
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,049
What's going on?

254
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,347
Please help me!

255
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,600
Help! Hey, I need help!

256
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,071
Goddamn it.

257
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,641
Yes, I like him.

258
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,437
It's the first time in my life.

259
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,065
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

260
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,569
I want to get to know you better.

261
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,490
Not just in the small world of our phones,

262
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,577
but out in the real world.

263
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,205
Will you meet me in person?

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,554
Jeez.

265
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,362
Hey!

266
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,073
Who are you?

267
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,009
Are you okay?

268
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,969
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

269
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:15,970
Are you hurt?

270
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:17,931
Damn it.

271
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,813
Are you okay?

272
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,199
That guy wasn't just
some pervert or pickpocket.

273
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,576
He was holding a stun gun!

274
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,287
My dashcam probably caught him.

275
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,748
How dare he do that
in front of Kang Pil-gu?

276
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,626
I'll check all the security cameras
around here tomorrow.

277
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,799
What did you just say?

278
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,469
Chairman Lee Dae-ho hired someone
to orchestrate Lee Jae-hyeong's accident.

279
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,179
I know it was him.

280
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,932
Calm down, now.

281
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,600
No one got hurt, so it's okay.

282
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,436
It's not okay!
You could've been seriously hurt!

283
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,729
I'm fine.

284
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,691
Anyway, what did you want to tell me?

285
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,234
Something about fate?

286
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,614
I came here in such a good mood
to tell you about a fascinating discovery.

287
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,867
But that punk ruined everything.

288
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,494
Don't let a loser like that
ruin things for you.

289
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,371
So what's the fascinating discovery?

290
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,625
Look at this.

291
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,752
THANK YOU
WI JEONG-SIN, EUNSEONGILBO

292
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,172
-This is my old business card.
-Right?

293
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,883
Why do you have this?

294
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,302
Was it seven or eight years ago?

295
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,762
Do you remember getting wasted
and climbing into someone's car,

296
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,347
panicking that you were kidnapped,

297
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,141
and going to the police station?

298
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,772
We saw that she got in my car by herself,
so I'm innocent.

299
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,651
-I remember!
-Right?

300
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,111
But how do you know about that?

301
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,615
That car is the one we're in right now.

302
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,826
Drink that and sober up before you go.

303
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,412
And don't hop into
someone else's car again.

304
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,957
Oftentimes, it's not your fault
when something bad happens.

305
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,375
Don't tell me you're that man?

306
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,919
-I am!
-Wait, really?

307
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,005
Are you serious?

308
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,174
See?

309
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,676
All of this was fate!

310
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:41,866
You should get going.

311
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,868
I will after you head inside.

312
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,291
So I was right all along.

313
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,709
About what?

314
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,212
What I said about the fine line
between cursed and fated.

315
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,130
There's a fine line
between cursed and fated.

316
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,801
Don't say that! It made my blood run cold!

317
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,513
Good night.

318
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:05,932
Sweet dreams.

319
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,206
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin,
do you have a life to spare?

320
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,501
I either make people give up
or simply eliminate them.

321
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,585
That's how I do things.

322
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,797
Now that I know where you stand,

323
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,507
I'll have to take matters
into my own hands.

324
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,016
Let me say this again.

325
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,434
You could get hurt.

326
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,102
Or maybe even

327
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,438
someone close to you.

328
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,112
Seeing how he even fired
Mr. Hwang from King's Back,

329
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,780
there isn't much time left.

330
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,824
You have to release it soon.

331
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,327
That's how we can protect ourselves
and King's Back.

332
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,182
Isn't it amazing?

333
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,433
It really is.

334
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,895
In fact,

335
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,938
it all started on the same day I met you.

336
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:36,939
What do you mean?

337
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,859
The beginning of the case
I've been investigating.

338
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,654
That was the day the aide
who was going to tip me off

339
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,032
passed away.

340
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,745
Why are you digging into someone
that dangerous?

341
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:51,662
Aren't you scared?

342
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,415
No one else can do it

343
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,542
except me.

344
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,712
I've been holding onto this case
for a long time,

345
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,090
and I want to get to the bottom of it.

346
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,647
I don't see anything.

347
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,066
Nothing at all.

348
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,111
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,571
I don't see any signs
of the ratings bouncing back.

350
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,200
Why are you even checking that?

351
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,911
Kang Pil-gu is just going to
drag on like this

352
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,538
until it fizzles out.

353
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,624
Mr. Hwang.

354
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,966
-On that note, I have something to share.
-What is it?

355
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,801
The next scene's lines have changed.

356
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,222
-Is that the script?
-Yes, but…

357
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,640
Give it to me so I can memorize the lines.

358
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,892
Right, but the thing is…

359
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,936
-Wait, why is this here?
-Give it to me.

360
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,230
What?

361
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,940
ENTERTAINMENT DESK

362
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,156
Ms. Wi, here's some cold medicine.

363
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,866
But you should go to the hospital.

364
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:11,492
What's this?

365
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,578
Thanks.

366
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,164
I'm okay. I'll leave after I wrap up.

367
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,583
-Okay.
-Thanks for the medicine.

368
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,716
Bak Byeong-gi, that crazy punk!

369
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,801
He's seriously insane!

370
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,386
Come on,

371
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,931
how am I supposed to memorize
the entire code of conduct today?

372
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,892
I'm about to lose my mind.

373
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,936
"Born at the time
of our nation's liberation,

374
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,146
we serve our country…"

375
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,399
"We serve our country and people

376
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,234
and protect
the free and democratic society…"

377
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,528
You can't be serious.

378
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:56,704
Kang Pil-gu is really, really special.

379
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,916
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

380
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,751
How lucky is that?

381
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,172
Right.

382
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,595
Kang Pil-gu is extraordinary.

383
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,141
Kang Pil-gu is extraordinary.

384
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,565
"Born at the time
of our nation's liberation,

385
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,150
we serve our country and people…"

386
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,491
Hello?

387
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,719
Oh,

388
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,137
apologies for being late.

389
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:18,744
Please sit down.

390
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,662
Okay.

391
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,417
It's our first
since that restaurant day, right?

392
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,459
Yes, that's right.

393
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,297
Bring us some tea.

394
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,132
Yes, sir.

395
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,806
I know you must be busy.
I'm sorry for making you come all the way.

396
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,058
No, not at all.

397
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,480
Why won't they let me in?

398
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,525
Why only Hyeon-jun? What are they up to?

399
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,489
You and Mr. Hwang seem very close.

400
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,908
I assume you were upset
to hear about his dismissal.

401
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,994
Yes, but nothing has changed.

402
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,122
He's still handling my work.

403
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,541
I'll get straight to the point then.

404
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,962
You're close with Ms. Wi Jeong-sin, right?

405
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,057
I don't see why I should answer that.

406
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,478
I'd rather talk about
the turmoil in the company

407
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,480
and Mr. Hwang's unfair dismissal.

408
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,815
"Unfair"?

409
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,697
I specifically told you last time
that I'd take care of the business.

410
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,991
But it didn't seem like you understood.

411
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,497
Oh, is that so?

412
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,557
Keep still.

413
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,818
What are you doing?

414
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,697
Damn it.

415
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,783
Maybe it's because
the tea tastes off today.

416
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,618
He just irritates me.

417
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,373
I can't stand things

418
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,083
that irritate me.

419
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,594
Wait outside.

420
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,900
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

421
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,487
The reality seems harsher
than dramas sometimes, right?

422
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,075
But in reality,

423
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,494
things don't end as beautifully

424
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,913
as they do in your dramas.

425
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,709
If you want a beautiful life with Ms. Wi
as you see in those dramas,

426
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,628
I suggest you stay quiet, all right?

427
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,785
Set up an interview for me.

428
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,205
All of a sudden?

429
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,708
Make sure the interview
is on a reputable program

430
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,211
that will give our story real credibility.

431
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,005
Not a popular program,
but a reputable one?

432
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,132
Okay, I got it.

433
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,802
I'll make sure it's a reputable program,
so don't you worry.

434
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,931
I think Ms. Wi is in danger.

435
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,934
I'll need to be by her side at all times.

436
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,319
Are you back, Jeong-sin?

437
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:25,824
Hi, I'm here.

438
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,327
Hello.

439
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,746
Why are you all here again?

440
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,540
Well, we…

441
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,793
We decided to get together
because we thought

442
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,963
a comfortable environment
could help Hong-sin

443
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,631
focus better on his acting.

444
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,467
-So that's why we gathered here.
-Oh, I see.

445
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,219
Wait.

446
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,221
Would you like to see Hong-sin acting?

447
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,766
-He's improved a lot.
-No, that's fine. I have work to do.

448
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,767
Please carry on.

449
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,311
-Have some ramyeon.
-No, I'm okay.

450
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,273
Get some rest.

451
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,944
I'll see how it goes later
and invite her for late-night snacks.

452
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,070
Okay.

453
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,239
Let's eat.

454
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:29,430
Jeong-sin.

455
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,015
We're ordering fried chicken. Want some?

456
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:34,935
Are you sleeping?

457
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,481
Jeong-sin?

458
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,359
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

459
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,279
You're burning up.

460
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,196
What?

461
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,199
Are you okay?

462
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,827
Let me see.

463
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,370
-I'm fine.
-Wait.

464
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:56,415
You really are burning up.
You're not okay.

465
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,958
What if it's serious?

466
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,877
Wait here.

467
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,587
I'm fine.

468
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,510
You should rest a bit longer.

469
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,719
No, I'm okay.

470
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,055
No, you're not. This is hot to the touch.

471
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:56,767
Oh.

472
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,687
Gosh, this is really hot.

473
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,980
-What? Right, medicine.
-I got medicine.

474
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,108
-And here's some water.
-Thanks.

475
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,444
-Here's medicine.
-Just leave it here.

476
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,621
Wouldn't it be better to call 119?

477
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,164
Come on, 119 isn't a taxi service.

478
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,582
I can get to the hospital myself.

479
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,002
Why do you insist on going alone?
It's better if someone goes with you.

480
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,587
I'll take you there. Get on my back.

481
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,006
If it's the flu,
you might catch it from me.

482
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,299
That would disrupt the whole set, right?

483
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,676
You're right.

484
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,054
Who cares about any of that?

485
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,724
-Let's go together.
-No, forget it.

486
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,351
Hey, if I test positive for the flu,

487
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,769
I'm staying at a motel for the night.

488
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,522
-Okay.
-I got all my stuff. See you.

489
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,149
-Okay.
-But…

490
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,401
Don't come near me.
You'll catch what I have.

491
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,986
Jeez.

492
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,906
Call me as soon as you
get to the hospital, okay?

493
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,866
Fine.

494
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,955
Oh, boy.

495
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,791
This is all so sudden…

496
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,002
Will your sister be okay by herself?

497
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,087
She made it back alive from a war zone.

498
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,589
She won't pass out
just getting to the hospital.

499
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,592
I know, but…

500
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,886
Gosh, that was pretty cold.

501
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,389
Was Mr. Lim always like that?

502
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,267
It beats me.
I've only been realizing it lately.

503
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,811
He's breaking out of character.

504
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,070
Darn, that's so loud.

505
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,367
I should've gone with her.

506
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,536
There must be construction next door.

507
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,010
I tested positive for the flu,

508
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,970
-so I'm off to a motel to quarantine.
-Mr. Lim.

509
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,182
She tested positive for the flu,
so she's off to a motel.

510
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,309
She has the flu?

511
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,227
Yes.

512
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,395
Man, I knew it.

513
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,273
But why is she going to a motel?
She'll be safer at my place.

514
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,108
A motel is too dangerous.

515
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,902
There are so many thugs out there…

516
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:12,986
What?

517
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,282
I'm just saying that my place is safer!

518
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,034
Then shouldn't we head home

519
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,745
and have Ms. Wi come back here instead?

520
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,331
I think that's the right thing to do, too.

521
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,749
No, what I meant was…

522
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,668
Never mind.

523
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:28,752
Here, it's…

524
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:29,920
I'll just call her myself.

525
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,465
Hello?

526
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:34,508
It's me.

527
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,679
Why are you staying at a motel?
It's so dangerous.

528
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,598
It's dangerous out there
with those shady guys roaming around!

529
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:42,558
Stay at my place.

530
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,475
Excuse me?

531
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,562
Why would I go to your place
when I could go to mine?

532
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,898
You won't get any rest here
with all the construction happening.

533
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,900
I'll text you my passcode,
so just go to my place.

534
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:52,985
It's safe there.

535
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,736
I'm going to a motel.

536
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,780
-That was the plan.
-Just go to my place already!

537
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,619
BEST RICE PORRIDGE

538
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,382
Eat the rice porridge
while it's still warm.

539
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,949
You're too tall.
That's why my clothes don't fit you.

540
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,409
-I'll go wash up first.
-Okay.

541
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,285
Mr. Lim, you can change into this.

542
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,453
Oh, me too?

543
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,830
Yes, make yourself at home.

544
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,207
Thank you.

545
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,542
I'll never wash those now.

546
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,881
Mr. Lim, I want to show you something.

547
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:20,924
-What?
-Come with me.

548
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,261
It won't take long.

549
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,388
Come on, hurry up and come here.

550
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,389
What is it?

551
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,100
Gosh, I don't know
if I should show this to you or not.

552
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,061
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

553
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,604
-You…
-What is it?

554
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,648
You have to keep this
a secret from Jeong-sin.

555
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,442
Otherwise, she might kill me.

556
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,569
Don't be shocked.

557
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,573
Ta-da!

558
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,661
Man, I can't believe I did that.
I'll leave you to it.

559
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,017
Get well soon.

560
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,519
I miss you already.

561
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,067
GET WELL SOON
I MISS YOU ALREADY

562
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,475
BEST ACTOR AWARD

GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
EPISODE 1

564
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,417
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
EPISODE 1

565
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,288
Who are you,
and what were you doing here alone?

566
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,958
Hello. My name is Wi Jeong-sin.

567
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:06,710
Have a seat.

568
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,176
I'm sorry. I have the flu,

569
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,053
so I can't get too close.

570
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,431
That's fine, I guess.

571
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,810
Anyway, are you and Hyeon-jun dating?

572
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,020
No, it's not like that.

573
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:26,855
Then what is it?

574
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,232
Answer carefully.

575
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,610
I could report you to the police
for trespassing.

576
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,446
Well…

577
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,408
We…

578
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,994
like each other.

579
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,621
You like each other,
but you're not dating?

580
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,123
So it's a situationship?

581
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,876
Yes, I think so.

582
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,464
But what are you doing here
without Hyeon-jun?

583
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,591
I have the flu,

584
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,676
and there are some things
going on at my place,

585
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,095
so he told me to stay here for a bit.

586
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,599
Yet he won't even let me set foot in here.

587
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,727
I've heard a lot about you, ma'am.

588
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:08,605
You have?

589
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,522
Yes.

590
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,695
I assume he complained about
how bad a mother I was.

591
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:16,905
No, not at all.

592
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,909
He said that as a child,
his dream was to be like you.

593
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,540
Did Hyeon-jun really say that?

594
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:27,665
-He's really changed for the better.
-Exactly.

595
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,125
-He's really changed for the better.
-Exactly.

596
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,210
I know, right?

597
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,712
Who's up for a round of foot volleyball?

598
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,090
-Let's go play!
-Sounds great.

599
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:36,633
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

600
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:37,592
Foot volleyball?

601
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,053
-Let's go.
-This will be fun.

602
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:43,640
What's going on?

603
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,771
-He can't get up that early.
-Gil-su.

604
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:50,772
Can you go to the car…

605
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:51,689
Mr. Lim?

606
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,274
Hold on. Let me just…

607
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:06,830
Hello.

608
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,498
-Hey.
-Thank you. Bye.

609
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,335
What's that?

610
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:16,339
Oh, the scriptwriter's parents
grow cherry tomatoes.

611
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,299
She brought you some
because you're on a strict diet.

612
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,426
For me?

613
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:20,927
-Yes.
-Why?

614
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,805
-Hey, you!
-What?

615
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,891
The crew does like me after all!

616
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,309
They "really" don't like me?

617
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,603
Like, "really"? Don't be ridiculous.

618
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,648
Man, he's so unbelievably naive.

619
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,483
Didn't you see them earlier?

620
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:36,484
They were badmouthing you

621
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,445
and then scattered
when they saw you coming.

622
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,363
And if they really liked you,

623
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:44,284
they would've said something like,
"Would you like to play foot volleyball?"

624
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:47,162
Then explain what happened
on the set during my break.

625
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,581
Why did he come up to me, call my name,

626
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,167
and pick off a loose thread
before making a heart like this?

627
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,253
He probably pulled it off
because it was too noticeable,

628
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,296
like this.

629
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,298
Come on, you need to connect the dots.

630
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,257
Then what about this?

631
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,634
That's…

632
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,430
She gave some to everyone,
and she didn't want you to feel left out,

633
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,973
so she gave you a token gift.

634
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,433
Don't be silly. A token gift?

635
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,477
Then was this a token gesture too?

636
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,603
You're ridiculous.

637
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,897
Hey, give me that. They're all mine.

638
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,732
Why did she give him that?

639
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:18,985
I don't get it.

640
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,030
Hello.

641
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,704
-Sir, how about a coffee?
-Sure.

642
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,164
-U-jin.
-Yes, sir?

643
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,081
Well,

644
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:36,503
I saw you all
talking about me a little while ago.

645
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,881
But when I walked by,
everyone suddenly scattered to avoid me.

646
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,800
Did I do something to offend anyone?

647
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:43,885
No, not at all.

648
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:47,972
The truth is,

649
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,892
-we were talking about you.
-Me?

650
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,479
Did you see Mr. Lim that day?

651
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,855
We saw him together.

652
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,273
Oh, right.

653
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,191
Let me go!

654
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,362
When he launched
that flying kick at the thug,

655
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,614
it was like I was watching Kang Pil-gu
right out of the screen.

656
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:05,657
Did the kick land perfectly?

657
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,158
-Yeah, it did.
-Really?

658
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,327
And he's been coming
to stunt school diligently,

659
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,745
even with the injury he got because of me.

660
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,080
What injury?

661
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,499
When we filmed the action scene
in the abandoned factory…

662
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,210
I'll be doing my own scenes today

663
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,753
without a stunt double.

664
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,839
You see, I was a bit injured at the time.

665
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,175
I was going to push myself
rather than create a problem.

666
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,885
But Mr. Lim found out

667
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:28,429
and did all the scenes himself,
which ended up in his injury.

668
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,348
He didn't even mention his injury
so I could avoid trouble.

669
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,849
-Really?
-Are you serious?

670
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,393
-I didn't know he was like that.
-That's incredible.

671
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,602
What happened to him?

672
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,355
Who's up for a round of foot volleyball?

673
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,566
-Let's go play!
-Sounds great.

674
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:46,155
Man, look at how red these are!

675
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,950
They look delicious.
These are so precious.

676
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,537
Hey, savor them.
Don't just stuff them down…

677
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,374
Hello, Ms. Oh.

678
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,959
-Have you been well?
-Hello.

679
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,335
You're here, Ms. Oh.

680
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:00,378
It's been a while.

681
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,257
Mr. Lim, Ms. Oh and Ms. Seong
have made up.

682
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,384
What?

683
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,303
Come on, no way.

684
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,055
They were at each other's throats,
pulling each other's hair…

685
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,307
Jeez.

686
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:15,602
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

687
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:17,437
Please have a seat.

688
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,403
Ae-suk showed up at my place.

689
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:28,573
I see.

690
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:38,666
Mi-ran, I want to apologize.

691
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,543
I went too far.

692
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:43,046
I hadn't acted in a long time,
and I was eager to do well,

693
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,089
so I just reacted without thinking.

694
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,717
But more importantly,

695
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,470
I can't drag my son's name
through the mud.

696
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,393
Could you please forgive me this once
for my son's sake?

697
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,604
We already have a strained relationship.

698
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,565
Do you think a single apology
will magically fix it?

699
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,280
If you don't feel comfortable,

700
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:10,990
I'll drop out.

701
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,042
So we agreed to just work together.

702
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,420
Thank you for your understanding, Ms. Oh.

703
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,425
By the way, I noticed
that Ae-suk finds you rather difficult.

704
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,343
Excuse me?

705
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,221
Anyone can tell
that you're not an affectionate son.

706
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,183
All sons are like that, I guess.

707
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,478
Ae-suk has been through a lot.

708
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,939
Not every well-known actress

709
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,441
could have the courage
to have and raise a child on her own.

710
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,903
Imagine all the disrespect
she must've faced back then.

711
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,782
No one has the right
to point fingers at her.

712
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,660
Not even her own child.

713
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,374
I'll get going now.

714
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,376
Right.

715
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,649
We're done!

716
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,527
-Good work, sir.
-Great job.

717
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,320
-Good work today.
-Goodbye.

718
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,780
-Mr. Lim!
-Yeah?

719
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,490
How about foot volleyball
if your ankle's okay?

720
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:35,450
Foot volleyball?

721
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,703
-Me?
-Yes, but it's fine if you can't.

722
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,622
-No, not at all. My ankle's fine.
-It is?

723
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:42,957
I'm done for the day, right?

724
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,916
Right.

725
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,918
-Okay, let me go and get changed.
-Sure.

726
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:47,253
Mr. Hwang, join us.

727
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:00,892
I'm fine.

728
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,502
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

729
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,753
-Lim Hyeon-jun!
-Lim Hyeon-jun!

730
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,839
-Kang Pil-gu!
-Kang Pil-gu!

731
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,311
He said that as a child,

732
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,146
his dream was to be like you.

733
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,566
Did Hyeon-jun really say that?

734
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,026
Yes.

735
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,153
I don't know for sure,

736
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:56,781
but it seems to me

737
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,867
that he admired you a lot
when he was young.

738
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,662
Maybe that's when he started dreaming

739
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:04,956
of becoming an actor.

740
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:11,879
That's a generous interpretation.

741
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:17,510
But my son hates me.

742
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:21,097
I put him through a lot,
both physically and emotionally.

743
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,933
Even so, thanks to him,

744
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,936
I've been able to live a good life.

745
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,146
Could I ask…

746
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,900
if you've ever thanked him?

747
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,905
Of course, I'm thankful.

748
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,867
But saying it out loud is a bit awkward.

749
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,204
To be honest, I'm not very good
at saying thank you myself.

750
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,290
But I read in a book

751
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,877
that the least you can do for someone

752
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,963
who's brought you happiness and peace…

753
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,300
is to express your thanks.

754
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:02,847
Hyeon-jun.

755
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,057
Thank you.

756
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:06,726
Thank…

757
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,229
Thank you, Hyeon-jun.
Hyeon-jun, thank you.

758
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,648
Thank you, Hyeon-jun.

759
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,317
Thanks.

760
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,695
Thank you. Hyeon-jun, thank you.

761
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,155
Hyeon-jun, thank you.

762
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,325
Thank you, son.

763
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,201
Thank you, Hyeon-jun, my son.

764
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,333
Wait a minute.

765
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:31,751
That's not it.

766
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,630
Thank you, son.

767
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,551
-See you later.
-Thank you!

768
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,307
-We did great.
-Awesome job.

769
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,476
Mr. Lim, that was the best teamwork ever.

770
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,312
-Great job, guys. That was fun.
-You were amazing.

771
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,189
-Great job today.
-Good job.

772
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,357
Great job, you guys.

773
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,736
Why do you put more effort
into foot volleyball than acting?

774
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,072
What do you mean? I put effort into both.

775
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,824
Are you going to Ms. Wi's place again?

776
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,285
-Yeah, I should.
-Ms. Wi's place?

777
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,207
They've already gotten that close?
Since when?

778
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,292
-Quiet.
-Since when?

779
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,796
I feel much better now,
so I came back home.

780
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,256
Let's return to our own homes today.

781
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:22,927
Thanks to you,
I was able to recover in a nice place.

782
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,737
Mom, you're here.

783
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,198
Goodness. Are you just getting in?

784
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:48,995
They had fresh baby octopus
at the grocery store,

785
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,204
so I made octopus soup.

786
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,832
You like baby octopus, remember?

787
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,294
Oh, I like baby octopus?

788
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,923
Right, baby octopus. That sounds good.

789
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,175
I mean, I like baby octopus.

790
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:05,428
Hyeon-jun.

791
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,142
Thank you.

792
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,480
It's been rough for you, hasn't it?

793
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,945
Thanks to your hard work,
I've been able to live a good life.

794
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:25,281
It's not that I'm unaware of it.

795
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,950
But seeing you do well
and living comfortably

796
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,578
made me want to forget it all.

797
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,665
I didn't want to think about
those miserable days anymore.

798
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,084
I think that's why…

799
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,464
I was reluctant to say thank you.

800
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:43,466
Jun.

801
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,763
Thank you.

802
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:51,932
And I'm sorry.

803
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,441
I've given it a lot of thought.

804
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:02,568
And…

805
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,739
this is the only thing I can do for you.

806
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,492
I'll come every day…

807
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,579
and cook for you.

808
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,550
Jeez.

809
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,137
What do you mean,
you haven't done much for me?

810
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,389
You've done plenty for me.

811
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,519
So don't think like that anymore, okay?

812
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,563
And also…

813
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:40,940
You don't have to come every day.

814
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:43,943
There's no need for that.

815
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,237
Let's eat.

816
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,364
And don't come every day.

817
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:07,341
Hi, I'm here.

818
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,300
Yeah.

819
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:12,012
Why are you here at this hour, though?
Did something happen?

820
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,181
You said to call if I needed your help.

821
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,060
If you ever need my help,

822
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,271
will you give me a call?

823
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,027
What is it?

824
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:28,988
What do you need my help with?

825
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,323
You owe me an article, remember?

826
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,327
I owe you an article?

827
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,289
That time when we followed
Mr. Yoon Jung-ho all the way to Gangneung.

828
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,041
You promised to write an article
I asked you to.

829
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,545
But I'm willing to let all that go
for a single article.

830
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,672
I never take requests for articles,

831
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,758
but I'll make an exception
under the condition that it's totally true

832
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:52,052
and newsworthy.

833
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,095
Good.

834
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,806
From this point on, you owe me an article.

835
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,392
Oh, you're right.

836
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,313
But are you really going to
cash in that favor?

837
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,480
Of course.

838
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,109
I'm going to ask you
for a big favor today.

839
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:11,572
I'm cashing in the article you owe me,

840
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:16,869
as well as the offer you made me
when you accused me of being a kidnapper.

841
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,371
I'm cashing in all my favors.

842
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,374
What's the favor?

843
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:24,793
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

844
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,881
Let's take him down.

845
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,301
Together.

846
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,559
You're watching
our star interview on YTM News.

847
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,186
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na from

848
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,897
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
are here with us today.

849
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,315
It's nice to meet you both.

850
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,650
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

851
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,693
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun,

852
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,862
and I play Kang Pil-gu
in Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

853
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,197
Hello.

854
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,075
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

855
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:02,706
I apologize for raising an issue like this
during our drama promotion segment,

856
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,541
but I've invited a guest today

857
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,752
to shed more light
on the details of a case.

858
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:09,255
I'm here today…

859
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:14,218
to expose the ugly truth
behind the political and business circles.

860
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:18,055
This case traces back seven years,

861
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,726
to the death of an assemblyman's aide.

862
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,602
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

863
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,315
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

864
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,317
Let's take him down.

865
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,234
Together.

866
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:13,360
Damn it!

867
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,030
I take it you need cash quickly.

868
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,197
Yes, I guess so.

869
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,575
-Here you go.
-He's selling off his building and car

870
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,827
to pay the penalties
for breaking his ad contracts.

871
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,245
If I let things go on like this,

872
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:26,790
everyone will assume all the rumors
about Mr. Lim are true.

873
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,292
I'll go.

874
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,253
What if I begged you not to go?

875
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:32,963
Would you still leave?

876
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:34,840
Yes.

877
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,680
