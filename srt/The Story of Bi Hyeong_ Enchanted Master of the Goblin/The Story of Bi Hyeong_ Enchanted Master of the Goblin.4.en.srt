00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,750
A long, long time ago,

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,410
there was a being who was
neither human nor demon.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,410
It was a beautiful life
born of a human and a Gumiho.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,100
The Gumihos looked down on him,

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,220
and humans were afraid of him, as he's
a fox that would eat human organs.

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,390
He felt belonging to
neither of those two places.

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,450
He had no choice but to live alone
over the boundary.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,200
He's honest and innocent.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,450
He tried not to hurt anyone.

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,280
Even if it's a little kindness,
he's sincere.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,760
But the world didn't know
his sincerity.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,810
Every word he speaks,

13
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,800
or his silence,
can sometimes be taken as lies.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,110
And a choice he made
was seen as a betrayal.

15
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,470
At the end of the day,
he's not a human nor a fox.

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,539
He was forced to have nowhere to go.

17
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,720
At the gate of Seorabeol,

18

now Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.]

the day Queen Seondeok arrived,

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,110
he looked up at the sky and prayed.

21
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,060
I dare not admire you;

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,539
I just want a place I belong to
in this world.

23
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,800
Be it with the humans or the Gumihos.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,100
I just hope for a name I can live in.

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,570
After saying that, he fell asleep.

26
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,390
The Queen pitied him,

27
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,470
passed by him,
and put a gold bracelet on his chest.

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,820
When he woke up,

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,000
the first thing that came to his heart
was not joy,

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,740
but a strong feeling of missing
and unspeakable regret.

31
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,760
These thoughts burned throughout his body.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,180
He was swallowed by this blazing energy

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,260
and eventually became the symbol of fire:

34
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,670
the God of Fire.

35
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,490
Since that day,

36
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,750
his name Jigwi

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,120
became a metaphor for someone
who doesn't fit in anywhere.

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,670
I'm generous
so I won't argue with you.

185
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,940
Generous?

186
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,530
I mean, well...

187
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,450
You need my essence
because you were born with it.

188
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,060
Yet I only became like this suddenly.

189
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,360
I just thought
you must've been through a lot.

190
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,420
Let's go.

191
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,140
Here.

192
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,010
Why do you have this?

193
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,850
I just picked it up just now.

194
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,650
Where did you get this?

195
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,350
Before I came to Seoul,
my grandpa gave me this amulet.

196
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,830
Why?

197
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,880
It looks like something I've seen before.

198
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,900
Where did your grandpa pick this up?

199
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,070
He said I picked it up when I was a kid.

200
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,080
My grandpa kept it since then.

201
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,940
Since I picked it up,
I suddenly recovered.

202
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,570
That's really your amulet.

203
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,870
I threw mine away.

204
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,240
Excuse me.

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,310
Can I hold onto you?

206
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,520
It's night, after all.

207
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,290
Are you a kid? Why are you scared?

208
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,920
You have my energy on you,
so you will be fine for a while.

209
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,760
Even so...

210
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,690
You're faster than me.
Since you have long legs.

211
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,620
Thank you for today.

212
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,480
I know.

213
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,530
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,770
If you're sorry, buy me ice cream.

215
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,180
You want a lot of things.

216
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,820
You said you were sorry.

217
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,970
I don't feel sorry anymore.

218
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,330
How can you do that?

219
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,610
Whatever. Shoo.

220
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,840
Then I'll see ghosts again.

221
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,830
What ice cream do you want?

222
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,080
Gosh. What a pain.

223
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,510
You'll get a stomach upset.

224
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,800
Where's the thing I asked you to find?

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,200
Why are you suddenly looking for books
on divine sicknesses?

226
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,760
I have a sickness after all.

227
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,890
I want to cure it.

228
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,630
The one you talked about?

229
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,200
But why are you curing it?

230
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,590
'Cause I caused it.

231
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,520
What?

232
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,340
Are you saying you
came into physical contact with a human?

233
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,810
So intense that the gate of hell opened?

234
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,530
What happened?

235
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,280
Do you have photos of them?

236
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,610
How pretty does this human have to be?

237
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,420
Why didn't Gildal tell me?

238
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,200
Oh. Are they a man or a woman?

239
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,790
He's just like that guy.

240
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,260
Could it be

241
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,950
the person who was your owner?

242
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,090
Don't tell me you are expecting him

243
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,860
to be a reborn of your master.

244
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,080
You know that too.

245
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,420
If he were your master,
he would have recognized you.

246
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,290
No matter how many times
they've been reborn.

247
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,800
I don't have any expectations.

248
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,820
It's been a thousand years.

249
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,920
If he wanted to find me,

250
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,610
he would have come to me.

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,850
Where are you going?

252
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,320
Have some squid before leaving!

253
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,990
To look cold normally,
but when I smile, I'd look cute.

254
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,360
My nose bridge should be about this tall.

255
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,280
Round and cute.

256
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,140
Thick double eyelids would be nice.

257
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,620
That'd give me sharp and charismatic eyes.

258
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,510
Someone that everyone would think
is handsome; like a city guy.

259
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,530
I want to praise you
for being so specific...

260
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,870
Why don't you just bring me someone
who looks like this

261
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,550
so I can just put their head on you.

262
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,390
But doctor, that's not
plastic surgery anymore.

263
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,540
I can assure you that
the side effect will be less by doing that.

264
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,630
In other words...

265
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm afraid you can never be a "city guy"
in this lifetime.

266
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,250
I didn't expect you to really come.

267
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,870
What?

268
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,540
You said you wanted to have a new image
for your audition, right?

269
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,990
Do you want to get some fillers?

270
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,700
I'll give you a discount.

271
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,790
Actually, I don't have any money.

272
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,320
Then why are you here?

273
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,080
Well, the Face Evaluation...

274
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,760
I mean, someone recommended this to me.

275
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,000
I thought I should
do something about it first.

276
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,450
I'm... really desperate.

277
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,000
You're really...

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Reckless?

279
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,940
That's one thing.

280
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,840
You're so naive.

281
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,859
Come in.

282
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,890
I'll give you a ride.

283
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,590
I've taken care of everything.
What about you?

284
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,440
I've eliminated
most of the things you mentioned.

285
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,380
Clear up whatever you see.

286
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,010
Okay. But why are you suddenly doing this?

287
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,060
Can I hold onto you?

288
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,010
It's night, after all.

289
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,270
The kid said he's afraid
of walking at night.

290
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,490
You don't have to send me home.

291
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,640
I want to.

292
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,190
Why?

293
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,340
I just think
you're probably quite popular.

294
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,890
This just feels like a foul.

295
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,170
What do you mean?

296
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,450
There are people like that.

297
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,010
They don't have any interest,

298
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,540
but would subconsciously make
other people's hearts flutter.

299
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,590
Then what are you?

300
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,580
Zero foul type?

301
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,810
What?

302
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,760
Or that you're the type so innocent that

303
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,430
you'd make people feel guilty?

304
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,590
Hold on.

Yes, hyung.

307
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,420
Yes, I'm on my way back.

308
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,700
You want to pick me up?

309
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,800
It's fine, I'm not a kid.

310
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,510
Okay.

311
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,020
See you at home.

312
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,900
Okay.

313
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,130
Your partner?

314
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,880
What?

315
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,510
I guess you haven't started dating.

316
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,880
Wasn't the person who called just now
your partner?

317
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
No! We are just roommates!

318
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
Roommates...

319
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,250
Oh... Roommates that live together.

320
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,850
Yes.

321
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,460
You really live here?

322
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,400
What?

323
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,550
Nothing.

324
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,610
I just think it's fate.

325
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,640
Someone I know lives here too.

326
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,290
No way!

327
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,340
Is it Gildal?

328
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,480
Yes.

329
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,580
Wow.

330
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,100
Are you friends with him?

331
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,980
That's amazing!

332
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,630
Gildal was the one who invited me to
stay with him after all.

333
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,310
That's interesting.

334
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,920
Right?

335
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,570
He's someone who doesn't allow anyone
to get close to him.

336
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,570
Thank you.

337
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,870
I'm curious what secret you've used.

338
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,700
Keumbok.

339
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,850
See you again.

340
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,280
Huh? When?

341
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,100
Anytime. As long as you're free.

342
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,390
I have a lot of time.

343
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,370
But why?

344
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,180
I just think I might want to see you.

345
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,880
Sure!

346
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,150
I've never made friends in Seoul.

347
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,040
Not as a friend.

348
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,960
What?

349
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,210
I'm asking you out on a date.
