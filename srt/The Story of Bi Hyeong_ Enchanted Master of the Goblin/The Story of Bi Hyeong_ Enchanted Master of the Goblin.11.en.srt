was not real hatred,

Just say it straight.

183
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,490
Keumbok almost died

184
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,510
because you gave Cheoyong
his handkerchief.

185
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,030
Bihyung lost his master again
and is alone again.

186
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,650
This is all because of you.

187
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,720
Who did I give it to—

188
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,600
Let go of me.

189
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,740
Is this how you smile
in front of Cheoyong, too?

190
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,000
What?

191
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,270
In order to avenge Bihyung,

192
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,810
you colluded with Cheoyong.

193
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,560
Do you think I don't know?

194
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,840
Is that what you think?

195
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,540
You... never trusted me.

196
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,120
No.

197
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,160
I trusted you, truly.

198
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,810
But you abandoned it

199
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,590
and ruined everything.

200
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,590
Is that what you believe?

201
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,140
Would you say the same thing
if it were Bihyung?

202
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,280
Bihyung is different.

203
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,660
Goblins don't betray.

204
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,470
And foxes do?

205
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,410
Fine.

206
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,600
I did it.

207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,990
Consider it all my doing.

208
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,240
How's that?

209
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,820
Aren't you sorry?

210
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,100
You were the one
who did something you should be sorry for!

211
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,960
I was wrong
for trusting you from the start.

212
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,770
I shouldn't have believed a fox.

213
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,440
Oh, how sorry I am.

214
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,890
But you enjoyed it, too.

215
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,680
You shouldn't hang out
with a darned fox like me.

216
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,160
You're a noble goblin, after all.

217
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,410
Thinking about it again,

218
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,500
I don't think foxes are the problem,
but you.

219
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,240
For betraying

220
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,760
and lying.

221
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,200
Do you like living such a dirty life?

222
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,750
In the end,

223
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,890
you're the same as everyone else.

224
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,800
Why?

225
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,680
Why did you confess back then?

226
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,420
I'll forget everything.

227
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,240
You!

228
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,690
Why are you so cute?

229
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,730
You even got a confession from a goblin.

230
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,670
I can't live anymore.

231
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,520
I only have two minutes left.

232
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,710
[Bihyung]

233
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,770
I'll keep my promise
and forget everything.

234
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,800
But...

235
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,960
if we meet again by chance,

236
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,710
I'll tell you that I like you, too.

237
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,390
Oh?
I haven't told him that I like him yet.

238
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,180
My head hurts.

239
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,090
[Bihyung]

240
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,960
Bihyung?

241
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,540
I'm blood type A, though?

242
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,540
[*T/N: "Bihyung"
sounds like blood type B in Korean.]

243
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,430
Wow.

244
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,490
Did I drink this much alone?

245
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,820
It's not like I'm an old man.

246
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,790
Wait, what is this place?

247
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,730
Right, Halmeoni
introduced me to this place.

248
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,380
I drank so much.

249
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,910
Huh?

250
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,760
Bihyung?

251
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,480
Huh?

252
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,680
Huh?

253
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,880
I didn't forget.

254
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,810
I-I remember everything!

255
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,400
I remember everything!

256
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Mister!

257
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,140
Mister!

258
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,160
Bihyung! Gildal!

259
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm Keumbok! I'm back!

260
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,630
Mister.

261
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,140
Who are you?

262
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,480
Are you here to see the house?

263
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,780
What?

264
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,990
In this economy,
it's rare to see such a cheap house.

265
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,900
I heard the family living here
moved abroad.

266
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,800
What?

267
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,060
[Closed]
[Thank you for your support
for Gumiho Plastic Surgery.]

268
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm dreaming, right?

269
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,320
Ouch!

270
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,760
No way.

271
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,040
Am I the one

272
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,650
who got forgotten?

273
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,930
I enjoyed my brief time here.

274
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,780
Thanks for taking me in.

275
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,890
I'll forget this

276
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,340
and return to being human.

277
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,790
[Sugar]

278
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,270
[Salt]

279
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,980
I put labels
on the salt and sugar shakers.

280
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,230
Don't mix them up anymore.

281
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,630
[Chili powder] [Pepper]

282
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,100
[Chili powder] [Pepper] [Sugar] [Salt]

283
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:46,620
I'm sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye.

284
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,570
Bihyung,

285
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,530
you're the coolest just as you are.

286
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,610
You're not anyone's goblin, but Bihyung.

287
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,570
Take care.

288
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,340
Thank you for everything.

289
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,790
From Superstar Keumbok.
