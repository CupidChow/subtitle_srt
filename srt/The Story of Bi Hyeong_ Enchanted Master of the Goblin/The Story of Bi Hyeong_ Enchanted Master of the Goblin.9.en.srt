I can't help but be curious,

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,920
and I can't help missing you.

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,730
And right here,

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,710
it feels like
it's been struck by lightning—

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,300
it's a tingling feeling.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,970
Are you really sick?

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,230
You were there on the mountain,

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,560
and you were at my house, too.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,890
Hey. You've come to the wrong place.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,270
I've confirmed it—our relationship.

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,010
Hey, you being like this, Keumbok will—

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,470
no—does Bihyung know?

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,250
This is my privacy.

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,700
Privacy?

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,290
You've grown up.

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,140
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,400
Free lunch?

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,070
Nothing happened between us—

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,850
I like you.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,060
I'm not avoiding you because you're dirty.

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,170
I'm just shy.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,740
You're so pretty
I can't even bear to look at you.

24
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,440
You made me fall for you,

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,610

did you do all this?

38
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,040
The more he gets entangled

You're Samshin Halmeoni,

61

Don't you remember?

72
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,090

To save you.

80
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,810

81
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,420

82

You're too naive!

83
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,090
I'm surprised you're still alive
in a goblin's house.

84
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,400
Goblin?

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,570
No way.

86
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,800
You can see ghosts.
Why don't you believe in goblins?

87
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,650

88

in front of you, but the Grim Reaper.

93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh, right. This guy is also a goblin.

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,580
How could he be a human with that body?

95
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,520
Can Bihyung...

96
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,270
wake up?

97
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,680
He expended too much of his energy.

98
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,000
If this state continues,

99
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,659
he might never wake up.

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,760
Without essence, I don't think
he can make it through the 16th.

101
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,380
Essence.

102
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,910
I can give him essence!
If he sucks essence from me—

103
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,840
Even so, he can't wake up.

104
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,920
Without his master's summon.

105
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,640
We can just go find this master.

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,940
Where is he?

107
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,720
We can't find him.

108
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,520
He left Bihyung 1,000 years ago.

109
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,160
1,000 years?

110
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,630
That's why, Ha Keumbok,

111
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,409
we need you.

112
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,280
What?

113
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,710
Travel back to the past
and stop Bihyung from meeting his master.

114
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,789
Then he'll wake up on his own eventually.

115
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,300
In other words,

116
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,460
we just need to make sure
he doesn't meet his owner?

117
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,570
Halmeoni!

118
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,350
Let me do it.

119
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,250
Cheoyong is only allowing
Ha Keumbok to do it.

120
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,150
How can we trust him?

121
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,830
He was the one who made Bihyung like this
to begin with—

122
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:05,000
He wants Bihyung to be alone.

123
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,180
That's why he did that to Keumbok, too.

124
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,920
You may not believe it,

125
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,640
but he really wants Bihyung to come back.

126
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,290
I'll do it.

127
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,520
Keumbok!

128
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,590
I feel like my brain is going to explode.

129
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,310
But one thing is for sure,

130
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,960
he won't wake up if I don't go.

131
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,590
So...

132
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,130
I'll go.

133
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,710
I'll go and save him.

134
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,770
I heard that a full moon eclipse happened

135
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,210
when he met his master.

136
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,030
Just hang in...

137
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,380
Just hang in there until then.

138
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,310
Ha Keumbok.

139
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,510
You'll forget everything

140
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,120
three days after you return.

141
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,620
Be it us,

142
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,820
the ghosts,

143
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,500
or Bihyung, you'll forget everything.

144
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,640
After three days...

145
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,310
The 16th?

146
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,790
You're going to make someone forget
a person they care about the most.

147
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,890
You should be prepared to lose something.

148
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,140
Can you do it?

149
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,450
How did you find me?

150
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,190

159
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,660
I was going to stay here for a few days.

160
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,860
If that's not possible...

161
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,980
just say it.

162
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,350
How can I just say it
when you're threatening me with a knife?

163
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,090
Your answer is quite loud.

164
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,500
By the way,

165
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,510
where did your hair go?

166
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,850
Did it get eaten by a dog?

167
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,680
Or are you a slave who fled?

168
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,350
Was it cut by your master?

169
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,930
You're neither a beggar nor a slave.

170
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,570
Why would you
be living in a place like this?

171
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,100
Are you telling me to stop talking
and just eat?

172
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,250
Forget it.

173
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,930
Not only do I look noble,

174
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,410
my taste and background are very high-class.

175
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,470
How arrogant.

176
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,200
You were the same back then.

177
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,170
I won't charge you
for appreciating beauty.

178
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,990
After all, I'm a deity
with a great appearance.

179
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,820
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,600
You're weird.

181
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,490
Don't you want to know who I am?

182
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,210
Do you know about the goblin
with a kill order on him?

183
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,090
Apparently, the war,

184
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,930
drought, and plague over the past 10 years

185
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,860
were all caused by that goblin king.

186
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,380
I thought I was just helping
by following the king's orders.

187
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,800
In the end, it was all a lie.

188
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,190
I'm here to kill the goblin king, Bihyung.

189
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,020
Tell me if you see anyone suspicious.

190
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,980
Don't be bewitched by the goblin.

191
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,540
I'll be practicing over there.

192
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,410
Don't follow me.

193
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,060
I told you not to follow me.

194
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,690
Hey.

195
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,320
What's your name?

196
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,410
[Ha]

197
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,800
[Keum]

198
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,340
[Bok]

199
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,450
What are these characters?

200
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,120
Ah.

201
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,940
You haven't learned how to read, have you?

202
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,180
Don't be ashamed.

203
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,950
[Bihyung]

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,260
That's my name.

205
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,780
Right.

206
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,210
In your eyes, these words
probably look like they're dancing.

207
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,630
This roar comes from
this Tiger Mountain's elder.

208
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,330
He's warning those who have
evil intentions toward Tiger Mountain.

209
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,670
The goblin king, who stirred up
a bloody storm, might be scared of it,

210
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,370
But there's no need for weak
and young people like you to worry.

211
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,050
By the way,

212
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,750
You're scared by such a small noise.

213
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,070
I guess my embrace
feels reliable to you.

214
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,720
Is he crazy?

215
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,830
At this time,

216
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,850
he laughed a lot.

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,950
What about Jigwi?

218
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,310
As you guessed,

219
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,310
he approached us to get the medicine.

220
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,390
So, where is his brother?

221
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,420
I heard that a few days ago...

222
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,970
he died.

223
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,110
Speaking of which, this house's owner
is unable to speak.

224
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,520
That's fortunate.

225
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,220
Fortunate?

226
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,110
How could you say that?

227
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,020
Huh?

228
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,460
My apologies.

229
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,040
The Killer Corps will be here soon.

230
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,080
Now that everything is ready,
you just need to leave.

231
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,460
What about him?

232
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,550
I'm afraid that being involved
with us will be his greatest suffering.

233
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,810
We won't have anyone on our side anymore.

234
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,310
We must depart immediately, Bihyung.

235
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,880
Did he meet his master

236
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,630
and leave this place?

237
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,180
It can't be.

238
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,590
They said he met his master here

239
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,230
during the full moon eclipse.

240
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,540
It's been four days.

241
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,470
But it felt like a thousand years.

242
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,100
This roar comes from
this Tiger Mountain's elder.

243
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,840
The goblin king, who stirred up
a bloody storm, might be scared of it,

244
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,740
But there's no need for weak
and young people like you to worry.

245
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,040
He's still here.

246
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,990
You absorbed some essence?

247
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,680
To be exact, after I touched him,

248
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,750
my recovery accelerated.

249
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,860
Does that mean he's...

250
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,900
Yes.

251
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,840
That's a relief.

252
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,500
Then before the Killer Corps arrive,
get him...

253
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,690
The deeper he gets involved with me,

254
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,100
he may have it tougher than I do.

255
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,590
But he's the only human
you can get essence from.

256
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,390
You should take him with you,
even if you have to use brute force.

257
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,790
You can't be swayed
by insignificant things

258
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,750
like empathy.

259
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,120
This is not empathy.

260
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,740
Until now,

261
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,310
I've never been so anxious and greedy.

262
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,310
But Gildal...

263
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,870
I...

264
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,430
felt fear for the first time.

265
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,610
How can this feeling

266
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,550
be just empathy?

267
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,020
I heard that
the full moon eclipse happened

268
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,490
when he picked his master.

269
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,330
Just hang in...

270
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,950
Just hang in there until then.

271
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,920
Master?

272
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,370
I'll come back later, then.

273
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,290
Now that I'm fully recovered,

274
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,860
I have no reason to stay here.

275
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,650
Are you telling me not to leave?

276
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,590
The bleeding stopped in just one night.

277
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,290
It didn't even leave a scar.

278
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,340
Do you think I'm a normal human being?

279
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,320
You don't know me.

280
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,600
Don't stop me.

281
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,830
Go back in

282
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,700
before I hurt you.

283
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,450
I'm not from the Killer Corps.

284
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,250
I'm that Bihyung.

285
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,450
You knew?

286
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,190
That I was a goblin?

287
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,300
I was curious.

288
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,700
Why did you help me,
someone you'd never met before?

289
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:00,170
Why do I feel at ease by your side?

290
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,500
But it doesn't matter now.

291
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,790
You found me,
and I'm willing to give myself to you.

292
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,660
This is the token
that proves I belong to you.

293
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,120
From now on, you are my master.

294
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,750
We have to hurry.

295
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,520
I'll go get the candle. Just wait.

296
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,360
The one he missed
for a thousand years...

297
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,170
was me.

298
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,050
I was his master.

299
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,810
How old-fashioned.
Who gives things like this anymore?
