[The Story of Bihyung]

8
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,380
Are you a rat or a fox?

9
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,840
Sneaking in, you have quite the good fate.

10
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,780
That's nothing
compared to your fate of seeking death.

11
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,220
You darn fox.

12
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,780
I didn't notice this
'cause I was always the one below,

13
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,980
but looking closely,
you have pretty delicate features.

14
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,329
Shall I play with you for old times' sake?

15
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:38,790
Thinking about having you below me
is making me quite excited.

16
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,360
You still have the habit
of riding on people's heads.

17
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,550
But what to do?

18
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,530
You're the prettiest
when you cry on the ground.

Shall we relive
the beautiful times we had?

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,450
What?

22
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,350
Didn't you say we should relive
the beautiful times we had?

23
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,650
You're so wooden.

24
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,010
No wonder you were abandoned.

25
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,710
That crazy fox, seriously—

26
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,010
Come in.

Gildal!

28
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,760
I saw Dr. Jigwi in our home just now.

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,630
Oh...

30
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,550
I think I brought him here.

31
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,870
I got drunk and...

32
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,630
But they got really close and...

33
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,500
And...

34
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,580
A-A-And?

35
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,150
The atmosphere was so dark.

36
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,060
I saw it with my own eyes.

37
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,000
What's their relationship?

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You said they had bad blood.

39
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,060
Might've slept together...

40
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,079
What?

41
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,340
No.

42
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,070
Did sleep together...

43
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,220
What?

44
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,110
So he's in that kind of relationship
with Dr. Jigwi?

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,030
You can't tell him.

46
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,900
Bihyung doesn't even know
that you have met Jigwi before.

47
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,580
But if he finds out,

48
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,210
you'll be kicked out immediately.

49
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,900
You saw nothing.

50
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,909
You didn't come to my room,

51
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,950
nor have we talked about this.

52
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,750
Nothing happened, just as usual.

53
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,450
Got it?

54
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,980
Yes.

55
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,470
Might've slept together.

56
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,120
No.

57
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,170
Did sleep together.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
Why are you acting shy?

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,460
You have good taste.

64
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,280
A-Are you having breakfast?

65
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,310
Why?

66
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,060
Can't I?

67
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,940
This is the first time we're having
breakfast together. I'm surprised.

68
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,130
Is the sun rising in the west today?

69
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,260
You don't want to eat breakfast with me?

70

No.

71
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,130
That's not it.

72
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,020
We drank together all night

73
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,000
and are sobering up together
in the morning.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,030
This is a complete date...

75
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,520
Put more vegetables.

76
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,370
Thanks to someone, I used
quite a bit of strength last night.

77
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,300
Yeah, that must have been the case.

78
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,980
Why isn't he here yet?

79
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,280
He always comes on the dot
at mealtimes.

80
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm a little late.

81
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,660
You...

82
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,850
Why do you look like this?

83
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,690
What's wrong with him?

84
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,530
Is it because of Jigwi?

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,730
I shouldn't have let you two meet
to start with.

86
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,140
It's all my fault.

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,380
Whatever.

88
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,450
I can't just abandon a drunkard.

89

What?

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,140
Gosh, but his temper is still
as terrible as ever.

91
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,910
He hasn't changed at all.

92
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,030
Don't let Keumpoop run into him.

93
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,860
What?

94
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,120
What about me?

95
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,940
People like you are his type.

96
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,820
You look like you'll fall for beauty
and give up everything, even your liver.

97
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,430
I'm not like that.

98
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,670
You're right.

99
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,790
Living with someone like me, normal people
won't be up to your standards.

100
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,970
Right?

101
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,159
Just eat.

102
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,070
Shall I?

103
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,840
You haven't sobered up yet?

104
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,290
What? Why?

105
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,060
Why is this so sweet?

106
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,770
You're amazing.

107
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,470
You can even make honey water
out of dried pollack.

108
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,270
I'll make it again. Stop eating.

109
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,930
Thanks for the meal.

110
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,510
I'll be taking my leave.

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,250
He...

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,549
Why is he acting like that?

113
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,870
He ate it all.

114
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,390
Bihyung slept with Jigwi...

115
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,770
So, the engagement
that Gildal mentioned before...

116
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,050
Was it with Dr. Jigwi?

117
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,060
An engagement?

118
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,660
Is someone getting married?

119
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,430
That's not it.

120
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,270
Ma'am,

121
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,530
can couples who broke up on bad terms

122
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,850
still kiss and sleep together?

123
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,650
That's physical attachment.

124
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,160
What? Physical attachment?

125
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,930
But I heard it was a really bad breakup.

126
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,370
That makes it even more likely to be physical attachment.

127
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,020
They are attracted
to each other physically,

128
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,190
make mistakes again,

129
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,650
and ruin everything again.

130
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,830
Ruin everything?

131
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,170
What should I do then?

132
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,130
What can you do?

133
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,800
Just stand by and watch.

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,530
It's someone else's business.

135
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,090
Someone else's...

136
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,870
But I can't.

137
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,930
Goodness.

138
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,750
You said you'll be auditioning soon.

139
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,420
How can you be distracted?

140
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm starting to get physical with him.

141
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,210
What should I do?

142
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,680
Dating

143
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,670
is similar to eating.

144
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,190
In other words, right now,
you're giving food out to him

145
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,410
even before knowing what he likes.

146
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,880
Situations like this
normally end badly.

147
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,590

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,360
That is...

151
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,090
What are you doing?

152
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,290
Aren't you studying?

153
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,230
This is also studying, okay?

154
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,920
Studying about life.

155
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,410
Is there a need to study things
this blatant?

156
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,200
It's easy.

157
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,600
What is it?

158
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,250
Our Samsin Halmeoni is already so old,

159
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,510
yet she still has the mental age of a baby.

160
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,460
Hey! Whatever.

161
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,120
You don't know either, right?

162
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,470
What is it?

163
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,030
You have to bait them—it's like
you're giving it to them but not.

164
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,080
Make it so they can't choose.

165
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,680

to avoid it ending badly.

167
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,780
That is...

168
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,070
this burning sincerity.

169
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,750
Confess passionately and stamp it on them,
"You're mine."

170
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,670
Stamp it...

171
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,480
You're already at this stage.

172
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,200
Is there any other way?

173
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,050
Is this taking the confession
as a chance to scold them?

174
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,960
Hey, if you made me fall for you,
you should take responsibility.

175
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,780
Are you a piece of trash that'd just
run away

176
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,150

177
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,740
No! I'll take responsibility!

I was worried
because you weren't picking up.

Worried about what?

I want to talk about last night.

188
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,350
Must we?

189
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,020
Is there a need?

190
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,810
Of course.

191
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,980
That s-something like this
happened despite our relationship.

192
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,670
Something like this?

193
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,640
What's our relationship?

194
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,750
What?

195
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,410
I don't really know
what our relationship is.

196
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,070
Call me when you figure it out.

197
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,120
[To Gumiho Plastic Surgery CEO, Jigwi]

198
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,690
[Do you like this type these days?]

199
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,930
With the tiger not at home,
the fox claims to be the king.

200
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,080
Sneaking in, you have quite the good fate.

201
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,480
That's nothing
compared to your fate of seeking death.

202
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,910
How dare you. With Keumpoop around, I...

203
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,800
Who are you calling a kid?

204
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,460
Are you going to keep making me
conscious of you?

205
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,820
I'm afraid there will be trouble
when I see you.

206
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,160
It's someone else's business.

207
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,580
Keumbok.

208
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,920
Put away your apron.

209
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,860
Remember to lock the door.

210
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,130
I'm heading off.

211
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,140
Okay! Goodbye!

212
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,650
What?

213
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,670
It's raining.

214
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,070
Jeez, I didn't bring an umbrella.
I'm done for.

215
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,980
Huh? Why is this here?

216
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,030
It's all cooked.

217
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,820
Almost.

218
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,550
See you.

219
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,170
Ha Keumbok!

220
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,100
Are you okay?

221
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,270
Are you calmer now?

222
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,579
Which crazy ghost dares to do this?

223
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,880
You promised me that
I wouldn't see them, right?

224
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,480
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,670
I was careless.

226
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,880
It's all my fault.

227
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,150
It's not your fault.

228
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,700
It's my fault. Why are you taking my side?

229
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,780
I mean...

230
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,720
you came to save me.

231
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,370
What are you doing?

232
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,420
It's a mess now.

233
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm relaxed now.

234
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,150
I'm not referring to you, but your energy.

235
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,660
What about that?

236
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,290
It'll be dangerous if this continues.

237
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,820
You might fall for something again.

238
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,920
What should I do then?

239
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,070
Let's hold hands and spend a day together.

240
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,920
What?

241
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,890
Or find your pulse.

242
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,860
M-My

243
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,110
pulse?

244
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,260
It's the path that the essence takes.

245
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,540
Because your breath is a mess,
your pulse has hidden itself.

246
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,600
Ha Keumpoop, take off your clothes first.

247
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,600
Cry or laugh—just choose one.

248
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,450
It tickles!

249
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,010
You haven't found it yet?

250
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,590
It's been 10 minutes.

251
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,590
Give me your hand.

252
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,260
Why do you keep sniffing it?

253
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,420
Are you a dog or what?

254
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,530
There's a pulse in the place
where the scent gets stronger.

255
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,660
Why do you keep saying I smell?

256
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,650
Freshly cooked fried chicken.

257
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,930
Guess you can't help it.

258
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,060
But am I sweet and spicy sauce
or original fried chicken?

259
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,710
Focus!

260
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,640
Are you nervous?

261
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,390
What?

262
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,840
N-No.

263
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,050
Why would I be?

264
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,590
Because I'm too handsome.

265
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,860
What are you talking about?

266
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,750
I used to be in a beauty pageant.

267
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,420
I know you're pretty.

268
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,870
Sit down,

269
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,180
Cabbage Kid Champ.

270
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,310
But...

271
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,790
Don't move.

272
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,690
No, I'm not moving.

273
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,960
I have something to say.

274
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,710
What is it?

275
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,960
Do you...

276
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,530
like...
