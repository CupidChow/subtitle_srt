00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,830
Bihyung was birthed
by a human and a ghost.

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,430
He's the one who can dispatch goblins,

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,070

5

Bihyung, though powerful,
has a fatal weakness.

Yet Bihyung's master

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,630
left him alone and disappeared.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,750
What's worse is that

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,920
goblins need the essence from humans.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,750
But because of Bihyung's unique physique,

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,990
he is unable to absorb essences.

14

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,480
he had no master nor energy.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,710
In the endless hunger, desire,
and loneliness,

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,930
Bihyung needs to live with a firm mind.

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,200

but he was no longer a king.

19

but he was no longer a ghost.

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,260
Hey, Samsin Halmeoni.

185
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,940
Am I really not going to die
even like that?

186
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,980
I feel like I'm already suffering enough.

187
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,470
Goblins don't die.

188
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,860
Go gather some essence.

189
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,790
So that you can feel better

190
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,880
and restore your power.

191
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,720
You know.

192
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,470
It's not that
I can absorb anyone's essence.

193
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,710
But you have to keep trying
until you find one.

194
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,720
It's not long before the 16th.

195
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
Didn't you say

196
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,560
that I only have one master.

197
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
Maybe I've been destined to be over
since that day.

198
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,320
Who knows?

199
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,300
Maybe the heavens
will give you another master.

200
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,730
I'm sick of hearing that.

201
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,080
Bye.

202
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,860
Are you here alone?

203
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,790
If you don't mind—

204
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,140
I'm meeting someone.

205
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,570
We don't usually make the first move.

206
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,450
But you're so handsome.
Can you give me your phone number...

207
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,950
Don't touch me.

208
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,300
What the heck?

209
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,070
It's getting worse.

210
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,010
I'm sick of this.

211
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,520
Are you okay?

212
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,950
Get lost!

213
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,260
I'm willing to give myself
to you who found me.

214
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,060
From now on, you are my master.

215
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,670
My master.

216
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,430
It must be a coincidence.

217
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,280
There aren't that many days left
till the 16th.

218
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,340
Yet evil spirits like this
are still wandering around.

219
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,290
Why do you keep following me?

220
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,480
Seriously?

221
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,540
I'm going in the same direction as you.
What else can I do?

222
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,819
You kept staring at me too,

223
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,720
making me feel uncomfortable.

224
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,680
Why do you keep treating me
like I'm a criminal?

225
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,050
Th-That's not it.

226
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,460
Then go ahead first.

227
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,170
Darn it.

228
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,069
You crazy bitch! Shut up and follow me—

229
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,740
My body...

230
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,410
Are you curious?

231
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,100
Why I can see through you?

232
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,010
Because only you

233
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,020
can see me.

234
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,590
Since then,

235
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,740
[Wanted Suspect]

236
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,480
it has always been you.

237
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,480
My prey.

238
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,790
I-I'm sorry.

239
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,990
Let's go!

240
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,960
Let's go!

241
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,580
Save me...

242
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,320
Goblin?

243
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,130
Just an evil spirit.

244
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,930
Seems like you're hiding

245
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,880
something interesting.

246
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,230
Don't cross the line and get lost.

247
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,900
The trash made by humans
should be cleaned up by humans.

248
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,640
Gildal?

249
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,160
Just be mine.

250
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,320
What?

251
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,100
There's no free lunch in this world.

252
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,080
Pay it back with your body.
