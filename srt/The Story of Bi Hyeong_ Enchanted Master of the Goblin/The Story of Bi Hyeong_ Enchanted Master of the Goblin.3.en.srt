00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,190
A long, long time ago,

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,950
there was a small village
at a deep mountain entrance.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,600
That village had a divine stone
that had been passed down for years.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,550
It was a protection stone with fragments of
the Mountain God.

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,410
Later generations called it Gildal.

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,320
This divine stone
stubbornly stood at the village gate,

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,310
enduring the sun, rain, snow, and wind,

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,030
guarding the village silently
for hundreds of years.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,400
This divine stone
had divine consciousness.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,130
A righteous person could pass by easily.

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,230
But those who had evil intentions
and might cause trouble to the village

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,620
would never pass by safely.

13
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,200
The divine stone would suddenly transform

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,960
and become a strong male

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
and wrestle with people all the time.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Facing this battle they couldn't win,

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
the villains would
eventually become exhausted and leave.

18
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,520
But one day,

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,330
when the balance of
heaven and earth was in chaos,

20
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,950
a noble in Silla Palace named Bihyung

21
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,330
looked for ghosts and goblins.

22
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,509
The rumor of this divine stone
was spread to the court.

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,240
Bihyung found this stone and said,

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,170
"Since you have judged justice
for so many years,

25
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,710
would you like to wear human clothes

26
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,050
and protect this world with me?"

27
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,580
With that said,

28
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,950
a goblin with sparkly eyes rose.

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,730

Why isn't he picking up?

186
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,390
Did you get indigestion?

187
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,350
I don't smell of anything though.

188
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,420
What are you doing here?

189
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,500
Well...

190
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,980
I think he has a stomach upset.

191
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,010
Wait. What time is it?

192
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,060
Gosh, I'm late.

193
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,610
Hyung, I'm going to work!

194
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,320
Halmeoni, I think I've finally gone crazy.

195
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
You just found out?

196
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,350
I smelled flowers—something sweet—
on a human.

197
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,660
How do I put this?

198
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,410
It's like I'm bewitched by him.

199
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,400
Who is he?

200
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,610
Why do you ask?

201
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,790
So that they can give me numbers
to buy a lottery ticket.

202
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,430
What?

203
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,880
A shaman is most powerful
right after they've been possessed.

204
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,190
If this person's scent is enough to
bewitch the demons,

205
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,810
then the gate of hell must be... open.

206
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,150
Why would a human with no divine power
suddenly open the gate of hell...

207
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,020
Could it be...

208
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,170
There's only one reason.

209
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,960
It's because he got too intimate
with non-humans, so it opened.

210
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,610
Intimate?

211
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,260
Did you think of anything?

212
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,210
Could it be...
I don't think it's you, though.

213
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,560
Gildal?

214
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,680
-Bihyung, is your stomach feeling better?
-Where is Keumpoop?

215
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,740
He said he went for his part-time job.

216
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,910
That human's in trouble.

217
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,660
Since the gate of hell is open,

218
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,200
all ghosts will come to him.

219
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,470
Sorry!

220
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,200
Interesting.

221
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,990
So sweet.

222
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,330
Grandpa?

223
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,310
Come here.

224
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,630
Grandpa!

225
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,570
Move! There are cars!

226
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,830
Grandpa, it's dangerous!

227
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,210
Grandpa!

228
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,730
Move! It's dangerous! There are cars!

229
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,330
Car!

230
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,140
Grandpa!

231
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,850
Move! There's a car coming!

232
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,050
Grandpa!

233
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,500
Hey! Grandpa!

234
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,520
Th-There's a car!

235
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,060
Move!

236
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,460
Don't move.

237
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,920
You'll die if you go there now.

238
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,160
Let go of me!

239
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,040
Please, let me go!

240
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,750
What was that?

241
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,310
What are you looking at?

242
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,840
Go on with your work.

243
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,100
You should be carrying things like this
to work out.
