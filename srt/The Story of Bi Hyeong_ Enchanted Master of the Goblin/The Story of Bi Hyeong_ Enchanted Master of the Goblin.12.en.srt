Congratulations.

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,260
Yes.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,290
You passed the audition.
Why do you look so unexcited?

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,810
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,280
Why? Did you break up?

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,450
Really?

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,770
He's not human.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,270
He's a goblin. My first love.

13
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,480
Some also say
that you were completely immersed

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,930
in your passionate love with a goblin
even before the shooting,

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,940

It's been a year,
yet you still don't remember my name.

This is my born attitude.

That's why I value you,
Superstar Ha, so much.

56
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,010
Because you're the only one
who's stuck to your contract with me.

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,130
What about the thing I asked you to do?

58
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,310
The pawnshop?

59
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,850
It doesn't exist.

60
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,260
I searched all over Seoul but couldn't
find a pawnshop with that name.

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
Please help me keep looking for it.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,620
Of course.

63
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,510

But why would a big shot like this
invest in a company with only one artist?

I heard he's a fan of yours,

72
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,590
Oh, really?

Awesome.

looks better today.

Let's change seats.

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,110
Why change seats?

Let's change.

81
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,700
So he can see this side of my face.

82
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,390
They have to see me like this

83
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,060
so we can get the investment.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,750
It's the same. How is it different?

85
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,500
This side looks better.

86
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,390
Have a seat.

87
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,970

Where did you get this—

94

I want to know if you mean

95
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,460
what you said in your interview.

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,320
That your first love was a goblin.

97
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,210
That's because he's immersed
in his character—

98
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,480
Sir?

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,260
I'll get going.

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,050
You two have a good chat.

101
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,770
Sir, I...

102
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,210
I'll go with you.

103
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,840
Let him go.

104
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,540
I'll take him home safely.

105
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,130
Who are you?

106
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,830
The pawnshop owner you're looking for.

107
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,570
I can't trust you either, then.

108
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,020
You sent a ghost to kill me.

109
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,020
I don't normally kill humans.

110
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,930
As long as they have nothing
to do with us.

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,620
If you want to get involved,

112
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,510
you can follow him.

113
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,060
Why did you come to me?

114
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,350
You should have forgotten everything,

115
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,450
but you talked about goblins.

116
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,200
Not only did you dispel the evil spirits
without leaving a trace,

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,720
and your energy is quite intact.

118
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,140
You still remember it, too.

119
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,320
This is a first.

120
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,190
Where is he?

121
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,210
Do you want to see him?

122
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,760
I have to see him.

123
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,370
Why?

124
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,910
Your life is already perfect, right?

125
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,870
You starred in the movie you wanted to.

126
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,880
You're doing well as an actor, too.

127
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,260
If you get involved with non-humans,
it will be difficult.

128
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,180
Why don't you sign the contract again?

129
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,720
I promise I won't make a mistake this time

130
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,920
and I'll wipe it all clean.

131
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
You must have been

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,870
single all your life.

133
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,010
You don't seem to understand.

134
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,350
Sometimes, rather than being alone,
it's better to suffer together.

135
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,820
Especially when you're in love.

136
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,860
Ha Keumbok.

137
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,679
It's been hard for me,
even though it was just a year.

138
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,150
But he waited for a thousand years.

139
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,050
How could he forget?

140
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,990
See you.

141
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,360

Long time no see.

144

Thank you for the Korean beef you sent me.

146
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,860
How did you change so much in a year?

147
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,910
I saw you on TV.

148
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,700
I was thinking about you.

149
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,240
I'm so happy to see you.

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,110
Me too.

151
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,430
I was just passing by, so I decided
to drop by since it's been a while.

152
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,610
I have a lot of memories here.

153
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,220
You're the only one
who remembers me from back then, too.

154
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,330
How could I forget you from back then?

155
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,030
Right?

156
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,290
You always broke dishes
and forgot customers' orders,

157
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,570
making mistakes everywhere.

158
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,500
Ma'am,
when did I forget customer orders?

159
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,870
But it was a nice time, too.

160
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,020
You worked hard no matter what you did.

161
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,950
I also watched your interview.

162
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,080
You did?

163
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,690
What a twist.

164
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,170
I thought you were an innocent kid.

165
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,550
The love confession was so passionate.

166
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,580
How did your real first love end?

167
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,070
Hmm... Not yet.

168
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,190
I'm already getting envious of the person

169
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,480
who'd be your first love.

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,990
No, I mean it hasn't ended.

171
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,900
I still like him.

172
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,140
The goblin.

173
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,440
Oh?

174
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,090
I didn't expect you to be so into it.

175
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,590
My goblin is special.

176
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,740
He can't distinguish salt from sugar,
yet is picky when it comes to food.

177
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,980
You can keep this for yourself.

178
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,710
Is it good?

179
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,640
He would grumble, but he'd still
bring an umbrella for me on rainy days.

180
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,490
Huh?

181
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,950
Why is this here?

182
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,050
If I say I'm scared, he'll be with me.

183
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,280
Are you a kid?

184
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,590
Why are you afraid?

185
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,770
