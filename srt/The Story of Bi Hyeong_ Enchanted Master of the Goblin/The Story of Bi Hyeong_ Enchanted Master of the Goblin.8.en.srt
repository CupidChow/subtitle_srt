Now you look like a human.

181
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,760
You call that human?

182
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,700
You've finally met the right person.

183
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,530
Treat him well.

184
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,270
What should I do?

185
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,710
Well...

186
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,250
Just don't leave any regrets.

187
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,200
Is there any other way?
What do you think?

188
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,390
He's quiet today.

189
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,200
[Is this a convenient time for a call?]

190
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,890
Is this a convenient time for a call?

191
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,190
Call the clinic's front desk
if you need help.

192
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,110
[Is this a convenient time for a call?]
[Call the clinic's front desk
if you need help.]

193
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,640
[Are you asleep?]
[Sir, please don't contact me
so early in the morning.]

194
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,760
Are you asleep?

195
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,910
Sir, please don't contact me
so early in the morning.

196
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,490
[The moon is so beautiful.]
[Did you drink?]

197
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,870
The moon is so beautiful.

198
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,380
Did you drink?

199
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,620
[Sorry.]

200
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,210
Sorry.

201
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,820
Sir, please stop contacting me
for private matters.

202
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,830
[Sir, please stop contacting me
for private matters.]

203
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,550
Okay. I hope your clinic gets good business.

204
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,930
[Okay. I hope your clinic
gets good business.]
[Good luck to you too.^^]

205
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,950
[Okay. I hope your clinic
gets good business.]

206
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,560
Good luck to you, too.

207
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,330
[Good luck to you, too.^^]

208
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,850
Yes.

209
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,070
Come in.

210
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,970
I don't have time to play with you.

211
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,960
I need to see a doctor, too.

212
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,760
What do you mean?
This is a plastic surgery clinic.

213
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,730
I can't help but be curious,

214
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,510
and I can't help missing you.

215
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,480
And right here,

216
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,860
it feels like
it's been struck by lightning—

217
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,260
it's a tingling feeling.

218
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,100
Are you really sick?

219
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,810
You were there on the mountain,

220
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,780
and you were at my house, too.

221
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,700
Hey. You've come to the wrong place.

222
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,390
I've confirmed it—our relationship.

223
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,960
Can you just come out here like that?

224
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,850
That kid just opened the gate of hell.

225
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,240
Don't worry.

226
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,970
I've done what it takes
to repel small ghosts from him.

227
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,050
Yeah, well...

228
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,000
You'll take care of it.

229
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,590
At first, I hated it.

230
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,650
I wondered why such a person existed.

231
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,800
Is he really an Earthling like me?

232
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,570
I didn't understand.

233
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,220
My master...

234
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,580
So why would you pick up trash like that?

235
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,980
Why are you doing things
no one asked you to?

236
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,040
Who are you to care about me?

237
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,650
You should keep this for yourself.

238
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,700
You're really...

239
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,150
sensitive, irritable,

240
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,280
and picky.

241
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,970
I keep thinking of you.

242
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,150
What are you looking at?

243
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,970
Thank you for today.

244
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,110
I know.

245
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm sorry.

246
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,220
You little...

247
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,430
Move!

248
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,750
Are you okay?

249
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,760
It's safe around here at night.

250
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,460
Just letting you know.

251
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,660
Do you...

252
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,100
like...

253
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,950
I like you, from the bottom of my heart.

254
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,840
You must really like them.

255
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,160
What? I was just reading from the script.

256
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,180
That wasn't it.

257
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,780
You were thinking about someone,
weren't you?

258
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,820
Thank you for your performance,
Ha Keumbok.

259
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,270
Thank you.

260
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,220
I miss him? What the hell.

261
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,100
Found it.

262
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,870
Love is like eating.

263
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,570
You need to give
what the other person likes.

264
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,670
What if you can't?

265
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,350
Then just give a little

266
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,030
and take it back.

267
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,360
Give a little,

268
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,540
and take it back. Just like this.

269
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,050
It's like playing hard to get.

270
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,540
I'm a master.

271
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,850
I'm just waiting for my love to show up.
Where are they?

272
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,060
-Hey.
-Yes?

273
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,490
-Actors wait here—
-No.

274
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,490
He's about this tall and has a small face.

275
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,920
Anyway, I'm looking for a guy
called Ha Keumbok.

276
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,610
I'm not sure.

277
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,280
Ha Keumbok!

278
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,590
You're late.

279
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,010
You...

280
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,440
It's fun.

281
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,550
If you misuse your power now,

282
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,760
you might never come back alive.

283
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,440
Are you going to keep making me
conscious of you?

284
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,540
Excuse me.

285
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,250
Can I hold onto you?

286
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,650
It's night, after all.

287
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
Are you okay?

288
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,970
But...

289
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,280
you came to save me.

290
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,120
Give me your hand.

291
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,600
Again?

292
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,800
Do you want
to go to the gate of hell then?

293
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,090
Give me your hand.

294
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,080
You're a genius.
