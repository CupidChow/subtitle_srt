00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,660
Keumbok.

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,490
See you again.

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,370
Sure.

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,730
This is my first time
making a friend in Seoul.

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,580
Not as a friend.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,300
What?

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,680
I'm asking you out on a date.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,060
What?

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,960
Dr. Ji?

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,820
There's a mark.

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,500
Dr. Ji!

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,430
Are you okay?

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,270
What?

14
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,900
You're nothing but strength,
as always.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,920
Jigwi?

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,150
Dr. Ji, a-are you okay?

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,289
Your hand is bleeding.

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,490
You probably scratched it when you fell.

19
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,570
Go home and apply some medicine—

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm fine.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,480
I've always known he's old-fashioned and cruel.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,590
Oh, right.

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,020
You said you two were friends, right?

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,130
Friends?

25
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
Don't be fooled by him.

26
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,190
Jigwi once

27
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,710
stabbed Bihyung in his chest.

28
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,410
S-Stabbed?

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,050
Don't mess with Keumbok.

30
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,550
Do you like him?

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,990
Yes.

32
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,500
What?

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,050
No, it's not like that.

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,970
What?

35
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,780
What?

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,220
In that case, Keumbok, do you dislike me?

37
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,320
No, that's not it.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,000
What he's asking is
if there's something special between us.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
You...

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
are someone special to me, that's true.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,889
That's not it.

42
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,380
What he means is someone
you really cherish

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,570
and is so special that
you'd risk your life for—

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,810
That's right!

45
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,270
I really cherish you,
and you're very special to me.

46
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,380
Of course I'd risk my life for you.

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,920
Huh?

48
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,950
That's my first time hearing this...

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,970
Didn't you know?

50
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,510
It's been like this since I first met you.

51
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,210
I'll borrow this.

52
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,940
Well...

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,940

we didn't get to next time.

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,060
I must have lived for too long.

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,660
He'd risk his life?

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,800
What a pain.

We used to be.

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
Until he betrayed Bihyung.

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,470
What did he do?

70
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,050
Without Bihyung around,
I'm afraid I can't say much.

71
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,500
But because of this, Bihyung had to endure

That's amazing.

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,930
Bihyung ordered me to do it.

He said something about a kid
who's afraid of walking at night.

81

Hey.

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,290
Can I hold onto you?

85

It's night, after all.

86
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,210
Are you a kid? Why are you so scared?

87
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,630
You have my energy on you,
so you'll be fine for a while.

88
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,380
Even so...

89
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,500
You're faster than me,
since you have long legs.

Oh, that's...

91
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,930

Oh.

It's safe in the neighborhood
at night, too.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,800

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,210

Are you okay?

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,830
You haven't changed.

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Hello?

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,790
I'm healthy, but I don't have any money.

103
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,880
I'll buy insurance next time...

Oh, no!

But why is your heart beating so fast?

120
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm really sorry.

121
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,409
What happened?

122
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,100
Well...

123
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,950
-An agency?
-An agency?

124
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,320
I uploaded my photo
on the Aspiring Actors Forum,

125
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,010
and this agency said that they liked it

126
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,230
and asked me to pay them a visit.

127
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,950

with just one photo.

130
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,770

131
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,200
Here.

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,300
Well...

133
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,210
Wow, that's amazing.

134
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,020
Can I print this and hang it up
in a frame?

135
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,470
It's not quite at that level.

136
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,250
At this level, I don't think
we need to work in the through the night.

137
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,160
It should be able to repel ghosts.

138
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,450
It has such a scary vibe.

139
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,160
I haven't felt this much pressure
in a long time.

140
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,710
Stop looking at it.

141
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,590

Oh.

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,540
No.

149
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,250
You look much better in person
than in photos.

150
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,840
You have fair skin

151
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,370
and bright eyes.

152
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,830
Even so, you're not saying anything like
I'm handsome.

153
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,750
He has high standards.

154
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,820
He lives his life looking at me every day,

155
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,900
so it'd be weird
if he didn't have high standards.

156
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,620

157
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,180

158
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,930
Y-You have a type?

159
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,070
I have standards, too.

160
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,410
I'm curious.

161
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,230
What's your ideal type?

162
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,050
Someone ordinary.

163
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,890
Pale skin

164
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,270
and full lips.

165
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,850
With thin ankles, but is a fast runner.

166
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,130
Wow, you're so picky.

167
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,270
What?

168
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,870
Everyone has standards like that,
don't they?

169
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,230
Well, my ideal type is clear, too.

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,740
You two haven't even dated before.

171
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,520
That's not true.

172
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,060
I was invited on a date recently—

173
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,730
When? Where? With whom?

174
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,180
Answer me with the 5Ws and 1H.

175
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,800
But it sounded like a joke.

176
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,160
I knew it.

177
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,250
You're Ha Keumpoop, after all.

178
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,230
What?

179
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,870
Gosh, I'm doomed.

180
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,240
What?

181
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
Well...

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,740
The agency sent me the script
for the meeting in advance.

183
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,440
The lines are all for romance scenes.

184
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,040
What's wrong with that?

185
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,850
You may find this unbelievable...

186
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,330
but I've never been in a relationship.

187
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,960
Are you laughing?

188
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,830
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

189
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,130
Y-Y-You've gone crazy!

190
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,570
This is just the beginning.

191
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,090
I won't forgive you.
I'm going to report you to the police.

192
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,540
J-Just for this?

193
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,200
To register our marriage.

194
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,200
[T/N: A pun on "reporting to the police"
and "registering a marriage" in Korean.]

195
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,560
What do you think?

196
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,690
It's cute.

197
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,260
That won't do.

198
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,380
This should be a charismatic confession
from a man like an injured lone wolf.

199
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,810
Charismatic?

200
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,920
That's what I'm best at.

201
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,670
Should I just kick them out?

202
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,670
H-Hyung, this is a bit...

203
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,540
Don't move. Stand at attention!

204
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,170
Huh?

205
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,170
Get a grip and stand at attention!

206
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,550
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

207
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,600
Are you not going to answer me?

208
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,410
Y-You've gone crazy!

209
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,610
I'll show you what "crazy" really is.

210
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,790
I won't forgive you.

211
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to report you to the police.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,660
To register our marriage.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,170
How was that?

214
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,240
Did your heart flutter?

215
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,370
I feel like my heart is going to explode.

216
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,190
Is this what charisma is like?

217
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,140
How can I do it like you?

218
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,950
I didn't do anything special.

219
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,040
It must be a talent of mine.

220
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,620
I knew it.

221
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,320
Then you must be very popular.

222
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,430
Even as a man, my heart is pounding.

223
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,880
No.

224
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,990
I'm just like you.

225
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,890
Huh? In what way?

226
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,040
Have you never dated before?

227
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,940
Since you were born?

228
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,490
There's no need for that.

229
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,360
Who gets into a relationship
because it's a necessity?

230
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,630
Then why do people do it?

231
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,580
It happens when
you get curious about someone

232
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,610
and just keep wanting to see them.

233
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,570
Huh?

234
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,060
Have you never met someone like that?

235
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,680
No matter how many times you see them,
you still miss them.

236
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,740
Even when you're with them, you still
miss them. That's what people say.

237
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,080
Some people say
it's like being struck by lightning.

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,840
Wait...

239
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,290
So...

240
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,970
The feeling I felt
when you were shouting at me just now...

241
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,530
Can't you even tell the difference
between your heart fluttering and fear?

242
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,180
You can at least avoid a lightning strike.

243
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,810
He's looking down on us
just because he's dated before.

244
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,560
Looks like it'll be difficult
on our own.

245
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,020
Gildal,
you're finally starting to realize—

246
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,520
Instead...

247
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,600
you can just teach him.

248
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,540
What?

249
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,470
You're the only one with experience
between us.

250
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,630
With dating.

251
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,530
I love kimchi soup
and kimchi stew the most.

252
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,420
As for snacks,
I like red bean porridge the most.

253
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,230
This is made with precious,
self-farmed red beans my grandpa sent.

254
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,430
You can't buy these at the supermarket.

255
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,500
The rice balls are super soft,
aren't they?

256
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,880
It's 'cause they're handmade.

257
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,160
I heard you're obsessed with red beans—
I mean—

258
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,880
I prepared some
because I heard you liked them.

259
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,500
What do you think?

260
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,150
Well, I'll make do with this.

261
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,930
That's great.

262
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,440
What are you doing?

263
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,460
I heard that
if I want to audition for a movie,

264
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,360
I need an agency.

265
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,810
Please help me.

266
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,170
Why should I?

267
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,650
Fine, then.

268
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,560
I'll throw it away.

269
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,050
W-Wait.

270
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,780
Hey. Why are you trying so hard
just to be an actor?

271
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,810
I just want to keep the promise I made
with my parents when I was young.

272
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,430
What?

273
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,710
I made a promise with them
before they passed away.

274
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,880
When I become an actor,

275
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,640
I'll make my debut in a movie
directed by their favorite director.

276
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,670
Don't you hate them?

277
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,020
What?

278
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,700
They left first

279
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,940
and left you all alone.

280
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,160
Well... I was still very young.

281
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,210
[A rear-end accident
caused two deaths in a family.]

282
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,880
Grandpa.

283
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,930
When are my parents coming?

284
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,020
Leaving such a young child all alone.

285
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,370
What am I going to do...

286
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,180
[A rear-end accident
caused two deaths in a family.]

287
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Keumbok...

288
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,690
And I never thought I was left behind.

289
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,410
After all, we had so many good memories.

290
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,410
If we only remember
the people we cherish with sadness,

291
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,470
it would be so difficult.

292
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,410
Besides, I still have Grandpa by my side.

293
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Ha Keumdong.

294
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,610
What can I do for you?

295
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,310
Is it good?

296
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,040
Yes.

297
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,650
That kind of feeling
where you're curious and you miss them.

298
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,110
[Dr. Jigwi:
What are you doing?]

299
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,820
What are you doing?

300
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,410
[Dr. Jigwi:
I miss you.]

301
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
I miss you.

302
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,820
In other words,
Jigwi wants to date Keumbok.

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,580
But to Bihyung, Jigwi is...

304
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,000
-Bihyung, is your stomach feeling better?
-Where is Keumpoop?

305
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,320
He said he went to work.

306
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,380
-I was invited on a date recently—
-What?

307
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,040
When? Where? With whom?

308
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,900
Answer me with the 5Ws and 1H.

309
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,590
If this continues,
and they fight like they did before...

310
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,680
I have to stop this!

311
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,600
You're really annoying.

312
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,640
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

313
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,100
What do you think?

314
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,030
You're so annoying.

315
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,170
Don't you have any other characters?

316
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,310
This won't work.

317
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,370
I don't...

318
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,610
Why does this character want to marry her
when he finds her so annoying?

319
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,780
That's because
he can't recognize his feelings.

320
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,780
What do you mean?

321
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,480
If he doesn't even know
what he's feeling,

322
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,520
why would he confess his love?

323
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,610
Are you stupid?

324
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,340
Darn it.

325
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,920
You're worried about how you feel,
but you can't ask them.

326
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,200
Yet, you want to keep them by your side.

327
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,180
But then you're in a dilemma.

328
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,000
Then you'd raise your voice
'cause you're scared.

329
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,030
Scared? This man is way scarier.

330
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,160
He's a gangster boss!

331
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,760
That identity means nothing.

332
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,970
This man

333
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,000
would rather be stabbed
than be rejected.

334
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,070
What does that mean?

335
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,440
It's the same in the real world, too.

336
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,120
It's not like he's a coward.

337
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
He is a coward.

338
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,170
A very timid

339
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,590
scaredy-cat.

340
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,250
Then he's just an idiot.

341
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,150
He is an idiot, that's right.

342
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,480
Intimidated by his own emotions.

343
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm so sad.

344
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,530
No, or do I feel a little suffocated?

345
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,760
Can you read this man's lines for me?

346
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,750
Why?

347
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,120
I think I need to hear you say it
to understand.

348
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,260
Ha Keumpoop, you're really getting
the most out of your red bean porridge.

349
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,140
You're really annoying.

350
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,670
Why do you keep making me
conscious of you?

351
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,870
I can't tell if this is a confession
or a threat.

352
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,450
Who are you calling a kid?

353
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,500
Are you going to keep making me
conscious of you?

354
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,270
I found it!

355
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,080
[Ha Keumbok]
