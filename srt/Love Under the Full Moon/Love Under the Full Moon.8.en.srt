00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,420
I hate your optimism virus.

172
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,910
I knew you wouldn't give up.

173
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,190
Look.

174
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,360
These are all orders from
our past clients.

175
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,360
After they've tasted Summer's Kiss,

176
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,350
they recommended it

177
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,750
and said that it tastes
the same as the past.

178
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,870
But some clients

179
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,580
might be too far away from the shop

180
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,830
and couldn't come.

181
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,310
So I was thinking,

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,720
should we take the chance of

183
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,270
delivering to their door step

184
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,830
and visit each one?

185
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,140
We might be able to find
who we're looking for.

What do you think?

187
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
An old taste is key

188
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,400
to rekindling old memories.

are you planning to ride this
for delivery?

Yes.

193
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Why don't you hail a ride?

194
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,590
It's so expensive.

195
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,590
Why don't you ride the scooter there?

196
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,310
That works too.

197
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,830
It'll be quicker that way.

00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,030
What would you like to order?

665
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,550
One Hong Kong Milk Tea.

666
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,230
Hong Kong Milk Tea.

667
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,190
I got a level 100 equipment
with my receipt.

668
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,100
Hey,

669
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,870
you're a player
of Battle of the Saints too?

670
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,640
Yes.

671
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm here for my game ID,

672
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,220
but fell in love with this

673
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,590
Summer's Kiss cake.

674
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,450
What's your game ID?

675
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,500
Add me as a friend.
Let's play together.

676
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,110
Come.

677
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,350
The Battle of the Saints' company is
probably an investor of Summer Time.

678
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,670
Do you think that

679
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,390
the owner is Winter?

680
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,670
It's possible.

681
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,950
You're on this game too?

682
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,550
Do you want to add me as a friend?

683
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,430
Sure.

684
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,510
Probably not the owner.

685
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,540
It's the man who's supporting the owner.

Let's head back.

694
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,390
Dear passenger,

695
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,890
you haven't paid your previous fare.

696
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,380
Do you want to pay for everything now?

697
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,830
Sure.

698
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,390
How do you want me to pay?

699
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,690
WeChat, AliPay or mobile transfer,

700
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,140
which would you like?

701
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,270
I choose a kiss here

702
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,110
and the payment will be settled.

703
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,380
Here?

704
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,710
-Jin Xiao Rui!
-That hurts!

705
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,110
Being my driver

706
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,870
is an honour, alright?

707
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,270
You're the one who should be paying.

708
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,270
Okay, I'll pay.

709
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,570
My fare.

710
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,830
Paid.

711
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,400
Jin Xiao Rui!

712
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,159
What?

713
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,310
You took advantage of me.

714
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,150
I can pay forward!

715
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,110
I can pay forward!

716
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,350
Pay forward, you wish!

717
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,270
I want to pay forward.

718
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,290
What are you doing?

719
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,199
Bye!

720
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,389
Wait for me!

721
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,110
I'm not in the car yet.

722
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,110
Cheers!

723
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,989
Celebrating another day of sold out cakes!

724
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm thankful.

725
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,350
Yuan Yuan and I made some deliveries,

726
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,340
Xiao Dong contributed the most useful

727
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,350
ordering app.

728
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,790
Winter

729
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,340
did an event shout out in the game.

730
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,469
Chu Xia,

731
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,780
who are you thankful for?

732
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,409
For everyone!

733
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,060
Of course, I'm most thankful for Winter.

734
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,750
I would never have thought

735
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,350
that I could become an NPC in a game.

736
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
So I'm now

737
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,180
living as Winter's fan.

738
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,860
If I die, I'd be Winter's...

739
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,670
die hard fan.

740
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,840
Winter takes good care
of his fans with his skills.

741
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,850
If someone becomes his girlfriend,

742
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,610
she's going to be the most pampered woman!

743
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,280
The most pampered...

744
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,000
Aren't people in reality
more helpful than virtual ones?

745
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,800
There's beauty from a distance.

746
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,230
Winter is perfect in my eyes.

747
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,700
Why don't we

748
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
make a plushie of him in the shop?

749
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,880
That could work.

750
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,900
Make a life-size one.

751
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,890
And when you hug the plushie,

752
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,570
it would feel like you're hugging Winter.

753
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,930
Hugging Winter.

754
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,270
I've convinced a shop

755
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,870
to make those plushies.

756
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,950
We can custom order one

757
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,480
of Winter in...

758
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,560
What do they call it? A cartoon version.

759
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,020
Look, they have a lot of them.

760
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,340
-This one...
-That's common.

761
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:43,750
[Cartoon Version]

762
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,510
[Cartoon Version]
Make the cartoon version.

763
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,290
Make it a cartoon.

764
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,610
[How does it feel to lose to yourself?]

765
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,200
[How does it feel to lose to yourself?]
[Round four, Xu Xiao Dong failed.]

766
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,430
[Xu Xiao Dong]
[Round four, Xu Xiao Dong failed.]

767
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,830
Really, they have everything.

768
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,470
[Leave]
Get lost.

769
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,080
Look,

770
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,990
festive ones.

771
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,990
Yes!

772
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,910
We'd be so happy
if you look at it every day.

773
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,230
Okay, enough.

774
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,310
Stop dreaming, wake up.

775
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,590
Winter is not going to favour you.

776
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,790
Time to go home.

777
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,460
Let's go home.

778
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,550
Back to our own homes to see our own mums.

779
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,380
Let's go, stay safe.

780
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,150
I'll see you in the shop tomorrow.

781
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,220
Our car is that way.

782
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,340
-Let's go.
-Bye!

783
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,070
I'll send you back.

784
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,720
You don't mind if I'm charging a fare?

785
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,830
No.

786
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,630
Are you full?

787
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Yes.

788
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,380
Why is he here?

789
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,930
Why are you here?

790
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,420
I saw that Summer's Kiss is selling well,

791
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,470
so I came to celebrate.

792
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,380
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

793
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,180
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

794
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,420
It is selling well.

795
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,940
They said that

796
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,780
you were dining here

797
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,710
so I came to see you.

798
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,870
Yes, we were just done.

799
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,110
You're here at the right time.

800
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,380
Let me send you back.

801
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,590
No, it's fine.

802
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,790
Mr. Wei, you might not know that

803
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,000
Chu Xia and I are staying together.

804
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,150
What do you mean?

805
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,310
Exactly what it means.

806
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,510
Staying together.

807
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,350
No, it's not what you think.

808
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,630
Even though we're staying together,

809
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,470
but...

810
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,470
It's what she said.

811
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,430
You don't have to explain to him.

812
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,030
Let's go.

813
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,660
Hold on.

814
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,360
Why are you staying together?

815
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,150
You don't have a place to stay?

816
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,140
Isn't that inconvenient?

817
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,090
Here.

818
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,460
Take this.

819
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,150
These are the keys to our marriage house.

820
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,950
I've been carrying it with me
all this while.

821
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,380
I have people clean it.

822
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,480
You can move in right away.

823
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,560
Take it.

824
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,150
Don't worry.

825
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,270
Before you agree to come back to me,

826
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,740
I'm not going to look for you.

827
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,260
I'm off.

828
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,990
Hey...

829
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,560
What are you thinking about?

830
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,200
What are you thinking about?

831
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,830
Lei Chu Xia,

832
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,690
why are you zoned out?

833
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,330
I was thinking that

834
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,160
we got a house for our wedding
ten years ago.

835
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,150
So?

836
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
He said something that's quite true.

837
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,780
It's not right for me
to stay at your place.

838
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,700
So you want to move in?

839
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,980
I don't.

840
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,110
Who says I want to move in?

841
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,390
Isn't that what you meant?

842
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,200
I was just questioning

843
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,750
if we really got that far.

844
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,220
That was the past,
and this is the present.

845
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,100
Lei Chu Xia,

846
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,700
I told you that he doesn't seem like
a good person.

847
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,430
He doesn't look like your fiance either.

848
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,640
And if you do move in,

849
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,550
you're walking into the lion's den.

850
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,190
If something happens,

851
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,860
I'm not going to take you back
even if you come back.

852
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,680
What do you mean by that?

853
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,130
Exactly what the words mean.

854
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,830
If you move in and got bullied,

855
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,710
got hurt,

856
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,550
don't come back to me.

857
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,080
I won't have the right to take you in.

858
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,470
I don't need you to take me in.

859
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,370
You said it.

860
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,550
I said it.

861
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,270
Stop the car.

862
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,790
Stop the car? Where are you going?

863
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,620
Never you mind. Stop the car.

864
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,240
It's not easy to get a ride here.

865
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,280
I just said a few words.

866
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,330
Where's the temper from?

867
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,470
Yuan Yuan,

868
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,110
what are you doing?

869
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,110
[Chu Xia, what's wrong?]

870
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,510
[Do you need help?]

871
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,950
Yes.

872
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,590
[Yuan Yuan,]

873
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,590
[the movie is starting.]

874
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,430
[Hurry up!]

875
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,270
[Okay.]

876
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,910
[What's wrong, Chu Xia?]

877
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,430
Nothing, it's fine.

878
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,540
I just want to call and chat.

879
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Go watch the movie. We'll talk tomorrow.

880
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,170
[I can't go to Yuan Yuan's place,]

881
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,780
[but I don't feel like going back
to Xiao Dong's.]

882
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,670
[Where else can I go?]

883
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,670
Sir,

884
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,440
let's go to 88, Ren Min Street,
Summer Time.

885
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,480
Turing.

886
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,030
Find Chu Xia's current location.

887
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,800
Locating Chu Xia.

888
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,430
Signal from sub-system.

889
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,230
In Summer Time.

890
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,470
Xiao Dong, do you want
to continue playing?

891
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,910
Yes.

892
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,070
You hit me.

893
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,020
[Summer Time]

894
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,530
Who... Who's there?
