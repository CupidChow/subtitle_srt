Lying is the worst thing he could do.

53

What would you do if someone lies to you?

54
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,920

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,440
That should only be Wei Xuan He.

174
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,320
What sort of

175
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
close contact was he?

176
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,280
Who is Wei Xuan He?

177
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,600
It is said that he was my boyfriend
before I lost my memory.

178
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,120
We were going to get married.

179
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
I think that will help.

180
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,110
Maybe he knows a lot of things

181
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,710
that could stimulate you.

182
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,910

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,880
He's just an ex, you know?

184
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,640
What good memories can exes have?

185
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,510
All exes leave behind
are painful memories, okay?

186
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,710
I kind of want to...

187
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
No, you don't.

188

You really have nothing to worry about.

190
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,200
He's not a good person.

191
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,440
But he was a part of my life,
after all.

192
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,810
In order to really live my life

193
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,880
in this world,

194
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,200
and in order to live with my parents,

195
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,740
I think I need to give it a try.

196

Okay.

I'll go with you,

200
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,460
but I'll wait at the door.

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Alright.

202
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,300
What brings you by today?

203
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,740
Do you need anything?

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
I would like to ask for a favour.

205
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,030
My psychiatrist said she hoped

206
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,280
I could interact more with

207
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,670
the people I was close to in the past.

208
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,920
This way, it'll help me
to recall more things.

209
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,230
You went to a psychiatrist?

210
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,530
What did they say?

211
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,740
Did you remember anything?

212
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,430
Just a few bits and pieces.

213
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,760
But I don't know exactly
what they mean.

214
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000

Trivial matters are fine too.

Sure.

220

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,480
Xiao Dong,

681
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,850
who is this?

682
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,739
This is my friend.

683
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,080
She likes cosplay.

684
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,400
Her event just ended today,

685
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,440
so she just came with me

686
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,510
to pick you guys up.

687
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,469
She keeps looking back,

688
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,760
probably because she thinks you two

689
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,750
seem familiar.

690
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,400
So she couldn't help but keep turning around

691
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,280
to look at you guys.

692
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,750
She's usually quiet

693
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,120
and just a normal girl.

694
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,230
Just that today,

695
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,560
she's immersing herself in her role.

696
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,310
Xiao Dong,

697
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
is this your girlfriend?

698
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,550
Her costume

699
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,440
is really adorable.

700
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,880
Uncle, you misunderstood.

701
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,159
We are still

702
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,680
not a couple yet.

703
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,960
We're just friends.

704
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,440
-Just friends. -Not yet.

705
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,090
By the way, auntie,

706
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,670
how was your stay at the care facility?

707
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,160
When I was in the care facility,

708
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
everyone took good care of us.

709
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,400
You see, I'm

710
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,920
in much better shape than before.

711
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,190
It's all thanks to you.

712
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,840
It's nothing.

713
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,880
Sit down.

714
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,680
I had wanted to

715
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,140
make a big meal

716
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,510
to thank you.

717
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,470
But I didn't have much time,

718
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,470
so I only made

719
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,640
some simple home dishes.

720
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,950
When you come again next time,

721
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,280
I'll make you

722
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,870
some nice dishes.

723
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,340
Okay, that's a deal then.

724
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,160
Do you still have to wear

725
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,220
the cosplay costume

726
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,310
and keep playing the role

727
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,560
even when you're eating?

728
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,680
It's fine, auntie. I'll feed her.

729
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,600
Here.

730
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
You want grilled sausage.

731
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
When Chu Xia was little,

732
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,510
she liked to eat grilled sausage too.

733
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,400
-Really? -That's why

734
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,830
we always make grilled sausages.

735
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,750
Xiao Dong is such a nice boy.

736
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,750
You treat your girlfriend

737
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,950
much better than how your uncle

738
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,150
treated me back then.

739
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,970
Auntie, we're good friends.

740
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,130
Honey,

741
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,400
have I been treating you badly?

742
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,870
I've been a doting husband and doting father

743
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,120
for decades.

744
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,320
That's kind of true.

745
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,640
Eat up.

746
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,520
What else do you want?

747
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,960
Dumpling.

748
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,080
Chu Xia likes to eat dumplings too.

749
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,350
She always finished a large plate every time.

750
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,620
No one could stop her.

751
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,720
I didn't expect that

752
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,400
your friend likes my dumplings too.

753
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,500
You guys have no idea.

754
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,730
When Chu Xia was little,

755
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,190
she also liked sweets.

756
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Really?

757
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,140
I remember when she was little,

758
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,720
when we took her travelling,

759
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,340
every place she visited,

760
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,360
she wanted to try the local desserts.

761
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,630
My daughter

762
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,990
is really talented.

763
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,310
No matter what dessert it is,

764
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,730
as long as she took a bite,

765
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,020
she would know how to make it.

766
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,630
When we got home,

767
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,290
she always made it for us.

768
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,800
I don't know when I will be able to

769
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,960
eat the desserts made by Chu Xia again.

770
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,790
Sorry for this.

771
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,560
Chu Xia is our daughter.

772
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,300
She went missing.

773
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,390
Last time, Chu Xia's mum

774
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,280
thought she saw our daughter.

775
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,630
She got so worked up,

776
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,120
her heart couldn't take it.

777
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,130
Fortunately, we met Xiao Dong.

778
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,110
He took us to the hospital in time.

779
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,950
And she got out of danger.

780
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,900
We've been looking for our daughter
for ten years.

781
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,390
People say

782
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,790
she's probably dead and we would never find her.

783
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,410
But I always think that

784
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,450
Chu Xia is just having too much fun that

785
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,090
she forgot to come home.

786
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
We purposely hid a key

787
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,640
at the door.

788
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,420
In case Chu Xia

789
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,010
comes back one day,

790
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,750
and can't enter the house because

791
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,710
she doesn't have a key.

792
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
I bet she would just cry at the door.

793
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,320
How we wish we could

794
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,200
go back to the old days.

795
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,040
When we both came home

796
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,480
from grocery shopping,

797
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,500
Chu Xia would

798
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,890
come running out from her room and say,

799
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,800
"I'm home."

800
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,880
Sorry.

801
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,760
I got carried away.

802
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,590
It's okay.

803
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,560
Uncle, auntie, don't mind this.

804
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,710
My friend is using her own way

805
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,330
to console you.

806
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,440
We know.

807
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,680
Xiao Dong.

808
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,990
I really like

809
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,320
your friend.

810
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,900
I don't know the reason,

811
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,160
but I feel like

812
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,140
I know her.

813
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,020
Child,

814
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,010
take off your head piece.

815
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
Let's get to know each other properly.

816
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,350
Auntie, you can get to know her
even with the mask on.

817
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,910
Your food tastes so good,

818
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,800
she will come often to see you.

819
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,560
Xiao Dong,

820
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,240
she's been wearing this for so long.

821
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,420
She could suffocate.

822
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,240
Take it off first.

823
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,200
No, uncle.

824
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,100
Don't take it off.

825
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,040
She's role-playing today.

826
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,170
If we take it off,

827
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,440
it would violate her sense of belief.

828
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,840
We'll leave it then.

829
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,680
Leave it.

830
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,000
Let's eat.

831
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,140
-Come on, sit down and eat more.
-Sit down.

832
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,000
Sit down and eat.

833
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,190
Have some more.

834
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,160
What else do you want?

835
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,120
Dumpling.

836
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,780
-Here. -When my daughter comes back,

837
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,040
maybe you two can be good friends.

838
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,030
It will happen, auntie.

839
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,430
You see, Chu Xia looked so cute

840
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,200
when she was little.

841
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,870
Yes.

842
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,030
She and her mum always bullied me

843
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,130
when she was young.

844
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,040
-I'll go. -Someone's here.

845
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,960
Hi, uncle.

846
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,920
Wei Xuan He.

847
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
What are you doing here?

848
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
I went to pick you up,

849
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,360
but I didn't see you.

850
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,240
So I came.

851
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,520
Auntie.

852
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,120
Xu Xiao Dong.

853
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,840
I didn't know you knew
Mr. and Mrs. Lei.

854
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,320
And who is this?

855
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,190
It's none of your business.

856
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,800
Wei Xuan He,

857
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,710
even if you didn't come,

858
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,160
uncle and I were going to see you too.

859
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
You said on the phone earlier that

860
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,510
you are going to marry Chu Xia.

861
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,400
What was that?

862
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,240
You were the one who wanted
to hold a memorial service.

863
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,110
And now you said you wanted to marry her.

864
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,990
Chu Xia is still missing.

865
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,480
Who are you marrying?

866
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,340
Her.

867
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,470
You're Chu Xia?

868
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

869
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,520
Are you Chu Xia?

870
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,320
Chu Xia, you're back.

871
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,920
Why are you hiding yourself
from uncle and auntie?

872
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,470
Stop making them worried, okay?

873
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,120
Chu Xia.

874
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,400
-Chu Xia. -Chu Xia.

875
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,120
Auntie.

876
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
-Chu Xia! -Auntie.

877
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,640
Chu Xia!

878
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,520
Chu Xia!

879
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,240
Chu Xia!

880
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,080
Chu Xia!

881
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,760
Slow down, Chu Xia!

882
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,720
Wait for me!

883
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,880
Chu Xia, slow down!

884
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,160
Chu Xia, stop running!

885
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,120
Chu Xia!

886
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,640
Chu Xia!

887
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,560
Chu Xia!

888
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,440
Chu Xia!

889
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Chu Xia!

890
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,400
-Chu Xia! -Chu Xia, stop...

891
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,600
Chu Xia, stop running.

892
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,680
Chu Xia.

893
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,960
Chu Xia, my child.

894
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,000
Chu Xia.

895
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,880
I'm not!

896
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,840
Chu Xia, how could we possibly be mistaken?

897
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,130
Wei Xuan He,

898
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,840
Chu Xia has turned you down.

899
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,340
What tricks are you trying to pull here?

900
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,730
Listen.

901
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
In this world,

902
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,510
other than Chu Xia's parents,

903
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,470
I'm the closest person to her.

904
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,290
Also,

905
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,050
you've brought her back,

906
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,630
why didn't you let her show her face?

907
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,660
What secret are you hiding?

908
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,260
It's none of your business.

909
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm warning you.

910
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,920
Stay away from Chu Xia,

911
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,900
or I won't let you off.
