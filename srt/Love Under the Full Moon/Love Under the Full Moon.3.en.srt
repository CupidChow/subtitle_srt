My contact number is stated there.

346
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,730
I have a question.

347
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,990
May I know your name?

348
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,660
Chen Mo.

349
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,350
That's my name.

350
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm a Professor of Astrophysics.

351
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:22,940
Hello.

352
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,830
Nice to meet you.

I have repeated it three times.

Now, I can't leave...

365

I mean, she can't leave me.

Jin Xiao Rui, I didn't
know that you are this silly.

368
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,980
Let me explain for one last time.

369
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,890
For one last time.

Here.

372
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,310
Do me a favour.

-She's my classmate.
-Cousin.

376
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,300
She's my cousin.

377
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,270
She's his classmate.

378
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,780
Who is she?

379
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,090
Whose classmate? Whose cousin?

380
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,950
Please go on.

381
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,990
I got it.

382
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,160
Don't go yet, pretty girl.

383
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,460
She is really not bad.

384
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,750
Will you please turn around
and let me have a look?

385
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,170
That's great!

386
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,790
She is so pretty.

387
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,160
Xiao Dong, is she your girlfriend?

388
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,920
So, the relationship is not official yet.

389
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,840
Please be Xiao Dong's girlfriend, okay?

390
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,460
Let me tell you.

391
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,170
Xiao Dong may appear as cold as a fridge,

392
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,850
but he is actually an air-conditioner.

393
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,230
He can adjust his temperature accordingly.

394
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,310
Aunt Wei Wei, do you still
want your birthday present?

395
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,990
What? Are you threatening me?

396
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,060
Fine.

397
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,300
For the sake of the handbag,

398
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,540
I'll pretend that I'm threatened.

399
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,460
Aunt Wei Wei, what are you doing here?

400
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,640
Before you came in,

401
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,020
weren't you supposed to knock on the door?

402
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,790
I have the key.

403
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,230
Let's get down to business.

404
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,780
Pass this

405
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,640
to Professor Chen Mo
of Tongcheng University.

406
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,840
Find out if he has a girlfriend.

407
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,550
Who?

408
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,330
Professor Chen Mo of Tongcheng University.

409
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,230
That's his name.

410
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,300
That man gave me a shock

411
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,850
when he pointed out the
problem in my speech.

412
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,540
Madam Shen, may I ask

413
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,610
which of the following stands
a higher chance,

414
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,220
getting accepted into Tongcheng University

415
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,990
or winning a ten-million-yuan lottery?

416
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,780
It has something to do
with the Probability theory.

417
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,680
I think you know it better than I do.

418
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,780
Of course,

419
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,410
I can answer the question

420
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,230
from the perspective
of an insurance agent.

421
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,880
Let's take Union Lotto as an example.

422
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,750
There are around a hundred million
lottery ticket buyers.

423
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,920
The prize pool is worth around
seven hundred million yuan.

424
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,890
The probability of winning the grand prize

425
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,510
would be 1 in 17,720,000.

426
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,410
The annual intake of Tongcheng University
is 3000 students.

427
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,780
Every year, ten million students
take part in the entrance examination.

428
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,850
In other words,

429
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,680
the probability of getting into
Tongcheng University is 3 in 10,000.

430
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,410
In that case,

431
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,170
the probability of getting
into Tongcheng University

432
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,990
is higher.

433
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,400
What do you think, Professor Chen?

434
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,680
Impressive.

435
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,060
Looks like you've been paying attention

436
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,370
in your nine years
of compulsory education,

437
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,600
especially in mathematics class.

438
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,750
I'm thinking of your future and health.

439
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,680
Of course I have to be meticulous.

440
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,440
Did it occur to you

441
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,270
that the accidents
you mentioned just now

442
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,080
have the same probability

443
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,570
as winning the lottery?

444
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,980
It's next to nothing and
almost close to zero.

445
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,370
I am just a normal living creature.

446
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,550
I don't think I will win the lottery.

447
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,030
These people

448
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,600
are just normal living creatures.

449
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,650
I also think that

450
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,930
accidents won't happen to them.

451
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,540
Furthermore, the percentages
that you mentioned just now,

452
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,850
for example, 70 percent, 60 percent

453
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,980
and 73 percent,

454
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,570
where did you get the statistics?

455
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,060
Which organisation
came out with the statistics?

456
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,130
Is it a domestic organisation
or a foreign organisation?

457
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,300
Is it operated by the government
or a private organisation?

458
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,500
Is it certified?

459
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,510
Please show us the proof.

460
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,090
No?

461
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,030
Okay.

462
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,710
Is it safe to say that

463
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,260
these exaggerated figures

464
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,460
are merely your imagination?

465
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,410
Do you have any questions?

466
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,640
You may rebut my claim.

467
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,790
Okay.

468
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,500
Madam Shen, here's a
word of advice.

469
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,360
You excel in mathematics.

470
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,020
If you read a few more books,

471
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,570
I'm sure you will get into
Tongcheng University.

472
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,500
And the probability

473
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,980
will be so much higher compared
to the probability

474
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,310
of you having an accident.

475
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,220
Do you have any questions?

476
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,270
You may rebut my claim.

477
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,120
Okay.

478
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,840
Everyone, as mentioned earlier,

479
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,030
I think that

480
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,880
there is no need to subscribe
to the insurance policy.

481
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,990
Goodbye.

482
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,170
You can buy lottery tickets every day

483
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,260
and as many times as you want.

484
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,780
However, the chance to get into
Tongcheng University

485
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,610
only comes around once a year.

486
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,370
Hence,

487
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,330
the probability of an accident

488
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,540
is not as little as you imagine.

489
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,820
Even if the probability increases,

490
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,220
I am still of the view that

491
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,610
I can handle most of
the accidents on my own.

492
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,920
Why should I subscribe to insurance?

493
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,990
What a waste.

494
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,750
Watch out!

495
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,680
You're such a gentleman.

496
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,090
You're really something, Aunt Wei Wei.

497
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,920
How long will it take to conquer him?

498
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,260
It depends on

499
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,790
Xiao Dong's preliminary research results.

500
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,220
You should take the chance
to indirectly reveal to him that

501
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,570
I'm smart, articulate,

502
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,170
mature, wise

503
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,360
and a wife material.

504
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,080
Madam Shen Wei Wei.

505
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,550
I won't help you pursue a man.

506
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,740
He is not just any ordinary man.

507
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,570
He may become your uncle-in-law.

508
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,470

This is the accident.

538

It's not scientific.

539

I'm sorry.

544

You said that

545
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,270
she appeared on the night
of the Super Moon?

546
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,550
Yes.

547
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,840
The night of the Super Moon.

548
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,090
A gravitational wave did hit Earth
a few days back

549
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,680
on the night of the Super Moon.

550
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,710
At that point in time, your
smartphone had been modified.

551
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,740
It might have turned into

552
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,170
a transfer station for the magnetic field.

553
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,790
In other words, it became an anchor point.

554
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,740
At that juncture, she accidentally

555
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,930
appeared beside you.

556
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,550
Her presence has something
to do with the gravitational wave.

557
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,920
Gravitational wave?

558
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,790
That's unbelievable.

559
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,950
It's just an accident.

560

That's unbelievable.

564

A gravitational wave

565
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,310
transported a person here from space.

566
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,890
I must have done

567
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,270
a horrendous crime in the past.

568
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,120
That's why I have to go through
all this in this life.

569
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,880
I even got you into trouble
because of your phone.

570
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,090
You asked me

571
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,820
why I'm still using an outdated phone.

572
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,980
That's because

573
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,990
it's the last present from my dad.

574
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,650
I didn't know that.

575
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,880
It's okay.

576
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,270
It's long past.

577

My dad is a programming genius.

578
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,410
He devoted himself to work.

579
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,890
However, to our surprise,

580
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,610
in the end,

581
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,080
he passed away all of
a sudden during work.

582
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,310
Back then, I was rebellious.

583
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,400
It was the time where I had the
most ferocious quarrels with him.

584
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Why did everything

585
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,040
happen to me out of the blue?

586
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,300
Since then, I have lived
with that question

587
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,840
until now.

588
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,220
Now,

589
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,680
no matter how much I change the
phone's internals,

590
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,330
I won't change its appearance.

591
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,400
That's because

592
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,950
this is the last connection I have
with my dad.

593
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,440
Now, I believe that

594
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,160
everything in life

595
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,400
