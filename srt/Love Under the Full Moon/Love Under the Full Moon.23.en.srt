This

174
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,440
is your parents' wedding ring.

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,450
I've always carried it around like an amulet.

176
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,650
I'm giving it to you now.

177
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,250
I think now is the perfect time.

178
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Thank you, Aunt Wei Wei.

Mr. Wei!

191
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,630
Mr. Wei, Cyber Tech's marketing department
just announced

that you're not listing your company anymore.

Please leave now.

Are you okay?

206
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,120
Get up.

207
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,910
I'm fine.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
I'm fine.

209
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,550
Stop chasing, Qin Yue.

210
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,200
I have some good news for you.

211
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,120
Up until now, I have received 11 calls,

212
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,140
all asking about your contract termination.

213
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,390
Five companies even sent
their contracts directly.

214
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,910
You can sign right away as long as you want.

215
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,090
I must say, the benefits are lucrative.

216
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,390
When did I say that I'm terminating
my contract with Cyber Tech?

217
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,420
Did you announce it without my permission?

218
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,230
No.

219
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,590
I just posted an emoji online.

220
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,910
Then, they started calling.

221
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,960
Now, everyone knows that Cyber Tech is a goner.

222
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,510
Delete your social media now.

223
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,150
Come on, Qin Yue.

224
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,200
Are you really going to keep supporting
Wei Xuan He and Cyber Tech?

225
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,240
Come on.

226
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,990
Who's the fool here, you or me?

227
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,560
You still can't let go of Wei Xuan He?

228
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,820
Let's go.

229
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,010
Doctor.

230
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,060
How is my dad?

231
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,780
Fortunately, he was sent here in time.

232
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,060
Your father is no longer in critical condition.

233
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,700
But, I heard from this lady

234
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,510
that the patient has been using Family First.

235
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,670
We've been receiving several similar cases.

236
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,510
I hope you can stop using this system.

237
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,080
Okay, doctor.

238
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,400
Dad.

239
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,360
Xuan He.

240
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
How are you feeling?

241
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,720
You're here.

242
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,390
After you left that day,

243
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,730
I kept thinking.

244
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,550
Ever since you were young,

245
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,670
I have been too strict on you.

246
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,880
As a father, I have...

247
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,550
truly failed.

248
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,670
This time too.

249
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,850
I wanted to support you.

250
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,750
In the end,

251
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,600
I messed it up instead.

252
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,550
Actually, being a father

253
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,270
doesn't mean that you're right in everything.

254
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,420
It's just that

255
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,960
I have just realized it.

256
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,270
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,930
Son.

258
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,620
I want to tell you

259
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,590
that if you did something wrong,

260
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,380
just admit it.

261
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,190
Repent.

262
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,200
Your family will always

263
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,040
face it with you.

264
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,160
Okay.

265
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,850
Welcome!

266
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Have a look around.

267
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,380
Sir, what kind of shoes are you looking for?

268
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,790
Let me recommend something to you.

269
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,880
Okay.

270
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,040
Xuan He.

271
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,400
You're asking me out here again.

272
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,490
My contract of termination?

273
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,830
Take it.

274
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
What do you mean?

275
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,000
Once you take the contract,

276
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,610
you don't have to pay the breaching penalty.

277
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,870
I don't want it.

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,150
Who said that I'm terminating my contract?

279
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm Cyber Tech's chief anchor.

280
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,880
No one can take my place.

281
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,550
Qin Yue.

282
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,500
This is the place where we first met.

283
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,120
Back then, I promised you

284
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,250
that I will make you
the most famous female anchor.

285
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,640
But now, we cannot offer you a better platform.

286
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,640
So, take it.

287
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,550
After this,

288
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,730
you can move on to the places you want.

289
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,970
Xuan He.

290
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,840
Don't do this.

291
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,220
If it's because of Family First's problems,

292
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,020
I think we can solve it.

293
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,330
If you're smart,

294
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,660
just take it.

295
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,780
Family First is facing issues now.

296
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,750
But, we can face them together.

297
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,200
When we face them together, we can solve them.

298
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,960
Also, I believe that
your father will still support you.

299
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
You don't get what I mean?

300
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,030
We don't need you anymore.

301
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,030
You have no value to the company now.

302
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,960
I know you didn't mean what you said.

303
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,960
You're just worried that
I'd get dragged down by Cyber Tech.

304
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,570
But, I'm not afraid.

305
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,750
I'm not afraid.

306
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,960
You can't understand human language?

307
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,680
Let me make this more direct, then.

308
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,310
Qin Yue.

309
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,350
I have never liked you before.

310
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,060
It was just wishful thinking
on your part that you're with me.

311
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,600
I was just toying with you.

312
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,480
I've had enough now.

313
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,690
I'm sick of you.

314
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,840
Stop clinging onto me, okay?

315
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,650
You think you can drive me away just like that?

316
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,070
You underestimate my feelings for you.

317
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,750
I don't need your feelings.

318
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
From now on,

319
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,700
you're fired.

320
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,240
This is goodbye.

321
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,440
Wei Xuan He!

322
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,910
Listen.

323
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,580
You can't ditch me.

324
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,120
No matter what happens,

325
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,790
I will always be with you.

326
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,470
I'll cling onto you.

327
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,110
You can't ditch me.

328
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,420
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

329
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,990
Want to jeer at me?

330
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,890
Humiliate me?

331
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,390
Celebrate your own victory?

332
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm here to help you.

333
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,440
Hand me all your data.

334
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,880
I'll fix the bugs.

335
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,590
This can minimize
the harm inflicted on the users.

336
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,910
Take it as me helping you
atone for your mistakes.

337
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,080
Also, I don't want my father's smart legacy

338
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,490
to be blotched in any way.

339
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,280
Are you this kind?

340
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,050
Not everyone lives for their own benefit.

[Ten years ago,]

[the copyright dispute between
Mr. Xu Wei Yi and Piggy Tech]

414

[was caused by my greed.]

415
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,820
[Back then, I stole Mr. Xu's patent]

416
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,000
and sold it to one of the Piggy Tech's shareholders,
Zhao Yao Yang.

417
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,070
I used this as a bargain chip

418
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,120
to become an invisible shareholder
at Piggy Tech.

419
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,400
After Piggy Tech was listed in the stock market,

420
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,880
I gained a large sum of wealth.

422

What I want to say is,

423
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,110
[He must be punished heavily.]
Mr. Xu Wei Yi has never plagiarized.

[I truly admire his character and talent.]

425
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,880
[So, I'd like to apologize]

[to Mr. Xu Wei Yi and his family.]

505
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,720
Now, you are showing yourself
in a more selfless and kinder persona.

506
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,760
Thank you,

507
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,520
my friend, Winter.

508
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,960
Thank you too,

509
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,400
my beloved Xiao Dong.

510
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,880
Okay, we have no more secrets between us now.

511
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,100
When I was a kid,

512
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,500
whenever I missed my mother,

513
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,720
my dad would always tell me

514
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,100
that two people who love each other
will never part ways.

515
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,790
It's just that they're meeting
in a different way.

516
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,680
Whenever you miss someone,

517
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,470
that's because
the other person is missing you too.

518
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,200
So,

519
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,480
nothing can ever drive us apart.

520
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,510
You depart from summer,

521
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,730
and I'll look back from winter.

522
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,560
Let us meet again in autumn.

523
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,000
Chu Xia.

524
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,590
Marry me, will you?

525
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,800
Sure.

526
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,840
Don't worry.

527
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,710
I have an idea.

528
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,100
♫ Under the night sky ♫

529
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,340
♫ In silence ♫

530
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,300
♫ Desolation lies ♫

531
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,320
♫ After losing everything,
can it all come back again? ♫

532
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,150
Here.

533
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,740
♫ Under the full moon ♫

534
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,100
♫ Let us look at each other ♫

535
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,260
♫ As fallen eternity wanders ♫

536
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,060
♫ A new day has come ♫

537
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,840
No matter what happens,

538
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,800
nothing can drive us apart.

539
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,220
♫ Under the full moon ♫

540
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,580
♫ Let us look at each other ♫

541
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,700
♫ As fallen eternity wanders ♫

542
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,540
♫ A new day has come ♫

543
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,510
To think you're willing to meet me.

544
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,920
You revealed the truth from ten years ago

545
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,840
and admitted your mistakes.

546
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,320
You're turning over a new leaf.

547
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,390
Of course, you're also carrying
your own responsibilities.

548
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,090
I have no reason not to meet you.

549
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,170
When we were in university,

550
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,490
you'd always wait for me under this tree.

551
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,280
It witnessed many beautiful memories we had.

552
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,790
That was probably a wonderful past.

553
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,270
But, we can't always stay in the past.

554
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,120
You're right.

555
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,590
Actually,

556
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,900
I have never wanted to become an exemplary son.

557
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,630
My dream was to become a down-and-out rower.

558
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,240
When I was in high school,

559
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,530
I joined a rowing competition with my friends

560
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,020
and won second place.

561
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,490
I was so happy.

562
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,460
But, my dad tore my certificate
right in front of me.

563
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,870
He said that even with my hobby,

564
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,110
I have to be number one.

565
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,590
From that moment on,

566
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,000
I buried my dream deep inside my heart.

567
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,840
No matter what place you get,

568
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,880
I'd always cheer for you.

569
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,570
Thank you.

570
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,670
Can you hug me?

571
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,700
The world may be constantly changing,

572
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,750
but you have never.

573
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,440
Be it in the past or present,

574
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,380
you have always been that little sun,

575
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,320
lighting up everyone around you.

576
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,410
New resume.

577
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,760
Get a new job.

578
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,520
The whole company is dead.

579
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,570
Can it still run?

580
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,520
No choice.

581
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,870
Our founder-cum-CEO, Zhao Yao Yang,

582
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,190
has already admitted his crimes.

583
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,070
The board of directors is in a frenzy now.

584
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,400
An important message from Battle of the Saints.

585
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,230
Wei Xuan He said he's not Winter.

586
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,400
The real Winter fixed the bugs in Family First

587
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,070
and provided a free update.

588
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,460
How righteous.

589
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,310
That's why he's our idol.

590
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,840
Look, there's a video clip here.

591
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,760
[This is an important system notice
from Battle of the Saints.]

592
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,960
[Our maintenance team would like
to apologize for the recent disruptions.]

593
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,940
[Meanwhile, we are also
revealing Winter's true identity.]

594
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,830
[I'm Winter!]

595
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,840
[I'm Xu Xiao Dong.]

596
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,790
Go!

597
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,400
Xu Xiao Dong.

598
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,400
Is this a huge joke?

599
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,230
Wait for me.

600
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,030
[We're closed today to celebrate a happy occasion]
Cheers!

601
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,150
The truth is finally revealed.

602
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,670
Congratulations to Xiao Dong
for revealing Winter's identity.

603
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,210
I didn't expect that you could hide
your identity for such a long time.

604
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,060
Brilliant.

605
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,550
So, you knew about it?

606
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,330
You too?

607
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,810
Only I didn't know?

608
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,830
This is not how it looks.

609
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,840
How, then?

610
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,160
Winter!

611
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,520
-Sit down. -Chu Xia.

612
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,620
Sit down.

613
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,800
Winter.

614
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,070
What brings you here?

615
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,150
We didn't know that you're Winter.

616
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,350
They are...?

617
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,510
Let me see.

618
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,750
Xiao Dong looks even more handsome now.

619
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,670
Yeah.

620
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,610
I want an autograph and a photo!

621
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,620
Sign here!

622
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,550
No.

623
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,540
Winter is mine.

624
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,210
Cousin.

625
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,770
You can't say that.

626
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,430
Winter is great

627
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,590
because he belongs to everyone.

628
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,360
Yes, to everyone.

629
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,150
Look what this is.

630
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,000
Xu Xiao Dong.

631
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,310
Not bad.

632
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Not bad, brother.

633
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,600
So-so.

634
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,720
We've got no hopes now.

635
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,250
Mrs. Winter.

636
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,070
I want an autograph and a photo.

637
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,110
No.

638
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,320
This dress looks so beautiful.

639
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,000
It suits you.

640
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,780
Doesn't it?

641
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,670
It's so pretty.

642
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,670
It's so nice.

643
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,840
This dress fits you.

644
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,490
Chu Xia.

645
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,640
You're finally here.

646
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,610
Well?

647
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,440
Nice!

648
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,590
Nice, right?

649
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,030
It's lovely.

650
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,760
I have an idea.

651
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,100
Since you're here,

652
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,320
why don't you pick a dress and try?

653
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,170
I'm not the one getting married.

654
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:27,940
Why should I try?

655
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,580
Just try them on with me.

656
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,360
Didn't you say that you want to be
the prettiest bride in the world?

657
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,360
You're lying, right?

658
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,290
Come on.

659
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,200
Just one dress.

660
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,550
Take a look.

661
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,880
All the wedding dresses here are gorgeous.

662
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,480

Forget it, I don't want to.

675
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,660
Take this for me, please.

676
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,070
Just try it on, you're already here.

677
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,690
Look!

678
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,750
Look.

679
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,800
You'll look like a princess when you wear this.

680
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,870
Really, try it.

681
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,860
Take this in for me.

682
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,850
Okay.

683
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,190
You're already here.

684
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,060
Come on, slowpoke.

685
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,830
Let's see how slow you can go.

686
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,820
♫ On my bed, beside me ♫

687
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,620
♫ A glimmer of light ♫

688
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,260
♫ My love ♫

689
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,590
♫ After I met you I understood ♫

690
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,340
♫ That it takes time to fill ♫

691
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,500
♫ Don't let the story happen later ♫

692
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:13,100
♫ Don't make us miss out on each other ♫

693
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,060
♫ Until we part in regret ♫

694
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,780
♫ Don't let time slip away ♫

695
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,860
♫ The lovely dream I have now ♫

696
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:32,020
♫ Can't compare to the time
with you in my arms ♫
