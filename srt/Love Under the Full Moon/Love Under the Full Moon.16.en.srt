It's not on his property inventory,

[Most Expensive Foreclosed Property in 2011]

178
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,910
[Most Expensive Foreclosed Property in 2011]
that's why I didn't find out.

179
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,630
Fortunately, history always leaves a trail behind.

180
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,310
By the way,

181
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,440
don't tell Chu Xia.

182
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,070
Why?

183
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,470
I have a feeling that

184
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,440
I've been followed lately.

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
My house was broken into.

186
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,870
I've been watching Zhao Yao Yang

187
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,400
too closely,

188
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,510
someone must've found out.

189
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,360
I don't want to get Chu Xia involved.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,910
You can tell her directly.

191
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,480
Do you think after I tell her,

192
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,600
she won't get worried anymore?

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
After all, it's my father's business,

194
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,030
which makes it mine too.

195
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,270
I want to take care of it myself.

196
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,070
Okay.

197
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,270
This is the place they're coming to.

198
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,510
Jin Xiao Rui doesn't dare

199
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,790
to lie to me now.

200
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,470
Are you really not going

201
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,630
to tell Xu Xiao Dong?

202
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,790
He didn't want me to come,

203
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,310
it must be because he didn't want me

204
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,360
to put myself in danger.

205
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,710
But this is a matter

206
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,840
of my innocence.

207
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,510
I have to take care of it myself.

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,880
Come on, let's go and take a look.

209
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,480
Hour maids are not allowed in.

210
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,480
Have you ever seen any hour maids

211
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,670
dressed like this?

212
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,200
You're not hour maids.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,030
All the more reason you can't go in.

214
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,150
If something happens,

215
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,070
who will take responsibility?

216
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,390
Open your eyes and look at us.

217
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,390
Do we look like bad guys?

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,790
Why are they allowed

219
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,550
to drive in?

220
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,160
Look at

221
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
the brand of car they drive.

222
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,310
So what if they have a car?

223
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,390
So what if they are rich?

224
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,550
Just because he's rich,

225
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,430
does it mean he's not a scammer

226
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,390
or a bad guy?

227
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,240
I didn't mean to tell her.

228
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,670
Yuan Yuan grabbed my phone.

229
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,120
Just go.

230
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,750
You're unbelievable.

231
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Excuse me,

232
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,430
they are

233
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,480
our hour maids.

234
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,590
Okay, okay.

235
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm sorry, girls.

236
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
Please.

237
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
What are you waiting for, hour maids?

238
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,320
Ouch, ouch.

239
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,640
[No. 189, 5A]

240
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
No. 189, 5A.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,950
This is Zhao Yao Yang's

242
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,830
foreclosed villa.

243
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,440
I just walked around.

244
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,360
The environment around

245
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,480
is really nice.

246
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,000
Looks like Zhao Yao Yang

247
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
definitely makes a lot of money.

248
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,160
I've set up

249
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
a motion capture system.

250
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,320
Whenever there is movement in his house,

251
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,390
it will alert us.

252
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,600
That's brilliant, Xiao Dong.

253
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,590
We won't have to bother

254
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,550
with surveillance.

255
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,600
Are you upset?

256
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,670
No.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,910
I just suddenly

258
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,720
thought about my dad.

259
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,920
He used to

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
like to sit under an old tree too.

261
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,630
He told me that

262
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,360
when he shared all his happiness

263
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,390
with the tree,

264
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,550
he would gain strength;

265
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
when he shared all his unhappiness

266
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,480
with the tree,

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,750
all his worries would be gone.

268
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,790
This is who he is.

269
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,480
He likes to

270
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,200
keep everything to himself.

271
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,750
Every time I hear you talk about your dad,

272
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,960
I can feel that

273
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,880
he is a good father.

274
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
You know,

275
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,360
I have

276
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,080
a game console that I grew up playing with.

277
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,120
My dad

278
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,240
carved some words on it for me.

279
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,760
What are those words?

280
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,040
To Xiao Dong,

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,920
my son.

282
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
But at that time,

283
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,200
I was rebellious and immature.

284
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,870
I always caused him trouble.

285
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,000
So I made up my mind

286
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,080
to find out the truth

287
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,670
and clear his name.

288
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,550
I think

289
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,470
as long as you don't lose

290
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,840
the courage to face everything,

291
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,070
any difficulty

292
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,150
can be defeated.

293
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,070
Why does it

294
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,000
sound so familiar?

295
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,240
The

296
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
old fairy lady

297
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
said the same thing before.

298
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,190
She said something similar

299
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,550
to encourage me.

300
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,960
You mean the person you told me about last time?

301
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,200
Are you still in touch with her?

302
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,280
No.

303
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,720
Ten years have passed.

304
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,750
I've lost touch with her a long time ago.

305
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,000
Besides, I didn't see clearly

306
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,960
what she looked like.

307
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,550
I think even if we stand together now,

308
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,360
face to face,

309
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,630
we still won't recognize each other.

310
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,790
There are quite a lot of stars tonight.

311
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,000
I guess we'll have fine weather tomorrow.

312
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,480
Oh right, have you heard?

313
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,960
A comet named Neo

314
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,600
will pass by

315
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,520
Earth soon.

316
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,760
Experts say that

317
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,360
if we miss it this time,

318
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,590
it'll only come again

319
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,720
6,000 years from now.

320
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,510
That sounds romantic.

321
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,390
There must be something special on Earth

322
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,390
that it cares about,

323
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,550
that is why it has to come back

324
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,910
to Earth again after 6,000 years.

325
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,720
It's just a cosmic phenomenon.

326
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,480
There are also many comets

327
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,150
that pass through the solar system

328
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,550
once and never return.

329
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,000
Simply passing by and going into

330
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
the depths of the universe.

331
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,200
This is just

332
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,080
the trajectory of the comet.

333
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,670
You know nothing.

334
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,520
This is

335
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,270
the trajectory of love.

336
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,400
No way.

337
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,070
Could that be the comet

338
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,600
you were just talking about?

339
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,710
It could be.

340
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,590
Make a wish, make a wish.

341
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,040
I don't care.

342
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,920
Make a wish first, make a wish first.

343
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,830
Hurry.

344
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,710
Sorry.

345
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,000
Did I interrupt you?

346
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,670
Sorry for interrupting.

347
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,750
No, no.

348
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,790
You didn't interrupt anything.

349
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,400
You have a flashlight.

350
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,480
I need to use the bathroom.

351
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,750
You carry on.

352
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,190
Let's go.

353
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,670
Are you seriously using me as a third wheel?

354
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
What...

355
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
Oh, Xu Xiao Dong,

356
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,000
serve you right.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,550
Now you know how it feels to get interrupted.

358
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,320
You even lit a small lamp.

359
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,510
That's quite romantic.

360
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,520
It's to keep away mosquitoes.

361
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,640
Keep away mosquitoes?

362
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,590
Wait up.

363
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,070
Chu Xia,

364
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,630
there are a lot of mosquitoes inside, look.

365
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,760
Check if there's any mosquito spray

366
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,640
in the bag.

367
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,520
What should I do?

368
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,240
Mosquito spray.

369
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,200
Let me see if they have brought it.

370
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,080
What is this?

371
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
I didn't find any mosquito spray,

372
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,160
but I found two bottles of pepper spray.

373
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,790
Jin Xiao Rui!

374
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,480
Jin Xiao Rui.

375
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,520
What's wrong?

376
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,349
Why did you bring

377
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,480
pepper spray?

378
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,349
What's wrong with pepper spray?

379
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,349
Boys need to

380
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,640
protect themselves too.

381
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,790
Are you going to eat me?

382
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,800
Jin Xiao Rui, you're so gross.

383
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,110
How can you be so shameless?

384
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,910
What are you doing?

385
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
There are a lot of mosquitoes inside.

386
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,720
I'm sacrificing myself to feed the mosquitoes.

387
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,840
So that mosquitoes

388
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,750
won't bite Yuan Yuan.

389
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,720
Is there any scientific basis for this?

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
It'll work if you believe in it.

391
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,830
It'll work if I believe in it?

392
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,480
Is there any scientific basis for this?

393
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,720
It'll work if you believe in it.

394
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,550
Xiao Dong,

395
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
tell me,

396
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,550
does this count as we are offering blood?

397
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,030
What are you talking about?

398
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,070
We are offering love.

399
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,520
What's wrong with your hand?

400
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,520
Nothing.

401
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
How are you feeling?

402
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,640
Did you sleep well last night?

403
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,550
It was alright.

404
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,030
Zhao Yao Yang showed up.

405
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,270
Let's go.

406
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,150
Mr. Zhao.

407
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,430
Are you

408
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,510
the assistant of Mr. Wei?

409
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,590
What are you doing here?

410
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Mr. Wei would like to

411
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,350
talk to you alone.

412
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,030
Please come with me.

413
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,110
I've said everything I needed to.

414
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,190
You guys should go.

415
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,640
I'm sorry for this then.

416
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,110
What's going on?

417
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,350
Seize him!

418
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,800
Let's go.

419
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,470
Come on.

420
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,350
Stop!

421
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,590
Stop!

422
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,200
Stop!

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Let's go.

424
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,280
Let's go.

425
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,030
Stop!

426
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,070
-Stop!
-Stop there!

427
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,040
Stop!

428
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
I didn't expect

429
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,000
you'd be the one who saved me.

430
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,360
Thank you.

431
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,310
Save your thanks.

432
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,270
I need to ask you about something.

433
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Did I steal the

434
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,750
patent certificate for you back then?

435
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,150
You?

436
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,590
Plus the memorial service,

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,070
this is only the second time I met you.

438
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,550
How could it be you?

439
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,640
Who was it then?

440
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,880
Are you still not going

441
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,760
to tell the truth?

442
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,240
Fine.

443
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,470
For the sake that

444
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,440
you saved me today,

445
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,480
I'll tell you.

446
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,270
It was

447
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,680
a woman named Gu Xiao Qi.

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,880
Gu Xiao Qi?

449
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,310
Do you know her?

450
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,000
She was my dad's secretary.

451
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920
His right-hand-woman in the company.

452
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,920
Why would a right-hand woman do that?

453
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,910
About this,

454
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,640
you will have to

455
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,750
ask Wei Xuan He.

456
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,680
He will tell you everything.

457
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,790
Wei Xuan He?

458
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,480
Let me see.

459
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,830
So much blood.

460
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,230
We're going to the hospital.

461
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,110
Come on.

462
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:05,800
Doctor,

463
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,240
isn't his wound a little deep?

464
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,590
It's fine, it's just a minor injury.

465
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,590
It's nothing serious.

466
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
What do you mean by nothing serious?

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,960
Your wound

468
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,440
requires at least twelve stitches.

469
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,200
And you need a tetanus shot.

470
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,640
You're being dramatic.

471
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,880
It's not necessary.

472
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Don't worry, I'm fine.

473
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,480
What do you mean "not necessary?”

474
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,920
Come, get ready for suturing.

475
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,440
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

476
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,270
We lost Zhao Yao Yang.

477
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,030
And we saw

478
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,110
Lei Chu Xia and Xu Xiao Dong.

479
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,510
We can't find out

480
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,440
their whereabouts now.

481
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,510
A bunch of losers.

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,800
Scram!

483
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,160
Did you not hear what I said?

484
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
I said scram.

485
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,720
You're here.

486
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,710
Have a seat.

487
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,590
Who is Gu Xiao Qi?

488
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,160
You met Zhao Yao Yang, didn't you?

489
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Nothing he said was true.

490
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,480
But Gu Xiao Qi is real, isn't it?

491
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,960
You're still lying to me at this point.

492
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,590
You were the one who colluded with other people

493
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,360
and stole the patent certificate.

494
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,270
Yet you're pinning it on me now.

495
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,230
Was there anything

496
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,110
you said that was true?

497
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,440
You still don't trust me.

498
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,640
Why do you always

499
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,590
take sides against me?

500
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,270
You are still doing that even now.

501
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,550
Is it hard to tell the truth?

502
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
What is the truth?

503
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
What is the evidence?

504
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,790
Do you have any evidence?

505
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,830
If you don't,

506
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,680
then there is no truth.

507
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
[Cyber Tech]

508
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,550
Yuan Yuan.

509
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,160
Chu Xia, where are you?

510
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,750
Why didn't you answer your phone?

511
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,070
I came here to see Wei Xuan He.

512
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,790
All the leads are gone.

513
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:20,990
Did Wei Xuan He

514
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,200
tell you anything?

515
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,840
I only know there was a girl

516
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,000
named Gu Xiao Qi.

517
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,110
Gu Xiao Qi?

518
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,000
What?

519
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,390
Do you know her?

520
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
Not only do I know her,

521
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
you know her too.

522
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,720
[I know Gu Xiao Qi too?]

523
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,720
[Who is she?]

524
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,480
[Where will]

525
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,960
[fate lead me to this time?]

526
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,070
This is the machine that

527
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,070
can make Lei Chu Xia disappear?

528
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,960
At least I managed

529
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,440
to bring Lei Chu Xia

530
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,350
back to this dimension last time.

531
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,960
If I want her to disappear again,

532
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,070
can you do that?

533
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,920
The machine has some problems now.

534
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,590
I need some time.

535
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,880
Also,

536
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,440
the bracelet Professor Chen gave her

537
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,270
has stabilized

538
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,830
her magnetic field in this dimension.

539
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,400
I can no longer control

540
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,070
the energy in her from a distance.

541
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,200
I can give you time.

542
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,200
You just need to fix this.

543
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,760
I'll take care of

544
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,350
the rest.

545
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,680
It's a deal.

546
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,910
Mr. Wei,

547
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,160
I think there's something you should know.

548
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,590
Without

549
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,110
Professor Chen's bracelet,

550
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,680
I can't ensure that Lei Chu Xia

551
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,000
will return to her original dimension,

552
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,720
and there is a possibility that

553
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,640
she will dissipate into the universe.

554
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,920
You don't need to worry about that.

555
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,920
We'll leave it to the universe.

556

[Chu Xia,]

557
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,200
[you leave me no choice.]

558
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,880
Haven't I already seen all of these?

559
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,960
No, I'm asking you to look at these.

560
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,350
Do you remember

561
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,400
the last time you

562
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,790
saw these pictures, you asked me

563
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,270
why was a part of these photos cut off?

564
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,150
Yes.

565
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,750
Because the person who was cut out

566
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
is Gu Xiao Qi.

567
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,640
The three of us were good friends

568
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,480
for four years in college.

569
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,240
And in those four years,

570
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,510
you and her were close.

571
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,590
After graduation,

572
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,160
you two

573
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,590
shared a place for a while.

574
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,000
Why haven't you mentioned this before?

575
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,670
There was a time

576
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,830
when you two

577
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,310
were pretty close.

578
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
However,

579
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,160
before you went missing,

580
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,280
every time she was mentioned,

581
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,920
you would become upset.

582
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,880
Until you disappeared,

583
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,510
she never showed up

584
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,110
nor asked about you.

585
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,680
What kind of good friend was she?

586
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,480
So I just cut her out of the photo.

587
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,120
Keep her

588
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,550
out of your world.

589
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,160
Now that you've lost your memory,

590
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,360
there's no need to

591
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,590
remember this person who upset you.

592
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,240
Besides, over the past ten years,

593
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,190
I've never seen

594
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,270
Gu Xiao Qi.

595
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,590
And I have no idea what she is doing now.

596
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,670
Isn't this the case with

597
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,680

598
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,200
Losing touch after graduation.

599
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Never heard from her since then.

600
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,030
Just disappear.

601
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,320

My dad trusted her so much that

604
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,920
she had every chance

605
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,240
to get her hands on the patent certificate.

606

the patent certificate end up in your house?

609

00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,070
You don't have to worry about

864
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,550
my job.

865
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,550
I'll take care of it myself.

866
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,870
Is that

867
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,360
what you came here for?

868
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,190
I need to talk to Lei Chu Xia.

869
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,150
Go back first.

870
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,510
Be careful.

871
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,720
Alright, I got it.

872
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Go on, go on.
