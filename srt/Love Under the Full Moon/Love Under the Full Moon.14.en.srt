342
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,800
It's not what you think.

343
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,670
Chu Xia, stop running!

344
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,710
Don't come any nearer.

345
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,980
Don't be foolish.

346
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Chu Xia!

347
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,360
Chu Xia!

348
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,650
No!

349
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,060
Don't let go!

350
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,950
I can't face Xu Wei Yi.

351
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,330
I can't put you in trouble too.

352
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,770
Let go!

353
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,960
Let go of me!

354
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,000
Let go!

355
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,770
Chu Xia!

356
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,400
[This is the real truth.]

357
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,820
Chu Xia.

358
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,770
Let the past be the past.

359
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,560
Chu Xia.

360
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,970
Stop blaming yourself.

361
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,230
How will I face Xiao Dong?

362
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,820
What do you mean?

363
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,730
Xiao Dong is Xu Wei Yi's son.

364
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,560
Lei Chu Xia.

365
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,530
I like you.

366
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,760
Let's be together.

367
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,350
They are over there.

368
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,240
Chu Xia!

369
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,980
You're finally back.

370
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,260
Don't ever leave us again.

371
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,380
I envy you.

372
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,820
Why?

373
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,620
That's something I yearn.

374
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,540
Be careful, don't burn your hands.

375
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,840
Aren't you envious?

376
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,920
Don't do that.

377
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,520
It's between me and my best friend.

378
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,550
Chu Xia.

379
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,550
If you don't feel well,

380
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,260
I can take you to Professor Chen
for a check-up.

381
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,220
Chu Xia.

382
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,170
What is going on?

383
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,200
Why did you

384
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,870
disappear all of a sudden at the back mountain?

385
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,410
Also, where were you the past few days?

386
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,110
We have been looking for you.

387
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,680
You missed out

388
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,670
the tenth anniversary of Summer Time.

389
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,790
Yuan Yuan, stop asking.

390
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,250
All right, I'll stop asking for now.

391
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,170
I went back to ten years ago.

392
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,420
I went to the back mountain
trying to recall my memory.

393
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,570
Then, I felt dizzy.

394
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,140
When I woke up, I was back to ten years ago.

395
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,420
Did you find out how you fell off the cliff?

396
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,430
[Everything]

397
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,940
[happened because of me.]

398
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,070
Then, how did you come back?

399
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,810
I felt dizzy again.

400
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,150
Then, I came back.

401
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,230
I want to go back for a rest.

402
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,230
Sure, let me send you home.

403
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,510
Can I go to your place?

404
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,430
Of course.

405
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,040
-But...
-Chu Xia.

406
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,990
Why don't you go back to your own place?

407
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,330
[Hurry up, persuade Xiao Dong.]

408
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,090
[Do you want me to betray my buddy?]

409
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,050
[Am I that kind of person?]

410
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,030
[Then you don't deserve to be a human.]

411
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,110
[You will be single forever.]

412
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,960
[Got it!]

413
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,800
[Leave it to me.]

414
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,520
Xiao Dong.

415
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,760
Come with me.

416
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,090
No need, you may leave first.

417
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,240
Xiao Dong, let them talk.

418
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
-Let's go back. Let's go.
-No need.

419
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,970
-Let's go.
-No need.

420
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,320
I said, no!

421
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,430
Chu Xia.

422
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,540
No matter what happened to you in the past,

423
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,800
you can always share it with me.

424
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,640
We can face it together.

425
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,760
They are finally gone.

426
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
Only two of us here.

427
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,050
Let's have

428
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,530
a talk between best friends.

429
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,600
Chu Xia, what is wrong?

430
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,790
We received the location from Turing

431
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,330
informing us that you were
at Tongcheng University.

432
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,830
When we got there,

433
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,140
we saw you and Xiao Dong hugging each other.

434
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,090
Did he confess to you?

435
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,250
He is quite the romantic.

436
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,420
He confessed to you in public.

437
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,130
He always looks a little sheepish.

438
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,050
I didn't expect him to do that.

439
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,700
Did you say yes?

440
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,920
No.

441
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,240
[Sorry.]

442
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,680
[The number you have dialled]

443
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,040
[is not available.]

444
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,630
[Please try again later.]

445
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,640
[Sending to Zhao Yao Yang]

446

447
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
Chu Xia.

448
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,460
In the past yen years,

449
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,130
I have been doing a lot of preparation

450
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,180
just in case you came back out of the blue.

451
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,320
In my life,

452
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,700
I never take any chances.

453
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,580
However,

454
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,940
the proof that I collected back then

455
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,710
still comes in handy

456
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,290
after ten years have passed.

457
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,050
I don't get it.

458
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,050
You didn't know Xu Wei Yi ten years ago.

459
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,050
[Piggy Tech sued Xu Wei Yi for patent infringement]
Why were you in his office

460
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,050
on that day?

461
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,190
Open the door, Wang Yi Xin!

462
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,330
It's you again.

463
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,910
I have told you everything.

464
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,090
It's up to you to believe it or not.

465
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,800
I believe you.

466
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,800
I saw Lei Chu Xia

467
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,820
appearing out of nowhere.

468
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,200
What?

469
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,010
Appearing out of nowhere?

470
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,910
Yes.

471
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,060
When did that happen?

472
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,870
Where?

473
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,820
It happened this morning.

474
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,850
At Wei Xuan He's place,

475
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,150
she appeared out of nowhere.

476

In the morning?

477
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,080
The machine overloaded this morning.

478
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,030
The energy in Lei Chu Xia's body

479
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,040
is connected to the energy that I collected.

480
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,080
I have succeeded.

481
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,780
I have succeeded!

482

I have succeeded!

483
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,100

Stop bugging me!

488
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,290
You were the one
who stole Xu Wei Yi's patent certificate.

[No doubt we don't know Xu Wei Yi in person]

but he would rather die
than being wrongly accused.

491
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm sure he would never

492
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,870
steal someone else's patent.

493
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,920
[You sought help from a friend
who worked at Xu Wei Yi's company]

I can't put you in trouble too.

497

The sooner, the better.

505
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,810
The interval between two hypnoses

506
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,850
is too short.

507
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,540
I worry that it will cause a negative impact

508

00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,890
Don't be mad at me.

681
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,990
I am sorry.

682
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,190
Kiss me

683
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,230
and I won't be angry at you anymore.

684
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,750
I want you to kiss me.

685
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,560
All right, it's a deal.

686
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,420
You will stop being angry after I kiss you.

687
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,370
Chu Xia, you are back!

688
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,900
Sorry to interrupt.
