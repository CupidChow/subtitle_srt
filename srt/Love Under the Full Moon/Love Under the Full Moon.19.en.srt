00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,340
Hurry.

526
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,020
I... I really... I really can't.

527
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,820
Why is it so hard to communicate?

528
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,380
Just say hey buddy,

529
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,340
can I borrow your spades?

530
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,300
Hurry.

531
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,820
Hi kids, how are you?

532
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,420
What are you playing?

533
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,180
Do you want me to

534
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,700
play with you?

535
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,460
This looks fun.

536
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,580
Here, lend me the spade.

537
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,460
Spade.

538
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,660
-Mum!
-Mum!

539
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,460
There's a bad man

540
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,420
who's trying to grab our things.

541
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,020
I'm not a bad man.

542
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,380
I'm not a bad man.

543
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,700
Not a bad man.

544
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,700
Is it pretty?

545
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,300
Do you want this?

546
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,180
Do you want to trade?

547
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,940
Here,

548
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,140
you get the pink one,

549
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,820
you get the yellow one.

550
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,340
Thank you.

551
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,700
Thank you.

552
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,060
Go and have fun.

553
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,340
There it is.

554
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,300
Hurry.

555
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,180
Let me do it.

556
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,460
You've done it.

557
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,860
Open it, open it!

558
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,580
It was new

559
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,500
when I buried it.

560
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,380
Why did it turn out like that?

561
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,340
It's been ten years.

562
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,820
It's not odd that it turned out like this.

563
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,060
You did your best.

564
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,100
But I've

565
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,300
cheated time.

566
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,580
Maybe history

567
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,660
cannot be changed.

568
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,500
[Moonlit Flats]

569
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,980
Are you still thinking about it?

570
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,780
Would it not change

571
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,220
no matter how hard I try?

572
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,340
It will.

573
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,140
Everything that you've done

574
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,860
has changed me.

575
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,540
I've always been alone

576
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,060
facing my problems by myself

577
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,660
before you showed up.

578
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,340
I worked hard

579
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,700
to clear my dad's name.

580
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,540
Go into hiding

581
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,060
and conceal my identity.

582
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,420
Until you showed up.

583
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,180
You took my loneliness away.

584
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
You made my life

585
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,380
richer

586
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,780
and more interesting.

587
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,620
Most importantly,

588
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,940
you gave my life

589
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
a different meaning.

590
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,020
So the current me

591
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,260
is the result of your hard work.

592
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,260
Lei Chu Xia,

593
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,780
keep up the good work.

594
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,580
I'm being serious right now.

595
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm being serious too.

596
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,620
Thanks to your hard work,

597
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,220
I will persevere.

598
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,700
Now it's your turn.

599
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,780
Wang Yi Xin has disappeared.

600
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,140
No one will ever

601
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,340
threaten your safety.

602
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,380
So I want to say

603
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,860
welcome home.

604
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,260
Shameless!

605
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,860
I knew it.

606
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:53,860
I knew that

607
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,340
he's up to no good.

608
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,100
He was the one who stole

609
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,540
Uncle Xu's patent

610
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,780
and did horrible things to Chu Xia.

611
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,580
I really... I...

612
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:04,739
Wait, what are you... what are you doing?

613
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:06,980
I...

614
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,699
I want to use

615
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,699
the hardest thing in the world

616
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,940
to break his head.

617
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,060
I want him to kneel in front of Uncle Xu

618
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,060
and apologise.

619
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,980
Don't get too excited.

620
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,940
Hitting me with a baguette

621
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,820
might work,

622
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,500
but we don't have evidence,

623
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,780
so Wei Xuan He will not

624
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,179
admit that he stole the patent document.

625
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,580
Nor will Zhao Yao Yang

626
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,420
admit that he stole

627
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,460
Uncle Xu's patent.

628
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,300
They will never admit it

629
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,460
without solid evidence.

630
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,020
Do we just give up?

631
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,500
Do we just let them go?

632
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,860
Chu Xia managed to

633
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,980
cheat time,

634
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:37,860
but still didn't manage to

635
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,780
keep evidence of the patent document.

636
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
Let's come up with a new plan.

637
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,460
Okay.

638
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,100
I'm so angry!

639
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,980
Don't be angry.

640
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
This rooftop

641
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,900
holds a lot of memories.

642
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,820
When I was young,

643
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,540
my dad brought me here from time to time.

644
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,660
It didn't look like this

645
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,980
back then.

646
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,580
After so many years,

647
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,900
he probably didn't expect

648
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,980
such drastic changes.

649
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,780
I need to tell you something.

650
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,780
Before this,

651
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,460
after Uncle Xu heard my story,

652
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,060
not only did he not laugh at me,

653
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,060
but he didn't think that I was lying.

654
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,260
Instead,

655
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,540
he wanted me to pass a message to you.

656
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,780
What is it?

657
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,540
Uncle Xu said

658
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,060
he hoped to bring this message to you

659
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,500
if given the chance.

660
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,860
I don't need

661
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,260
you to do anything for me.

662
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,940
I just hope that

663
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,500
you appreciate the happiness you have

664
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,260
and live happily.

665
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,140
It sounds like something he would say.

666
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,500
He thanked me for being there for you.

667
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,500
Aren't you going to thank me?

668
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,820
Thank you.

669
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,740
Happy?

670
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,260
That's it?

671
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,300
That's too simple.

672
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,420
Thank you.

673
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,540
It's been weird recently.

674
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,540
I keep remembering

675
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,460
that odd person.

676
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,020
Odd person?

677
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,780
Yes,

678
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,060
that person I mentioned before.

679
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,540
Who?

680
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,140
The old fairy lady.

681
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,460
If I had to give thanks,

682
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,580
I really want to thank her

683
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,340
for encouraging me

684
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,660
and pushing me

685
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,020
when I was at my most helpless

686
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,500
and saddest.

687
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,180
Heavens,

688
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,060
how could there be

689
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,220
such a kind woman in this world?

690
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,220
Really,

691
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,300
you should thank her.

692
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,700
It's pointless.

693
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,940
She suddenly appeared

694
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,380
in my life

695
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,820
and disappeared just as suddenly.

696
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,460
This person

697
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,420
really was quite bizarre.

698
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,980
She kept covering half of her face.

699
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,020
I couldn't see
