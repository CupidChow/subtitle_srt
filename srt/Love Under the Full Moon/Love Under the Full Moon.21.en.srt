Isn't Wang Yi Xin's machine broken?

Why is this happening?

445
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,120
This time, it's due to gravitational waves.

446
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,470
Gravitational waves?

447
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,680
Gravitational waves with code GF180520.

448
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,470
They are produced due to the friction

449
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,190
between two black holes in the universe.

450
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,990
Their distance away from Earth

451
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,190
is approximately one billion light years.

452
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,990
During the last super full moon,

453
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,910
a group of gravitational waves

454
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,910
passed through Earth

455
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,470
and caused many changes of fate to happen.

456
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,160
After that, many unusual phenomena

457
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,560
in the universe

458
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,510
happened to you.

459
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,400
These gravitational waves

460
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,510
are now weakening.

461
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,950
Hence,

462
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,320
once the next black hole is formed,

463
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,950
these gravitational waves will disappear.

464
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,950
That also means that

465
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,750
the energy that supports you

466
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,120
to continue living in this space-time

467
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,780
will also disappear.

468
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,120
So you...

469
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,880
I will cease to exist?

470
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,880

471
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,710
How much time left do I have, Professor Chen?

472
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,710
I'm not sure about this.

473
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,670

or maybe tomorrow.

475
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
However, according to my studies

476
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,230
about the field of gravitational waves,

477
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,840

480
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,310

482
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,500
Why did you dress up like this?

483
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,540
You look like a salesman.

484
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Do I look handsome?

485
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,120
You know what?

486
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,120
I'll start working tomorrow.

487
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,190
I want Yuan Yuan to feel more assured.

488
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,040
You haven't answered me.

489
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,390
I'm going to attend

490
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,630
the press conference of Battle of the Saints.

491
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,840
How could I not be happy?

492
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,710
I think it's not just
about the press conference.

493
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,190
I saw the news reporting that

494
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,470

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,350
of Battle of the Saints.

514
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
As usual, I'm here to accompany you

515
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,990
throughout this warm

516

527
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,430
After watching

528
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,430
the video just now,

529
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,630
we saw that

530
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,630
many offline players

531
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,840
had sent us their wishes.

532
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,800
Their photos are very heartwarming.

533
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
That's because many people

534
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,190
not only found themselves

535
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,430
in the game,

536
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,760
they also became friends

537
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,600
from playing as comrades.

538
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,390
From being friends,

539
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,910
they also became close friends.

540
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,470
Some even got together as couples.

541
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,470
Today, I know that

542
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,710
these few pairs of couples

543
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,560
are here with us

544
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
at our offline game meeting.

545
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,710
Later,

546
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,510
they will share their stories with us.

547
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,950
Anyways,

548
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,760
we are here

549
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,630
at a very heartwarming

551
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,600
We are able to gather here

552
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,670
because of this person.

553
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,990
Who is he?

554
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,470
Winter! Winter!

555

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,190
Our event today is truly a success.

564
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,630
You're right. Many people came today.

565
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,700
That's right.

566
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,360
They were so enthusiastic.

567
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,350
You know what?

568
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,210
It's amazing to see

00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,320
the same people

570
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,560
coming here for three years in a row.

571
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,990
Miss Qin Yue, have some water.

572
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,320
You worked hard today.

573
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,040
It's nothing.

574
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,580
It's within my job scope.

575

Miss Qin Yue.

576
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,040
President Wei called you

577
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,520
many times just now.

578
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,430
Do you want to return his calls?

579
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,230
No.

580
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,430
If he ever calls again next time,

581
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,800
end the call immediately.

582
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,430
Got it.

583
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
What's with the noise outside?

584
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,060
Which segment is it now?

585
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,040
The players are just too enthusiastic.

586
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,440
Let me take a look
and make sure everything is in control.

587
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Okay.

588
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,190
Go through the proposal again.

589
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,070
Sure.

590
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,390
We are game players who got to know each other

591
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,760
through the virtual network.

592
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,120
Through Battle of the Saints,

593
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,470
we are able to gather here today.

594
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,040
But our feelings for each other

595
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,190
are sincere.

596
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,880
Let's take the first step

597
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,290

00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,110
Actually, in real life,

601
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,230
I'm not good in socialising.

602
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,230
However,

a lot of people.

606
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,880
Who says there isn't sincerity in the virtual world

607
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,950
or no life in playing games?

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,370
No.

686
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,380
I'll say it one more time.

687
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,970
I didn't go there for the interview.

688
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,430
You're so prideful.

689
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,120
Believe it or not,

690
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,910
I will lead a good life

691
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,560
in this city.

692
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,390
I'm sure you will.

693
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,560
Come on. Dig in.

694
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,810
Let's have another drink.

695
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,470
[Battle of the Saints
Players' Offline Meeting]

696
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,160
I didn't expect that

697
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,080
you are Winter.

698
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,060
But come to think of it,

699
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,710
it makes sense.

700
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,830
All these while,

701
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,310
you were special to me.

702
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,470
But I didn't know that you were this formidable.

703
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,750
I didn't mean to hide
the truth from you, Qin Yue.

704
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,560
It's just that I still have

705
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,390
some unfinished business.

706
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,470
So I couldn't reveal my true identity.

707
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,450
I understand.

708
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,800
Answer me now.

709
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,560
All these while,

710
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,290
Battle of the Saints

711
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,940
has been hiring me as the host.

712
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,600
Were you the one who arranged that?

713
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,520
You could say so.

714
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,190
Ever since I turned 18 years old,

715
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,320
I seldom felt

716
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,040
the benevolence of people.

717
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,199
This is just

718
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,639
my way of

719
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:01,239
giving back to the society

720
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,830
for their kindness.

721
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,350
Come to think of it,

722
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,810
all these while

723
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,340
I thought that I was the one who helped you.

724
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,070
But you're actually the one

725
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,320
who helped me.

726
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,690
Thank you, Xiao Dong.

727
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,480
What are you thanking me for?

728
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,670
Since you found out about my identity,

729
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,310
I have a favour

730
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,590
to ask from you.

731
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,400
About Xuan He?

732
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,590
Yes.

733
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,370
Please tell him

734
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,469
to stop repeating the same mistake.

735
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,870
Stop causing harm to others.

736
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,860
He should bear the consequences

737
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,550
of his actions.

738
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,260
Also, please tell him this

739
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,710
to clear my father's name.

740
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,690
Why didn't you answer my calls?

741
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,080
I've said what I had to say.

742
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,230
I don't know what else I could say.

743
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,680
I really missed you

744
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,800
these few days.

745
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,300
Didn't you say that

746
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,670
you're an expert in waiting for me?

747
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,720
Why are you ignoring me now

748
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,990
after you tricked me

749
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,910
into your life?

750
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,220
Xuan He.

751
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,530
Stop it

752
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
while you still can.

753
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,350
Qin Yue.

754
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,360
Why are you still telling me this?

755
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,600
I thought you knew me well

756
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
and would support me.

757
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,550
I didn't expect you to be like others

758
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,190
and look down on me.

759
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,390
Listen carefully.

760
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,800
Be it Winter or Xu Xiao Dong,

761
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,380
I will not lose to them.

762
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,640
I just can't bear to see you
come to a dead end

763
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,310
and ruin yourself.

764
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,640
Xuan He.

765
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,290
Xiao Dong is Winter.

766
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,350
Xiao Dong stayed low for many years

767
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,990
and hid his identity

768
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,600
as Winter

769
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,200
because he wanted to find out

770
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
the manipulator

771
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,520
who framed his father.

772
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,160
What happened to Family First

773
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,730
is just the beginning.

774
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,160
His purpose is to make you

775
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,280
and Zhao Yao Yang pay for

776
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,710
what you both did.

777
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,340
Stop doing this.

778
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,870
Okay?

779
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,960
These croissants were
freshly baked this morning.

780
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,330
Do you want to try one?

781
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,650
Welcome.

782
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,440
Chu Xia.

783
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,600
You're finally here.

784
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,720
Sorry I'm late today.

785
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,870
That's nothing to be sorry for.

786
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,240
It has been a while since our dear Miss Lei

787
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,990
had some free time.

788
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,990
Moreover, you have me, the store manager

789
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,760
to look after the bakery.

790
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,560
What's wrong with you?

791
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,040
Nothing.

792
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,310
I just want to give you a hug.

793
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,120
Let me give you a big hug too.

794
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,670
Excuse me.

795
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,010
Excuse me.

796
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,940
I want to pay the bill.

797
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,870
Go.

798
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,520
I apologise.

799
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,670
Hello.

800
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,510
The total amount is 32.50 yuan.

801
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,070
Okay.

802
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,830
Please come again. Have a nice day.

803
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,160
Last night, did you go for

804
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,320
a romantic midnight date
with Xu Xiao Dong?

805
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,690
How did you know?

806
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,600
Jin Xiao Rui told me.

807
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,070
You know what?

808
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,430
Early this morning, Xu Xiao Dong

809
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,550
told Jin Xiao Rui

810
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,110
all the details

811
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,620
about your date.

812
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,580
He told him about the fireworks

813
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,260
and the sky lantern.

814
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,820
I never knew

815
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,160
a cold-blooded guy with an evil tongue like him

816
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,750
could have this romantic side.

817
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,160
Now that I think about it,

818
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,270
I'm not used to it.

819
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,880
Why do you

820
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,350
look unhappy?

821
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,400
I'm quite happy.

822
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,120
Are your eyes swollen because you cried?

823
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,680
Chu Xia.

824
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,470
If something bad happened,

825
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,430
don't you ever keep it from me.

826
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,320
You must tell me.

827
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,470
What could possibly happen?

828
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,680
Get back to work.

829
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,000
Lei Chu Xia.

830
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,680
Did Xu Xiao Dong upset you?

831
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,180
-I'll give him a call now. -No, don't.

832
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,060
It's not about Xu Xiao Dong.

833
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,530
It's not related to him.

834
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,410
Then what is it?

835
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,660
Get back to work.

836
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,250
Chu Xia.

837
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,390
What's wrong with your hand?

838
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,320
Nothing.

839
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,390
Let me take a look.

840
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,200
I'm fine.

841
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,350
Let me...

842
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,220
Chu Xia.

843
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,720
What...

844
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,830
What is happening?

845
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,250
Answer me.

846
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,400
Come here.

847
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,210
I might not be able to accompany you any more.

848
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,590
I'll have to leave.

849
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,800
What do you mean?

850
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,280
Didn't Wang Yi Xin fail?

851
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,460
And Professor Chen...

852
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,830
Didn't Professor Chen say that

853
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,160
you could lead a peaceful and stable life?

854
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,950
And about Xiao Dong.

855
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,460
He's about to succeed soon.

856
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,820
Why do you have to leave at this time?

857
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,790
No matter when

858
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,000
and where,

859
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,880
my heart is forever

860
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440
with my best friend.

861
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,560
I don't want this.

862
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,100
Chu Xia.

863
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,220
I don't want you to leave.

864
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,290
I want to always see you

865
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,500
when I open my eyes every day.

866
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,050
I don't want you to leave.

867
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,840
I just want to always

868
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
have senseless talk with you

869
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,470
and live a simple life.

870
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,560
I don't want you to leave.

871
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,450
I only realised now that

872
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,830
a simple life is the most precious.
