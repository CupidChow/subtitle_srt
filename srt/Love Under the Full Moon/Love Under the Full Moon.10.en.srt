[Episode 10]

4
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,579
Then we helped her

5
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,900
find Summer Time.

6
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,270
You know the rest.

7
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,540
So that's it.

8
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,870
I'm glad you're back.

9
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,460
I'm glad I waited until you got back.

10
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
Based on

11
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,320
what was said,

12
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,530
you're currently just

13
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,640
twenty-two years old.

14
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,120
But I'm already...

15
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,610
Thirty-two.

16
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,680
It's alright.

17
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,740
That's not important.

18
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,710
What's important is that you're back.

19
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
It's fine.

20
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,460
I'll protect you.

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
You've always been

22
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,030
taking care of me like a sister

23
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
in the past.

24
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,660
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

25
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,960
I won't complain that you're young.

26
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,700
Since you fainted,

27
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,060
you're probably not feeling well.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,840
So tonight you should stay at my place.

29
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,910
I'll take care of you.

30
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,680
Why are you looking at him
just to come stay at my place?

31
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
Well, you see...

32
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,520
Didn't I lose my wrist band?

33
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,710
I can't stay too far away from him.

34
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,990
No matter how far I go,

35
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,720
I'll still be back at his side.

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,820
Then would you mind

37
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,340
sleeping on the sofa at my place?

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,620
I...

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,420
I don't mind.

40
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,270
Get lost.

41
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,970
That's decided then.

42
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,640
I want to go too.

43
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,980
What does this have to do with you?

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,890
What does this have to do with you?

45
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,040
How's this?

46
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,550
Doesn't this

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,790
look quite cool?

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
Yuan Yuan,
why are you staying at a warehouse?

49
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,250
The rent is low here.

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,210
The money that I save

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,909
has to go to sustain Summer Time.

52
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,830
Come in and take a look.

53
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
Why don't you move in with me?

54
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,500
I won't charge rent.

55
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,950
No one wants to stay with you.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,590
My place is a little small.

57
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,840
Yuan Yuan,
your home is decorated quite nicely.

58
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,400
Life is tough

59
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,360
so I have to treat myself nicer.

60
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,470
It doesn't look very decent.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,840
You're the indecent one.

62
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,460
Jin Xiao Rui,

63
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,520
you are making yourself at home, huh?

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,080
Chu Xia,

65
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,090
the bedroom is this way.

66
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,500
We can sleep together

67
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,560
tonight.

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
You're mine.

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,310
Xu Xiao Dong,

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
you'll sleep on the sofa, okay?

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,670
Okay.

72
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Is this distance alright?

73
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,530
No problem.

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,850
What about me?

75
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,000
Look,

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,500
there's a lot of space on the floor.

77
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,780
Pick a spot.

78
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,420
How is it?

79
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,520
My room.

80
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,390
Your room is really tasteful.

81
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,120
Right?

82
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,320
There was actually nothing here

83
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,620
when I first moved in.

84
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,640
These were all

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
slowly added to the decoration.

86
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,980
Look.

87
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,260
There's a small balcony.

88
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,230
When I came,

89
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,870
everything was empty.

90
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,520
I thought since I'm staying here,

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,110
I should treat myself better.

92
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,440
So I decorated it.

93
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,540
Now it looks not bad, right?

94
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,500
When we earn some big money,

95
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,440
we'll stay in a bigger home,

96
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,010
and have more flavour in life.

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,710
Let's work hard together.

98
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,360
What's wrong?

99
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,260
Why are you not getting ready
to sleep yet?

100
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,350
Were you scared about

101
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
what happened just now?

102
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm fine,

103
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,550
but the customers got scared.

104
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,990
Don't worry about them.

105
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,350
People love to be

106
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,700
nosy.

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,430
The bigger the issue the better.

108
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,090
But,

109
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,550
luckily Xu Xiao Dong showed up in time.

110
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,909
You didn't see

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,730
how anxious he was

112
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,780
when he picked you up.

113
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,490
Thanks to him.

114
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,690
Thanks to him.

115
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,820
Based on my strong sixth sense,

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,120
my instinct says that

117
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,640
Xu Xiao Dong definitely
has feelings for you.

118
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,610
What about you?

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,030
What about me?

120
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,010
Playing dumb?

121
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,450
I'm asking if you like him.

122
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,870
I better think about

123
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,190
how to stay alive here.

124
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,290
You're such a killjoy.

125
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,250
I think Xu Xiao Dong

126
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,650
is definitely the first choice.

127
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,980
I'll be the first to vote for him.

128
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,750
Vote with both my hands and feet.

129
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,420
Alright, time to sleep.

130
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,300
You can make anything work.

131
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,180
Xiao Dong is just on
the other side of the door.

132
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,920
Go to sleep.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Stop talking.

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,560
No, it's because the two of you...

135
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,350
Don't talk when you're eating
or sleeping, okay?

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,350
Okay, I'll sleep.

137
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,930
You should sleep early too.

138
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,300
Sleeping soon.

139
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,130
I feel so happy

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,160
breathing the air of Yuan Yuan's home.

141
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,580
Xiao Dong,

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,810
tell me.

143
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,530
Yuan Yuan was able to finish

144
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,970
all my sentences about love.

145
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,640
Don't you think that
we're extra compatible?

146
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,790
Even though she's a lot older than I am,

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,450
I feel that she doesn't mind that at all.

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,760
What do you think?

149
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,540
Your best friend is talking to you.

150
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,570
Can you give some response, please?

151
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,250
The girls might just be

152
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,920
having pillow talk in the room.

153
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
We should communicate so that

154
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,570
we have each others' backs.

155
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,299
Okay.

156
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,400
Do you think I should be
more straight forward

157
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,280
and take a lot more initiative?

158
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm afraid you might not

159
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
be able to even sleep on the sofa.

160
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,350
Okay. Let's stop talking about me.

161
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
Let's talk about you.

162
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
I saw you

163
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,730
coming back with her.

164
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,910
That feeling between you two...

165
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,080
I will definitely not believe it

166
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,990
if you say you don't have feelings
for each other.

167
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,570
You're a man.

168
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,290
You should just confess your feelings.

169
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,940
It's not the best time
to confess my feelings.

170
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,160
Chu Xia just experienced
a serious physical condition.

171
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,200
If I confess now, I...

172
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,230
Didn't they say online that

173
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,340
spending time is

Let me tell you.

345
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,120
People shouldn't be so greedy.

346
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,950
I am exactly that greedy.

347
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,520
Xiao Dong.

348
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,720
Xiao dong...

349
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
I sent something good to you.

350
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,330
Check your phone.

351
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,580
That's it?

352
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,250
Turing can get more of these sappy

353
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,280
love notes in a blink.

354
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,020
How is that the same?

355
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,030
These are the exclusive version
of Xiao Rui's Love Notes.

356
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,710
I saw how you were last night.

357
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,470
Lei Chu Xia and you were telling stories,

358
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,340
reading codes,

359
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,300
but not confessing your feelings.

360
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,430
I'm dying of anxiety.

361
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
So as your best friend,

362
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,340
I think I should give you a hand.

363
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,680
I don't need it.

364
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,360
If you really want to help me,

365
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,320
help me make an appointment
with the psychologist.

366
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,680
Dr. Tian Yu?

367
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,290
What do you plan to do?

368
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,110
I want to bring Chu Xia

369
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,470
over for a session.

370
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,720
Take the trash out.

371
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,860
Do it yourself.

372
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,820
[Psychologist Tian Yu]

373
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,110
How do you feel now?

374
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,830
At that time...

375
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,670
You see a light

376
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,150
[shining on you.]

377
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,120
Relax.

378
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,190
Relax.

379
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,280
Three, two, one.

380
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,910
How is it, Dr. Tian Yu?

381
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,150
The scene that Chu Xia saw

382
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,300
wasn't an illusion.

383
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,770
Are the scenes in her memory

384
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,410
all true?

385
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,910
Scenes that were shown

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,160
basically match what Chu Xia described.

387
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,880
This means it's not an illusion.

388
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,020
Look,

389
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,110
running,

390
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,200
falling,

391
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,370
being chased.

392
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,480
It hints at a lack of security.

393
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,690
It's bizarre.

394
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,330
She is especially resistant and nervous

395
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,490
with this one memory.

396
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,020
That caused her to see

397
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,270
sporadic scenes.

398
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,910
This further points to

399
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,710
a big probability that

400
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,600
this is a true memory.

401
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,250
Based on what you said,

402
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,520
the man that let go and caused her

403
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
to fall down the cliff in her memory

404
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,410
really exists too?

405
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,840
It's highly possible.

406
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,670
Of course,

407
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,240
we can't rule out that this is something

408
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,560
that stems from her extreme fear.

409
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,410
We need more memories

410
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,310
to come to a
relatively accurate conclusion.

411
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,120
Got it. Thank you, Dr. Tian.

412
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,190
It's windy.

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,130
Don't overthink.

414
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,680
It's possible that the person

415
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,430
who hurt you is already dead.

416
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,480
It's also possible that

417
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,480
just like Dr. Tian Yu said,

418
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,410
he's just a visualisation of your fear.

419
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,480
This person might not exist in reality.

420
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,860
If someone really

421
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,430
pushed me off a cliff ten years ago,

422
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,960
something terrible must have happened.

423
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,070
I have to investigate.

424
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,370
Okay.

425
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,910
Mum.

426
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,390
Chu Xia.

427
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,180
Chu Xia.

428
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,040
Chu Xia.

429
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,560
It's been a few days.

430
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,940
Why don't I go back to the room with you?

431
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
It's more comfortable to sleep on a bed.

432
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,870
You're not sleeping well here.

433
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,100
I'm fine.

434
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,660
I don't dare to sleep now anyway.

435
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,940
You can go back to work.

436
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,630
I...

437
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,480
I'll just lie down here for a bit.

438
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,390
Madam, can I have a sugar pancake?

439
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,490
Okay.

440
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,670
Where did she go?

441
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,080
Lei Chu Xia.

442
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,830
What are you doing?

443
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,000
Are you having another nightmare?

444
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,520
I just went to get breakfast.

445
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,400
The wrist band is
still with Professor Chen.

446
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,750
We can't stay too far apart.

447
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,760
You need to control the distance.

448
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,150
Since you're awake,

449
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,340
let's go together.

450
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,100
I want to sleep a little bit more.

451
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,950
Stop sleeping.

452
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
You've said so much,

453
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,910
it's time to get up.

454
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,270
Get up.

455
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,230
Hey,

456
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,590
I saw with my own eyes

457
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,390
that there was only one
sugar pancake left.

458
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,760
It's a shame if we don't get it.

459
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,230
The last one?

460
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,530
I'll go with you then.

461
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,560
The best way

462
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,560
to control your distance,

463
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,110
a leash.

464
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,590
This is what you meant by the last one?

465
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,340
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Sure thing.

466
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,150
Is this sugar pancake really that good?

467
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,150
You don't get it.

468
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,190
Sometimes you just have to

469
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,210
get what you're craving for.

470
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,780
If you don't, you won't be happy.

471
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,840
Xiao Dong!

472
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,240
We have to go.

473
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,190
Oh no.

474
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,730
-Xiao Dong.
-Good morning, aunty.

475
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,580
Why do you have a leash on?

476
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,350
This is usually for dogs and kids,

477
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,890
I've never seen it on boyfriends before.

478
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,990
This is something new.

479
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,690
Yes.

480
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,820
Women shouldn't be too possessive.

481
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,860
If you really want to tie him down,

482
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,320
it shouldn't be done with a rope.

483
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,630
Exactly.

484
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,750
Let me tell you,

485
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,580
if a woman wants to tie a man down,

486
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,040
you need to tie him at his heart.

487
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,870
Yes.

488
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,320
Aunty, young people like us
prefer it like this.

489
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,320
Bye!

490
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,780
Kids nowadays.

491
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,020
Why are they all like that?

492
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,390
There's always something new.

493
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,630
It's true.

494
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,610
[Chu Xia's dream]

495
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,910
[is a projection of
her wanting to get her memories back.]

496
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,260
Because she's pushing
to know more about the past,

497
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,200
she kept dreaming about it.

498
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
As for what the dream represents,

499
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,800
we would need
more information to decipher it.

500
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,830
We can actually try

501
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,620
getting her to get in touch with people,
places and events

502
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,040
[that she's more familiar with.]

503
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,080
[This might help her a lot more.]

504
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,390
[Since Dr. Tian Yu said that,]

505
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,630
[why don't we go to my home?]

506
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,110
Catch.

507
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,120
Chu Xia,

508
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,760
take a look.

509
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,950
Hurry.

510
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,280
♫ Broken ♫

511
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
♫ Zoning out all night ♫

512
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,750
♫ The time machine is broken ♫

513
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,960
This was when I was young?

514
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,690
I think so.

[Run.]

516
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,000
What happened?

517
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,720
Was that it?

518
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,950
Did it end or is it broken?

519
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,900
Is it out of battery?

520
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,600
This might be broken.

521
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,760
Let's find a place to fix it.

522
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,770
We definitely need to fix it.

523
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,900
This unit isn't an old model.

524
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,910
It's an antique.

525
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,600
It's done once it's broken.

526
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
But the video inside
is pretty precious.

527
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,210
Could you help us take a better look?

528
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,950
If it stopped playing half way,

529
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,320
there's one possibility.

530
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,560
The battery slot is broken.

531
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,230
It turns on at first,

532
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,350
but stops after awhile.

533
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,420
That means

534
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
if I can find a new slot
and replace it,

535
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,520
it'll work again, right?

536
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,540
But this type of slot

537
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,110
has been obsolete for a long time.

538
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,300
It's not easy to find at all.

539
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,620
I can try and give it a go.

540
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,570
-Thanks a lot.
-Great.

541
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,370
Let's go and find one.

542
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,350

"Battle of the Saints,"

No.

591

I'm moving the parcels.

592
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,910
Weird.

593
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,390
Is this it?

594
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,230
Players of Battle of the Saints

595
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,230
sent a lot of

596
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,870
parts and user manuals to us?

597
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,010
Didn't you say that you're

598
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,390
looking for parts of the DV?

600
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,910
helped you in the game.

601
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,540

603

605
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,500

606
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,910
I'm trying to fix a DV.

607
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,950
Did Jin Xiao Rui

608
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,450
tell Winter?

609
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,840
Jin Xiao Rui

610
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,840
-counts as Winter's online friend too.
-Is this it?

611
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,150
And he helped Winter

612
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,520
help out Summer Time before.

613
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,470
Here's the problem.

614
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,140
I didn't tell Jin Xiao Rui either.

615
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,280
Xiao Dong,

616
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,430
my back feels like it's burning.

617
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,860
Every time you need help,

618
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,240
Winter will appear in time.

619
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,280
This means...

620
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,000
-he's around us.
-He's around us.

621
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,760
But there's only the two of them

622
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,340
around us.

623
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,490
They're Winter!

624
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,860
How's that possible?

625
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,900
Stop staring.

626
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,410
Keep looking.

627
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,270
Okay.

628
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,080
Winter knows me very well.

629
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,730
Xiao Dong knows me best, after you.

630
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,320
He's Winter?

631
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,560
I heard that

632
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,750
Winter is the

633
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,520
mature and reliable type.

634
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,380
Is this it?

635
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,360
That's it.

636
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,680
So the both of them...

637
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,460
-Yes.
-You found it.

638
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,780
-Found it.

640
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,910

656
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,630
That's all the videos
that are in the DV.

657
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,610
Chu Xia,

658
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,760
did you remember anything?

659
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,540
I just feel that I'm pretty adorable

660
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,040
when I was a kid.

661
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,330
If it's not for Winter,

662
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,440
I wouldn't get to watch all these.

663
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:03,940
But how did he know?

664
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,030
I forgot to tell you.

665
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,840
The owner of the electronic store
sent a message to me.

666
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,440
He said he plays Battle of the Saints too.

667
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,630
He bumped into Winter in the game.

668
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,080
After Winter found out about this,

669
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,030
he tried to ask around.

670
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,940
Are you leaving comments for Winter?

671
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,790
Yes.

672
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,940
Chu Xia,

673
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,120
don't you feel that the way you're

674
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,600
[Thanks Winter. I found the part for the DV.]
communicating with Winter,

675
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,030
[I'll thank you in person if I get the chance.]

676
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,320
[I'll thank you in person if I get the chance.]
it feels like...

677
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,070
He wants to be in
a virtual relationship with you.

678
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,679
Do you want to die?

679
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,070
He's never even seen me.

680
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,780
That's why it's called
a virtual relationship.

681
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,400
When you meet it's called
bringing it to the real world.

682
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,510
Think about it.

683
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,460
A friend whom

684
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,710
you have never met

685
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,630
keeps giving you a helping hand.

686
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,950
He also fulfils all your requests

687
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,770
using the public for personal gain.

688
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,130
There's only one truth to this,

689
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,310
and that is that he likes you.

690
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,590
That's impossible. Stop guessing.

691
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,630
Okay, I'll stop guessing.

692
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,390
We don't need to care

693
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,510
what Winter thinks.

694
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,540
Let me ask you then.

695
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,120
Do you have feelings for Winter?

696
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,680
He might just be casually helping out.

697
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,950
It's like doing
the daily missions in the game.

698
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,550
Winter is a gaming genius.

699
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,950
And your favourite game

700
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,360
was designed by him.

701
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,680
Wouldn't you fall for
someone with so much talent?

702
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,710
Xiao Rui,

703
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,350
have you heard that
crazy gamer boys

704
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,670
only shower once a month

705
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,850
and have shiny, greasy hair?

706
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,830
No way.

707
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,470
Winter is a hot guy,

708
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,990
and definitely a very hot one.

709
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,250
If he's so mysterious,

710
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,250
it's possible that he's just

711
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,380
an emotionless pig that only lives online.

712
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,810
Who said you could
talk about my friend like that?

713
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,440
What about me?

714
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,550
You...

715
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,470
are my friend too.

716
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,270
Then let me ask you this.

717
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,180
If I fell into the sea with Winter,

718
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,490
who would you save?

719
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,020
I can't swim.

720
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,990
I'm saving neither.

721
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,240
Lend me your phone.

722
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,240
What do you want to do?

723
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,260
[Thanks, Winter.]

724
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,060
[I found the part for the DV.]

725
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,550
[I'll thank you in person]

726
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,950
[if I get the chance.]

727
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,980
Chu Xia doesn't sound like

728
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,280
she has feelings for Winter
other than being thankful.

729
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,070
As for meeting in person,

730
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,630
she's not going to get a chance.

731
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,130
What are you sneakily watching?

732
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,870
Watch... watching?

733
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,420
Don't move.

734
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,200
What were you watching?

735
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,650
Jin Xiao Rui.

736
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,720
A good relationship

737
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,400
would allow us to see each others' phones,

738
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,300
and we might not need
to see each other's phone.

739
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,410
But I think

740
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,010
I'll pick the former.

741
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,140
What do you think?

742
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,200
What would you choose?

743
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,460
There's nothing that I can't show you.

744
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,950
See, there's nothing there.

745
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,190
Good.

746
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,850
Why don't you see it later?

747
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,810
Not now.

748
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,350
You would have deleted
what needs to be deleted.

749
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,990
You think I'm dumb?

750
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
Yuan Yuan, this...

751
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,070
What's your password?

752
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,240
I... I've forgotten.

753
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Really...

754
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,660
[Lei Chu Xia: Thanks, Winter.
I've found the part for the DV.]

755
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,940
[I'll thank you in person
if I get the chance.]

756
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,120
Winter asked me
to settle things here.

757
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,230
I can't expose Winter's information,

758
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,280
but I think he's probably

759
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,670
better looking than Xu Xiao Dong.

760
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,170
[Jin Xiao Rui...]

761
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,750
Could he be Winter?

762
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,520
You're Winter?

763
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,930
I'm not.

764
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,910
-You have feelings for Chu Xia!
-I don't!

765
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,350
You have feelings for Chu Xia!

766
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,150
Go away.

767
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,420
You did so much for Chu Xia?

768
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,560
Did so much!

769
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,170
Trust me. I really don't
have feelings for Chu Xia.

770
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,370
How do you explain Winter?

771
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,290
How do you explain it?

772
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,440
Jin Xiao Rui, you liar!

773
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,320
Jin Xiao Rui, you're such a liar!

774
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,490
I won't believe you anymore.

775
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,120
-Yuan Yuan...
-You're a liar!

776
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,870
A liar you are!

777
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,420
I told you to wait a little longer.

778
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,380
Now we're exposed.

779
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,400
We can't let Chu Xia

780
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,350
know my identity yet.

781
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,920
There's more danger
if more people know about it.

782
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,460
What should I do with Yuan Yuan then?

783
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,300
She's going to ignore me!

784
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,470
I must come clean.

785
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,020
If you're my best friend,

786
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,990
you need to help me.

787
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,670
If you're my best friend then you
should tell her that you're Winter!

788
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,700
Xiao Dong,

789
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,210
please help me.

790
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,520
Yuan Yuan is going to ignore me.

791
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,480
What should I do?

792
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,130
Okay.

793
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,070
No, no, no.

794
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,760
No.

795
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,070
I...

796
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,980
Jin Xiao Rui!

797
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,840
No!

798
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,430
It's dangerous! Slow down.

799
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,760
So you are the real Winter.

800
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,780
Correct.

801
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,330
Winter is my actual identity.

802
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,740
But due to some unique reasons,

803
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,310
I had to cover my identity

804
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,890
with the identity of a game programmer.

805
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,040
But don't worry.

806
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,040
I won't hurt Chu Xia.

807
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,590
Then why did you tell me?

808
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,150
If I don't tell you,

809
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,490
I'm going to lose
Jin Xiao Rui as my brother.

810
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,420
He doesn't want you to misunderstand.

811
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,450
Yuan Yuan,

812
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,590
I hope that for now,

813
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,000
you won't tell Chu Xia yet.

814
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,880
I'll tell her personally

815
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,090
when the time is right.

816
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,820
I don't have to tell her now,

817
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,460
but when is it the right time?

818
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,450
When my place in Chu Xia's heart
overtakes

819
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,720
Winter's place.

820
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,190
I really don't understand
what you men

821
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,690
think about all day.

822
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,180
Okay,

823
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,540
I've come clean.

824
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,720
I hope you can help me keep this secret.

825
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
Thank you.

826
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,940
Good luck.

827
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,300
[Summer Time]

828
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,520
So Yuan Yuan,

829
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,770
please don't ignore me.

830
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,120
Let go.

831
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,120
No.

832
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,200
Are you going to let go?

833
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,390
Sit over there.

834
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,670
So based on what

835
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,130
Xu Xiao Dong said,

836
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,840
that car wasn't yours?

837
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,880
Well...

838
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,070
He doesn't drive it.

839
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,800
I just drive it for fun.

840
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,670
What about the watch?

841
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,790
Xiao Dong gave it to me.

842
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,530
I'm just a

843
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,820
common finance worker.

844
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,690
Why would you
keep pretending like

845
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,100
you come from money?

846
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,070
You can't hit me

847
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,490
if I tell the truth.

848
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,430
Tell me.

849
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,400
It was love at first sight

850
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,640
since the first time I saw you.

851
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,200
But you look

852
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,560
a lot more mature than I am.

853
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,340
I worried that you'd think I'm too young,

854
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,410
so I thought that

855
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,630
if I have money,

856
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,210
you probably wouldn't turn me down.

857
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,820
Really?

858
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,520
Yes.

859
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,880
I keep hearing people say

860
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,080
mature women

861
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,130
have seen a lot in life
and are very realistic.

862
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,240
So I thought a relationship
without stable financial grounds

863
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,340
will not last.

864
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,460
I'm acting all the time because

865
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,990
I want to sustain our love.

866
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,360
So in Jin Xiao Rui's Heart,

867
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,490
I've always been

868
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,150
a woman who just loves money?

869
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,370
Let me tell you,

870
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,370
I don't need that.

871
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,340
What era is this?

872
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,630
You think this is the past?

873
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,370
Women must rely on men?

874
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,050
Jin Xiao Rui,

875
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,520
I'm breaking up with you.

876
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,280
Hold on,

877
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,160
when were we officially together?

878
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,610
Why didn't you inform me?

879
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,360
That's not important.

880
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,320
We've broken up now.

881
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,780
Why am I just being informed

882
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,320
about a relationship and our breakup?

883
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,360
Wait for me.

884
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,500
[Summer Time]

885
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,910
What's going on with you and Jin Xiao Rui?

886
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,280
That Jin Xiao Rui...

887
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,320
He thinks I'm a woman

888
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,200
who is after fame and fortune.

889
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,150
Am I?

890
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:30,900
No.

891
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,320
And he

892
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,760
pretended to be tall, rich and handsome

893
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,030
in front of me.

894
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,360
Does he fit?

895
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,730
Which part of him is tall,

896
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,000
rich and handsome?

897
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,000
Xiao Dong, if you don't help me
get Yuan Yuan back,

898
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,210
I'll just stick to you
for the rest of my life.
