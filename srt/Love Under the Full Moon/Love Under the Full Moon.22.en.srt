What matters to him right now

is to prove Uncle Xu's innocence.

What about Professor Chen?

34
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
We can ask

35
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,570
for his help.

36
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,620
He would've told me if he knew.

37

Chu Xia, don't you remember?

45
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,710
Both of us made wishes

when we were kids.

47
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,340

72

no one could hurt you

73

about your physical condition?

83

Winter won't let you off the hook.

86

So it means

87

The sooner, the better.

101

Because of what?

102
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,050
Is it because of the figure?

103
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,039
Everything the toy shop's boss said

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
is a lie.

105

Come down and talk.

113
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,910
I never thought that you'd hide it so well.

114
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,230
If I knew Xu Wei Yi's son

115
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,060
was a genius from the start,

116
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
Zhao Yao Yang would've joined forces

117
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,390
with me to stop you.

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,780
We would never

119
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,630
give you a chance to grow.

120
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,710
I don't suppose then

121
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,640
The Great Winter would've existed

122
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
in this world.

123
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
You wouldn't have had such great power

124
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,080
to affect my business

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,810
and my Family First app, either.

126
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,690
Your Family First?

127
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,970
I remember the year that my dad passed away.

128
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,330
I always felt like someone was spying on me.

129
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,320
There is no proof for that

130
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,670
but this vigilance of instinct

131
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,950
has been reminding me

132
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
to learn

133
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,310
to hide myself

134
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,000
and to live an average life

135
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,090
until such feeling slowly disappeared.

136
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,070

137
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,350

141
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,660
Xu Xiao Dong,

142
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
don't be so sure about it.

143
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,510
You should give yourself a little leeway

144
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,060
to beg me in the future.

145

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,750
She went out.

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,950
Wei Xuan He,

159
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,330
where did you take Chu Xia?

160
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,120
You have my contact number, right?

161
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,240
Feel free to contact me.

162
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,190
Chu Xia.

163
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,600
Why are you here?

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,120
I knew I'd find you here.

165
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,790
Your game fan meeting

166
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,920
was a success, right?

167
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,360
You must be very happy

168
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
to meet those players who are

169
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,660
in sync with you, right?

170
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,820
And this afternoon,

171
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,450
Yuan Yuan told me

172
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,910
that we agreed to be

173
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,150
the coolest old ladies

174
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,350
when we grow old.

175
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,790
It's unbelievable.

176
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,780
What do you think?

177
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,300
Professor Chen,

178
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,990
isn't there any other way?

179
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,830
I'm willing to do anything if it could

180
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,340
stop Chu Xia from disappearing.

181
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,380
Professor Chen.

182
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,270
Xiao Dong,

183
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,560
Professor Chen has done his best.

184
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,330
There's a way.

185
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,630
Theoretically speaking.

186
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,030
Chu Xia

187
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,910
can only exist with the energy

188
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,660
of the gravitational wave

189
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,910
a decade later.

190
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,310
What if she returns to

191
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,240
where she lived a decade ago?

192
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,030
She won't need the energy anymore.

193
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,060
She can live like a normal person.

194
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,140
Meaning that

195
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
if you could fix that machine,

196
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,760
Chu Xia will be fine

197
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,510
as she can return to ten years ago.

198
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,640
But the key is I couldn't fix that machine.

199
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,200
I've tried it

200
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,410
umpteen times,

201
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,820
still I couldn't fix it.

202
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:37,930
Wang Yi Xin

203
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,230
is a madman,

204
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,410
but I must admit

205
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,610
that he is a genius.

206
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,100
If we could obtain

207
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,600
Wang Yi Xin's experimental materials,

208
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,030
do you have confidence in fixing it?

209
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,870
I'm sure I can fix the machine

210
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,180
if you could obtain the materials.

211
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
Xiao Dong,

212
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,370
my central computer

213
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,550
keeps breaking down.

214
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,880
It affects my productivity.

215
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,310
Aren't you a computer genius?

216
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,220
Check it for me.

217
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,390
Sure.

218
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,090
This way.

219
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,300
Gao Liang!

220
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,360
Gao Liang!

221
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,900
Take Xiao Dong to check on the computer.

222
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,700
Okay.

223
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,430
Professor, is there something
you want to tell me?

224
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,980
Chu Xia,

225
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,990
I wonder if you've thought about this.

226
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,870
If

227
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,420
you successfully return to ten years ago,

228
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,200
you might need to face

229
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,910
Wei Xuan He

230
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,400
on the night

231
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,500
of November 18th.

232
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
And

233
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,420
the gravitational wave ten years ago

234
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,710
will once again send you to ten years later.

235
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,870
You'll once again meet Xiao Dong,

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,300
fall in love with him

237
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,870
and the gravitational wave ten years later

238
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,390
will still disappear.

239
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,550
And...

240
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,590
I'll return to the past again

241
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,320
and go through November 18th.

242
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,790
It's an infinite loop.

243
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,630
Just like

244
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,720
the path integral theory
proposed by Feynman, the physicist.

245
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,580
The time particles

246
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,120
will be cyclical in the closed-loop

247
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
of time and space.

248
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,540
It will never end.

249
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,960
You can intuitively understand it

250
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,550
as the Mobius strip.

251
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,230
Meaning that

252
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,720
I could never stop Wei Xuan He no matter

253
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,060
how many times I return to the past.

254
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,460
Because the history can never be changed.

255
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,920
Xiao Dong will still have to experience

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,150
the pain of his dad's death

257
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,960
and his painful personal growth.

258
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,000
And there's nothing I can do

259
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,270
except staying with him.

260
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,960
But your appearance

261
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,470
has brought sunshine

262
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,960
into Xiao Dong's life.

263
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,190
Xiao Dong has the courage

264
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,420
to face everything

265
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,640
because of your love and accompany.

266
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,110
As we could encounter and fall in love

267
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,670
countless times,

268
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,200
I think it's worthwhile even if we experience

269
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,550
the anomalies of the universe.

270
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,550
But I think

271
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
there might be another possibility.

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,070
Do you know about
the "many-worlds interpretation"?

273
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,680
Many-worlds interpretation

274
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,590
was mentioned in Everett's thesis

275
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,160
in the year 1957.

276
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,440
It is also known as the parallel world.

277
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,380
Parallel world?

278
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,160
Yes.

279
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
If you return

280
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,310
to November 18th of ten years ago,

281
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
you only get back to that moment

282
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,350
but it might not
be that original world of yours.

283
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,830
Maybe it is another parallel world.

284
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,390
If that happens,

285
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,660
you'll have different choices.

286
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,490
But every choice you make

287
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,220
will lead to different results.

288
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,590
But Chu Xia,

289
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,880
you have to remember this.

290
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,810
Eventually, you'll have to face

291
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,550
the destined decision.

292
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,790
[Chu Xia,]

293
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,120
[this is the destined decision]

294
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,030
[you have to face.]

295
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,390
Chu Xia.

296
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,120
Chu Xia.

297
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,540
What's wrong?

298
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,030
You seem preoccupied

299
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,420
after coming out from 415 Lab.

300
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,710
Did Professor Chen tell you something?

301
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,370
No.

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
Just that I've had some rough days.

303
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,820
I'm a bit tired.

304
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,210
You're right.

305
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,020
Don't worry.

306
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
I'll sort that lot out

307
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,320
as soon as possible.

308
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,820
[Summer Time]

309
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,240
Chu Xia.

310
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,410
I have a very important

311
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,920
announcement.

312
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,270
Important announcement?

313
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,000
What is it?

314
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,260
We are going to get married.

315
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,260
This...

316
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,240
is so sudden.

317
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,750
So that we could fulfil

318
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,430
a little wish before we become

319
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,140
the cool old ladies.

320
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,250
Have you

321
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,830
proposed to her?

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,070
Have you decided the time?

323
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,060
What about the location?

324
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,790
We're too excited that
we haven't decided anything.

325
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,400
But I'm planning it.

326
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,070
I'll give Yuan Yuan

327
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,530
a proper wedding proposal.

328
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,130
Isn't it too late for that?

329
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,510
A humble-brag

330
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,110
and a narcissist

331
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,110
like Yuan Yuan,

332
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,280
she wishes to have

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,310
a romantic proposal

334
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,350
and dream-like wedding.

335
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,030
-No, don't talk nonsense.
-You do.

336
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,350
Plan it well.

337
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,680
Do not let Yuan Yuan's next husband

338
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,560
to realise it for her.

339
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,920
What do you mean?

340
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
I'm the only husband she has.

341
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,530
I'll promise you a happy life.

342
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,110
Trust me.

343
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,460
What about you?

344
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,870
Will you still marry him

345
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,420
if it isn't for our original plan?

346
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,260
I will.

347
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,060
Me too.

348

00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,560
Don't worry.

517
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,270
I'll try my best.

518
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,350
Thank you, Professor Chen.

519
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,480
I knew you'd be here.

520
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,310
Why did you do this?

521
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,750
What deal have you made

522
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,920
with Wei Xuan He for me?

523
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:13,950
Excuse me.

524
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,400
What's that in Professor Chen's hands?

525
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,890
I don't know.

526
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,370
Maybe it's a research project.

527
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,590
Wei Xuan He is not Winter.

528
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,640
Why did you hand

529
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,810
your other self over to him?

530
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm not Winter.

531
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,610
I found it odd.

532
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,720
Why would an unemployed programmer

533
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,450
have such a mysterious workshop?

534
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,310
Why would a friend in the virtual world

535
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
appear in the real world

536
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,390
every time when I need help?

537
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,240
This is not coincidence.

538
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,560
It's because there's a man

539
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,440
who has been watching over me

540
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
and helping me.

541
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,750
It doesn't matter if you admit it.

542
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,910
Anyway, I already have the answer I need.

543
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,000
Let's get the title of Winter back, okay?

544
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,490
Chu Xia,

545
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,010
I have only one thought now.

546
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,510
I just want you to be safe.

547
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,790
But I don't want you

548
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,490
to make all the sacrifices for me.

549
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Chu... Chu Xia.

550
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,790
Please register in advance
as you want to see Mr. Wei.

551
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,850
Wei Xuan He.

552
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,660
Security, stop her!

553
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,640
Do not let her pester Mr. Wei!

554
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,920
Hang on!

555
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,240
[I knew you wouldn't dare]

556
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,550
[to face me in a dignified manner.]

557
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,960
[This is the only way I can do.]

558
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,420
Please hold on.

559
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,640
Mr. Wei will be right with you.

560
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,220
Thank you.

561
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,220
Enjoy your tea.

562
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,130
Uncle Wei, it's been a long time.

563
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,550
Lei Chu Xia?

564
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,190
Are you all right?

565
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,860
Have a seat.

566
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,190
I can't believe

567
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,460
that Xuan He

568
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,280
made so many mistakes these past years.

569
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,949
I knew you haven't been well.

570
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,670
So I didn't want to disturb you.

571
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,350
But the problem now

572
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,870
is that things are getting out of control.

573
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,070
Family First has become a major threat

574
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,040
to the users' safety.

575
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,840
So...

576
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,760
I think only you can stop him.

577
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,659
I promise you

578
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,610
that I'll talk to him.

579
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,840
Thank you.

580
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,750
I'm counting on you.

581
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,310
Chu Xia.

582
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,190
As I opposed

583
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,840
the marriage between Xuan He and you,

584
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,800
I always felt guilty about it during this decade

585
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,510
when you went missing.

586
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,780
Don't worry about that.

587
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,280
I can't believe I'd done

588
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,110
many indecorous things that time.

589
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,840
I'd like to apologise.

590
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,710
I'm also sorry

591
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,590
that things didn't work out

592
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,000
between you and Xuan He.

593
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,740
Uncle Wei,

594
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,590
you don't have to worry about it.

595
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't think

596
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,570
it's regrettable.

597
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,230
Anyway,

598
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,800
everything happens for a reason.

599
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,730
I'll be going now.

600
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,490
I've got some important business
to take care of.

601
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,970
Important business?

602
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,500
[Bing County Part]

603
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,510
I've got to go out later.

604
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,570
Complete the tasks

605
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,100
at hand which should be done.

606
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,960
Do not do other things.

607
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,050
Do you hear me?

608
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,310
Do your job.

609
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,500
It's been a long time

610
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,880
since I played Battle of the Saints.

611
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,840
Right.

612
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,780
I can't believe
Battle of the Saints has started charging.

613
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,650
Winter said it was permanent free.

614
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,490
Right.

615
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,800
The way he plays has also changed.

616
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,800
He's started to kill new players.

617
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,070
Don't you think Winter

618
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,650
is literally a different person now?

619
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,020
He used to care a lot

620
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,560
about the fairness and morality
of the gaming world.

621
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,660
He was my idol.

622
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,510
Your idol has ruined his public image.

623
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,960
Our room has collapsed.

624
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,920
I'm sure he is not the Winter I knew.

625
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,310
I'm tired of playing games.

626
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,070
Lone Wolves Alliance.

627
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,460
Cousin, why are you here?

628
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,450
I need your help.

629
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,310
Sure.

630
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
Lone Wolves Alliance is always available.

631
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,130
Let's go.

632
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,970
Sure.

633
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,400
Where are you going?

634
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,700
You even try to ditch work.

635
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,140
How dare you?

636
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,960
Brother Sui,

637
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,770
I have a favour to ask you.

638
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,630
It's you again.

639
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,670
Just say it.

640
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,140
If you do me

641
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,700
this favour, you'll get my silence

642
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,270
about the fact that
Xu Xiao Dong helped you.

643
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,150
If you don't,

644
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,140
I'm not too sure

645
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,220
if I'd spill the beans.

646
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,320
Are you eavesdropping?
Three of you, turn around!

647
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,280
Young lady,

648
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,230
why are you so immature?

649
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,550
You even threaten me?

650
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,510
How would I dare to threaten you?

651
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,480
Going to the engineering department
for coordination, right?

652
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,790
Right?

653
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,070
Yes.

654
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,550
Make it quick.

655
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,980
We still have a lot of work to do.

656
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,280
Let's go.

657
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,070
What are you looking at? Do your job.

658
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,570
So this Winter

659
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,270
is not the real Winter.

660
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,730
That's great.

661
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,780
Winter hasn't changed.

662
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,440
It's only a false alarm.

663
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,480
Does it mean that

664
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
I can use my game skin?

665
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,630
And the game is free to play again.

666
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,790
My baby is back too.

667
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,710
It's back.

668
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,420
We can play the game again.

669
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,140
Hang on.

670
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,400
The focus now

671
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
is that cousin hopes we could help

672
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,580
to maintain the gaming world

673
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,320
and wait for the real Winter to come back.

674
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,620
No.

675
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,920
Shouldn't the focus

676
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,270
be on the fact that

677
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
cousin knows Winter

678
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,660
and they're actually good friends?

679
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,280
Maybe we're

680
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,390
more than just good friends.

681
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,710
What?

682
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,280
He's toast.

683
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,210
Xiao Dong's opponent is too strong.

684
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,390
Cousin,

685
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,530
come to your senses.

686
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,060
Xiao Dong is still there for you.

687
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,270
Cousin,

688
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,720
can I meet Winter?

689
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,990
Here you go again.

690
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,610
What about the steadfast brotherhood

691
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,920
between us and Brother Dong?

692
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,670
You only have eyes for idol instead of brothers.

693
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,840
Well, I can do that.

694
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,800
Then, count us in.

695
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,440
Didn't you talk about

696
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,560
the steadfast brotherhood?

697
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,560
Anyway, for Winter,

698
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,920
we'll fight!

699
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,100
Lone Wolves Alliance.

700
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,400
Easy.

701
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,840
You two hit too hard!

702
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,280
-It hurts!
-Easy!

703
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,890
Both of you are very annoying!

704
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,770
How childish!

705
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,770
Let's go!

706
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,630
-We can do it!
-Go, go, go!

707
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,800
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

708
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,430
We can do it!

709
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,300
[Turn back]

710
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,850
Dad,

711
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,300
what did you need to see me about?

712
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,800
You still have the audacity to call me?

713
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,570
Let me ask you.

714
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,760
What's wrong with the Family First app?

715
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,960
Did you do

716
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,760
something shameful?

717
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,880
You've disgraced and

718
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,380
humiliated the Wei family!

719
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,740
Xuan He,

720
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,800
you don't deserve to be my,

721
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,720
Wei Guo Peng's son!

722
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,280
Get lost!

723
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,490
Fine.

724
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,510
I don't want to be

725
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,080
Wei Guo Peng's son, either.

726
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,920
Because you've never

727
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,650
cared about me.

728
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,110
I've never had

729
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,820
my father's love since childhood!

730
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,940
Do you know how long

731
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,190
it took me to set up Family First?

732
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,650
Do you know how many

733
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,130
days and nights I've spent for this?

734
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,710
Do you know how many

735
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,940
versions I've created to test run?

736
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,120
You don't know about that.

737
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,790
Because you never

738
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,150
tried to understand me.

739
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,960
Because all you care about are

740
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,510
the dignity of this family

741
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,210
and your own prestige.

742
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,800
I've already downloaded

743
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,850
Family First on your phone.

744
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,590
I guess you've never opened it.
