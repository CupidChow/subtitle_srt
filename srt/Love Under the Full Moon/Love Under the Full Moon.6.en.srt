Did you find back any memories?

95
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,980
He was quite interested in my memories

96
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,420
but I somehow didn't find a sense of familiarity in him.

97
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,659
You said that I was quite close with him, right?

98
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,140
You were indeed quite close with him.

99
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,300
After you went missing,

100
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,100
he looked for you like crazy.

101
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,220
Though he claimed that he couldn't live without you,

102
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,980
I think that he was just paying lip services.

103
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,260
It has been ten years.

104
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,220
It's such a long time

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,580
but I had never seen him

106
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,020
took care of your parents.

107
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,940
I had also never seen him

108
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,540

109
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,300
What does that mean?

110
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,580
What does that mean?

111
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,940
It shows that Wei Xuan He

112
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,140

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,820
now that you are back,

It was so popular back then.

128
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,059
It's all because of your signature dessert,

Summer's Kiss.

130
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,060
Now I remember.

131
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,540
One day before you went missing,

132
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,140
you made a Summer's Kiss.

133
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,540
You put it there.

134
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,380
Then, you left the store.

135
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,300
You told me

136
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,860
it's reserved by an important customer.

137
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,060
He would come and pick it up.

138
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,460
Then, you left the store.

139
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,500
But I waited for him for the whole day.

140
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,100
No one came to pick it up.

141
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,620
Did my disappearance have something to do
with that customer?

142
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,980
That could be.

143
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,300
Our priority

144
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,980
is to reopen the store.

145
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,780

the answer that we are looking for lies in it.

That's right.

150
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,620
However, we need fund to reopen the store.

151

155
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420

156
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,740
I don't have money.

157
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,740
The rest...

158

195
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,420

198

[You have received 500,000 yuan]
That's too much.

199

You know him, right?

203
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,260
Return the money to him.

204
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
You can't do so.

205
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,820
I don't really know Winter.

206

the business of his company.

208
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,740
Furthermore, once Winter has made up his mind,

209
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,260
without his authority,

210
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,060
I can't undo it.

211
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,660
Winter has a message for you.

212
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,340
He said, "Bravery is more valuable than money."

213
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,700
He hopes that you will accept his encouragement
that isn't worth a penny.

214
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,980
He thinks that the encouragement isn't worth a penny?

You just can't wait longer.

344
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,980
Of course.

345
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,780
I got you a hand-phone.

346
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,300
I am the emergency contact,

347
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,220
guardian

348
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
and my credit card is linked to the phone.

349
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,460
Turning's subsystem has been installed too.

350
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,260
Your phone is connected to my phone.

351
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,860
When emergency arises,

352
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,580
it will show our respective location

353
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,980
and the special contact.

354
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,540
Of course, just in case,

355
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,060
I hope you can memorise

356
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,820
my hand-phone number.

357
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,300
I have memorised it a long time ago.

358
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,540
What else do you want to tell me?

359
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,700
That's all.

360
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,420
All right, I'm going to cross the road.

361
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,220
Don't you think something is missing?

362
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,140
Thank you.

363
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,660
You are not being sincere.

364
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,940
I had to remind you about that.

365
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,340
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

366
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,580
Fine.

367
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,220
Be careful.

368
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,940
I'm leaving.

369
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,300
-Bye.   -Bye.

370
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,900

371
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,020
[Finally I'm leaving him.]

[Are you going to keep me forever?]

376
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,580
[I will try to get rid of you, troublemaker.]

[Finally he has get ridden of me, the troublemaker.]

Let me take you to a place

385
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,340

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,980
Yes.

400
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,620
Director Wei.

401
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,780
You said that we are here to find my memories?

402
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,740
Yes.

403
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,740
But I didn't expect that

404
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,540
the pier has been deserted.

405
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,540
We have a deal, right?

406
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,500
Call me Xuan He.

407
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,140
What should we do?

408
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,940
How do we go in?

409
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,380
Come on.

410
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,820
What are you doing?

411
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,100
Have you forgotten?

412
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,140
I learned this from you.

413
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,820
When we were late to school

414
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,420
and were stuck at the entrance,

415
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,020
you taught me to climb over the wall.

416
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,020
Now, it's my turn to be your teacher.

417
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,140
Give me your hand.

418
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,260
I'm good.

419
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,700
Are you coming down?

420
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,740
It's okay.

421
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,180
Let's go.

422
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,780
Did we come here often?

423
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,460
Yes.

424
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,060
It's almost time. Listen closely.

425
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,100
What is it?

426
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,900
Listen to it.

427
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,300
It's ship whistle.

428
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,340
The ship whistle goes well with the waves.

429
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,700
It gives me a sense of calmness.

430
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,980
Were we here to listen to the ship whistle in the past?

431
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,060
Yes.

432
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,420
You brought me here.

433
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,900

Xuan He,

466
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,980
I'll do anything

467
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
for you.

468
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,300
So will I.

469
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,140
You look so pretty.

470
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,380
Show it to me.

471
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,420
No way.

472
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,140
Ever since we got together,

473
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,940
every year, you recorded a video

474
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,860
but you wouldn't show it to me.

475
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,180
This is the video I recorded.

476
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,220
In the past ten years,

477
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,180
I came here once in a while.

478
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,580
I would spend time here alone.

479

When I missed you,

480
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,300
I would watch the video.

481
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,260
It felt as if you were by my side.

482
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,060
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,060
Everything that you said

484
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,340
is not part of my memories.

485
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,100
I don't remember you.

486

I don't remember Yuan Yuan.

487

I don't remember my parents.

I don't remember anything.

489
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,980
I even suspect

490
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,780
if the me in your mind

491
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,980
is the real me.

492
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,540
Chu Xia.

493
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,220
Just like what you said before,

494
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,260
love and pain are inseparable.

495
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,380
As long as we can grow together,

496
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,340
I love you

497
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,020
and I'm willing to bear the pain with you.

498
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,300
What you have forgotten,

499
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,980
I'm willing to remember it for you.

500
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,220
No matter how many times it happens,

501
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,980
bear it in mind,

502
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,500
Lei Chu Xia's love for Wei Xuan He lasts forever.

503
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,900
The same goes to Wei Xuan He.

504
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,740
Just give me a chance.

505
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,380
We can go back to the past

506
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,620
as if

507
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,980
nothing has happened.

508
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,370
[Yuan Yuan]

509
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,740
Wei Xuan He loves only himself.

510

Let's go back.

511
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,340
You are on the wrong way.

512
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,660
I know that. You don't have to remind me.

513
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,300
Why do I feel that someone

514
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,700
is troubled?

515
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,900
I'm fine.

516
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,300
Is it?

517
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,260
Finally you got rid of Lei Chu Xia, the troublemaker.

518
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

519
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,300
Yes, I'm happy.

520
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,740
Of course I'm happy.

521
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,660
That's right.

522
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm happy when you're happy.

523
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,060
Yuan Yuan told me that

524
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,420
tonight

525
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,020
she is going to throw Chu Xia

526
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,620
a welcome home party.

527
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,700
I wonder if someone keens to join the party.

528
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,300
Of course, why not?

529
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,980
No.

530
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,540
When did you become Yuan Yuan's friend on WeChat?

531
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,100
This is love.

532
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,820
It's more like harassment.

533
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,900
What do you know?

534
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,540
Let's wait for a minute.

535
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,140
Chu Xia said that she will be here soon.

536
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,140
Chu Xia went out with someone?

537
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,780
She seems happier when she's not by your side.

538
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
You are so articulate.

539
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,620
I need to tend to the lamps.

540
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,340
Help her with the candles.

541
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,740
Yuan Yuan.

542
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,140
It's getting late. Why don't we start early?

543
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,820
What is worth celebrating between us?

544
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,180
What is worth celebrating?

545
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,060
It's to celebrate the first 24 hours we met each other.

546
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,020
Let me see.

547
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,580
If something is wrong with your eyes,

548
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,740
you should consult a doctor before it's too late.

549
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,060
Where did you learn this mushy pose?

550
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,460
It's not mushy!

551
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,060
Nowadays, all the idols are doing this.

552
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,940
This is the ultimate move.

553
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,660
Wink.

554
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,780
All the idols are doing this?

555
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,460
Do you know

556
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,300
what is the difference
between illustration and actual product?

557
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,580
What is the difference?

558
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,940
Come here, let me tell you.

559
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,340
The difference lies in your appearance.

560
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,700
I'm quite good looking.

561
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,780
All right, rest early.

562
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,620
Sure.

563
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,740
I'll get going.

564
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,380
Okay, see you again.

565
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,500
The decoration is impressive.

566
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,420
Chu Xia.

567
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,300
Finally you are back.

568
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,940
We decorated this place to welcome you.

569
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,580
Isn't it beautiful?

570
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,100
I have something important to ask you.

571
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,940
Ask away.

572
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,260
You went out with Wei Xuan He alone today.

573
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,620
Did you recall anything?

574
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,420
Don't tell me

575
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,660
you got back together with him.

576
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,980
No, that's not true.

577
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,100
It's nothing like what you think.

578
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,820
I didn't recall anything.

579
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,060

580
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,180
if you can't recollect the past,

581
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,220
then you should stop thinking about it.

582
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,940
Don't go near Wei Xuan He.

583
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,700
After all,

584
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,140
it's been so many years since you last saw him.

585
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,460
You haven't changed a bit but he has changed.

586
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
Why don't you start all over again?

587
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,220
Will you pick it up?

588
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,460
I think that fellow is not bad.

You dropped it on your own. Come down!

592
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340

00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,580
[It's too early. No morning news is available.]

682
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,030
[Receipt]

683
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,900
Thank you.

684
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,980
It's okay.

685
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,980
Please deliver it to the store.

686
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,300
Fine.

687
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,420
I'll do it on my own.

688
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,140
It's just a few sacks of flour.

689
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,060
[Summer Time]

690
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,580
Pretty lady,

691
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,260
may I offer my service

692
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,700
to get you up?

693
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,980
Thank you.

694
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
Goodness.

695
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,620
It's five in the morning.

696
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,860
What are you doing at our store

697
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,380
dressing like that?

698
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,300
Regardless of the attire,

699
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm always at your command.

700
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,420
After all,

701
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,460
your hands are so soft.

702
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Those hands are meant to hold bouquets.

703
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,020
My strong arms

704
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,260
are meant to carry the pretty lady.

705
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
I mean, the pretty lady's flour.

706
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Thank you in advance for your help.

707
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,900
Bring them in.

708
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,700
Yuan Yuan.

709
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,380
My body is full of flour.

710
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Can you clean it up for me?

711
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,740
You just have to dust it away.

712
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,700
No cleaning is needed.

713
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,980
That's because

714
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,460
I want

715
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
to give you a clean heart.

716
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,620
My goodness.

717
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,140
Will you be careful?

718
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,060
You are bumping into things.

719
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,020
I...

720
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
What did I bump into?

721
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,340
You...

722
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,260
You bumped into my heart.

723
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,740
Young boy,

724
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,140
heed my advice.

725
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,580
Don't waste your time on me.

726
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm not interested in a younger man.
