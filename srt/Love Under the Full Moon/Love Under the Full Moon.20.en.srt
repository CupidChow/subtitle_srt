Turing,

5
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,940
initiate turbo mode.

6
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,500
Confirming.

7
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,440
Administrator authorization required

8
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,480
for turbo mode.

9
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,280
So what I usually see

10
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
was just part of it?

11
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,860
Yes.

12
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,300
We need to go all out

13
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,660
to work against Wei Xuan He.

14
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,420
Would your friend agree to this?

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,380
Which friend?

16
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,340
Didn't you say that this work place

17
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,220
belongs to your friend?

18
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,540
Yes, it does.

19
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,280
I don't see your friend coming over.

20
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,320
He's overseas.

21
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,500
So you're in charge

22
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,740
of this work space?

23
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,940
Sort... sort of.

24
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,180
But there's one thing

25
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,180
that I find odd.

26
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,140
What is it?

27
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,820
You said that your dad is a genius,

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,780
but you...

29
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,250
Why do you seem

30
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
so average?

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,160
I'm actually quite good.

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,970
Okay, Chu Xia,

33
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,980
I need to start working.

34
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,180
I can't send you to Summer Time today.

35
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,220
Okay.

36
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,780
I'll pick you up in the evening.

37
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,660
Okay.

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,680
You're back again.

39
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:12,980
It seems that this universe

40
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,270
really favours you.

41
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,060
But I have to deal with you every time I'm back.

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480
I don't know if the universe is favouring me

43
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,980
or punishing me.

44
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,250
What do you mean?

45
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,540
I know

46
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,900
the whole truth.

47
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,100
That includes the patent certificate

48
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,700
and Gu Xiao Qi.

49
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,659
The document

50
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,220
that you tried so hard to find at my place

51
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,420
was Xu Wei Yi's patent certificate, right?

52
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,100
Why are you here to ruin things every time

53
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,460
I'm close to success?

54
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
There's a thin line
between success and over-confidence.

55
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,660
That's not important.

56
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,700
I just want to tell you that

57
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,060
from now on

58
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,860
I won't believe 

59
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,730
anything you say.

60
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,420
Nana,

61
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,270
Nana,

62
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,230
wait for me.

63
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,380
Wait for me,

64
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,420
Nana.

65

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,220
Yes, Xiao Dong?

67
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,340
I asked you to monitor
the interviews of Family First.

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,620
Have you done it?

69
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,620
Yes,

70
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,409
Xiao Dong.

71
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,300
Good.

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,900
Go collect

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,620
all information regarding user experience

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,659
and run a full analysis for me.

75
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,540
Yes, Xiao Dong.

76
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,860
I'll do it when I have Nana.

77
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,690
You're a robot.

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,330
Do you have experience with love?

79
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,820
I have time anyway.

80
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,330
Wang Yi Xin

81
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,780
deliberately

82
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,820
wanted to return to ten years ago.

83
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
I didn't expect

84
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,900
Chu Xia to return.

85
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,260
Sometimes I'm just in awe

86
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,580
of how magical fate can be.

87
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,770
Haven't you always believed in science

88
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,370
and don't believe in fate?

89
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,190
There are a lot of things

90
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,940
that can't be explained

91
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,100

Many people who love each other
never got to meet again.

Only love

96
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,080
can break through the constraints of time

97
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,560

everything I said.

108
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,620
Wei Wei,

109
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,380
I'm an astrophysicist.

110
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,020
I spend time with stars every day.

111
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,409
But all this while

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,520
I've been feeling lonely.

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,020
I feel that none of these stars

114
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,580
belong to me.

115
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,330
I haven't found the star

116
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
that could be mine.

117
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,150
But now...

118
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,980
Now,

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
I think I've found it.

120
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,220
This star is so close to you.

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,840
Aren't you afraid that you'll get burned?

122
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,120
Would you

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,640
draw stars and pray

124
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,169
for me every day?

125
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,950
I would

126
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,010
draw a star on my hand every day

127
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,210
and pray for you.

128
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,460
This picture is so ugly.

129
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,660
Do you know how rarely

130
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,060
we get to spend time together?

131
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,980
You love Summer Time

132
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,220
more than me now.

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,740
What?

134
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,540
Are you trying to

135
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,070
complain that

136
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,370
working hard to earn money is wrong?

137
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,140
No.

138
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,430
I wasn't complaining.

139
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,190
I'm earning money too.

140
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,570
But I have Xiao Dong

141
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,130
as Winter helping me.

142
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,870
Since you mentioned Winter,

143
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,260
are Chu Xia and Xiao Dong

144
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,790
officially together?

145
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,150
So when does Xiao Dong plan

146
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,590
to tell Chu Xia that

147
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,470
he's actually Winter?

148
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,800
Has he thought about

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
how Chu Xia would react if

150
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
she finds out he's Winter?

151
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,440
What would happen?

152
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,620
She's going to be very angry.

153
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,450
In the beginning, only I know

154
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,490
that Xiao Dong is Winter.

155
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,340
But too much happened

156
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,870
in this month.

157
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,150
Xiao Dong is probably not ready yet.

158
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,290
That's true.

159
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,380
Never mind.

160
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,180
Anyway,

161
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,460
she'll find out one day.

162
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,750
I've gotten a chair

163
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,830
to wait for the day it happens

164
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,350
and have some popcorn.

165
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,330
Imagine how the whole

166
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,770
scene would be like.

167
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,730
There'll be shock and happiness.

168
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,140
Yuan Yuan,

169
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,500
since we're out,

170
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,550
can we stop talking about
someone else's love?

171
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,430
Can we talk about ours instead?

172
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,580
Sure.

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,940
What do you want to talk about?

174
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,710
I want to bring you somewhere.

175
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,960
Where?

176
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,510
My other world

177
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,070
after you.

178
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,320
Yuan Yuan,

179
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,340
this is my world

180
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,820
after you.

181
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,220
Say hi to each other.

182
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,010
My two worlds

183
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,620
will be acquainted then.

184
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,260
Say hi to them?

185
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,590
Would they answer if I call them?

186
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,900
They might.

187
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,110
This is so cute.

188
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,190
Hi, boss.

189
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,380
Xiao Rui.

190
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,100
Boss.

191
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,740
The merchandise you ordered has arrived.

192
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,900
I've kept it for you.

193
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,740
Thank you.

194
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,620
Shop around.

195
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,660
Okay.

196
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,170
You know this shop well.

197
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,270
Of course.

198
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,830
This is my home.

199
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,870
I contributed to

200
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,060
each brick and tile here.

201
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,990
Really?

202
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,920
This is so cute.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
Yuan Yuan,

204
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,890
I brought you here to see this

205
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,500
limited edition figuring.

206
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,700
Look at the outfit

207
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,500
and the character's colours.

208
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,740
Isn't it magnificent?

209
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,100
The price

210
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,830
is very magnificent too.

211
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,430
It's alright.

212
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,900
It's too expensive.

213
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,340
Can they move?

214
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:17,980
Never mind it.

215
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,460
Here, see this.

216
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,910
Do you know

217
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,050
how meaningful these two

218
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,340
figurines are to us?

219
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,190
Are you sure?

220
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,230
I don't even know who he is.

221
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,300
Very sure.

222
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,070
The day it launched

223
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,710
was the day we first met.

224
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
And this one,

225
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,190
the day it was launched

226
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,980
was the day of our first date.

227
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,700
Jin Xiao Rui,

228
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,060
you're remembering

229
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,730
our special days this way?

230
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,660
Yes.

231
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,340
It's the perfect combination of

232
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,480
the second and third dimension.

233
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,640
Aren't I smart?

234
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,410
Yes, yes, you're the most brilliant.

235
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,300
Yuan Yuan, what is this?

236
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,940
What?

237
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,430
These are joint tarot cards.

238
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,180
I have to get it.

239
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,030
I think you want to get your hands chopped off.

240
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,990
Give it to me.

241
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,810
A silly set of card like this

242
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,660
being sold at such a high price. That's crazy.

243
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,700
Not buying it.

244
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,270
Yuan Yuan,

245
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,070
this merchandise has hit me

246
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,510
square in the heart.

247
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,810
Hit?

248
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,070
Come here.

249
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,950
Stand here.

250
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,150
Okay.

251
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,340
I've put

252
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,820
a bullet-proof vest on you.

253
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,540
You won't be hit anymore.

254
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,540
Let's go.

255
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,020
Then I want this.

256
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,600
What is this?

257
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,810
This is the viral

258
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,370
love token of anime characters.

259
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,490
A treasure from,
"Even though the wind is strong,

260
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
I'll meet you if I smile".

261
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,060
The "Eternal Love Crystal Ball".

262
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,380
Can I have it?

263
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,340
Say that again.

264
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,460
I didn't catch that.

265
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,890
What is it called?

266
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,290
It's the hottest item this year.

267
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,520
If I get it...

268
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,280
Xiao Rui,

269
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,560
you have great taste.

270
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,320
This crystal ball is really amazing.

271
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,370
It can make your love last

272
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,540
forever and ever.

273
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,930
Since you're a loyal customer,

274
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,740
I'll give you a discount.

275
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,580
Okay.

276
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,700
What do you mean okay?

277
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,220
This thing costs

278
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,580
at most 30 RMB.

279
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,700
Just because you gave it

280
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,700
a very long name,

281
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,220
the price is now that?

282
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,820
The crystal ball works.

283
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,430
The crystal ball is telling me

284
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,660
that your love

285
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,300
will bloom and bear fruit this year.

286
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,190
That's great!

287
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm buying it.

288
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,660
Great.

289
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
What do you mean great?

290
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,020
You're so easily cheated.

291
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,260
There are 365 days in a year.

292
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,940
Boss,

293
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,980
when is my love with Yuan Yuan
going to bloom

294
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,940
and bear fruit?

295
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,980
That would depend on your card reading.

296
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,260
Card reading?

297
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,140
Xiao Rui, pick one.

298
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,490
Okay.

299
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,140
This one.

300
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,780
The wheel of fortune.

301
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,900
Number ten.

302
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
It means that you'll get married

303
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,420
in ten days.

304
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,900
What?

305
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,140
That's impossible.

306
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,260
Totally impossible.

307
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,350
Oh...

308
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
I'm buying it.

309
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,660
I'm buying this set of cards.

310
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,700
Great!

311
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,820
Tsk.

312
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,540
You believe this?

313
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,070
I do.

314
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,780
I believe everything that's a blessing

315
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,740
for you and me.

316
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,660
I'm buying it

317
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,180
to place at home.

318
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,210
How much is it?

319
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,190
I'll get it.

320
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,460
-Scan here. -Sure thing.

321
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,380
Also,

322
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,980
take that

323
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,020
limited edition figurine

324
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,020
together with this.

325
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,180
Okay.

326
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,100
Am I dreaming, Yuan Yuan?

327
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,020
You're getting them for me?

328
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,030
Don't you like them?

329
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,260
We'll buy

330
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,140
anything that you like

331
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,380
and keep them at home.

332
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,680
Since this is your hobby,

333
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,280
I think

334
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,340
I should try and

335
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,860
be interested.

336
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,610
Yuan Yuan, you're awesome.

337
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,130
You're the best person in this world.

338
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,010
I could get married in ten days

339
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,540
if it's with you.

340
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,700
Okay, okay, there are people around.

341
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,830
So many people.

342
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,990
Stop it.

343
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,520
Let's go.

344
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,380
Let's go.

345
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,300
[Handmade Desserts]

346
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,920
Is it good?

347
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
Take your time.

348
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,270
Okay.

349
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,720
Take your time.

350
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,080
Don't rush.

351
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
Give some to mum.

352
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,000
Mummy.

495

You have so many bad habits.

497

Don't complain about me.

500

I don't have bad habits.

Why don't you count them for me?

Look,

503

You'll want

505
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,540
to get supper.

506
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,740
You'll run around

507
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,700
before the sun is up.

508
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
You'll affect their sleep.

509
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,340
What's the biggest problem?

510
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,860
You'll wait for someone

511
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,740
to be your lab rat

512
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
and try out your dessert.

513
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,300
Uncle and auntie are old.

514
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,100
If something happens to them...

515
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,470
No, no.

516
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,010
I meant

517
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,260
I still can

518
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,460
let you stay here.

519
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,540
Just say that you want me to stay.

520
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,420
What's with all this talk?

521
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,340
What did you say?

522
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,740
What did you say?

523
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,460
Nothing.

524
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,300
I said, help me pack up.

525
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,940
Here, let me do it.

526
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,490
I've reluctantly

527

helped you pack up.

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,410
You should reluctantly

529
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,730
help me carry them too then.

530
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,860
I'm leaving. Bye.

531
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,660
Bye, Chu Xia.

532
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,660
Remember to come back and visit Xiao Dong.

533
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,260
Xiao Dong is sad

534
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,980
but Turing is sadder.

535
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,110
Be careful.

536
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,600
Uncle, auntie.

537
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,840
You're here.

538
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,780
Here.

539
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,580
No, it's fine.

540
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,420
I can do it.

541
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,580
Give it to me.

542
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,460
It's been ten years.

543
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,740
Let us enjoy

544
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,060
taking care of our daughter.

545
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,820
Okay.

546
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,510
Hurry up.

547
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,470
Okay, I'll be right over.

548
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,460
Okay.

549
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,770
Give me the bag.

550
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,120
Lei Chu Xia.

551
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,880
Don't you feel that

552
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,660
something's wrong?

553
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,980
What's wrong?

554
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,420
Think about it.

555
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,260
You suddenly

556
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,580
appeared at my side back then, right?

557
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,940
I couldn't get rid of you.

558
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,900
But now,

559
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,010
you're throwing me aside

560
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,380
because you can go home.

561
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,220
Don't you think something is missing?

562
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,000
I think the way you're being unreasonable

563
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,640
is a lot like how you were ten years ago.

564
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,490
I should have

565
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,000
taught you a lessen.

566
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,680
Chu Xia, come along.

567
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,380
Coming.

568
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,780
I haven't seen my parents in such a long time.

569
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,100
I should spend time with them.

570
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,990
But something you said

571
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,040
made sense.

572
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,380
I should still show my appreciation.

573
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,490
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

574
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,170
Thanks for taking care of me,

575
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,170
and thanks for finding my home.

576
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,750
To show you my gratitude.

577
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,290
Bye!

578
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,590
Xiao Dong,

579
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,360
based on analysis of your laughter,

580
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,680
your hormone levels are unusual.

581
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,940
[Xiao Dong]

582
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,370
[Are you there?]

583
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:39,790
[Chu Xia]

584
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,950
[Chu Xia]
[No.]

585
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,690
[How is spending]

586
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,750
[time with your parents?]

587
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
[It's been awhile since]

588
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,830
[I spent time with them like this.]

589
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,710
[I can finally]

590
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,680
[enjoy my huge bed now that you moved out.]

591
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,350
[That won't work.

592
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
[How dare someone]

593
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,860
[covet my bed while I'm away?]

594
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
Who are you chatting with?

595
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,670
You're smiling ear to ear.

596
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,180
Rest early.

597
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,940
What's wrong?

598
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,320
[My mum just left.]

599
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,400
Hold on.

600
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,570
Why are you nervous?

601
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,130
Don't you feel that no matter when

602
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,940
or at what age,

603
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,780
it's still pretty nerve-wrecking

604
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,100
being in a relationship in front
of your parents?

605
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,190
You're overthinking.

606
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,200
By the way,

607
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,350
after much thought,

608
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,390
the compensation

609
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,010
you gave me in the afternoon

610
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,050
isn't enough to cover

611
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,780
the efforts I've made.

612
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,260
So I'm requesting for additional compensation.

613
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,100
[You're just raising the price.]

614
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,580
[I don't care.]

615
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,070
[I want a date]

616
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,950
[with just the two of us.]

617
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,430
[Tomorrow.]

618
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,920
Chu Xia,

619
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,620
why are you still on your phone?

620
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,680
Get ready to sleep.

621
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,650
Okay, I will.

622
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
[I need to go.]

623
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,760
Is that a yes?

624
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,740
[I'll take your silence as a yes.]

625
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,060
Do you want to

626
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,250
give me extra compensation now?

627
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,820
Time to sleep.

628
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,030
See you tomorrow.

629
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,790
How could you not know this?

630
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,020
[Fine.]

631
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,540
[Go to sleep.]

632
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,040
[Good night.]

633
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,020
We haven't gotten a souvenir

634
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,260
after coming so many times.

635
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,140
Let's take a picture.

636
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,460
Here.

637
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,940
One, two...

638
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,300
Uncle, auntie.

639
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,770
Xiao Dong,

640
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,530
I hope you don't mind us coming along.

641
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,510
No, not at all.

642
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,170
Just ignore us.

643
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,010
We're here on a date too.

644
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,020
Let's take one together.

645
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,220
We'll have a date together then.

646
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,340
Here.

647
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,060
Look here.

648
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,460
This isn't a good angle.

649
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,540
Move back, this angle.

650
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,540
Slightly to the side.

651
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,110
One, two, three, smile.

652
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,660
Okay.

653
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,340
How is it?

654
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,820
Take one for us.

655
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,610
Let's take one.

656
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,900
Okay.

657
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,780
Let's do it.

658
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,850
Here.

659
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,740
Ready.

660
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,260
One, two, three.

661
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,140
Smile.

662
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,800
Okay, done.

663
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,860
How is it?

664
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,820
Uncle, take a look.

665
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,940
Let's see.

666
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
Yes, that's not bad.

667
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,120
Not bad.

668
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,040
Let's take another one over there.

669
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Let's go.

670
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,180
Didn't we agree

671
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,740
that it's just you and me?

672
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,980
I tried my best.

673
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,080
-Let's go. -But...

674
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,740
My dear,

675
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,700
look at that ship.

676
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,580
That must be a cruise ship.

677
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,620
The white one.

678
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,450
Someone is standing there.

679
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,780
Look, look.

680
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,970
To me,

681
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,110
I've only split up with them for a few months.

682
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,200
Let me see.

683
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,670
But to them, it's been ten years.

684
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,390
Thank you

685
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,750
for letting us create

686
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,270
new happy memories as a family.

687
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,290
I'm happy

688
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,440
seeing that your family is happy too.

689
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,530
Alright.

690
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,800
Now that I've thought about it,

691
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,460
a double date

692
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,500
is quite interesting.

693
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,510
It's alright.

694
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,920
Youngsters shouldn't keep taking breaks.

695
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
Let's go to the next location.

696
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,810
Yes, sure.

697
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,110
Let's go.

698
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,470
Let's go. Hurry. Go.

699
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,580
Let's go.

700
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,660
♫ One word from you ♫

701
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,860

you should go home first.

Go in.

717

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,900
I'll leave when you go in.

719
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,580
Go home.

720
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,860
I'll leave when you go in.

721
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,060
Go home.

722
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,820
Go in.

723
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,780
Stop being so sappy.

724
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,420
Xiao Dong,

725
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,380
I'm going to cook something good.

726
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,060
Let's eat together.

727
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,820
Great!

728
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,740
Chu Xia, help me.

729
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,140
Hurry.

730
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,100
Okay.

731
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,740
Xiao Dong, you have other plans?

732
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,220
-No, I'd like to eat.
-Go ahead then.

733
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,140
Maybe next time.

734
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
See you next time.

735
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,660
Bye. You go ahead.

736
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,140
Is this not supposed to be a double date?

737
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,330
What do you mean?

738
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,010
[Mr. Wei,]

[but nothing much happened.]

741
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,790
Okay.

742
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
It looks like

743
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,060
Lei Chu Xia has no evidence.

744
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,860
That means

745
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,140
she found out evidence

746
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,550
about the truth

747
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,230
but couldn't keep any of those

748
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,770
when she travelled through time.

749
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,700
So other than getting me

750
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,260
to tell the truth,

751
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,820
there's nothing she can do.

752
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,700
It looks like

753
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,960
my guess was right.

754
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,500

757
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,630
Okay, Xiao Dong.

758
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,250
After analysing,

759
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,980
with the current source code,

760
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,980
user information that can be properly processed

00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,900
is within 5 million.

763
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,340
When it hits 10 million,

764
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,500
the system will show

765
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,460
serious login operation errors.

766
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,860
When the software sends out

767
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,180
a large amount of error messages,

768
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,260
there will be serious consequences.

[Family First App Data Analysis Report]
[Critical Error]

770
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
What is this?

771
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,260
What you received is the system

772
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,700
risk report of Family First.

773
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,690
Once Family First's users

774
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,000
exceed 10 million,

775
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,880
the existing system framework

776
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
won't be able to handle

777
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,480
these user information.

778
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,490
It's highly possible that

779
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,540
there would be errors
for the medication reminder,

780
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,980
mistakes in suggested medication,

781
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,180
incorrect data for allergens and

These errors

784
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,300

you're an alarmist.

You just want to destroy my career.

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,180
I'm not trying to scare you.

791
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,440
I'm advising you to take down
Family First as soon as possible.

792
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,040
After all, your source code

793
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,580
is stolen from my dad's
development from ten years ago.

794
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,570
The marketing of Family First

795
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,730
is running very well.

797
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,460
going to hit 10 million soon.

Mr. Wei,

802
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,450
the technical team ran a check overnight

803
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,610
and found the system issue

804
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,260
that Xu Xiao Dong mentioned.

805
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,410
I don't need to hear this.

806
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,850
How long does it take

807
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,730
for the technical team

808
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,020
to rectify this problem?

809
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,700
Well...

810
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,040
The technical team said

811
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,680
they need to continue evaluating.

812
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,180
Since it involves

813
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,930
changing the codes by Xu Wei Yi,

814
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,940
they are not confident to do it.

815
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,530
What's the point of me

816
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,500
spending so much money to hire you?

817
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,850
Tell your team

818
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,540
to solve this problem immediately.

819
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,420
Or I'll fire everyone.

820
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,310
Yes, Mr. Wei.

821
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,580

826
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,380
Do you think

827
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,070
we should cancel it?

828
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,260
No.

829
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,500
Family First

830
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,340
is very important to the company.

831
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,660
It's related to Cyber Tech's

833
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,490
Not only do I want the event to continue,

834
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,940
I want to put more budget

835
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,220
into marketing.

836
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,940
You,

837
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,700
tell the marketing team

838
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,180
to keep an eye on the negative news online.

839
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Control the reviews.

840
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,300
Make sure there are no leaks.

841
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,460
Yes, Mr. Wei.

842
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,010
[Success is just around the corner.]

843
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,930
[No one will stop me.]

844
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,600
[There's a price to success,]

845
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,580
[and I'm willing to pay the price.]

846

posted the Family First's

848

849

That's such a shameless thing to do.

850
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:29,890
I've never seen

such a thick-skinned person ever.

852

He stole

853
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,900
Uncle Xu's code,

854
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,510
but why is he being so proud about it?

855
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,890

857
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,960
Oh no.

858
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,050
I said the wrong thing.

860
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm here, Xiao Dong.

861
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,040
Start the retaliation.

862
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,280
Yes, Xiao Dong.
