00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,550
Yes.

178
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,230
That's a deal.

179
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,830
Let's pack up.

180
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,900
Let's go.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,430
[Winter: I'll send your parents to nursing home with "Battle of the Saints" kind fund]

182
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,800
[It's free. I wish your mom a speedy recovery.]

183
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,790
Xu Xiao Dong.

184
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,630
What's wrong?

185
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,510
Winter's foundation

186
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,150
made arrangement to send my parents

187
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,990
to a nursing home.

188
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,150
How did he know that?

189
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,390
Two days ago, I left him a comment

190
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,070
telling him I found my name.

191
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,590
Of course,

192
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,750
I did tell him that

193
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,630
due to an accident,

194
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,550
I can't take care of my parents.

195
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,470
However, I really didn't expect that

196
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,270
he would help me out.

197
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,190
It's so touching.

198
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,620
As your dream man,

199
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,910
I think he can be considered

200
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,590
to have passed the threshold.

201
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,030
How could you say that?

202
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,630
He is perfect!

203
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,030
I didn't expect that

204
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,750
I would meet

205
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,380
my first friend

206
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,700
on the internet.

207
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,990
He is also a super cool guy.

208
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,980
Isn't me

209
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,990
your first friend?

210
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,590
You are the first bad guy I met.

211
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,750
Of course,

212
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,110
you are nice to me now.

213
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,270
Have my parents

214
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,230
gone to the nursing home?

215
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,270
Let's check on them.

216
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,070
I mean let's go my home.

217
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,470
Let's go.

218
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,510
Why are you in a rush?

219
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,910
What does that mean?

220
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,950
It has been a long time

221
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,430
and you haven't found her?

222
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,870
Yes, Director Wei.

223
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,670
Due to the venue,

224
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,310
none of the security cameras

225
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,350
had taken any photo.

226
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,710
Furthermore,

227
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,830
Mr. and Mrs. Lei are not home lately.

228
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,430
No, keep looking.

229
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,670
Make sure you find her.

230
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,310
Okay, Director Wei.

231
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,030
Xuan He.

232
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,510
Don't panic.

233
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,630
Take a seat.

234
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,990
You are exhausted.

235
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,190
Perhaps you saw it wrongly.

236
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,950
She's been missing in action for ten years.

237
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,750
She wouldn't have had appeared out of no where.

238
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,110
No way I saw it wrongly.

239
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,300
She was there.

240
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,550
All right, stop thinking too much.

241
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,950
Today, I baked some biscuits.

242
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,590
Try it.

243
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,350
It's fresh from the oven.

244
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,110
[Chu Xia.]

245
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,830
No.

246
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,740
I must find her.

247
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,350
You should go back first.

248
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,590
I have something else to do.

249
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,390
Xuan He.

250
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,030
As expected, once Lei Chu Xia appears,

251
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,110
you start to neglect me.

252
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,190
Director Zhao.

253
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,670
I'm sorry, Director Wei.

254
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,710
Director Zhao insists to see you.

255
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,950
Director Wei,

256
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,100
why are you troubled?

257
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,070
Nothing.

258
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,070
Are you thinking about

259
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,470
the intelligent system

260
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,110
that will be launched soon,

261
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,260
the Family First app?

262
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,470
I heard about it.

263
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,790
For this app,

264
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,670
there are some technical issues

265
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,470
which haven't been resolved.

266
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,510
That's why it took a long time to launch.

267
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,990
As one of the investors

268
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,870
of this project,

269
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm quite worried.

270
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,750
Director, don't worry.

271
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,870
I'm the founder of Cyber Tech.

272
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,310
I care about

273
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,230
the Family First app more than anyone else.

274
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,870
Our R&D team

275
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,900
is full of talented people.

276
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,910
We will surely have a breakthrough

277
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,190
on the technical issues.

278
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,150
I'm not as optimistic as you, Director Wei.

279
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,790
Speed is the soul of the internet.

280
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,150
This is the information of the companies

281
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,070
which are also working on an app similar to Family First.

282
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,470
They are a bunch of talented people

283
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,630
without support and background.

284
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,800
[Company information]

285
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,510
Director Wei, I have a proposal.

286
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,630
Why don't we change our mindset?

287
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,190
Since your team is unable to solve the issues,

288
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,630
why don't we

289
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,510
draw on the experience

290
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,270
of others?

291
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,350
This is plagiarism.

292
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,710
Director Wei.

293
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,350
Didn't we do the same

294
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,710
ten years ago?

295
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,510
Have you forgotten

296
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,670
Xu Wei Yi?

297
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,870
Sorry,

298
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,820
I tainted your blazer.

299
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,590
All right, I'll leave you alone.

300
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,740
Director Wei.

301
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,820
A wise man submits to fate.

302
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,020
Goodbye.

303
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,550
By the way, do you have the key?

304
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,070
If you don't have the key, how do we go inside?

305
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,590
What's wrong?

306
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,190
As expected, it's still here.

307
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,790
You remember everything now?

308
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,550
It's gut feeling.

309
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,990
Your parents are so careless.

310
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,870
How could they leave the key there?

311
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,510
Is that you when you were young?

312
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,190
You were already a glutton since young.

313
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,350
Look at you.

314
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,020
Is it funny?

315
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,950
No.

316
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,510
Think carefully

317
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,670
and see if you can recall anything.

318
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,110
Many years have passed

319
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,390
yet everything is well maintained.

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,430
This must be an essay I wrote
when I was in elementary school.

324
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,710
I didn't expect that my parents would keep my essay

325
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,590
written when I was in elementary school.

326
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,350
The essay is well kept

My dad?

My dad has passed away

331
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,980
but to me,

332
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,150
he was a hero.

333
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,350
He was a genius.

I don't even know my dad's name.

How about this?

345
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,070
You should stay in this room

346
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,300
and think about it.

347
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,150

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,430
Perhaps it's related to you.

[Summer Time]

351
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,590
Take a close look.

352
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,630
[Summer Time]

353
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,869
That's enough.

354
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:58,710
Stop talking.

355
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,069
I won't rent this place to you.

356
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,869
I have made up my mind.

357
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:02,630
Ms. Chen.

358
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,510
How about this?

359
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,430
Take the money.

360
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:04,990
You must

361
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,069
rent the shop to me.

362
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,270
I can't afford to lose the shop.

363
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,550
This place...

364
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,150
When was the last time it was in business?

365
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,430
Can it still be considered as a shop?

366
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,710
It's been vacant for a year.

367
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,750
I can't imagine the loss.

368
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,470
I can understand that

369
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,190
but no matter how much of losses it caused,

370
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,550
I need to hang in there.

371
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,950
I can't lose it.

372
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,110
Listen, girl.

373
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,310
Just give up on it.

374
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,140
I am serious about it.

375
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,710
I won't rent it to you anymore.

376
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,830
Don't you think you are silly?

377
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,510
Who on earth behaves like you?

378
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,270
You go to work all day and all night

379
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,550
just to make money

380
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,830
to sustain a dessert shop

381
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,990
which has not made any profit

382
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,380
in the past ten years.

383
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:34,990
Ms. Chen.

384
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,030
To me, this shop

385
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,950
is really important.

386
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,950
I set up this store

387
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,910
with my best friend.

388
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,390
I must take care of the store

389
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,470
while waiting for her to come back.

390
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,790
Why don't you increase the rent?

391
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,790
You may increase the rent.

392
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,630
No, listen.

393
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,790
Don't you get

394
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,150
what am I trying to say?

395
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,540
Even if you're willing to pay extra,

396
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,750
I can't take it anymore.

397
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,790
That's enough.

398
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,790
I have to go.

399
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,030

400
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,590
I'll be here to take over the place.

00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,430
Ms. Chen.

402

Is that you, Chu Xia?

405

Finally you are back.

406
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,310
It's been so many years.

407
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,510
Where have you been?

408
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,470
Do you know

409
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,390
we were so worried

410
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,390
when we couldn't find you?

Can't you recognise me?

Do you remember this store?

Summer Time.

422
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,270
We set up

423
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,220
the store together.

424
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,510
We aspired

425
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,910
to set up the best dessert shop in the world.

426
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,550
Don't you

427
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,630
remember any of them?

428
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,430
Chu Xia.

429
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,300
What have you experienced

430
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,350
in the past ten years?

431
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,350
Who are you?

I'm not her boyfriend.

433

It's spotless.

436
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,270
I come here to clean up the store every month.

437
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:51,950
Just ignore him.

438
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,030
Chu Xia.

439
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:53,990
Tell me.

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,350
What is going on?

441
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,310
I don't know

where to start

443
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,710
and I can't explain it clearly.

444
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,750
My memories

445
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,230
started from Xu Xiao Dong.

446
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,950
Not long ago,

447
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,710
I found out

448
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,670
my name is Lei Chu Xia

449
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,430
and I found my parents.

450
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,870
That's all.

451
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,070
How did you

452
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,430
meet him?

453
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,710
I picked her up.

454
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,830
Picked her up?

455
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,030
Am I a stray cat to you?

456
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,590
How could you say that?

457
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,270
You are a lot more troublesome than a stray cat.

458
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,270
It's like this.

459
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,510
Not long ago,

460
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,870
she suddenly barged into my house

461
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,590
out of the blue.

462
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,180
She looked

463
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,430
fragile and helpless.

464
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,230
She knew nothing.

465
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,070
If I left her alone,

466
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,030
she would die from starvation.

467
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,350
Hence, I brought her home.

468
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,710
However, I still have a doubt.

469
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,910
She is Lei Chu Xia.

470
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,270
Are you Yuan Yuan for real?

471
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,070
If I am not Yuan Yuan, who am I?

472
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,190
[Yuan Yuan is Lei Chu Xia's best friend.]

[She is one of the shareholders of Summer Time.]

No!

Stop, don't move.

479
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,070
Wait a minute.

480
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,630
No!

481
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,070
This is a prehistorical photo.

482
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,670
I have deleted the photo a long time ago.

483
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,630
Where did you get it?

484
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,270
That's enough!

485
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,820
She looks so cute.

486
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,790
Now, she is prettier.

487
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,910
Chu Xia.

488
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,070
You said the same thing before.

489
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,470
Do you know?

490
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,630
Both of us

491
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,390
have never separated since elementary school

492
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,390
all the way to university.

493
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,830
You were by my side when I fell in love,

494
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,030
when I fell out of love,

495
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,550
and when I had my chin surgery

496
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,070
after I fell out of love.

497
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,550
If it weren't for you,

498
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,390
I wouldn't have had

499
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,670
mustered the courage.

500
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,550
No doubt I can't remember

501
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,790
anything that you just said,

502
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,510
but today,

503
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,430
this is the first time I'm here.

504
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,150
This is also the first time I met you.

505
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,470
I have

506
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,950
a sense of familiarity for no reason.

507
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,590
I kind of think that I used to live here.

508
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,870
This is

509
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,710
the first time I met you,

510
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,430
but I have a feeling

511
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,910
we are best friends

512
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,030
for real.

513
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,630
We are best friends.

514
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,070
We are best friends for real.

515
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,830
And this is

516
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,590
Summer Time for real.

517
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,630
Furthermore,

518
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,750
you lived here before

519
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,020
for real.

520
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,550
Even though

521
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,510
we don't meet up for a long time,

522
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,110
our friendship

still remains the same.

It's okay, I'm here.

Let me find back your memories.

We share

lots of memories.

Yes. Come here.

"are friends forever."

Do you know

541
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,980
why did we name the store Summer Time?

542
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,910
Why?

543
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,710
When we set up the store,

544
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,790
you said,

545
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,350
"it's the first day of summer."

546
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,150

"Summer Time?"

That's all?

Look at this.

Do you know what is this?

559

These utensils

were your favourite utensils back then.

He was the one who organised the memorial service for me.

conduct a memorial service for me?

Can't you recognize me?

for Chu Xia yesterday.

575

We met each other yesterday.

to talk to you,

you would come to Summer Time.

I have been looking for you for ten years.

I have missed you so much.

590

Are you sure, Director Wei?

591
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,910
Yesterday, when I called you

592

to stop you from conducting livestream,

593
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,500
why did you turn me down?

594

It's between me and Chu Xia.

You are Wei Xuan He, right?

596
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,950
Since you claim that

597
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,350
you were my boyfriend ten years ago,

598
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,710
why did I disappear?

599
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,660
What happened before I disappeared?

600
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,590
Ten years ago, we were intimate.

601
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,510
However, at that point in time,

602
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,470
my company was just getting better.

603
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,230
I was too busy.

604
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,110
I didn't take care of you.

605
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,830
Since you ask about

606
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,230
the night ten years ago,

607
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,830
I planned to celebrate with you

608
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,870
after work.

609
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,230
But when I reached home,

610
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,390
I found that you had gone missing.

611
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,110
Is that true?

612
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,470
On that day,

613
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,430
you left Summer Time early.

614
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,710
I was busy at work.

615
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,190
The next day, I was informed that

616

869
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,110
There is a mosquito.

870
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,310
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

871
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,150
Not only mosquito,

872
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,270
but look, there are spiders

873
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,230
and ants.

874
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,910
This university is quite environmentally friendly.

875
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,900
However, the infestation treatment

876
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,670
is not well done.

877
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,030
If your friend is around,

878
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,980
it will affect our memories.

879
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,710
Why don't we make him stay away?

880
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,190
Are you

881
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,950
asking me to leave?

882
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,430
Sure, I'll leave now.

883
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,190
Please don't leave.

884
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,630
It won't affect anything.

885
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,630
He is

886
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,750
the first friend I met here.

887
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,790
With him around,

888
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,550
I would feel

889
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,630
more relaxed.

890
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,430
It will help me

891
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,710
recollect more memories better.

892
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,540
All right.

893
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,710
It's okay. Just ignore him.

894
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,990
Show us the way.

895
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,510
Chu Xia.

896
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,150
Do you still remember

897
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,990
the library?

898
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,590
As she said,

899
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,510
she doesn't remember a thing.

900
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,430
Of course she doesn't have any impression.

901
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,430
Am I right?

902
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,590
Back then,

903
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,510
you confessed to me here.

904
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,750
You said that you like me.

905
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,470
Then, we got together.

906
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,910
Soon, we became

907
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,190
a couple everyone envied in the university.

908
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,430
Yes.

909
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,910
After all, she doesn't remember a thing.

910
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,750
You can say whatever you want.

911
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,310
Stop fooling around.

912
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,430
Just ignore him. Continue the story.

913
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,510
Yes, continue the story.

914
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,630
Just ignore him and be yourself.

915
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,150
I like you.

916
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,940
I think the feeling is mutual.

917
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,110
What do you think?

918
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,350
What did you say?

919
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:31,910
That was

920
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,740
what you said

921
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,470
when you confessed to me.

922
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,630
You told me

923
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,820
not to care about someone else's opinion.

924
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,110
Don't you remember a thing?

925
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,060
Your confession was so well done.

926
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,070
I really don't remember anything.

927
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,070
It's okay.

928
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,390
Now that I have told you about it,

929
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,270
does what you said in the past

930
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,430
still count?

931
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,870
Let's go to the second floor.

932
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,550
Let's go to the second floor.

933
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,670
This way.

934
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,710
We used to come to library very frequently.

935
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,390
I loved reading finance related books.

936
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,070
You loved reading language related books.

937
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,310
For convenience,

938
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,110
we always sat at this spot.

939
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,150
Take a seat.

940
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,390
Help yourself. I want to take a stroll.

941
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,350
Dating at the library

942
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,190
is disturbing for those who are here to study.

943
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,420
That's unbelievable.

944
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,750
Not only it can guarantee

945
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,750
the exchange of magnetic field,

946
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,710
it can also limit

947
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,830
the impact caused by

948
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,950
the drastic increase of the energy.

949
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,830
If Newton were reborn

950
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,390
or Einstein were resurrected,

951
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,230
they couldn't do better.

952
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,510
Xiao Dong.

953
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,550
Let me tell you a good news.

954
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,350
The bracelet

955
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,310
is successfully invented.

956
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,350
If it works,

957
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,590
Lei Chu Xia

958
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,590
can leave you and move around.

959
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,950
No.

960
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,830
That's just a small achievement

961
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,870
among my many researches.

962
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,030
It's not even worth mentioning.

963
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,230
How about this? Come and get it tomorrow.

964
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,470
Okay, that's all.

965
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,190
Chen Mo.

966
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,510
You are such a genius.

967
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,660
That's not scientific.

968
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,310
[She came from ten years ago.]

969
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,430
[She appeared on the supermoon night?]

970
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,510
[Yes.]

971
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,590
[At that point in time, ]

972
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,150
[your smartphone had been modified.]

973
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,710
[It might have turned into]

974
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,030
[a transfer station for the magnetic field.]

975
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,390
[In other words, it became an anchor point.]

976
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,670
[Her presence]

977
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,950
[has something to do with the gravitational wave.]

978
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,470
[Lei Chu Xia]

979
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,950
[is the one and only specimen.]

980
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,470
[I won't miss the chance.]

981
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,070
[I think I'll have to do something]

982
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,910
[to the bracelet.]
