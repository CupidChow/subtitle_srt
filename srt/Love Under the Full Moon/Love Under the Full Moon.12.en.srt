00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,680
Wei Xuan He,

5
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,480
Chu Xia has turned you down.

6
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,120
What tricks are you trying to pull here?

7
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,920
Chu Xia!

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Chu Xia, stop...

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,920
Chu Xia, stop running.

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Chu Xia.

11
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,480
Chu Xia, my child.

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,600
Come home with me.

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,640
I'm not!

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
Chu Xia.

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
Why won't you

16
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,510
acknowledge us?

17
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,060
Chu Xia, how could we possibly be mistaken?

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
You're my daughter.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
You've got the wrong person.

20
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,360
Yes, that's right.

21
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,480
You're not Chu Xia.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,200
We mistook you for our daughter.

23
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,120
We're old.

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,520
We couldn't see clearly.

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Sorry.

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

27
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,350
Would I mistake my own daughter

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
for someone else?

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,480
Chu Xia.

30
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Honey,

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
our child still wouldn't acknowledge us

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
even at this point.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,920
She must have her reasons.

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Let's not push her, alright?

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,080
Let's go back first.

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
We'll wait for her at home.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,920
When she wants to come home,

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
she'll come home.

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,300
Right?

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,880
Xiao Dong.

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,880
Uncle.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,880
You have to take care

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,480
of this good friend of yours.

44
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
She must also be

45
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,220
the most beloved child of her parents.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,400
Uncle, auntie, don't worry.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
No matter what happens,

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,480
I'll protect her.

49
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,880
Leave her to me.

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,100
Come on, let's go home.

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
What's wrong?

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,080
What's on your mind?

53
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,120
Why is this happening to me?

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
I just want to be an ordinary person,

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,600
who can live with their parents,

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,240
and doesn't remember those unknown fears.

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,400
Is that too much to ask?

58
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,680
Is this how I'm going to be
for the rest of my life?

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
This is not what I want at all.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,840
What do you want to do then?

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
I want to see my parents.

62
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to tell them the truth.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,360
Including the fact that you fell off the cliff

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,280
and your strange encounter
over the past ten years.

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,990
I don't want to put them in danger,

66
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,920
but I really want to tell them I'm still alive.

67
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,980
I don't want the people I love the most

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,000
to drown in pain.

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,600
Are you sure?

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm sure.

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,030
Now this is the Lei Chu Xia I know,

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,840
the one who will never surrender.

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Alright, now.

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Xiao Dong,

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,120
you're saying that
although Chu Xia has returned,

76
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,480
she has lost all her memories.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,030
And because of some

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
special reasons,

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,000
she can't acknowledge us?

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,120
But she's our daughter.

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,640
Auntie, uncle,

82
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm still helping her

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,520
to find her memories.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,159
I want to help her solve all the mysteries

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
and remove the danger.

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,430
So that she can return

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,480
to her normal life,

88
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,120
return to your side as soon as possible.

89
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,390
Is there anything we can do

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,960
to help her?

91
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
Honestly,

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
Chu Xia and I

93
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,800
have been coming back secretly these days.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,070
But apart from some intuitions

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
from her past,

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,120
it didn't stimulate

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,680
more memories of her past.

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,670
I had wanted to ask Chu Xia

99
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
to move back home.

100
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
If there is anything she wants to know,

101
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,120
we can tell her slowly.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,120
But since she can't
acknowledge us now,

103
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,400
looks like this idea

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,280
is not going to work.

105
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,400
What should we do?

106
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,800
I have an idea.

107
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,520
Maybe we can give it a try.

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
Chu Xia loves desserts.

109
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,260
She has always wanted to be

110
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,150
a dessert chef since childhood.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,950
Her father and I used to

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
take her on trips.

113
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,200
We tried the desserts from different places.

114
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Here's my idea,

115
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,960
we'll visit those places again.

116
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,400
We'll collect all these dessert recipes

117
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,560
and give it to Chu Xia.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
Maybe her palate can stimulate her memory.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,120
Honey,

120
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,720
that's a brilliant idea.

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,760
Maybe when Chu Xia

122
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,660
tastes those desserts she used to love,

123
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
she would remember everything.

124
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,880
We've been looking for Chu Xia for ten years.

125
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,520
Ten years.

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,280
But we never thought of giving up.

127
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,680
Now that we know

128
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,080
she's healthy and safe,

129
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,550
and she has

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,840
reliable friends like you

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,280
by her side,

132
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
we're relieved.

133
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,560
She will definitely regain her memory.

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
We'll get through this.

135
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,159
She wants to find her memory.

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,880
As her parents, it's our duty

137
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
to help her get through this.

138
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,150
As for reuniting,

139
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,520
we can wait for a few more months.

140
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,240
When she is fully recovered,

141
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,480
our family will be reunited.

142
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,240
Why did you come in?

143
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,920
Xiao Dong,

144
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,200
please tell Chu Xia.

145
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,390
Our daughter has always been full of energy.

146
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
When she encounters any difficulty,

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,320
she always overcomes it with optimism,

148
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,680
just like when she was learning
to make desserts.

149
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
I believe that now, while recovering her memory,

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,800
she will do the same.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,360
She'll always have our support.

152
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,360
We'll wait for her to come home.

153
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,240

next time she comes,

156
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,600
she can role play

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,370

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,470
the sales of our products in the future.

175
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,330
No, no.

176
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,550
Come on, cheers.

177
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,040
Let's set a deal on
our cooperation plan first.

178
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Mr. Zhou,

179
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
your company's products

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,080
are already selling very well.

181
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,270
My promoting your product
is just like icing on the cake.

182
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,160
You're too kind.

183
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,960
I think

184
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,230
you should finish this glass.

185
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,150
You're the boss.

186
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,270
Mr. Zhou can drink this,

187
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,590
but don't you think you should

188
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
drink a cross-armed wine with Mr. Zhou?

189
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,360
Right, guys?

190
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,960
That's right.

191
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,520
You won't turn him down, right?

192
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,830
We haven't signed

193
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
the contract yet.

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,440
Miss Qin...

195
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,280
Miss Qin...

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Miss Qin...

197
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,080
This is quite the party.

198

Xuan He.

199
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,600
You came, Mr. Wei.

200
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
Sorry that I'm late, Mr Zhou.

201
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
Are you coming to her rescue?

202
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,120
This is such a great party,

203
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,800
how can I miss it, right?

204
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
Besides, I came here to surprise you.

205
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Let's have a drink.

206
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
You came just in time.

207
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,640
Xuan He, don't drink too much.

208
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
Mr. Zhou likes to drink.

209
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,920
I'll have a few more drinks with him.

210
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Come.

211
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Xuan He.

212
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,480
Drink.

213
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Here.

214
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,480
Here, bottoms up.

I'm warning you.

216
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Stay away from Chu Xia,

217
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,720

Professor Chen has asked someone
to deliver the wrist band.

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,310
Great.

266
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,670
Now you don't have to go to the company
with me anymore

267
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,630
and I don't have to go with you

268
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,790
to Summer Time anymore.

269

It's fixed?

270
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,370
Why did someone make it seem like

271
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,650
this is such a pity?

272
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Is it that obvious?

273
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,750
This is good.

274
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,790
With this wrist band,

275
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,750
I can speed up on the investigation

277

It's fine, you should go.

00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,680
You mustn't delay your work

288

because of me.

289
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,270
I have the wrist band now, don't I?

290
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
I can go anywhere freely now.

291
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,200

292
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,230
no matter what difficulties I face,

293
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
I won't give up easily.

294
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,680
So, for their sake,

295
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,650
I have to work hard.

296

Your family

298

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,280
Just like your dad is a genius,

300
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,200
and you...

301
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,750

302

304
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520

305
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
you are hidden gem.

306
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,710
If you want to praise me,
just praise me directly.

307
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't mince your words.

308

Relieved?

311
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,790
Even more worried.

312
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,260
Who knows what sort of new trouble

313
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,740
you would make?

314
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,920
Life is full of challenges.

315
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,520
That's enough, go out now.

316
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,280
Don't delay your work.

317
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,000
That's enough.

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Go, go, go.

319
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,920
I'm going now.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Bye-bye.

321
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
Stop looking. What are you looking at?

322
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,720
Listen,

323
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
I've found some information.

324
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,960
The mainframe room is going to be
relocated earlier for maintenance.

325
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,390
This is your only chance

326
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,800
to go in,

327
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,840
you hear me?

328
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,120
Stop looking.

329
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,090
What?

330
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,440
Okay, okay.

Thank you, Sui.

333
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,210
It's no big deal.

334
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
Let's go.

335
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Where are you going?

336
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,520
The mainframe room.

337
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,080
You're just going to waltz in there?

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,080
Didn't I tell you

339
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,880
with your qualifications,

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,200
you can't enter
the core area of the company?

341
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
We'll do the same as before.

342
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,040

can't be crossed.

513
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
Thanks. Excuse me.

514
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,280
Liang.

515
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Xiao Dong,

516
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,190
seeing you here, I can stop rushing.

517
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,640
I didn't expect that I'm not the last person.

518
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,080
What's going on with that?

519
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,680
You don't know?

520
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,160
The company was hacked.

521
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,430
Everyone will be investigated.

522
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
They suspect it was an inside job.

523
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,870
When did it happen?

524
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,920
Yesterday.

525
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,520
Sui sent everyone an email.

526
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
You didn't receive it?

527
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,690
[You have an unread email]

Xiao Dong.

530
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,220
[You have an unread email]

531
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,840
We're just following orders too.

532
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,630
Our company secrets are leaked.

533
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,590
The computers of everyone in the company

534
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,440
have to be checked,

535
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,760
including President Zhao's computer.

536
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,060
I'm leading by example.

537
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,000
Also,

538
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,110
you have to hand over

539
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,000
all the hard drives too.

540
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,980
The one who is capable of
stealing company secrets

541
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,150
must be an expert.

542
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,480
Other than the staff from the core office,

543
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,840
there is your department.

544
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,720
Sui,

545
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,000
your department is highly valued and

546
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,050
has been performing well lately,

547
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,000
but we have to follow the protocol

548
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,030
and focus the inspection on you guys.

549
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,890
Please cooperate.

550
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
Don't worry.

551
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,230
We will certainly cooperate, right?

552
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,120
Yes.

553
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,160
It's true that our department

554
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
has been highly valued lately,

555
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,590
because we are really competent.

556
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,760
But take a look around,

557
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,530
these people are tech nerds.

558
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,880
I mean, they won't have the guts to...

559
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,050
steal the company's secrets.

560
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,720
Also,

561
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,760
please hand over your phones too.

562
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,160
Our phones?

563
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,390
This is out of line, isn't it?

564
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,280
That's right.

565
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,280
What rights do you have to take our phones away?

566
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
This is a violation of privacy.

567
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,000
-That's right. -Exactly.

568
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,880
Is he going to take responsibility of this?

569
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,640
They can't do this.

570
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,520
Alright, silence.

571
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,720
I'll say something.

572
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,880
Director Gao,

573
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,920
we've known each other for quite a long time.

574
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,600
I think this really is a violation of privacy.

575
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,750
And there are girls too.

576
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,080
What if their phones have...

577
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
Come on.

578
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,840
Everyone, put your phones into this basket.

579
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,680
Hurry up.

580
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,720
One by one, put it inside.

581
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,280
After this, disassemble your computer.

582
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,960
Disassemble it.

583
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,960
They need to check the hard drive.

584
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,120
Make it easy for them.

585
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,320
Cooperate with Director Gao.

586
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,420
Do you hear me?

587
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,800
-We got it. -We got it.

588
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,120
Seriously.

589
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,780
[Cleaning in progress]

590
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,080
I know someone's in there.

591
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,040
Come out.

592
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
Come out, stop pretending.

593
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,680
I'll count to three.

594
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,640
One.

595
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,640
Two.

596
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,800
Sui.

597
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,680
You need to pull.

598
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,190
They found out about it so soon.

599
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,680
Tell me. Did you take
something particularly important?

600
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,560
I didn't.

601
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,430
And to prevent leaks,

602
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,830
the source code in the mainframe room

603
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,000
is intelligently encrypted.

604
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,320
Once cracked,

605
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,810
it will trigger an automatic alert command.

606
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,800
In that case,

607
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,200
the smart encryption
of the source code in our mainframe room

608
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,410
is quite interesting.

609
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,800
The automatic alert function

610
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,400
is quite impressive.

611
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,920
Put that aside for now.

612
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,250
If they find out about you,

613
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,720
they will know about me too.

614
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,320
And I just got promoted.

615
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,260
You must ensure that

616
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,900
nothing happens, okay?

617
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,840
Sui, don't worry.

618
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,430
I've cracked

619
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,200
the file tracking algorithm.

620
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,800
Even if they try to trace me

621
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,070
from the source code,

622
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,600
it'll only get them to a virtual IP address.

623
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,600
They can't trace it back to me.

624
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,430
Also,

625
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,390
about the mainframe room,

626
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,470
I took care of everything.

627
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,480
Don't worry.

628
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Good.

629
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,560
Just a false alarm, right?

630
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,320
Something is wrong.

631
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,440
What is it this time?

632
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,240
Nothing.

633
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,600
What nothing? Spit it out!

634
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,790
Nothing, really.

635
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,400
Forget the tissue paper. Tell me now!

636
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,280
The surveillance.

637
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,600
A clever IT elite

638
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,640
like you

639
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,230
would forget about the surveillance?

640
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,320
I didn't forget it.

641
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,350
I took care of the surveillance
in the mainframe room.

642
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
There's no problem with it.

643
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,760
I just forgot the surveillance in the lobby.

644
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,040
Xu Xiao Dong,

645
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,190
do you think we are in a soap opera?

646
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,320
Why didn't you finish your sentence
in one breath?

647
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,610
Believe me, I can die right now.

648
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,600
Sui, calm down.

649
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,480
Don't panic.

650
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,480
Calm down.

651
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,400
Breathe.

652
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,440
And,

653
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,040
why am I saying this?

654
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,600
If they did find us out,

655
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,400
they would've arrested us immediately.

656
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,590
They wouldn't have

657
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,320
gone through so much trouble to check everyone.

658
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,480
A small part

659
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,000
must have gone wrong in the process.

660
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,440
We got lucky

661
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,800
and got away.

662
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,520
Small part gone wrong.

663
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,720
We can't afford to have that.

664
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,960
The small part is usually the fatal part.

665
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,920
We could get exposed at any time.

666
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,640
What about the future?

667
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,280
What if we get exposed in the future?

668
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,520
Small part.

669
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,640
We have to find out this small part.

670
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,560
You hear me?

671
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,200
I think we'll be fine.

672
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,080
Listen to me.

673
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,760
The surveillance out there got us, right?

674
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,440
It's not like we were doing anything.

675
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,310
I just pulled you to the corner
and had a conversation with you.

676
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

677
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,560
You're right, Sui.

678
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,110
Nothing wrong.

679
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,510
Besides, I know that surveillance

680
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,720
broke down a week ago.

681
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,960
That's right.

682
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,440
Xu Xiao Dong!

683
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,390
Are you messing with me?

684
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
Do you think it's funny?

685
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,120
How could you mess with me?

686
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
You made my feelings go up and down.

687
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,920
I almost lost it.

688
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,000
What's wrong with you?

689
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,560
Do you know how I felt just now?

690
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,120
I almost lost it!

691
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,680
And you still messed with me.

692
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,760
Okay.

693
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,600
Anyway, I've done you a big favour this time.

694
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,110
You will have to help me in the future.

695
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,990
Keep this in mind.

696
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Okay, don't worry.

697
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
I can't believe you messed with me.

698
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,120
I need to take a breath.

699
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,760
I need to use the toilet.

700
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,600
Don't worry.

701
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,160
[They're making such a big move.]

702
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,230
[Looks like the truth behind the source code]

703
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
[isn't simple indeed.]

704
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
[Zhao Yao Yang,]

705
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,560
[you are not getting away this time.]

706
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,160
Mr. Wei,

707
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,880
we have a meeting
at the company at 2 p.m. today.

708
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,000
You'll need to attend it.

709
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,760
Wei Xuan He!

710
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Wei Xuan He!

711
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,440
Who are you?

712
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,800
Stop pulling me!

713
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,880
I want to see Wei Xuan He!

714
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,840
Wait!

715
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,800
I want to see...

716
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Sir...

717
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,750
Stop him!

718
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,680
Let go of me!

719
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,600
Let me in!

720
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,640
Wei Xuan He! Let me go in!

721
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,680
Get out of my way!

722
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,200
Get out of my way! Let me in!

723
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,040
Wei Xuan He,

724
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,000
I want to talk to you about Lei Chu Xia!

725
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,350
Who is that man?

726
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,880
Why is he looking for Xuan He?

727
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
I don't know.

728
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,440
Do we know each other?

729
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
No.

730
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,120
But I know Lei Chu Xia.

731
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,440
What is your relationship with Lei Chu Xia?

732
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,000
We have no relationship.

733
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,840
But I know her biggest secret.

734
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,240
I think I heard him mention

735
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,450
Lei Chu Xia.

736
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,110
I think

737
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,760
he knows Lei Chu Xia's secret.

738
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,910
Find out about it.

739
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,960
Investigate this man.

740
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,910
Okay.

741
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,489
I suppose you're not just here

742
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,190
for a free breakfast.

743
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,360
What I'm about to tell you

744
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,150
is worth a million free breakfasts from you.

745
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,100
It'd better be.

746
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,320
You might not know me, Mr. Wei.

747
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,120
[Tongcheng University, Wang Yi Xin]
Let me introduce myself.

748
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,139
[Tongcheng University, Wang Yi Xin]

749
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,960
I'm Wang Yi Xin.

750
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
I study astrophysics.

751
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,290
I don't care about who you are.

752
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,280
What about Lei Chu Xia?

753
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,240
See the band on Lei Chu Xia's wrist?

754
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,500
That's her stabilizer.

755
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
If you don't believe me,

756
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,920
you can take it off and see.

757
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,920
You're saying that

758
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,780
the current Lei Chu Xia

759
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,170
is the Lei Chu Xia from ten years ago?

760
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,480
She's still 22 years old?

761
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
Yes.

762
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,550
The current level of science

763
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,880
can't corroborate it,

764
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,240
but all the facts indicate that

765
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,120
I'm right.

766
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,880
On the day of the super full moon,

767
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,030
a powerful gravitational wave

768
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
was formed between the earth and the moon.

769
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
Ten years ago,

770
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,600
some coincidental circumstances

771
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,220
might have allowed Lei Chu Xia

772
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,420
to attach herself to this gravitational wave.

773
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
Gravitational waves

774
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,840
can change the timeline.

775
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,000
Our ten years may be long,

776
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,240
but Lei Chu Xia's ten years

777
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,520
is fleeting.

778
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,280
Why did she lose her memory?

779
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,760
It's possible that

780
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,680
the gravitational wave has interfered

781
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,360
with her memory nerves.

782
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,670
Or some other reasons.

783
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,750
I don't know about this.

784
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
Tell me then,

785
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,040
how can she regain her memory?

786
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,680
Recreate all the events

787
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,840
of the moment when she attached to

788
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,590
the gravitational wave ten years ago.

789
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,400
Maybe she'll get her memory back.

790
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
Or maybe

791
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,040
she can travel back to ten years ago

792
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,900
or another time period.

793
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,280
What a great scientific moment
it would be.

794
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,600
Why are you telling me this?

795
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,650
Because I want to study Lei Chu Xia.

796
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,080
Mr. Wei,

797
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,360
you've waited for her for ten years.

798
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,040
Don't you want her to regain her memory

799
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,160
so that you can start over?

800
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,040
I'm the only one

801
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,080
who can help you now.

802
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,280
So you just want to experiment on Lei Chu Xia.

803
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,960
No.

804
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,960
I'm just pursuing science.

805
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,770
Studying Lei Chu Xia

806
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,000
is good for all of mankind.

807
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,320
It's just that in

808
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,880
my pursuit of scientific truth,

809
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,000
I happened to meet your needs.

810
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,000
We can work together, right?

811
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,190
So what do you want

812
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,240
to get from me?

813
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,480
The funding for my research.

814
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,920
That's not too much to ask, is it?

815
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,400
Chu Xia.

816
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,080
What are these?

817
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,270
Why did you come by yourself?

818
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,560
What are you guys doing?

819
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,030
Next Saturday is

820
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,140
our shop's anniversary.

821
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,180
You don't remember?

822
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,160
Sorry, sorry, my bad.

823
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,880
Come here, check this out.

824
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,800
These are all the gifts

825
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,200
I bought for the shop anniversary.

826
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,440
Count it from the beginning.

827
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,280
Summer Time

828
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,280
only recorded great sales

829
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,570
during its first year

830
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,050
and its tenth year.

831
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,830
As for the period in between,

832
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,300
I managed to

833
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,260
muddle through.

834
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,080
But you're back.

835
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,270
Our Summer Time

836
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,320
is now considered a viral shop, right?

837
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,160
Hold out your hand.

838
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,270
What is this?

839
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,520
We all have this.

840
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,710
So I'm planning to hold

841
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,920
a tenth anniversary store celebration.

842
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,880
What do you think?

843
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,720
It needs to have a sense of ritual.

844
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,360
I'll hang it here. My side here...

845
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,240
Check the length.

846
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,990
Okay.

847
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,960
Let me measure it.

848
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Get the scissors.

849
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,360
Cut the extra part.

850
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,240
Okay.

851
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,360
Be careful up there.

852
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,720
Scissors.

853
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,200
I just left it here.

854
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
You can check...

855
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
