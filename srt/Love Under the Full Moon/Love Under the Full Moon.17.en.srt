346
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,270
[We will always]

347
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,400
[support you.]

348
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,750
[The weather forecast said the weather is getting cold.]

349
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,510
[Your mum wants me to remind you]

350
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,350
[to put on warm clothes.]

351
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,520
[From Senior Lei.]

352
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,350
[I can find the patent certificate]

353
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,750
[and find out its secret in advance.]

354
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,230
[This way, I'll be able to]

355
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,830
[prove Uncle Xu Wei Yi's innocence directly.]

356
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,070
[But where is it?]

357
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,000
[Looks like I'll have to find another way.]

358
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,960
[Wei Yi Tech]

359
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,750
[Wei Yi Tech]
Hi.

360
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,030
I need to see Uncle Xu.

361
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,680
Uncle Xu?

362
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,790
I mean Xu Wei Yi, Mr. Xu.

363
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,070
Sorry, ma'am.

364
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Mr. Xu is away on a business trip.

365
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,480
He's not in the office right now.

366
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,670
I have something very important to tell him,

367
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,720
I need to talk to him now.

368
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,270
Can you get a hold of him for me?

369
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,310
Oh,

370
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,070
Mr. Xu is in a business meeting,

371
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,320
it's inappropriate to

372
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,550
interrupt his meeting.

373
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,800
Please,

374
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,350
this is really important.

375
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,720
How about you make a call for me?

376
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,190
Alright.

377
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,310
I'll call him for you.

378
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,720
Thank you.

379
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,270
Nice doing business with you.

380
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,670
Hello.

381
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,640
Hi, Ms. Gu.

382
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,110
I'm the front desk receptionist.

383
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,710
A lady said

384
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,590
she has some really important matters

385
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,640
to tell Mr. Xu.

386
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,440
She needs to talk to him now.

387
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,390
Mr. Xu,

388
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,720
your call.

389
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,800
Mr. Xu is waiting for you

390
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,920
at the other end of the phone.

391
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,350
Thank you.

392
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,760
Hello, Hi.

393
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,670
Hi.

394
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,230
Is this Mr. Xu,

395
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,110
Xu Wei Yi?

396
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,480
Yes, Xu Wei Yi speaking.

397
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,030
Mr. Xu,

398
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,200
I finally found you.

399
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,510
Calm down, talk slowly.

400
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,720
Mr. Xu, hi.

401
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,480
I'm Lei Chu Xia.

402
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,670
I hope

403
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,750
you can trust me

404
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,160
in everything I tell you next.

405
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,680
Okay, Ms. Lei Chu Xia.

406
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,830
I promise you that I'll try.

407
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,920
Lei Chu Xia?

408
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,440
What's the matter, Gu Xiao Qi?

409
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
You know her?

410
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,550
Chu Xia is my best friend from college.

411
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,030
I came on this business trip in a hurry,

412
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,310
I didn't have time to tell her.

413
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,880
Plus, my phone is out of battery.

414
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,990
I didn't expect

415
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,320
she would call you.

416
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,510
Excuse me, Mr. Xu,

417
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,430
may I take this call

418
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,080
outside?

419
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,960
Go on.

420
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,270
Don't, Mr. Xu. No.

421
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,720
Lei Chu Xia,

422
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
what are you trying to do?

423
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,240
You must be Gu Xiao Qi, right?

424
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,880
Why did you do such

425
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
an immoral thing with Wei Xuan He?

426
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,120
If you confess

427
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,710
to Mr. Xu now,

428
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,000
it's still not too late.

429
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,990
Chu Xia,

430
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,030
you've been saying

431
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,160
things that don't make sense lately.

432
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,030
I don't understand at all.

433
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,520
Besides,

434
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,470
you're defaming me.

435
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,350
Do you have any proof?

436
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,550
The reason I'm helping Wei Xuan He,

437
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,640
don't you already

438
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,350
know the answer in your heart?

439
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Hello?

440
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,910
Hello?

441
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Ma'am, please have some water.

442
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,870
Thank you.

443
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,030
Gu Xiao Qi will do

444
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,640
something that harms Mr. Xu.

445
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,640
You have to help me.

446
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,800
Gu Xiao Qi is Mr. Xu's

447
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
most trusted person.

448
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,080
She's the most competent board secretary

449
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,510
of our company.

450
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,240
There's no way she will harm Mr. Xu.

451
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,310
You have to trust me.

452
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,160
I'm talking about

453
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
the future that will happen

454
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,830
soon.

455
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,480
You can see the future?

456
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,480
Ma'am, are you alright?

457
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,240
Do you need me to call a doctor for you?

458
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,590
I'm fine, I'm fine.

459
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,920
I knew no one would trust me.

460
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,390
How about this?

461
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,190
Give me

462
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,270
Mr. Xu's private number.

463
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,510
I'm not at liberty to tell

464
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,590
an outsider Mr. Xu's private number.

465
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm not an outsider.

466
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,440
I

467
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,590
may be, possibly, could be

468
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,960
his future daughter-in-law.

469
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,400
What?

470
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,350
Who's my wife?

471
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,110
[Wei Yi Tech]

472
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,440
Love is sweet, sweet and sad.

473
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,310
A bachelor doesn't need love.

474
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
Xiao Dong, what are you doing here?

475
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,720
Don't you have school today?

476
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,120
I'm out of game coins.

477
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,950
I want to get a new avatar.

478
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,160
Hurry up and go get me some money.

479
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,190
Your dad still has something

480
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,070
he wants to give you.

481
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,750
Non-mainstream.

482
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,400
[Wei Yi Tech]

483
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,830
Look up to the sky at 45 degrees,

484
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,110
so that your tears don't fall.

485
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,510
You're the one who wanted to be my wife?

486
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,110
I don't deserve you.

487
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,400
Don't get infatuated with me.

488
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,150
I'm just a legend.

489
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,400
Do you know me?

490
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,480
Woman,

491
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,550
let me see your face.

492
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Let me see if there is the possibility of transformation.

493
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,160
Don't be shy.

494
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,080
Go away, go away.

495
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Maybe you have potential.

496
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,400
Non-mainstream, non-mainstream.

497
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,720
Let me see, let me see.

498
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,920
The old lady hit me!

499
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,240
The old lady hit me!

500
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,120
The old lady hit me!

501
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,160
Who are you calling "old lady?" I'm a fairy.

502
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,470
My head hurts.

503
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,550
My heart hurts, I'm going to die.

504
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,190
Call 120.

505
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:41,670
She looked

506
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,880
just like the older girl

507
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,310
I met before.

508
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,950
And she called herself

509
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,030
the old fairy lady.

510
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,230
That

511
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,230
old fairy lady

512
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,110
said the same thing before.

513
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,230
She said something like this

514
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,270
to encourage me.

515
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,640
The old fairy lady turns out to be me.

516
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,640
Help!

517
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,920
Someone hit me!

518
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,670
An old lady hit me!

519
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,640
Cut it out.

520
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,320
I'm telling you,

521
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,030
if you hadn't stopped me,

522
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,910
I would've...

523
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,920
Mr. Xu fixed the handheld.

524
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,920
He asked me to pass it to you.

525
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,840
He said

526
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,030
he would go home immediately after the meeting

527
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,920
to finish the level with you.

528
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,080
As for your pocket money,

529
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,750
Mr. Xu said

530
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,710
think of it as the payment

531
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,590
for fixing the handheld.

532
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,270
So that means no money for me.

533
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,590
Stop lying, I don't believe him.

534
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,590
How many times has he said that?

535
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,920
Has he ever kept his promise?

536
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,190
Work comes first.

537
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,310
That's what he said.

538
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,310
He doesn't care about me at all.

539
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,790
Stop pretending to be a good father.

540
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,080
He said he cared about me?

541
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,310
To hell with that.

542
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,310
He actually does care about you.

543
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,550
What does that have to do with you?

544
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,000
You're everywhere.

545
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,840
What is her position?

546
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,670
Fire her.

547
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,470
This lady doesn't

548
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,320
work for us.

549
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,190
Ignore him, ignore him.

550
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,070
Leave it to me.

551
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,430
I have

552
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,070
a playboy that I grew up playing.

553
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,270
My dad

554
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,160
carved some words on it for me.

555
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
What are those words?

556
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,510
To Xiao Dong, my son.

557
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,360
[To Xiao Dong, my son]

558
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,800
What are you doing?

559
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,070
See it yourself.

560
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,240
[To Xiao Dong, my son]

561
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,400
But at that time,

562
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,310
I was rebellious and immature.

563
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,550
I always caused him trouble.

564
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,200
Hang on,

565
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,550
how did you know?

566
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,430
Let me see...

567
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,120
Xiao Dong,

568
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,750
your teacher just called and

569
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,240
said you skipped class again today.

570
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,710
Nobles don't attend classes.

571
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,640
That's normal, isn't it?

572
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Non-mainstream.

573
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,320
Is that an ear stud?

574
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,880
Let go.

575
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,670
Is that an ear stud?

576
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,550
Ouch! Ouch!

577
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,630
Let go!

578
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,590
Give me my wig back!

579
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,350
Stop her!

580
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,160
Give me my wig back!

581
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,550
I'm going to teach you a lesson for your father.

582
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,350
You break my wings, I will destroy your paradise.

583
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,680
We're here, this is the place.

584
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,870
Ouch.

585
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,600
Ouch.

586
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,640
Let go.

587
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Ouch.

588
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,160
Go in.

589
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,990
It really hurts.

590
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,870
Open the door.

591
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,630
I don't have the key.

592
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,070
Open the door.

593
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,590
I don't have the key.

594
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,800
Xiao Dong.

595
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,870
Aunt.

596
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,270
You know my aunt?

597
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,200
-No.
-Xiao Dong,

598
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,790
this is the girl

599
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,440
who took you home, right?

600
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,830
I heard it from the front desk.

601
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,440
It was you who took Xiao Dong home.

602
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,440
Thank you.

603
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,880
Why do you keep blocking your face

604
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,830
with your scarf?

605
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,270
Is it because you can't be seen?

606
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,270
Her face got acne.

607
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,550
Don't talk nonsense, kid.

608
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,590
When your dad comes home, remember to tell me.

609
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,469
I have something important

610
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,350
I need to tell him.

611
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,360
Do you have a pen and paper?

612
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,389
Yes.

613
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
Call this number.

614
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Ask your dad to be careful of Piggy Tech.

615
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,320
See you next time.

616
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
There will be no next time.

617
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
It's not up to you,

618
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,190
it's up to the universe.

619
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,679
Thank you.

620
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,710
Thank you.

621
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,600
Aunt,

622
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,949
not every adult is

623
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,920
as smart as my dad,

624
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
right?

625
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,360
You brat.

626
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,440
And you,

627
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,400
your teacher called again.

628
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,710
Did you skip class?

629
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,429
I couldn't reach Brother-in-law on his phone.

630
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,440
You had me worried sick.

631
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,030
Are you not going to

632
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,590
listen to me?

633
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,110
No matter what I say?

634
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,510
Anyway...

635
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,070
It's fine that you don't listen to me,

636
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,630
my sister is watching you from heaven.

637
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,480
Adults are so nagging.

638
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,830
Xiao Dong.

639
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,870
This kid.

640
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,720
[Looks like]

641
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,070
[the idea of telling Uncle Xu]

642
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,840
[in advance]

643
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,720
[is hard to pull off.]

644
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,760
[What can]

645
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,070
[I do next?]

646
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,510
[Who else can I get to help me?]

647
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,840
Summer Time.

648
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,120
Chu Xia,

649
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,590
didn't you say you were resting at home?

650
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,590
Why are you here?

651
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,920
Yuan Yuan?

652
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,920
What's going on with your face?

653
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,630
Can you tell I've lost weight?

654
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,990
I lost another

655
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,800
0.1 kg this morning.

656
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,960
[I remember it now.]

657
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,550
[Yuan Yuan had a chubby face back then.]

658
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,400
Hang on,

659
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,320
where did you find

660
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:04,950
such an ancient photo?

661
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,830
Alright now.

662
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,470
You seem thinner, thinner.

663
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,480
It's quite obvious.

664
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,030
Do you think

665
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,550
I should lose more weight?

666
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,510
Maybe I should get a V-Line surgery.

667
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,670
Are you insane?

668
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,920
Listen to me,

669
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,630
your ex-boyfriends

670
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,430
were blind.

671
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,280
Don't mind them.

672
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,630
You should feel lucky

673
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,470
because you get to

674
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,440
meet a better man, don't you think so?

675
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,760
Because

676
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,480
you're my best friend,

677
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,230
that's why you said that to console me.

678
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
Don't say that.

679
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,230
In the matter of loving you,

680
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,760
anything I say is the truth.

681
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,550
Anyway,

682
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,190
I already read your fortune.

683
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,000
You will have a good boyfriend

684
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,150
who is obedient and

685
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,200
will do whatever you say

686
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,080
in the future.

687
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,720
Master,

688
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,000
tell me more.

689
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,320
When will I meet him?

690
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,280
