00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,650
I'm so tired.

6
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,770
I should be the one saying that.

7
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,130
Can you ask

8
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,450
what's-its-name Turing

9
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,690
what it has found out

10
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,250
about my identity?

11
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,570
I'll do it even if you didn't ask.

12
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,770
Such a hassle.

13
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,650
Xiao Dong, open up.

14
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,690
Xiao Dong, open up. It's me.

15
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,850
One thing after another.

16
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,770
We can't let him find out

17

you're here.

18

Come.

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,770
Xiao Dong, open up. It's me.

20
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,770
Go inside.

21
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,290
Stay here. Don't say a word.

22
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,370

Dinner.

27
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,690
Don't need it.

28
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,170
Xu Xiao Dong,

29
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,970
what is the meaning of this?

30
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,810
You keep chasing me away

31
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,970
since yesterday.

32
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,570
No, I...

33
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,170
Why did it take so long

34
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,210
for you to open the door?

35
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,650
Are you hiding something in there

36
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,810
that you don't want anyone to know about?

37
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,570
Xu Xiao Dong,

38
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,290
are we still best friends

39
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,730
that talk about everything?

40
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,690
You said on the day of the Super Moon

41
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,210
a girl appeared next to you?

42
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,770
Yes.

43
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,130
Not only that,

44
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,250
she can't leave you

45
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,650
like a little tail?

46
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,730
Yes.

47
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,970
Why do good things like this

48
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,210
never happen to me?

49
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,450
Xu Xiao Dong,

50
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,090
are you sick?

51
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,090
I'm very much conscious.

52
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,010
But you're acting weird.

53
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,810
What smells so good?

54
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,850
That smells so good.

55
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,890
I'm dying of hunger.

56
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,730
Where can I find food?

57
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,810
But anyway,

58
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,610
I've met a lot of

59
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,970
pretty girls under the moonlight.

60
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,769
The ones that

61
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,250
finish their money every month.

62
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,450
By the way,

63
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,290
Xiao Dong,

64
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,690
could it be the Turing

65
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,210
that you developed has gone rogue

66
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,970
and has affected your brain waves,

67
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,050
so you believe that
illusions are the truth?

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,850
AIs are

69
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,170
very developed nowadays.

70
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,370
One day, they just might

71
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,010
replace humans.

72
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,810
Xiao Dong,

73
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,610
give Qin Yue a call.

74
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,490
Why?

75
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,050
I think it must be because

76
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,610
you're too bored being a programmer

77
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,730
and you need your goddess

78
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,130
to help you readjust.

79
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,490
Jin Xiao Rui,

80
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,570
don't use your dirty way of thinking

81
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,170
to label the relationship of others.

82
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,930
Okay, you're right.

83
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,570
Didn't you say that

84
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,690
the pretty girl under the moonlight

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,490
can't leave your side?

86
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,130
Ask her out.

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,810
We'll get to know each other

88
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,890
and be friends. Alright?

89
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,370
No.

90
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,170
The whole world will know

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,450
if you know.

92
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,450
You're looking down on me.

93
00:04:59,530 --> 00:04:59,850
Eat.

94
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,610
I don't believe you.

95

99

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,770
Stop yelling.

101

Hello.

102
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,890
Stop yelling.

103
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,770
She'll hear you.

104
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,530
I'm telling you.

105
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,850
What are you doing?

106
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,930
What's in your room?

107
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,250
Nothing.

108
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,450
Xu Xiao Dong, you're hiding
something from me.

109
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,330
Ouch.

110
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,050
Someone is calling you.

111
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,570
You...

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:34,810
Someone is asking you out.

113
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,770
You're too invested in this.

114
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,490
What are you doing?

115
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,530
Time to leave.

116
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,610
If you're hiding something from me,

117
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,890
we won't be best friends anymore.

118

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,409
Get out.

125
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,050
Hurry.

00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,450
Xiao Dong. I'm here.

128
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,290
Open the door.

129
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,170
Yes.

130
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,050
Have you lost your words?

131
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,530
It stops you from being a hassle.

132
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,890
Come in.

133
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,650
Good evening, Xiao Dong.

134
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,170
Welcome to the lab.

135
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,570
What's this?

136
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,930
Turing.

137
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,450
Hello, I'm Turing.

138
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,690

Pretty girl under the moonlight.

140
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,330
We finally meet.

141
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,050
You have a lot of secrets here.

142
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,970
Don't go.

143
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,850
There's no secret.

144
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,130
I have a friend

145
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,450
who's a game developer.

146
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,170
He's rich and likes to keep
a low profile.

147
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,610
I'm just helping him

148
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,530
take care of this place for now.

149
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,410
Then why did you

150
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,770
use your room as the entrance?

151
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,290
We're close.

152
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,090
I can't look?

153
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,650
Why?

154
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,370
It's every man's heaven in there.

155
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,090
Really?

156
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,890
And every woman's hell.

157
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm curious.

158
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,650
Okay.

159
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,530
Let's go and solve your problem.

160
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,409
Let's go.

161
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,530
Scan failed.

162
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,730
Rerun a detailed analysis.

163
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,930
Scan analysis failed.

164
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,530
Try to say something.

165
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,010
One,

166
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,970
two, three.

167
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,450
Voice recording failed.

168
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,530
End tests.

169
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,930
Don't, try again.

170
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,410
Turing is a super AI.

171
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,530
If even he failed to run tests,

172
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,090
there really isn't any other solution.

173
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,570
That's why you should
try a few more times.

174
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,370
Are you listening to me?

175
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,610
Are you listening?

176
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,530
I'm thinking...

177
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,169
Turing,

178
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,330
what just happened?

179
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,809
We've been affected by
an unknown magnetic field.

180
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,890
Failed to detect

181
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,049
related information.

182
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,490
There are changes in the magnetic field energy.

183
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
You managed to affect

184
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,970
the magnetic field around us?

185
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,250
I'll think of something.

186
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,050
Please keep your emotions under control.

187
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,930
Okay?

188
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,290
Deep breaths.

189
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,210
Magnetic disturbance has disappeared.

190
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,250

193
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,250

194
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,170

Professor...

198
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,850
Can you please calm down?

199
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,810
Your yelling

200
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,650
reminds me of

201
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,690
a gorilla during mating season.

202
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,050
Peace and silence.

203
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,770
Professor, it's not the
problem of the machine.

204
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,450
After analysing the data,

205
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,370
this really is related to the Super Moon.

206
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,330
The Super Moon that only
appears once every decade

207
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,330
will appear tonight.

208
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,610
The moon

209
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,330
just flashed.

210
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,290
Turing,

211
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,970
compile all news

212
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,730
from around the world

213
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,890
about the Super Moon for me.

214
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,250
Run an analysis

215
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,890
and report back to me.

216
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,890
There is an increase in news

217
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,810
about the Super Moon.

218
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,490
At the same time,

219
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,170
more than one physics lab

220
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,330
detected gravitational waves

221
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,570
caused by a black hole.

222
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,290
Gravitational waves?

223
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,450
What did you say?

224
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,730
Gravitational waves?

225
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,690
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

226
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,370
Hurry.

227
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:58,970
Didn't I mention to

228
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,010
inform me first thing

229
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,730
when it comes to gravitational waves?

230
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,730
This Super Moon

231
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,290
is indeed different

232
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,410
from the others.

233
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,210
A lot of netizens are

234
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,130
debating that

235
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,090
this Super Moon

236
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,010
might have caused some

237
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,370
strange cosmic phenomena.

238
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,650
The last time the super moon appeared

239
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,570
was ten years ago.

240
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,170
I heard at that time

241
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,170
there were a lot of

242
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,490
inexplicable incidents.

243
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,250
Could you be

244
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,650
an alien?

245
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,290
Do you want to witness

246
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,810
the power of an alien?

247
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,690
It's fine.

248
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,730
Professor,

249
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,090
when the Super Moon

250
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,370
was at its peak,

251
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,330
the gravitational wave

252
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,490
sent out some energy

253
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,370
towards Earth.

254
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,250
That's so close.

255
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,370
The data of this gravitational wave

256
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,130
is so close to the one

257
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,290
detected ten years ago.

258
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,410
Is this a coincidence or a pattern?

259
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,290
Could it be that

260
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,530
the Super Moon

261
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,210
brought a huge present

262
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,290
to us?

263
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,010
Xiao Dong,

264
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,370
she, the unknown creature,

265
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,250
could be a cosmic neighbour.

266
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,770
The cousin seems to
have run out of energy.

267
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,650
So her classification is

268
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,170
human.

269
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,410
Hello, Winter.

270
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,530
I don't remember my name

271
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:34,850
and I don't know

272
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,610
why I appeared here.

273
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,370
But you must know

274
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,690
how it feels like

275
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,570
to be alone

276
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,410
in a foreign place,

277
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,370
right?

278
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,010
But I don't know if I can

279
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,890
find a life

280
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,290
that truly belongs to me

281
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,690
like you did.

282
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,090

where life changes, ♫

287
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,730
I'm not sleeping.

288
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,930
I...

289
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,450
I was wondering if

290
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,490
you'd take a walk around the city

291
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,850
with me if you're free

292
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,770
tomorrow night?

293
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,530
If you lived

294
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,170
here before, then...

295
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,850
I might bump into someone I know.

296
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,730
Yes.

297
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,210
Let's go then.

298
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,850
It's late.

299
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,170
You've had your rest,

300
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,890
but I still need to sleep.

301
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,210
I didn't sleep.

302
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,570
Two options,

303
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,810
sleep on the sofa or the bed?

304
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,770
Why are you thinking of taking the sofa?

305
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,810
You're making me shy.

306
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,050
You'll sleep on the sofa
and I'll sleep on the bed.

307
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,930
No...

308
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,050
No. Good night.

309
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,530
Isn't it comfortable?

310
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:24,650
No.

311
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,410
Aren't you a gentleman?

312
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,450
Gentlemen need to rest too.

313
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,050
Good night and goodbye.

314
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,330
Perfect.

315
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,570
Xuan He.

316
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,210
Why are you here?

317
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,570
Where's Xuan He?

318
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,330
Something came up so
President Wei won't be coming.

319
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,730
This is a present as compensation.

320
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,850
It's just a bag.

321
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,530
I can afford it.

322
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,930
President Wei gave you a present
despite his busy schedule.

323
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,690
He treats you well.

324
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,250
You're the one who bought it, right?

325
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,730
He treats me well

326
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,090
compared to whom?

327
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,250
Miss Qin,

328
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,410
I think it's better if you

329
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,890
don't compare yourself with his ex.

330
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,730
Although she's been missing for a decade,

331
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,330
she is still irreplaceable

332
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,490
in President Wei's heart.

333
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,570
Instead of focusing on the past,

334
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,810
you should find a way

335
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,250
to be his most important person now.

336
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,450
What are you talking about?

337
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,370

It's finally quiet.

354
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,130
Why are you back in here?

355
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,690
How would I know?

356
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,090
You scared me to death.

357
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,130
It must be becuase of an increase

358
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,200
in your fatigue

359
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,690
that's causing our

The living room is pretty big.

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,330
You might run around.

363
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,250
Come,

364
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,170
let me arrange a spot for you.

It's comfortable.

368
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,530
Stand here.

369
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,730
Don't move.

370
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,210
Let me test it out.

371
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,850
Test it.

372
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,770
Still alright.

373
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,850
Still alright.

Still alright.

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,170
Still alright.

376
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,770
Good night.

377
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,010
No, could you turn around?

I'll keep looking at you.

381
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,810
Would you still sleep?

382
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,610
This is probably

within the longest distance.

384
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,250
You'll take the bed
and I'll take the couch.

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,650
Happy?

386
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,370
Thank you.

For what...

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,330
Just don't bother me.

I think I'm hungry too.

Happy now?

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,490
No.

404
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,730
It's not authentic.

405
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,010
Not authentic?

406
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,050
Let me tell you,

407
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,850
for authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice,

408
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,690
the rice has to be stir-fried

409
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,890
with chicken oil first.

410
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,970
And the water used to boil the rice

411
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,930
has to be chicken soup.

412
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,250
And the meat

413
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,450
has to be kept in subzero water

414
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,090
after it's cooked

415
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,930
to ensure

416
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,890
that the chicken is soft

417
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,250
and the skin is crispy.

418
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,850
This is just a simplified version.

419
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,810
Very professional.

420
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,690
If you're not happy,

421
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,370
why did you eat that much?

422
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,290
Just to try it out.

423
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,610
We're at a new place.

424
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,050
I have to try it out.

425
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,330
No,

426
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,370
but you said you

427
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,130
don't remember anything, right?

428
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,370
How come you

429
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,170
remember this so clearly?

430
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,570
Are you from Hainan?

431
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,890
What I'm trying to say is...

432
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,730
a lot of people said that

433
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,370
people tend to relate the

434
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,930
memory of taste to home.

435
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,810
Think hard and see

436
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,090
if you remember something.

437
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,770
I said I've tried.

438
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,570
Maybe...

439
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,810
I don't have a family.

440
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,970
If not, why didn't anyone

441
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,650
realise or look for me

442
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,690
when I've disappeared for so long?

443
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,250
Or maybe

444
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,450
it's just like you said,

445
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,450
I'm an alien.

446
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,330
So other than

447
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,330
teleportation,

448
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,210
do you have

449
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,570
any other skills?

Make money appear.

451
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,770
Make money appear?

452
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,370
I earn too little.

453
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,170
Can you afford to pay for this meal?

454
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,210
I'll pay.

455
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,890

457
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,490
And the tea.

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,450

[Alien-60-2]

460
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,930
plus two.

461
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,970
62.

462
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,410
So stingy.

463
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,010
Do you want to...

464
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,930
I don't want to eat anymore.

465
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,810
You might not be able to pay.

466
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,930
Okay. Let's go.

467
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,490
You feel sad

468
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,530
and get upset.

469
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,010
You throw tantrums when you're angry.

470
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,650
You binge eat when you're hungry.

471
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,170
No matter how I see it,

472
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,250
you're just a normal,

473
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,170
basic human being.

474
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,530
Can normal humans teleport?

475
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,410
Who am I really?

476
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,890
I want to go home so badly.

477
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,010
I'm a realist.

478
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,650
Even though there's no explanation

479
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,570
for what's going on,

480
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,530
you're really behaving

481
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,610
like a con artist.

482
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,410
What's wrong?

483
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,210
Come.

484
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,090
Why are you out?

485
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,370
Go, go back.

486
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,130
Go back, don't jump.

487
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,370
Are there cat-related memories

488
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,370
in your mind?

489
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,530
Even cats

490
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,810
have a family.

491
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,290
But I'm all alone.

492
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,890
I'll help you find your family,

493
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,890
and help you find yourself.

494
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,450
Really?

495
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,210
Why would I lie?

496
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,970
What's wrong?

497
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,130
Are you crying?

498
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,610
No one's crying.

499
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,530
You probably look good

500
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,170
when you're crying.

501
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,530
That's not what I meant.

502
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,850
I mean you can relax.

503
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,410
You are dumb,

504
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,770
you eat a lot,

505
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,490
and you always mess things up
with your help,

506
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,130
but

507
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,650
when I find your family,

508
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,690
I'll get everything back

509
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,250
with interest.

510
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,130
Hold on.

511
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,450
What are you talking about?

512
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,450
Why are you being sarcastic?

513
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,170
Nothing.

514
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,970
Whoever answers...

515
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,170
It's raining.

516
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,460
We need to get back already.

517
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,210
I'll blame you

518
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,930
if I catch a cold. Let's go.

519
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,890
Hurry, let's go.

520
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,770
But...

521
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,690
this...

522
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,570
What's wrong?

523
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,650
What are you doing?

524
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,490
Put it down.

525

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,490
that she'll just sit at the side.

872
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,250
She won't cause any trouble.

873
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,930
Don't delay any work.

874
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,650
Don't delay any work.

875
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,290
Good job.

876
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,010
You go first.

877
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,610
Okay.

878
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,530
Wait for me right here.

879
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,130
Don't touch anything.

881
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,690
Excuse me, sirs,

882
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,970
The Mouton that you've ordered is here.

883
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,970
Would you like to let it breathe?

884
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,850
Yes.

885
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,850
Mr. Li, your turn.

886
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,730
Okay, let me take over.

887
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,010
I can't go on anymore.

888
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,410
You must have thrown the game.

889
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,490
No no.

890
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,490
With this shot,

891
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,610
we'll have to catch a birdie.

Good one.

894
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,090
82 strokes.

895
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,930
That's nothing compared to Mr Xia.

896
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,130
How many strokes did Mr Xia say he took?

897
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,250
He said more than a hundred.

898
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,410
He's bluffing.

899
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,010
I should send a picture to him.

900
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,930
Yes, take a picture for me.

Take a picture and send it to him.

He'll definitely lose it.

Let's take a picture with our phones.
