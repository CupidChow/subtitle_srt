That's exactly why I'm mad.

144

Speaking of Summer's Kiss,

148
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,230
I got dumped that year.

149
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,220
So, I was in a horrible mood.

150
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,470
I didn't feel like moving or eating.

151
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,670
You were so worried.

152
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,910
Then, one day, you brought Summer's Kiss right to me.

153
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,030
You said that it represents the summer's kiss

154
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,830
my future boyfriend would give me.

155
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,350
After I ate it,

156
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,870
I became so happy.

157
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,350
I felt like my love was coming back.

158
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,630
Was I so romantic?

159
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,710
Of course.

160
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,030
You didn't know this.

161
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,190
All our customers who had tried Summer's Kiss
spread the word around.

162
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,870
They said the cake is just like its name.

163
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,110
Eating it feels like being kissed by summer itself.

164
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,630
It feels gentle and inspiring.

165
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,990
It's true.

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,470
I didn't make any notes about a romantic cake like that?

167
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,830
This is what you said.

168
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,710
You said Summer's kiss is a cake that you made

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,620
But now?

172
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,430
Yeah, I don't know who gave me such confidence.

173
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,750
Yuan Yuan.

174
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,790
I'm buying all your bread today.

175
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,670
Your fanboy is here.

176
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,590
Take a look, take a gander.

177

Don't miss our bread!

Try it, it tastes pretty nice!

185
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,070
This is not the personality I had in mind.

186
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,190
I want to be the bossy president type.

187
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,670
Bossy president?

188
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,110
Say, instead of going to work,

189
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,150
you just had to come here to get tortured.

190
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,990
That's because...

191
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,710
Because of what?

192
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,950
Listen, Jin Xiao Rui.

193
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,590
If there's even a morsel of bread in this sampling box
by the end of the day,

194
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,270
don't even come in anymore, got it?

195
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,190
Okay.

196
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,350
Can I go in now?

197
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,390
No.

You're not letting me in.

Listen, if you miss out on me now...

202
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,300
What?

203
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,750
I'll wait for you next time.

Are you planning to get yourself buried
in the graveyard today?

206
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,910
Yuan Yuan, are you threatening me?

207
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,270
If you threaten me,

208
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,550
I'll continue doing this.

Were you wrong?

Are you still going to throw more cheesy lines?

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,390
I need to go out a while.

I'm going to look for Wei Xuan He.

Of course not.

247

Do you remember that I made a cake called Summer's Kiss?

248

Of course I do.

249
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,350
So, you're here today to ask me about Summer's Kiss?

250

Yeah.

251
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,870
I can't really remember how to make it.

252
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,870
So, I wanted to ask if I've ever told you how to make it.

253
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,190
Of course.

how Summer's Kiss was made?

Of course.

But, you have to do three things for me.

262
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,630
Then, if I can do them, it's a deal.

Activate the Candy App.

341
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,110
Execute the second plan.

342
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,110
Attack the system's weakness.

343
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,110
Back then, this restaurant
was a famous go-to spot among couples.

344
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,190
Many couples came here to celebrate their anniversaries.

345
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,790
Back when we're studying,

346
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,870
you had always wanted to go on a date with me here.

347
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,150
But, I was poor.

348
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,940
I didn't rely on my family.

349
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,070
I worked hard alone to start my own business.

350
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,150
You would also give me your hard-earned money
from part-time jobs.

351
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,950
Back then, what we did often

352
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,870
was standing in front of this restaurant

353
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,950
and flipping through the pages of their menu.

354
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,750
You'd keep telling me

355
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,350
which dish is the chef's signature dish

356
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,150
and which dessert is a must-try.

357
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,470
And so, we analyzed each dish one by one.

358
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,750
There were so many to remember.

359
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,310
That's why I brought you here

360
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,670
to make up for the regret we had back in our university days.

361
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,510
I also wanted to give myself a chance.

362
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,710
I wanted to tell you this.

363
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,350
Chu Xia.

364
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,110
If there's anything you need,

365
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,710
I can satisfy you.

366
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
As long as you want it,

367
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,630
I can give you.

368
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,230
Thank you for telling me
about such precious moments in the past.

369
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,790
But, I really don't remember even an inkling of what you said.

370
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,510
As I look at these exquisite dishes,

371
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,060
I can't understand

372
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,310
why I would be so obsessed with this restaurant in the past.

373
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,100
Was it because I wanted to try the food here,

374
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,180
or was it because
I wanted to experience the atmosphere here?

375
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,630
But, there's a voice in my heart telling me

376
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,350
that I want to be with the person I like

377
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,670
and experience the small, meaningful
moments in life together.

378
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,260
I want to spend more time with him.

379
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,860
I see.

380
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,350
I didn't know about this back when we were studying.

381
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,910
But, Chu Xia.

382
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,990
I don't mind you losing your memory.

383
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,910
I just want you to come back.

384
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,110
As long as we're together,

385
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,710
for the rest of our life,

386
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,110
we can create a better future with better memories.

387
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,870
Don't you think it's nice to have a new life?

388
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,070
Why do I feel that it's not me
who's affected by the past, but you?

389
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,790
I may want to find my lost memories,

390
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,990
but that doesn't mean I want to live like how I did in the past.

391
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,110
I think I should stand on the shoulders of the past

392
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,430
and go to a future that belongs to me.

393
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,310
Since time itself played a joke on us,

394
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,190
we should take this opportunity to start anew

395
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,750
instead of living in emotions and memories of the past.

396
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,820
We should have a new goal, a new direction, a new wish.

397
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,670
For instance, my wish now is
to know how to make Summer's Kiss.

398
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,350
The way you're so eager to know how to make Summer's Kiss

399
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,270
is exactly like how you were in the past.

400
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,390
Eat up.

401
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,790
I'm so sorry!

402
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,710
-It's okay. -Why are you so careless?

403
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm so sorry.

404
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,390
-It's okay. -I'm sorry.

405
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,350
What happened? Are you okay?

406
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,150
I'm fine.

407
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,510
-Apologize. -I'm so sorry.

408
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,270
I'm sorry, ma'am.

409
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,060
Mr. Wei, I'm so sorry.

410
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,070
We startled you and your girlfriend.

411
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,790
How about this? This meal is on the house.

412
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,350
No, don't.

413
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,070
First, I'm not his girlfriend.

414
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,350
Also, you don't have to offer us a free meal.

415
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,430
Are you really okay?

416
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,390
I'm really fine.

417
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,340
Okay, everything's fine.

418
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,310
Okay.

419
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,790
I'm really fine.

420
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,980
Xiao Dong.

421
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,310
Ignore that jerk, Zhou Sui.

422
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,070
He's up to his old shenanigans.

423
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,700
He keeps ragging on newbies like us.

424
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,710
Do you know why our department does the most jobs

425
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,100
yet gets the least bonus?

426
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,430
That's because Zhou Sui took all our credit.

427
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,510
We can't help it.

428
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,310
Brother Sui is the most senior around here.

429
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,950
Still, we have Chu Xia.

430
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,300
Xiao Dong, is she coming tomorrow?

431
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,600
[You have a new message]

432
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,740
[Credit card payment at 13:27
to Peninsula Restaurant, 8678 yuan]

433
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,940
[Credit card payment at 13:27
to Peninsula Restaurant, 8678 yuan]

434
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,990
Xiao Dong, someone stole your credit card info.

435
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,710
Want to call the police?

436
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,830
This place, Peninsula Restaurant, is a famous dating spot.

437
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,670
I seem to remember
that Chu Xia has access to Xiao Dong's card.

438
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,230
I know.

439
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,710
Chu Xia is using Xiao Dong's card

440
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,860
on a date with another guy!

441
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,350
Xiao Dong, we're all men.

442
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,670
We've been through this.

443
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,190
Yeah.

444
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,190
We're all men, right?

445
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,700
We all go through this.

446
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,110
Don't worry, we're with you.

447
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,070
It's no big deal.

448
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,630
See, Liang and Da Bao have been through this.

449
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,470
Xiao Dong.

450
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,500
We, the Lone Wolves Alliance, are always behind you!

451
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,990
We're behind you!

452
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,100
Love is sweet, until she cheats.

453
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,190
Let's go.

454
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,140
You're still the same as ever.

455
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,310
You're a heroine.

456
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,630
A heroine who fights to foot the bill.

457
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,350
Since I'm asking you for a favour,
of course I should foot the bill.

458
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,670
Just tell me your last condition.

459
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,510
If I complete all your requests,

460
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,900
you'll tell me how to make Summer's Kiss, right?

461
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,830
About that last request, no rush.

462
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,550
But, about the recipe for Summer's Kiss...

463
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,630
I'm not telling you.

464
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,670
Why won't you tell me?

465
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,510
That's the answer for the recipe.

466
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,070
Back then, when I casually asked you about it,

467
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,390
that's how you replied.

468
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,630
You even gave me a weird remark.

469
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,430
You said,

470
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,790
"Love is a ray of sunshine that shines on you."

471
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,030
Why would someone say something so brainless?

472
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,780
Anyway, thank you.

473
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,630
I'm off, then.

474
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,590
Are you really okay?

475
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,750
Do you need to go to the hospital?

476
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,470
It was a tiny bump. Nothing can happen.

477
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,270
It's better to be careful when it comes to your head.

478
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,710
I'll bring you to the hospital. Let's go.

479
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,430
Do I have to?

480
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,350
Doctor, how's her condition?

481
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,670
I'm her family.

482
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,670
Just tell me if there are any problems.

483
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,990
Her condition is unusual.

484
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,380
Memory loss is usually caused by brain trauma.

485
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,150
But, the results of her brain's CT scan are normal.

486
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,190
If we exclude pathological changes in the organs,

487
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,070
it's more likely that her memory loss is psychogenic.

488
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,070
Has she experienced any serious emotional trauma?

489
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,670
Probably no.

490
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,630
Then, can she still regain her memories?

491
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,750
Her condition is considered to be global amnesia.

492
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,870
There's a high likelihood
that her memory loss will be permanent.

493
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,550
That means

494
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,270
it's very likely that she won't recall her past anymore?

495
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,150
It's possible.

496
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,870
I'll give you a ride back.

497
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,750
I'll just rent a bike over there.

498
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,980
You learned how to cycle?

499
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:38,790
Yeah.

500
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,630
No, it's okay. I'll drive you back.

501
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,590
You're injured.

502
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,510
You call that injured? My god.

503
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,190
They did nothing other than a full body checkup.

504
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,350
I'm worried about your health.

505
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,150
My health?

506
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,870
I'm perfectly healthy.

507
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,910
Of course, it'd be better if I can remember Summer's Kiss.

508
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,630
I'm off, bye.

509
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,270
Okay.

510
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,390
Hello?

511
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,230
President Wei, it's me.

512
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,910
Are you still considering?

513
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,550
Time waits for no one.

514
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,470
Listen, this is an amazing project.

515
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,630
You'd regret if you miss out.

516
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,550
Stop hesitating.

517
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,030
President Zhao.

518
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,710
I've pondered about it.

519
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,990
Let's stop working together.

520
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,510
What?

521
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,070
The sun has risen.

522
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,750
I don't want to go back to the darkness.

523
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,190
Chu Xia.

524
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,590
[Delicious bread, 50% off]
Do you think this would really work?

525
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,710
[Delicious bread, 50% off]
Of course.

526
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,550
Other than your fanboy buying all that bread just now,

527
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,390
we didn't sell any bread today.

528
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,870
It may be a bad start,

529
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,510
but traditionally, bakeries that offer evening discounts
can't discard their bread.

530
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,830
Those traditional bakeries have long gone out of business.

531
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,630
There are two kinds of glorious moments for bread.

532
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,350
First, when it's fresh out of the oven.

533
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,950
Second, it's now.

534
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,990
How did you come up with so many philosophies
after a meal with Wei Xuan He?

535
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,830
What philosophies?

536
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,230
I'm trying to feel its meaning.

537
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,870
Wait.

538
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,150
Xu Xiao Dong is here to pick you up.

539
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,150
Why does it seem to me that he's glum?

540
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,510
Glum is an understatement.

541
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,430
He's not glum. He's angry.

542
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,310
Why is he angry?

543
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,790
I used his card.

544
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,190
It was pretty expensive.

545
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,670
Nice job.

546
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,590
He's here.

547
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,630
I admit that I went to an expensive restaurant
and used your card.

548
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,060
But, their food was really delicious.

549
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,270
It was worth the money.

550
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,310
So, while you were dating with your ex-boyfriend there,

551
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,830
did you recall anything?

552
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,230
Sorry, excuse me.

553
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,630
Is today's bread actually getting sour?

554
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,350
How did you know?

555
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,830
No, that's not important.

556
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,910
Anyway, I think that meal was worth it.

557
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,020
After all, I found out that Wei Xuan He
doesn't know how Summer's Kiss was made.

558
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,910
Nice. At least you got something.

559
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,510
We're selling at half price. Want to buy some?

560
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,750
You used up all my money in the card.

561
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,150
I'll skip the bread, then.

562
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,430
So, I wanted to ask you out.

563
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,390
Professor Chen is inviting us to his lab for a checkup.

564
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,350
Do you have time?

565
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,780
Of course I have, but...

566
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,670
Didn't you say that you're joining an important project team?

567
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,830
You have time?

568
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,910
I have now.

569

Of course she's fine.

Don't go to unfamiliar areas.

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,510
Especially with a stranger.

581

You're still upset over me dining out with Wei Xuan He?

582

583
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,940
Yeah.

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,710
Did you shut the windows?

593
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,430
Yes.

594
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,070

00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,830
Bye.

605

00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,230
Why are you guys dating here?

607
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,830
It's not a date.

608
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,710
I know.

609
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,150
Still, for you to let them enter your lab,

610
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,750
you're giving me face after all.

611
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,550
How absurd. Ridiculous.

612
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,070
Is it ridiculous?

613
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,550
If it is ridiculous,

614
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,870
why did you pick me up from work?

615
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,150
Who picked you up?

616
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,510
Who'd know that I'd bump into you
at the supermarket that day?

617
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,350
A supermarket trip takes just about five minutes.

618
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,030
There are 24 hours in a day.

619
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,830
So, the probability of us meeting by chance is 3 out of 1000.

620
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,990
Do you believe in such a coincidence?

621
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,590
Just because the odds are low
doesn't mean it wouldn't happen.

622
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,390
It still happened despite the low odds.

623
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,190
Are you hinting that we share a destiny?

624
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,190
The odds of a satellite hitting Earth are low too.

625
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,350
If that happens, would you call it destiny or disaster?

626
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,990
If it's a disaster,

627
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,110
then why did you buy me medicine that day?

628
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,670
Who bought you medicine?

629
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,870
You snatched my phone and bought it yourself.

630
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,630
How can I snatch a phone from a strong man like you?

631
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,630
Even if I could, how would I know your WeChat password?

632
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,390
Even if I knew the password,
how would I know your payment code?

633
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,430
Face it, you bought me the medicine.

634
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,470
The way you keep going on and on is annoying!

635
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,060
I bought you the medicine so that I could clear my head!

636
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,630
I know you love it when it's clear.

637
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,550
That's why I came here without even applying makeup.

638
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,230
That's not what I mean by "clear".

639
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,990
Besides, your face looks so smooth today.

640
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,830
How are you not applying any makeup? This isn't scientific.

641
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,060
415 is a place that is based on science.

642
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,030
You're not scientific.

643
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,310
You can even tell if I'm wearing makeup or not.

644
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,830
How annoying!

645
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,670
You're a role model, Aunt Wei Wei.

646
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,060
Just you wait.

647
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,190

648
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,340
Chen Mo.

649
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,110
Wait!

650
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,430
Stand behind the yellow line.

651
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,790
Is this some kind of checkpoint?

652
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,190
Besides, where's the yellow line?

653
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,310
Miss Shen Wei Wei.

654
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,870
I'm warning you.

655
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,230
You are seriously affecting my work.

656
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,310
Chen Mo, speak the truth.

657
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,390
Are you scared of me?

658
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,910
What a joke.

659
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,430
415 is my lab. Why would I be scared of you?

660
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,510
If you're not scared of me, then why do you keep...

661
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,030
Burping?

662
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,710
My stomach is bloated
from eating too many nuts this morning.

663
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,700
You're already tempted.

664
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,390
Still trying to play hard to get.

665
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,790
Don't you feel yourself burning from being so close to me?

666
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,950
Keep your distance, will you?

667
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,950
Are you tired?

668
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,070
You've gone round and round so many times in my heart.

669
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,070
Okay, I'll buy your insurance.

670
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,550
I'll buy, okay?

671
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,070
Can you leave now?

672
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,430
What in the world do you want?

673
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,110
When you're in love, you act faster than your heart.

674
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,030
[When you're in love, you act faster than your heart.]

675
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,230
[That's love, right?]

676
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,989
Do you feel anything like a hint of happiness?

677
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,989
Or the taste of a little sunshine?

678
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,350
What about the taste of falling in love?

679
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,219
I've tried all five flavours here.

680
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,510
I couldn't taste anything like happiness, sunshine

681
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,830
or falling in love.

682
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,150
I only feel like something's stuck in my throat now.

683
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,750
That's strange.

684
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,030
You're giving up?

685
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,190
The phrase "give up" doesn't exist in my life.

686
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,830
Summer's Kiss, oh Summer's Kiss.

687
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,750
What should we do with you?

688
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,910
Summer's Kiss.

689
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,030
Why don't you kiss me?

690
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,630
Seriously, a kiss?

691
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,150
Think about it. What's it called?

692
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,220
It's called Summer's...

693
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,790
Kiss.

694
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,380
This isn't a good idea.

695
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,990
I...

696
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,310
Just try it, then.

697
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,590
Nana.

698
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,990
I want to know how a summer's kiss is like too.

699
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,230
Is this it, Summer's Kiss?

700
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,550
It just looks like a fancy cake.

701
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,710
Is it really that delicious?

703

You're awesome!

705
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,150
This tastes exactly the same as the cake ten years ago.

706
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,630
How did you recall it?

707
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,710
Yeah, didn't you lose your memory?

708
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,580
You could even remember the recipe for Summer's Kiss.

709
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,340
Then, if you use the same method,

710
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,430
do you think you can remember the other recipes you had?

711
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,110
No.

What does he have to do with how you remembered the cake?

716
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,990
You'd still babble even if I stuff your mouth.

Look at me, so forgetful.

I'm so busy with work until I got all muddled up.

727

Then, why don't you try this...

728
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,390
Is this even a celebration when my birthday's over?

729
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,910
You can have it.

730

What is it?

731
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,630
Xiao Dong, do you remember the app we worked on together?

732
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,190
No, I mean the app you tweaked.

733
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,670
It's been hacked.

734
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,590
There's a huge loophole inside now.

735
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,990
If we don't fix it right away,

736
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,300
the users we accumulated so far would all go to waste.

737
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,110
I've thought long and hard.

738
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,190
Only the developer can solve this.

739

I'm just a newbie who needs more training.

What kind of act are you pulling here?

743
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,790
Someone was there that day.

744
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,390
Don't you know how prideful I am?

745
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,350
I can't do anything now.

746
