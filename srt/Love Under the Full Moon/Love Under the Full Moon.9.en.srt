Hello.

I'm sorry I have something on.

I gave you a lot of coins,

But instead you're caught up
in issues with women.

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,370
Yes.

241
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,350
It's normal to be nervous
the first time you're here.

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,420

246
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,150
This isn't from our company?

247
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,780
Why would we copy it

if it's from our company?

249
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,660
Zhou Sui told me

250
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,270
that you are highly skilled.

251
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,430
But why do you seem a little slow?

252
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,530

very seriously.

Furthermore,

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,100
he would come over and check.

How's the progress?

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,330
I've split them into two groups,

268
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,420
one will collect information,

269
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,900
the other will simultaneously
consolidate the content.

It needs to be faster.

272
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,520
This smart method

273
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,170
is copied by a lot of other companies.

274
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
There's only one way for us to win.

275
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,870
And that's stealing faster than others.

Chu Xia,

341
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,240
other than Wei Xuan He
that you can't pick,

342
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,280
who would you choose
among the remaining two?

343
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:24,290
[A Winter]
[C Dong something]

344
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,760
Neither.

345
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,100
You should at least...

346
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,910
Xu Xiao Dong,

347
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,680
who do you think Chu Xia will pick?

348
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,450
Why ask him?

349
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,250
Both are...

350
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,250
Both are what?

351
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,720
I think there's a problem
with the comment system.

352
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,040
There are too many comments
unrelated to the topic.

353
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,040
I need to add on a filter.

354
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,000
Forget it.

355
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,170

356
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,120
is there a comment that talks about

357
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,460
the other owner

358
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,900
and the cute guy by her side

359
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,220
who's willing to do all the hard work?

360
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,600
-Let me see.
-Okay.

361
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,640
There's one here.

362
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,720
Really?

363
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,080
The comment suggests

364
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,730
the other owner

365
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,040
to beat up the cute guy by her side.

366

[Dong something.]

371
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,850
He's considered unremarkable?

372
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
No way.

373
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,980
So what if he just spends time with me?

374
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,110
Isn't that quite nice?

375

What?

378
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,530
It's C!

379
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,940
That looks like the moon.

380
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,740
It looks more like the sun!

381
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
Lei Chu Xia,

382
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,760
this is what it means by
"the hearts wants what it wants".

383
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,070
This little cookie

384
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,840
has exposed the secret in your heart.

385
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,130
What secret?

386
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,260
There's no secret.

387
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,740
Move.

388
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,860
It tastes quite good.

389
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,250
Why are you blushing then?

390
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
You're going to blush
if you stand next to the oven too.

391
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,240
Hurry, go.

392
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,610
So it's because the oven is too hot.

393
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,760
Miss Lei,

394
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,800
each cookie costs money,

395
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,080
don't waste it.

396
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,750
Yes, yes, go.

397
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,240

Stop that right now.

Just pick C.

402
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,800
Our teacher taught us to

403
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
just pick C
when you don't know the answer.

404
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,630
Do you want me to get Jin Xiao Rui?

405
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,090

407
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,630
Enough.

Yuan Yuan,

411
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,330
since I was so busy helping you

412
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,610
and didn't even have time for dinner,

413
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,730
could you go watch a movie with me?

414
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,940
I'd believe if Xu Xiao Dong didn't eat,

415
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,500
but if it's you,

416
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,860
I won't believe it.

417
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
Do you look like someone
who would sacrifice yourself?

418
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,360
I've sacrificed in vain then.

419
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,640
Let's go.

420
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,200

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,150
When will it be Rui something's turn?

513
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,720
Here, number eight.

514
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,090
Chu Xia.

515
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,420
What's wrong?

516
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,980
I'm fine. Probably because
I didn't sleep well.

517
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,980
Let's take a seat over there. Let's go.

518
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,270
-Why did she faint?
-What's wrong?

519
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,640
-Maybe she has low blood sugar.
-Chu Xia.

520
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,360
That's dangerous.

521
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,810
Chu Xia.

522
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,840
Chu Xia!

523
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,240
Help me call 120.

524
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,810
Chu Xia, wake up.

525
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,920
What's happening?

526
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,520
Xiao Rui!

527
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,870
-Chu Xia suddenly fainted.
-Help her up.

528
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,380
What happened to her?

529
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,440
Hang in there.

530
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,210
I don't know anything.

531
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,580
Don't worry,

532
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,740
I'm here.

533
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,470
Xiao Dong,

534
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,120
can you come with me?

535
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,530
Chu Xia's syncope

536
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,480
is due to loss of energy.

537
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,120
Would this be a hazard to her?

538
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,600
When she came here,
her energy was balanced.

539
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,520
But she broke them all after that.

540
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,810
There's too little data.

541
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,650
I don't know what's going to happen next.

542
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,260
But Professor Chen,

543
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,020
why would Chu Xia's magnetic field
suddenly become unstable?

544
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,920
Because this was in her wrist band.

545
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,440
The original wrist band was used
to control her magnetic field.

546
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,920
But after this was added,

547
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,929
it turned into an automatic emission
of energy.

548
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,270
There are less than five people

549
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,679
from my creation to

550
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,560
those who can get close to it
and make changes.

551
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,850
Professor Chen,

552
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,650
would you be able to find this person?

553
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,030
Of course.

554
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,560
If there's a sender,
there'll be a receiver.

555
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,580
I'll find this person.

556
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,220
Professor, the materials you need.

557
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,470
Leave them there.

558
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm leaving now.

559
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,430
Hold on.

560
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,760
What's that in your coat?

561
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,500
Show me.

562
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,640
Show me!

563
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,230
You were the one who tampered
with Chu Xia's wrist band.

564
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,520
Wang Yi Xin,

565
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,670
was it really you?

566
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,570
I don't know what you're talking about.

567
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,100
Stop pretending.

568
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,720
Why would you do that?

569
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,570
Would you be able to bear the
responsibility of taking a human life?

570
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,040
Human life?

571
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,920
Does she count as human?

572
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,370
What are you talking about?

573
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,480
Say that again.

574
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,110
Say that again!

575
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,870
Xiao Dong.

576
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,600
Listen.

577
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,930
He's my student.

578
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,300
Let me handle this.

579
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,260
I'll give you an explanation.

580
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,150
Go take care of Chu Xia.

581
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,610
Wang Yi Xin.

582
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,210
You're my top student.

583
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,930
But this time,

584
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,160
you've gone too far.

585
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,030
Why?

586
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,250
Professor.

587
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,170
We can harness the energy of the universe

588
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,620
and travel from past to future.

589
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,450
That's such a wonderful thing.

590
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,440
If we can

591
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,250
find out

592
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,650
the truth about her time-travelling,

593
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,650
it'll be an outstanding step

594
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,890
in the history of science.

595
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,690
Aren't you tempted?

596
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,260
I am.

597
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,000
Of course I'm tempted.

598
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,600
Should I murder you now then?

599
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,500
All the achievement and honour

600
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,000
of researching Chu Xia

601
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,000
would be mine then.

602
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,110
Right?

603
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,580
Should I kill you?

604
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,850
How is what you're doing now

605
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,740
different from murder?

606
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,530
Firstly,

607
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,170
I didn't commit murder.

608
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,640
Secondly,

609
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,570
is there energy to be

610
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,210
taken from humans?

611
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,670
I just did what I needed to do.

612
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,400
I just didn't expect

613
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,360
taking such a small amount of energy

614
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,100
would cause her to black out.

615
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,810
You know well that Chu Xia

616
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,400
will disappear if she runs out of energy.

617
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,180
If you take her energy,

618
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,920
it's the same as committing murder.

619
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,990
Where do you draw the line?

620
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,350
The line?

621
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,380
Professor Chen,

622
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,340
you were the one who told us

623
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,760
that science is crossing the line,
one step at a time!

624
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,810
Just because we cross the line
doesn't mean there's no line!

625
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,710
I also told you

626
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,100
that science is for
bringing happiness to people.

627
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,410
Not to bring harm.

628
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,760
Wang Yi Xin,

629
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,420
I'm giving you one last chance.

630
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,940
Stop everything you're doing

631
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,370
and apologise to Xiao Dong and Chu Xia.

632
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,990
Everything that I have done

633
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,450
is for the advancement of mankind.

634
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I didn't do wrong.

635
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,940
No,

636
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,460
you didn't do wrong.

637
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,980
I'm the one who's wrong.

638
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,190
Terribly wrong.

639
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,830
I've underestimated you.

640
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,900
You have big ambitions.

641
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,820
415

642
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,530
won't be able to contain you anymore.

643
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,720
[Wang Yi Xin]

644
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,350
Pack your things

645
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,790
and get out!

646
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,440
Stand still. Don't move.

647
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,080
Let me tell you, Jin Xiao Rui,

648
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,030
I'm asking you one last time.

649
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,890
Do you know it or not?

650
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,500
Yuan Yuan, I really don't know.

651
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,560
Don't know?

652
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,380
Say that again

653
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,840
and I'll give you clips.

654
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
More clips.

655
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,560
You decide what to do.

656
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,520
Are you going to tell?

657
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,640
Xiao Dong really didn't tell me anything.

658
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,320
I don't know anything about Chu Xia.

659
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,960
Do you think I'm blind?

660
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,320
I saw very clearly

661
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,330
how Chu Xia was in the afternoon.

662
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,750
Xu Xiao Dong came
and carried her off straight away.

663
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,730
I'm not going to believe
he doesn't know anything.

664
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,110
It's even harder to believe
that he knew something

665
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,600
and didn't tell you.

666
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm no longer best friend with Xiao Dong.

667
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
Why would he tell me anything?

668
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,010
Are you going to tell the truth?

669
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,340
I don't know.

670
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,320
Xiao Rui.

671
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,040
What are you...

672
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,840
Xiao Dong.

673
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,600
You're finally back!

674
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,520
Chu Xia.

675
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,760
Look at my face and hands.

676
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,480
Are you all right?

677
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,940
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

678
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,630
Why did you faint?

679
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,220
Why did I faint...

680
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,130
You should tell her.

681
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,600
So you knew!

682
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,190
I asked you the entire afternoon
and you just wouldn't say.

683
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,960
This is too important to Chu Xia.

684
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,010
I can't tell without her permission.

685
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,360
Tell her.

686
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,210
Tell her.

687
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,270
I'm the only one who doesn't know?

688
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,450
Before I tell,

689
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,170
can I remove the clips?

690
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,440
It hurts too much.
