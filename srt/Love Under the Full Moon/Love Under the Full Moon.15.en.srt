00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,120
just say something!

174
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,400
How did Xiao Dong react

175
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,280
after you told him?

176
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,910
I didn't dare to look at him.

177
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,920
At this moment,

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,550
isn't Xu Xiao Dong

179
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,040
supposed to trust you

180
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,630
with all his heart?

181
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,200
Also, Jin Xiao Rui,

182
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,830
what were you trying to say?

183
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,390
Do you not trust Chu Xia?

184
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,950
Yuan Yuan,

185
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,070
this matter is very crucial

186
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,030
to Xiao Dong.

187
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
He definitely needs time to think it over.

188
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,190
I have no right

189
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,270
to choose who to trust on his behalf.

190
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
He must be very upset now.

191
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,280
I'll go visit him.

192
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,790
I was asking

193
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,710
if you trust her,

194
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,870
I didn't ask about Xu Xiao Dong!

195
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,790
Do you think Chu Xia is not upset

196
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,120
right now?

197
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,600
Enough, enough.

198
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,640
Chu Xia,

199
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,670
don't care about them.

200
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,430
I trust you

201
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,600
with all my heart.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,670
But right now,

203
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,720
I don't even trust myself.

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,510
So don't blame them.

205
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,550
Now all I want

206
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,590
is to make up for my sins,

207
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,590
but I feel like everything that happened

208
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,870
is irreparable.

209
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,080
I don't know what to do.

210
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll stay by your side.

214
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,670
I lost again.

215
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
Is there a bug

216
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
in this game of yours?

217
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,070
I used the passing tips

218
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,320
that you gave me,

219
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,000
why would I still fail?

220
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,510
Since computer programs have been invented,

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,320
they have been used

222
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,670
for numerical calculations

223
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,960
and logical calculations.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,070
But do you know

225
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,840
what the future development

226
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,830
of the computer is?

227
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,550
What is it?

228
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,240
Intelligence.

229
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,070
The programs will have more

230
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,080
human-like intelligence,

231
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,790
and they'll be better

232
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,710
at studying

233
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,150
human's delicate emotions.

234
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,200
Doesn't this mean

235
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,460
that it is similar to the Turing program

236
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,000
[Turing Plan]
that it is similar to the Turing program

239
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,670
Yes, you're right.

240
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,790
So,

241
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,200
when you're playing games,

242
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,080
don't just focus on the techniques

243
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,510
or tips

244
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
and be restricted.

245
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,480
You have to trust your heart.

246
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,590
Connect with the game

247
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,030
through your inner feelings.

248
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
At last,

249
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,120
you will win.

250
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,840
I hope this is how

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,800
you live your life.

252
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,630
Trust your heart

256

260
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,030
I thought that you're in a bad mood,

261
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,070
so I came here to have a drink

262
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,950
and play games with you.

263

Nonsense!

269
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,520

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,670
do not have such a dark past.

272
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Do you really believe

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
that Chu Xia

274
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
is the culprit who killed Uncle Xu?

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
But Chu Xia

276
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,870
seems to be really upset.

277
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,950
Let's continue.

278
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,760
Chu Xia,

279
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,520
come.

280
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,400
Take a look.

281
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,120
The stuff in this box

282
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,040
is the stuff

283
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,150
from our childhood.

284
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,320
This diary.

285
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
It's my diary from when I was young.

286
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,190
Look.

287
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
There are so many things

288
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
about you in here.

289
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,280
We might be able

290
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,550
to recall your memory.

291
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,640
And this.

292
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,470
When we were in secondary school,

293
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,310
you gave me this as a birthday gift.

294
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,200
Look. It can be lit up.

295
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,470
And this.

296
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,310
This is the mobile phone we used

297
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,160
when we were young.

298
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,390

I've been charging it.

301
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,360
It still contains the messages

302
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,550
that we sent.

303
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,200
Best friends forever.

304
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,790
Let me help you recall what happened.

305
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,870
When you were in lower secondary school,

306
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,400
you got an award.

307
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,550
That award

308
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,280
was a Helping Others Award.

309
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,520
After we got into university,

310
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,030
you became the president of the student union.

311
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,360
When we were in the university,

312
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,280
you were actively

313
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,760
helping those clubs

314
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
to participate in activities

315
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
and hold evening galas.

316
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,000
Everyone

317
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
really adored you.

318
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:55,390
Besides,

319
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,510
you have to trust yourself.

320
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:58,630
You

321
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,710
have always been

322
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,190
a kind-hearted girl.

323
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,359
You don't even have the heart

324
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,510
to hurt an animal.

325
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,440
Why would you hurt anyone?

326
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,680
You wouldn't do this in the past,

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,109
you won't do it now as well.

328
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,670
But you've always been my best friend.

329
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,599
It's normal

330
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,480
for you to side with me.

331
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,470
But these

332
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,000
are all facts.

333
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,760
One more thing.

334
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
Look at these photos.

335
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,960
You were adorable back then.

336
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,750
Not bad.

337
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,510
But why did you

338
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,000
cut these photos in halves?

339
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,240
These are not important.

340
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,640
The most important thing now

341
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,440
is to find new evidence

342
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,830
to clear your name.

343
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,750
Miss Qin Yue.

344
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,630
Nice.

345
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,240
This lipstick is pretty.

346
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,920
These are the program flow and product list

347

care so much about Lei Chu Xia?

411
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,400
Why are you

412
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,030
keeping the secret for her?

413
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,720
Why are you covering up for her crimes?

414
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,760
What crimes?

415
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
That day I was outside the door,

416
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,310
I heard everything.

Through

418

a friend of Xu Wei Yi's company,

419
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,110
you stole Xu Wei Yi's patent.

420
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,080
Lei Chu Xia made that mistake,

421
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,790
she should bear the responsibility herself.

These are long gone now.

Besides,

Take a seat.

442
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,590
Here's the information of Xu Xiao Dong,

443
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,030
the son of Xu Wei Yi.

444
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,880
I ran a thorough background check on him.

445
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,270
He's a nobody.

446
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,920
He hardly made it through an average university.

447
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,600
As for the jobs he got after that,

448
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,360
none of them

449
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,920
made it through probation.

450
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,600
He's been doing odd jobs

451
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,480
to make ends meet.

452
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,680
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

453
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,200
But I didn't expect

454
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
that the son of Xu Wei Yi would be a nobody.

455
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,030
Nobody?

456
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,510
He doesn't seem like one.

457
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,640
You seem to know him very well.

458

461
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,520
That's a coincidence.

Not long ago,

463
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,510

in Yao Yang Tech.

465
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,400
Why would he

466
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,310
work in your company?

467
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,590
What is he up to?

and became a staff member

this coincidence

475
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,480
doesn't seem like a good thing.

476

not let our guard down.

even Xu Wei Yi couldn't take us down.

But to be safe,

487

I brought his information here.

488
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,550

[Xu Xiao Dong's Resume]

Are you sure he's a good-for-nothing?

491
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,880
The projects that he was in

492
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
are all projects from Yao Yang Tech

in the market recently.

495
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,560
That's because his team leader

was good at drawing on the advantages
of competing products.

497

It has nothing to do with Xu Xiao Dong.

I still think

499
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,430
that he's not that simple.

500
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,680
You'd better keep your eyes on him.

if you have time,

503
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,510

00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,350
Anyway,

693
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,120
I will work hard

694
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,400
to find out the truth.

695
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,480
Thank you for trusting me.

696
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,680
But the important thing now is

697
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,840
I've brought so much trouble

698
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,960
to the others.

699
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,830
What's the matter?

700
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,270
I have an idea.

701
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,880
Miss Yuan Yuan, slow down.

702
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,760
Wait for me.

703
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,030
Wait for you?

704
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,120
I let you in,

705
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,840
you should be grateful.

706
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,880
Why should I wait for you?

707
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,910
Yuan Yuan,

708
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,160
you get a complimentary boyfriend with this bouquet.

709
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Please accept it.

710
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,640
I don't want it.

711
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,990
Jin Xiao Rui,

712
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,720
I hate people like you the most.

713
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,750
You change anytime you like

714
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,670
and you don't have your own principles

715
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,680
and standpoints.

716
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,920
Yuan Yuan, what are you talking about?

717
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,310
I, Jin Xiao Rui,

718
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,480
have the clearest standpoint!

719
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,560
I always

720
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
stand by you, Yuan Yuan.

721
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,160
Stop saying

722
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,030
all the nonsense.

723
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,910
Let me ask you.

724
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,960
Regarding Xiao Dong and Chu Xia,

725
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,960
who do you side with?

726
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Is your surname Lei or Xu?

727
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,590
Yuan is my surname.

728
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,800
I'm great

729
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,480
at answering trick questions like this.

730
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,110
Ma'am,

731
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,760
please don't be mad.

732
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,630
You will get wrinkles if you're angry.

733
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,800
Do you think I'm old?

734
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,800
Why did you come here if you think I'm old?

735
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,440
Go out and find yourself some young girls.

736
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,840
They're everywhere downstairs.

737
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,000
Come, let me take you there.

738
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,030
What's the matter?

739
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,480
You're the only one I want.

740
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,760
I knew this would happen again.

741
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,550
This time there are two of them.

742
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,840
Since we're already here,

743
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,230
I'll make an announcement.

744
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,000
We're doing something big tomorrow morning.

745
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,360
What is it?

746
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,680
Higher, higher.

747
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,800
All they can see are nostrils if you film like this.

748
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,540
[Does anyone know what this is about?]

749
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,360
[What are you selling?]

750
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,190
[What are you selling?]
Wait. Will it work?

751
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,150
You haven't tried it yet,

752
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,070
how do you know that it won't work?

753
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,150
[You're so pretty.]
Chu Xia, someone has entered the room.

754
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,470
Has it started?

755
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,960
Yes. Smile, smile.

756
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,830
Okay.

757
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,880
[Does everyone play dirty now?]
Welcome to

758
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,190
[Let's see what she's up to.]
Summer Time.

759
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,720
That's right.

760
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,470
I'm the owner of Summer Time.

761
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,760
[Isn't she the alien from two days ago? ]
Regarding the internet rumours

762
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,640
[Isn't she the alien from two days ago? ]
that...

763
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,510
The internet rumours that I'm an alien,

764
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,950
and that I have superpowers,

765
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,030
[Explain it like I'm five.]

766
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,000
[Explain it like I'm five.]
are true.

767
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,800
Da Huang, come over here.

768
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,400
[Any special offers?]
Like this bread,

769
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
[Any special offers?]
I actually generated electricity by myself

770
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,320
[Where are you located?]
and baked it.

771
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,320
[Where are you located?]
Come. Smell it. Does it smell good?

772
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,720
It's good!

773
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,840
[I knew you were trying to promote your stuff.]
It's good!

774
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,430
And now.

775
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,400
Okay, you can leave now.

776
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,710
Now I'll show you

777
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,060
[Lightning]

778
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,840
electric current!

779
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,150
Come. Hurry up.

780
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,220
[Do you have superpowers?]

781
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,980
[Cheap effect.]

782
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,940
[I bet she didn't even have to pay for it.]

783
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,820
[I'm leaving.]

784
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,400
[Do you think we're three-year-olds?]

785
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,280
[Why are you still watching?]
What else, Xu Xiao Dong?

786
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,160
[Guys, just leave.]
Xu Xiao Dong.

787
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,780
[The alien is promoting.]

788
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,140
[This is absurd.]

789
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,500
[You could've used better acting skills.]

790
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,360
[I feel humiliated.]

791
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,160
[Viewers are decreasing.]
Anything else?

792
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,220
[Viewers are decreasing.]

793
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
-Mr. Xu!
-Nothing...

794
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,180
[Viewers are decreasing.]

795
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,950
[That's it?]
Don't go! Don't go, don't go!

796
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,000
[Aren't you embarrassed?]
There are more!

797
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,400
One more. It's...

798
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,510
What is it?

799
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,630
I can vanish into thin air.

800
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,710
[This is so cheap.]
Three, two, one.

801
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,630
Am I gone now?

802
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,300
[Could you be any more absurd? ]

803
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,360
Get the cake.

804
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,200
Hurry, hurry.

805
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,800
[People are playing dirty now.]
Come, come.

806
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,430
[What could it be if it's not cake?]
Don't ever miss this.

807
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,920
Presented by our alien boss,

808
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,360
[Bomb?]
our new alien cake!

809
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,590
[Alien: I don't know her.]
It is definitely

810
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,150
the lowest price on the internet today.

811
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,720
She baked this by generating the electricity herself.

812
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,230
You must never miss this.

813
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,280
You will not lose anything

814
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,280
if you buy this.

815
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,030
Besides, today,

816
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,000
those of you who order from us

817
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,200
will enjoy a buy 100 free 100 offer...

818
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,080
A customer! A customer.

819
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,950
[This place seems familiar.]
This is an alien cake, right?

820
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,830
Yes!

821
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,150
How much is it?

822
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,760
Do you want one?

823
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,720
Buy 100 free 100.

824
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,880
Ask your friends to come here.

825
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Hurry up. Ask your friends to come here.

826
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,510
Come to our livestream now,

827
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,000
buy 100 free 100.

828
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,680
His friend is here.

829
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,360
[I'm waiting for their account to be removed.]
His friend, his friend.

830
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,400
Do you want one?

831
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,400
This... This...

832
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,110
Is this an alien cake?

833
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,630
Yes!

834
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,510
Yes, yes.

835
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,320
Do you want it?

836
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,880
Okay.

837
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,760
[I'm leaving.]
One for you.

838
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,840
Don't leave! Don't leave!

839
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,510
Viewers, don't leave.

840
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,110
Don't leave.

841
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,630
[Can I travel in space after eating that cake?]
We are very sincere.

842
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,590
We're not promoting

843
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,760
our own products.

844
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,070
What is it again?

845
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,760
We're not...

846
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,630
Recommend in all good conscience!

847
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,760
[Complain.]
Recommend in all good conscience.

848
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,920
We're not making money with it.

849
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,550
I want this cake.

850
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,280
[I've reported them. You're welcome.]
You want it?

851
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,070
Okay, okay.

852
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,960
Okay, take it.

853
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,000
Watch out. Take good care of it.

854
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,760
Don't go.

855
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,990
Someone's leaving. Don't go.

856
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,920
[I'm getting out of here.]
Don't go.

857
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,230
