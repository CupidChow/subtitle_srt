00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,440
made a hefty profit

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
with my dad's invention.

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
Then, the eight shareholders split up

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,880
and set up their respective company.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,070
Since then, they have
cut ties with each other.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,510
I looked into these companies one by one.

Yao Yang Tech.

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,630
The founder of Yao Yang Tech, Zhao Yao Yang,

14
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,000
is the last person

15
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,190
that I'm going to investigate.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,150
You have investigated them
for so many years.

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,350
You tried not to alert any party.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,950
You didn't even disclose

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,150
your identity as Winter.

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,990
Now, finally you see a glimpse of hope.

21

But...

Zhao Yao Yang

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,870
looks quite innocent.

24
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,230
He does look innocent in his photo.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,310
Zhao Yao Yang is a cautious person.

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,990
I investigated using Turing

27
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,320
but I didn't

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,830
get any useful information.

29
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,480
I think

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,030
if he was involved in the incident,

Have you figured it out?

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,680
Yao Yang Tech

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,079
is a reputable company.

37
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,680
It is not easy

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,560
to hack into their system

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,630

Yes, I bought them.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,500
Go away.

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,470
You didn't stop her from
purchasing so many items.

49

I just want to buy a few garage kits.

about online shopping?

52
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
Well...

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,270
Charge them to my account.

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,950
Yes, I've recorded them.

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,750
Moreover, I didn't shop for no reason.

56
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
With my instinct as a lady,

57

I think these things are helpful to me.

58

Helpful to you?

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,240
How are these kitchenware helpful?

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,190
Will they help you become a chef?

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,470
You don't look like a chef.

62
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,750
You look more like a babysitter.

63

It's none of your business.

64

browsing through some kitchenware.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,520
In order to find out your real identity

68
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,310
and to get rid of you as soon as possible,

69
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,750
I have purchased all the kitchenware.

70
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,909
Do you want to take a look?

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,390
However, you will still have
to pay for these kitchenware.

It's here.

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,310
Where?

78
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,500
Why did you turn it into a kitchen?

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
I am always busy at work

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
and you can't stay away from me.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
So, I turned this area

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
into a mini kitchen

83
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,760
so that you can try and see

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,520
if you can find your memories.

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,290
Second,

86
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,760
I hope I can get rid of you soon.

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,750
So, the kitchen is for her.

88

Choose one.

103
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,870
These two are not edible.

104
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
Do I really have to try it?

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,560
Try it!

I'm good at baking.

Did I work in a restaurant...

112

As a babysitter.

113

Is Xu Xiao Dong in love with her?

143
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,710
Not to that extent.

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
However, she always
seeks help from Xu Xiao Dong

and Xu Xiao Dong has
never turned her down.

But it's normal.

I don't think anyone
would say no to Qin Yue.

148

It's just some random stuff.

I'm here to ask for a favour.

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,070
Here it goes.

Everyone,

155

as we can see,

both parties have come
to the middle of the stage.

Tomorrow, I have an important live-stream.

159

I need you to monitor the background.

160
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,040
Will my friend

You agreed right away.

Yes.

No problem, it's just a small deal.

That's great.

344
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,950
It's okay.

345
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,270
I'll contact the person in charge.

346
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,590
Okay.

347
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,380
Chu Xia.

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,270
Let's put an end to all the secrets

349
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,950
when the memorial
service is officially over.

350
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,500
I've been having nightmares
in the past ten years.

351
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,190
I always found myself by
the cliff in the nightmare.

352
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,590
I didn't have a choice back then.

353
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,950
I didn't mean to harm you.

354
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,910
Please don't blame me.

355
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:02,510
Chu Xia.

356
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,569
Is that you?

357
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Who are you? Let go of me!

358
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,069
Let go of me!

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,240
Let go of her!

360
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,579
-Chu Xia.
-Who are you?

361
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,540
Let go of her!

362
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,280
Are you okay?

363
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,160
Chu Xia.

364
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,040
Leave her alone!

365
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,230
Don't come near her.

366
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,230
Mr. Wei.

367
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,880
Mr. Zhao, I have to go.

368
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,920
Don't go yet, Mr. Wei.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Mr. Wei.

370
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,320
I'm here

371
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,140
for something important.

372
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,190
Mr. Wei.

373
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,630
Lately, a few companies

374
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,830
approached me for a project
that took place ten years ago.

375
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,830
Mr. Zhao.

376
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
Don't you forget

377
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
our deal.

378
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,510
No one is allowed to bring up that matter.

379
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,800
Have you lost your memories

380
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,070
due to old age?

381
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,790
I just want to share
the good deal with you.

382
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,880
Mr. Wei.

383
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,840
If we succeed in this project,

384
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,830
it will be a huge deal.

385
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,590
We can enjoy our life after this.

386
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,520
So, I have to

387
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,830
talk with you about it.

388
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,160
Who is that guy?

389
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Who did he hold your hand?

390
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,470
Is he crazy?

391
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,070
My name is Lei Chu Xia.

392
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,070
I'm glad that you're okay.

393
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,390
Congratulations, you finally
found out your name.

394
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,500

395

No.

[Hello, I have heart disease.]

429
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,670
[If I pass out, please contact my husband.]
She has an artificial pacemaker inside her body.

430
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,800
Your presence might have affected it.

431
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,010
You need to control your emotions.

432
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,560
Here.

433
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,600
Does she live here?

434
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,710
What is going on?

435
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,750
Hello, is this 120?

436
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,160
Her pacemaker was interrupted

437
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,150
and stopped working.

438
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
Hence, the patient
passed out all of a sudden.

439
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,680
Fortunately, she was
sent to the hospital in time.

440
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,220
The surgery was a success.

441
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
At the moment, she is doing fine.

442
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,550
She will wake up soon.

443

444
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,710
Yes, she is okay.

473
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,280
Chu Xia called me mum.

474
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,160
-I need to find her.
-Don't move.

475
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,830
You just had surgery.

476
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,270
I'll look for her.

477

Hurry up.

480
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,150
I'll go now.

481
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,950
I have a daughter.

482
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,790
She has been missing for ten years.

483
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,310
We have been looking for her
for the past ten years.

484
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,870
Maybe it's because she has been
longing to see her daughter so much,

485
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,350
something went wrong with her heart.

486
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,190
A few years back, a pacemaker
was installed inside her.

487
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,310
She always said,

488
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,630
"I have to keep my heart beating."

489
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,750
"I want to wait for my
daughter to come home."

affected my mum's heart, right?

may sound ridiculous.

It may be beyond your imagination,

She...

549
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,540
She came from ten years ago.

550
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,790
What did you say?

551
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,300
Peace and silence.

552
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,830
Take a deep breath.

553
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,680
You are an adult.

554
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,950
You need to control your emotions, okay?

555
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,480
All right, let's continue.

556
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,760
She came from ten years ago.

557
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
The magnetic energy that I detected on her

558
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,040
is very similar to

559
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,720

561

However, for some unknown reason,

562
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,030
though you lost your memories,

563
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,150
your appearance has remained the same.

564
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,030
In other words,

565

she looks exactly the
same as ten years ago.

566

Her age remains the same.

578
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,150
Will the magnetic field on Chu Xia
affect medical equipment?

579
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
For example, artificial pacemakers.

580
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,960
Of course.

581
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,600
Once her emotion is agitated,

582
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,280
it will affect electronic products.

583
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,520
For example, the lights were blinking.

584
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,800
It was caused by her emotional agitation.

585
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,550
However, you don't have to worry.

586
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,360

Be patient.

590
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,510
Is there any way

591
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,590
to control the influence?

592
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Technically,

593
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,920
as long as you stay calm,

594
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,270
it won't affect anything.

595
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,910

You don't have to be so pessimistic.

You are in luck because you ran into me.

603
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,100
I can try to find a solution

604
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,630
by inventing a device that
can control your energy.

605

With that device,

606
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,800
your range of activities can be expanded.

607
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,400
Then, you can leave him.

However,

609
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,630
there is a minor technical issue.

610
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,470
This research requires
a huge amount of money.

611
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
My lab is a little short on funds.

612
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,680
That means

613
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,710
it can be solved with money.

614
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,520

Stop looking at him. He is stingy.

617
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,870
I will figure it out.

I should be able to go back
the same way, right?

622
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,540
Apparently it's against Newton's Law.

623
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,070
No way it works.

624

Why don't you jump off the building?

625

happen to me?

654

To me, this world

655
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,510
is like a mirage.

656

I can see it yet I can't reach it.

I am expressing my feelings.

Why are you ignoring me?

Do you know?

664
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,710
In the virtual cyberworld,

665
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,230
it's all about binary,

666
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,230
which means everything
is formed by zeros and ones.

667
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,590
The game you play called
Battle of the Saints

668
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,520
is basically

669
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,110
a collection of zeros and ones.

670
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,880
Now, I'm using

It is as if you are taking a photo.

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,270
Scan it.

685
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,790
How did you make it?

686
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,610
[Lei Chu Xia]

687
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,590
When I was young,

688
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,710
my dad always played this game with me.

689
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,280
It's known as the

690
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,550
Two Dimensional Barcode Colouring Game.

691
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,030
I still remember that he
used to be busy all the time.

692
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,590
I always bugged him to play with me.

693
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,400
So, he got me

694
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,150
some black and white boxes.

695
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,310
If I got the code right,

696
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,870
he would spend ten minutes
to keep me company.

697
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,550
In the beginning,

698
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,060
I didn't know how to do it.

699
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,469
Slowly, I mastered the pattern.

700
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,110
However, I knew that he was busy.

701
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,510
So, I pretend that I
didn't know how to do it.

702
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,420
I spent a long time arranging
the code on purpose.

703
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,590
I bet you miss your dad a lot.

704
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,430
In the cyberworld, zero and one

705
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,400
is the most basic

706
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,790
yet the most important.

707
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,510
Therefore, in your world,

708
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,230
you are the most important.

709
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,350
As long as you are here,

710
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,840
no matter where you came from,

711
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,760
no matter who you are

712
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,630
or what your name is,

713
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,590
those are not important.

714
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,680
Just like the bar code,

715
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,310
you can find the meaning of your presence.

716
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,600
You can create

717
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,790
a new world that belongs to you.

[I wake up from a nightmare every night.]

[I'm almost out of breath.]

[so that I can forget you.]

[I thought I could bid you goodbye.]

[into my nightmare?]

744
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,350
It's time to eat.

745
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,400
You must be starving.

[You have a new message]

[Please come to the hospital

Okay, I'll bring you there.

The street lamp stopped
working for a long time.

Why isn't it fixed yet?

It's an old residential area.

[remember the way home?]

788
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,750
[What should I do?]

789
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,420
[I have an idea.]

790

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,150
The rainbow staircase looks like candy.

It's so beautiful.

799
