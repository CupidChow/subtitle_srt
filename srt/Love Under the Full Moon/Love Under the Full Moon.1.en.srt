178
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,860
Good evening, Xiao Dong.

179
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,470
I'm your smart assistant, Turing.

180
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,350
How may I help you?

181
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,230
Open the door.

182
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,430
Got it, Xiao Dong.

183
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,070
I didn't understand the
reason why you bought

184
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,350
the entire fourth floor
of this building back then.

185
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,950
I didn't expect you to utilise

186
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,030
the unique structure of old buildings

187

within it.

189
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,790
You can tell Aunt Wei Wei

190
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,350
that you're neither poor nor miserable.

191
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,180
Even the car I drive belongs to you.

192
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,590
Why would you hide your identity

193
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,950
as The Great Winter?

194
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,150
This drink is not for you.

195
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,750
It's not time yet, I'm afraid.

196
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,030
If I tell her now,

197
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,270
she would

198
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,350
remember what happened ten years ago.

199
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,870

Where did he go?

211

Today is my birthday.

212

213
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,470
to celebrate with me.

214

Qin Yue,

215
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,070
I don't think it's appropriate

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,510
to talk about personal matters

217

Forget it.

You're just an assistant,

223

there's no point in telling you.

Where exactly is he?

What is it?

318

I'm so exhausted.

324
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,910
We need sufficient samples

326

Are you going to retaliate against me?

327
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,070
You may choose to leave anytime.

328
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,830
Furthermore,

329
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,750
you're not worth retaliating.

330
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,550
Do you think I'll leave just like that?

331
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,790
Don't worry.

332
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,670
I didn't see anything

333
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,150

334
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,670
It seems

335
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,430
you were taking a shower, and

336

your body is covered in bubbles.

337
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,550
And then...

338
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,470
That's enough.

339
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,070

to solve your problem.

341
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,070
Fine, let's get tired together.

342
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,310
What does that mean?

343
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,380
Wait, let me close the door.

Why haven't I seen her before?

350
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,710
Is she your girlfriend?

351
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,910
No, no, no.

352
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,710
We're in a rush.

353
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,150
Sorry.

354
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,350
Let's go and solve your problem.

355
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,230
Let's go.

356
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,270
Goodbye, auntie.

358
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,030
[Moonlit Flats]
Hey, slow down.

359
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,910
[Moonlit Flats]
I'm exhausted.

360
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,510
[Moonlit Flats]
Where is it?

361
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,110
Over there.

362
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,910
Walk faster.

363
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,990
Right here.

364
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,350
This is the table.

365
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,070
It's right here.

366
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,070
Turing.

367
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,870
Measure the distance.

368
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,030
Xiao Dong,

369
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,470
this is the farthest distance

370
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,910
ever recorded.

371
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,660
Try it.

372
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,550
I will.

373
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,940
Left...

374
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,350
Let's take two more steps.

375
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,870
Let's run a few steps.

376
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,790
Okay.

377
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,950
I suspect you are teasing me.

378
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,630
I swear I never teased you.

379
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,230
-The past few times...
-Then explain to me,

380
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,270
what's going on now?

381
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,430
No, the past few times,

382
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,500
I couldn't even make it

383
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,380
pass that table.

384
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,110
I don't know why...

385
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,950
I now suspect that

386
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,390
you're stalking me.

387
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,340
No, I don't have to,

388
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,030
right?

389
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,910
Why should I follow you?

390
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,910
Right?

391
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,740
That's so strange.

392
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,950
Wait.

393
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,750
I'm really telling the truth.

394
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,710
I don't need to lie to you.

395
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,550
I also wonder

396
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,350
how I ended up here.

397
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,230
I...

398
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,670
Don't look at me like that.

399
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,630
I really didn't lie to you.

400
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,310
Do you know that

401
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,670
it's hard to grab a seat

402
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,790
in President Wei's elective course?

403
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,590
You're right.

404
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,420
He is also the most handsome

405
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,350
guest professor.

406
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,350
You're right.

407
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,750
Hello, students.

408
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,150
Hi, President Wei.

409
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,430
The way you address me

410
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,510
makes me feel like

411
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,660
we're miles apart.

412
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,750
How about this?

413
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,550
You may call me senior.

414
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,390
After all, I'm also an alumni

415
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,630
of this school.

416
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,790
Hello, senior.

417
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,110
Great.

418
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,350
It seems that

419
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,630
none of you are absent today.

420
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,830
I shall skip the roll call.

421
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,070
Let's start our lesson.

422
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,110
As all of you know...

423
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,110
Senior Wei, can I have your autograph?

424
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,670
Senior,

425
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,750
can I have your autograph too?

426
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,310
Me too.

427
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,590
Students,

428
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,110
the reason

429
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,110
we're here today

430
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,030
is to attend my lesson.

431
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,510
I hope all of you can abide

432
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,670
by classroom discipline.

433
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,150
Since we have to abide
by classroom discipline,

434
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:05,790
then why

435
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,350
are you having your lesson here?

436
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,430
That's a good question.

437
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,500
Please sit down.

438
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,870
I chose this place

439
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,430
because

440
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,070
the subject of our elective course is

441
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,220
The Infinite Possibilities of Media

442
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,390
endued by New Network Technology.

443
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,670
While we are here,

444
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,710
our minds can be set free

445
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,470
and break away

446
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,910
from our traditional way of thinking.

447
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,870
So

448
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,310
that's it for our outdoor lesson

449
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,740
today.

450
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,030
If you have any questions,

451
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,350
feel free to come and ask me.

452
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,270
Also,

453
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,270
your homework is

454
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,510
to think about

455
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,470
the location

456
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,910
for our next class.

457
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,310
Senior.

458
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,780
I have a question.

459
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,710
If today is

460
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,420
your girlfriend's birthday,

461
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,390
where would you bring her

462
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,910
to celebrate her birthday?

463
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,150
Senior Wei,

464
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,910
do you have a girlfriend?

465
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,420
Tell us, Senior.

466
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,300
Do you have a girlfriend?

467
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:15,990
Senior.

468
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,750
Do you have a girlfriend?

469
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,540
Students.

470
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,750
I should remind you that

471
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,780
we should only

472
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,550
ask questions

473
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,590
that are related to

474
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,590
the course.

475
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,750
Thank you, everyone.

476
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,430

477
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,700
I have applied for

478
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,910
an internship at your company.

479
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,590
I hope it can be approved.

480
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,270
Great.

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,390
I look forward to your performance.

482
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,420
If you face any difficulties,

483
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,300
just let me know.

484
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,550

Got it, Xiao Dong.

499
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,670

What do you mean "unknown entity"?

503

I'm a person.

Don't mind her, please continue.

505

Noted, Xiao Dong.

506
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,270

the distance between you

00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,670
is shrinking.

510
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,950
The rate will increase

00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,150
when the unknown entity

512

gets weary.

the distance between both of you

to its original distance.

518

699
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,270
We never had any new blood

700
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:30,750
for a long time.

701
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,390
Everyone here is outstanding.

702
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,270
Exactly.

703
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,030
With his outstanding skills

704
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,470
and charming good looks,

705
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,390
I just think that...

706
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,790
Come here.

707
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,070
Come.

708
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,460
♫ I like these voices ♫

709
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,100
♫ I will never hear again ♫

710
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,060
♫ If you hear these voices ♫

711
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,860
♫ I hope my love ♫

712
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,110
♫ Let it count too ♫

713
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,150
Hello.

714
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,950
Who are you?

715
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,390
I am...

716
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,430
My cousin.

717
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,750
Cousin.

718
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,660
Cousin?

719
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,110
Why are you standing there?

720
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,190
You told me to stay away, remember?

721
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,430
I said, stay...

722
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,710
Forget it.

723
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,550
Just sit down here.

724
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,070
Here, play with my cell phone.

725
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,310
Remember,

726
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,780
don't let others discover your uniqueness.

727
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,190
I get it, you're sounding
like a broken record.

728
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,270
He's too much.

729
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,190
Does he think that IT guys

730
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,350
are clueless about love?

731
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,830
Cousin

732
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,550
is just another way of

733
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,500
calling someone's girlfriend
during an ambiguous relationship.

734
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,110
Xiao Dong.

735
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,510
Brother Sui

736
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,030
wants to see you in his office.

737
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,510
How's it going?

738
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,510
Bao, did he hit you?

739
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,950
Well, not really.

740
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,470
Who is she?

741
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,430
Cousin.

742
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,070
Hello.

743
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,830
Cousin, how are you?

744
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,750
I am Da Bao.

745
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,030
Hi, Brother Da Bao.

746
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,110
Cousin.

747
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,790
Here, have some fruits.

748
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,350
Thank you.

749
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,070
Battle of the Saints?

750
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,470
Let me have a look.

751
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,750
It seems our new colleague
is also a fan of this game.

752
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,830
We can play together.

753
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,910
Indeed, from now on,

754
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,230
we should communicate with him more.

755
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,180
Who is this?

756
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,630
It is our idol.

757
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,990
It is Winter's avatar,

758
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,390
the genius game designer.

759
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,070
He designed Battle of the Saints.

760
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,750
How cool is that?

761
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,950
Tell you what,

762
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,470
Winter has single-handedly

763
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,590
created a whole new space

764
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,790
for all gamers to

765
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,110
discover their true identities

766
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,670
within an unfamiliar world.

767
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,750
Not only that,

768
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,670
he's the reason we found
our sense of belonging.

769
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,030
Discover their true identities

770
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,710
within an unfamiliar world?

771
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,230
That's the reason why

772
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,430
Winter deserves our admiration.

773
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,540
How do I communicate with him?

774
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,590
Actually, you can just

775
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,710
drop him a private message.

776
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,590
But many people have been

777
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,430
doing so,

778
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,350
and he is extremely busy,

779
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,550
so he might never reply
to your messages.

780
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,750
Never mind, I'll try.

781
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,710
Cousin.

782
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,950
You don't have an account, right?

783
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,270
You may use my account

784
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:38,790
to send him...

785
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,710
Use my account.

786
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,420
No, use mine.

787
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,300
I've upgraded my account.

788
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,070
Cousin, it's ready to use.

789
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,070
-Cousin...
-Thank you.

790
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,510
Come on, get back to work.

791
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,220
Bye, cousin.

792
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,790
-Let's go.
-It's time to work.

793
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,110
Traitor.

794
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,110
You too.

795
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,310
Hi, Winter.

796
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,190
[Moonlit Flats]

797
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,870
I'm so exhausted.

798
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,910
I should be saying that.

799
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,430
Don't forget to ask

800
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,710
your Turing program

801
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,950
regarding the progress of

802
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,500
finding my identity.

803
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,830
I'll do it even without you telling me.

804
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,870
How troublesome.

805
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,270
Xiao Dong, open the door.

806
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,030
Xiao Dong, open the door. It's me.

807
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,190
One trouble follows another.

808
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,110
We must never let him find out

809
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,030
that you are here.
