My goodness.

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,670
It's like this dress was made

6
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,860
especially for you.

7
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,510
Give me a hand.

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,190
I'm losing my balance.

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,750
It looks so nice on you,

10
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,590
doesn't it?

11
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,870
You look stunning in it.

12
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,750
If I were Xu Xiao Dong,

13
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,010
just seeing how stunning you're in this dress,

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
I'd marry you right away.

It's true.

Just look.

18
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,360
You look gorgeous, Yuan Yuan.

19
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,140
I've got something to say to you.

20
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,430
Come with me.

21
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,550
Where are we going?

Every full moon from now on,

29

Alright.

30
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,070
Why did you bring me here?

Yuan Yuan.

32
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,130
Although our marriage was prompted

33
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,390
by the courier store manager

34
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800

36

Those were the reasons

37
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,170
you married me?

38
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,770
No, that's not it.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,770
What I meant was

40
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,530
even without those reasons,

41
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,350
I'd still want to marry you.

42
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,630
Because I really like you very much.

43

Don't laugh.

45

so why wouldn't I?

46
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
Although this marriage proposal

47
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,270
is quite rushed and simple,

48
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
I hope you'd still accept it.

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,680

50

tolerate her temperament.

What's with the luggages?

129
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,030
Are you planning on

130

sleeping on our couch permanently now?

131
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,260
That's right, uncle.

132
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,390
I find the couch more comfortable

133
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,360
than my own bed at home.

134
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,480
You're not afraid of falling off it again?

135

Look at young people these days.

136

They can't bear to be apart even for a moment.

137
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,600
You're right, aunty.

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Right now, I don't want to

139
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,480
leave Chu Xia's side even for a moment.

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,680
Say it again?

141
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,180
I'm not ready to marry off

142
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,670
my daughter at the moment.

143
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,800
You

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,480
better watch yourself.

145
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,790
But what aunty said is true.

146
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,910
I'm eager to be with her.

147
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,390
You're really doing this again, aren't you?

148
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,470
Let's dig in, shall we?

149
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,420
Let's eat.

150
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,870
Eat up, so that you'll stop talking.

151
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,670
Okay.

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,180

153
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,120
You'll sleep here tonight.

You're not to wander off anywhere.

Are you clear with that?

156

That's enough. It's time to rest.

Chu Xia.

158

Your mum wants you to go to bed now.

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,360
She meant you.

160
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,240
What are you up to?

161
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,150
I...

162

Just setting up the couch.

163

Tonight,

You haven't slept.

169

What's the matter?

170

Come with me.

I've got a gift for you.

It's a full moon.

173
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
Haven't I said before that

174
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,000
I wish we'd be together

175

00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,370
Let me handle this private affair of mine.

346
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,750
I'll rearrange a day for our meeting.

347
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,770
What's wrong with you?

348
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,110
What are you trying to do?

349
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
Don't partner up with Zhao Yao Yang.

350
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,310
And don't steal Xu Wei Yi's patent.

351
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,550
You'll regret it very much.

352
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,270
Who told you about that?

353
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,310
I know

354
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,640
your biggest dream

355
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,550
is not to be Wei family's
most outstanding child,

356
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,110
but to be a down-and-about rower.

357
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,200
I've never

358
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
told anyone about this before.

359
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,630
You told me yourself.

360
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,920
You said I'm to stop you
at all cost from doing that.

361
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
That was the first thing
I promised you that I'd do.

362
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Thank you.

363
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,700
Mr. Xu.

364
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,030
I'm Lei Chu Xia.

365
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,830
I see, it's Miss Lei.

366
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,350
Hi. I'm Xu Wei Yi.

367
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,480
The things I'm about to say will probably sound

368
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,000
unbelievable to you.

369
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,960
But you must believe them.

370
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,230
The things you said

371
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,510
are indeed quite unbelievable.

372
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,270
This is your medicine.

373
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,900
That I have.

374
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,400
You're out of it.

375
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,110
Please take your medicine on time.

376
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,440
Regardless, you need to take care
of your health.

377
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,110
Alright.

378
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,470
For Xiao Dong,

379
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,460
I'll definitely take good care of my health.

380
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,850
Thank you.

381
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,030
I'll excuse myself.

382
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,880
Alright.

383
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,710
Hello.

384
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,560
Attorney Qian?

385
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,030
I have something important to speak to you about.

386
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,270
You're home?

387
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,920
Have you eaten?

388
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,980
[Finally I've prevented
all of that from happening.]

389
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,570
[Xiao Dong.]

390
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,190
[You finally won't have to endure]

391
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,880
[the pain of losing your father.]

392
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,270
What's the matter? You seem so absent-minded.

393
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,960
What's wrong, Junior Lei?

394
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,960
Who gave you a tough time?

395
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,880
[Your life may never]

396
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,160
[have me in it anymore.]

397
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,620
[Summer Time]

398
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,700
[Patent Certificate]

399
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:45,180
[Reserved]

400
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,960
You're here.

401
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,880
When I saw you earlier today,

402
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,150
I felt that you looked familiar.

403
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,070
But I just couldn't recall

404
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,410
where we've met before.

405
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,920
Later I remembered that

406
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,680
I had ordered a cake at Summer Time.

407
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,250
It was then that

408
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,480
I realised you are the bakery's owner.

409
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,070
Thank you.

410
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,110
You're welcome.

411
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,940
This is the cake

412
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,080
and the patent certificate.

413
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,790
They have returned to their rightful owner.

414
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,340
[Patent Certificate]

415
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,070
Honestly,

416
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,590
my son

417
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,350
really loves eating your cakes.

418
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,350
Unfortunately he won't be able
to have them from now on.

419
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,240
It's been finalized.

420
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,250
My whole family and I

421
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,060
will migrate overseas.

422
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,190
After this,

423
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,590
it's unlikely for us to cross paths any more.

424
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,570
Then I wish you all a safe journey.

425
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,410
Take good care of yourself too.

426
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
[Farewell, Xiao Dong.]

427
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,240
[You take care too.]

428
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,820
Chu Xia.

429
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,270
Why are you here?

430
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,170
What's the matter?

431
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,320
You seem like

432
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,440
you're unhappy.

433
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,590
Let's forget about all the unhappy stuff.

434
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,340
Come on.

435
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,140
Come with me.

436
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,030
Here.

437
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,590
Look.

438
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,310
Over there.

439
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,980
A full moon.

440
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,070
I heard that

441
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,640
it's the decennial supermoon.

442
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,670
Supermoon?

443
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,440
Isn't it pretty?

444
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,440
[I want to change my future.]

445
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,030
[Even if in my own world,]

446
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,000
[I'll never get to meet you again.]

447
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,610
[That's the decision that I've made.]

448
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,620
[Ten years later]

449
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,940
Chu Xia.

450
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,310
Stop here, please.

451
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,240
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

452
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,430
You're finally here.

453
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,680
This decision of yours is so abrupt.

454
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,590
Don't tell me

455
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,470
you're planning to really marry

456
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,900
that food critic boyfriend of yours?

457
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,940
Anyway, in the past ten years,

458
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,430
you've been running all over the country

459
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,750
searching for some unknown delicacy.

460
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,160
When was the last time...

461
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,590
When was the last time you ever checked on me?

462
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,720
You weren't the least interested

463
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,110
in my romantic love affairs.

464
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,240
That's just nonsense.

465
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,740
I'm telling the truth. Ask your conscience.

466
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,360
Ask your conscience.

467
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,200
Alright, I'm asking it.

468
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,000
Ask you conscience.

469
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,180
There's a a small lake over there,

470
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,240
a wind chime...

471
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,160
What do you think?

472
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,590
What are you looking at?

473
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,070
Nothing. I think I've mistaken somebody.

474
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,020
So right ahead we have

475
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,440
a lawn.

476
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,460
It's really suitable to have a wedding there.

477
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,890
Look, over there.

478
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,350
Does it look nice?

479
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,400
You're quite loyal in your taste.

480
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,760
Just like your wedding back then.

481
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,830
Wedding back...

482
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,610
Stop that nonsense.

483
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,440
If people overheard it,

484
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,420
they might think this is my second.

485
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,440
I've never been married.

486
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,240
Alright. My bad, my bad.

487
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,100
Probably it's because I'm a bit slow.

488
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,120
I think someone's being geeky lately.

489
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,500
I heard that

490
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,720
you're no longer researching recipes

491
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,760
but on physics instead?

492
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,910
Are you sure your failed middle school

493
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,080
physics paper would agree on that?

494
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,000
Enough already.
You've been on that for years now.

495
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,190
-This way. -This way.

496
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,990
You're arguing with me on this?

497
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,670
Isn't this your first time here?

498
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,400
How could you possibly

499
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,440
know this place better than me?

500
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,400
I suddenly remembered that

501
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,270
the boyfriend of the aunt

502
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,420
of my fiance's buddy

503
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,830
is a physicist.

504
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,390
I can introduce him to you.

505
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,150
If you have any questions,

506
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,080
you can ask him directly.

507
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,200
That's a convoluted

508
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,840
web of relationships there.

509
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,390
Plus, I don't think he'd necessarily

510
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,140
be able to answer the question that I have.

511
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,160
The question that you have?

512
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,590
Lei Chu Xia.

513
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,320
Don't underestimate him.

514
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,100
I'm wondering what the destined inevitable event

515
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,160
really is.

516
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,400
Destined inevitable event?

517
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,550
According to physicist

518
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,890
Richard Feynman's theory,

519
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,890
there are numerous paths

520
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,170
to move from Point A to Point B.

521
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,920
In other words,

522
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,550
it doesn't matter how

523
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,710
inconceivable the trajectory is,

524
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,240
it'll eventually reach Point B.

525
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
Einstein back in 1905 did mention about

526
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,290
an overview on the world line concept.

527
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,440
There was an author then

528
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,220
who boldly predicted it.

529
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,950
It was said that if all the discrete lines

530
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,240
emerging from Point A

531
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,760
would ultimately reach Point B.

532
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,570
Given that this assumption stands,

533
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,750
what would be the destined Point B then?

534
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,750
Are you done?

535
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,310
Yes, I'm done.

536
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,000
Lei Chu Xia.

537
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,960
You hear that sound?

538
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,550
What do you mean?

539
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,700
That's the sound of your brain

540

That's you, not me.

542

and what not.

545
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,680
And then there's that thing you said

546
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,850
about this inevitable point...

547
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,080

I just remembered someone told me before that

603
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,710
only love can transcend time and space.

604
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,430
But now it seems that

605
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,510
the universe is telling me otherwise.

606
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400

It can't be that coincidental, can it?

611
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,710
The aunt of my boyfriend's buddy

612

[out of nowhere in my bathroom?]

688
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,840
What's your motive?

689
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,950
I'm seriously suspecting that

690
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,980
you've got some ulterior motive.

691
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,360
Who are you actually?

692
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,800
I suspect you're using
some kind of sorcery to track me around.

693
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,140
I'll think of a way

694
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,230
to get rid of a trouble like you.

coveting my brains and...

698

♫ Living in ♫

699

Are you planning on holding me here?

701
