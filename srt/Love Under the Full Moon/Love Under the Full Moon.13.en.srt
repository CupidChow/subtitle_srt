Don't you know that she won't eat rice

344
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:50,870
when there's sausage?

345
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,390
Just let her have her favourite food.

346
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,400
Don't do that.

347
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,790
[When Chu Xia was young,]

348
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,550
[she loved eating grilled sausage too.]

349
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,430
[That's why]

350
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,950
[we often have grilled sausage nowadays.]

351
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,700
Why are you spacing out

352
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,830
during dinner?

353
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,670
Eat up.

354
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,110
It's been a long time
since I had mum's cooking.

355
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,400
I really miss it.

356
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,420
Didn't you just eat my dishes

357
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,480
not long ago?

358
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
What are you talking about?

359
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,110
Since I can't claim a refund,

360
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,160
I have to put up with your dad.

361
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,110
But why are you behaving strange?

362
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,920
Fortunately, Xuan He

363
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
is almost done with

364
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,070
your own house's decoration.

365
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,910
Soon,

366
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,480
you will become

367
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,010
someone else's trouble.

368
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,240
[That's right.]

369
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,640
[Wei Xuan He exists]

370
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,620
[at the present time.]

371
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,130
[Will history repeat itself?]

372
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,830
[Will I fall off the cliff again
because of him?]

373
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,870
If you ask me,

374
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,510
there is no need for you
to get married in a rush.

375
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Summer Time

376
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,290
has only been set up for a few months.

377
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,180
Chu Xia

378
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,920
should focus on

379
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,030
her career first.

380
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,160
Getting married will not affect her career.

381
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,870
Am I right?

382
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,070
Chu Xia and Xuan He

383
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,040
have been in a relationship

384
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,840
since they were in university.

385
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,360
It has been five years.

386
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,970
Starting a happy family

387
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,300
has always been Chu Xia's dream.

388
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,270
Am I right, Chu Xia?

389
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,360
Getting married?

390
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,510
I am not in a hurry.

391
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,270
I wish to keep you two company
for a longer time.

392
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,660
So, who was the one that wanted to get married

393
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,500
as soon as possible?

394
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,720
You are so in love with him.

395
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,480
Why did you

396
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,640
change your mind?

397
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,960
Did you two fight?

398
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,420
It's normal

399
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,690
to have argument.

400
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,750
I'm on your side.

401
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,830
Not long ago,

402
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
for the nonsensical wedding photography session,

403
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,630
you went on a strict diet.

404
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,510
You didn't even eat properly.

405
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,550
Here.

406
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,070
Have some meat.

407
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,880
You need some nutrient.

408
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,550
Are you working together to piss me off?

409
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,280
Is it?

410
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,260
Go get the door.

411
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,880
I am going.

412
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,990
Mr. Lei.

413
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,310
Mr. Lei.

414
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,270
Xuan He is here.

415
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,860
Xuan He, here you are.

416
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,030
Hurry up, take a seat.

417
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,630
Chu Xia.

418
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,090
Let me bring a pair of chopsticks for you.

419
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
We need to talk.

420
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,310
Chu Xia,

421
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,750
why don't you serve Xuan He?

422
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,640
Xuan He, take a seat.

423
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,400
It's okay.

424
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I need to talk to Chu Xia.

425
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,460
Xuan He.

426
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,840
Here, take a seat. Take a seat.

427
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,110
Sure.

428
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,650
Xuan He.

429
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,510
Chu Xia said that

430
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,910
you had become Piggy Tech's shareholder recently.

431
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,490
[Piggy Tech?]

432
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,000
[I think Xiao Dong mentioned it before.]

433
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,400
[That company stole the patent registered by]

434
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,950
[Xiao Dong's dad, Xu Wei Yi.]

435
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,170
It seems that

436
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,000
you are really capable.

437
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,400
That means Xuan He has

438
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,000
what they need most,

439
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,480
which is his extraordinary talent.

440
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,820
Chu Xia.

441
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,680
Why did you
tell your parents everything?

442
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Your parents

443
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,790
shouldn't be worrying about my work.

444
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,790
Well, I sought help from my friend

445
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,070
to hold the shares on behalf of me

446
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,150
in Piggy Tech.

447
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,150
It's no big deal as it's just a small share.

448
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,480
That means you are a sleeping shareholder.

449
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,400
It's quite risky.

450
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,650
[Sleeping shareholder?]

451
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,880
[Wei Xuan He,]

452
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,940
[what kind of deal did you make
with Piggy Tech?]

453
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,830
It seems that

454
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,630
you really trust that friend.

455
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,030
It's just a deal of profit.

456
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
It doesn't involve trust or what not.

457
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,030
I'm doing all these

458
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,550
for our future.

459
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,510
I aspire to provide Chu Xia with a better life.

460
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,390
Mr. and Mrs. Lei.

461
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,200
I really

462
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,720
need to talk to Chu Xia.

463
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,110
Go ahead.

464
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,390
Before getting married,

465
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,200
you surely have many things

466
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,340
to discuss with each other.

467
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Go on.

468
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,800
Chu Xia.

469
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,730
Go.

470
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,600
Let's go.

471
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,530
Go ahead.

472
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,330
Stop sulking.

473
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,700
Where did you keep the document?

474
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,770
What document?

475
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,850
Chu Xia.

476
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,180
Don't do silly things in the name of love.

477
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,200
Not only will you ruin me,

478
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,360
you will ruin our future too.

479
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,170
Please.

480
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,790
If that document

481
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,300
is really important to you,

482
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,340
why didn't you keep it properly?

483
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,410
What do you mean?

484
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,360
Are you not going to give it to me?

485
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,440
I will look for it.

486
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,970
So, the memory was true.

487
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,370
Hello.

488
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,950
What did you say?

489
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,530
Chu Xia.

490
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,370
No matter what you decide,

491
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,550
think about our relationship.

492
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,090
I am doing this

493
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,620
for both of us.

494
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,520
What document is he looking for?

495
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,110
If my memory serves me right,

496
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,890
then everything

497
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,890
will repeat itself
in accordance with the destined trajectory.

498
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,640
[Your parents said that]

499
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,790
[on that night,]

500
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,510
[between 7.30 and 8 p.m.,

501
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,910
you left home all of a sudden

502
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,940
and disappeared.

503
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,200
We didn't hear from you again.

504
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,880
[Between 7.30 and 8 p.m.?]

505
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,300
[Why did I leave home all of a sudden?]

506
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,610
Did you fight with him?

507
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,790
I could tell that

508
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,270
Xuan He was not in a good mood

509
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,350
when he left.

510
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,870
Is it a misunderstanding?

511
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,750
You just have to explain to him.

512
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,830
It's still not too late to catch up with him.

513
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,760
No way.

514
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,070
Why should my daughter

515
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,000
chase after him?

516
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,440
No matter who is at fault,

517
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,880
Wei Xuan He

518
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,870
has to be the one who apologises first.

519
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,170
Senior Lei is right.

520
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,070
No matter what,

521
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,190
I won't leave home today.

522
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,030
Look at you!

523
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,960
You are adding fuel to the fire!

524
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,690
To get along with your partner,

525
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
you need to be wise. Got it?

526
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,480
Go get the dishes done. Go.

527
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,910
[No matter what happens,]

528
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,200
[I won't leave the house.]

529
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,880
[I must not disappear for another ten years.]

530
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,300
[It will break my parents' heart
for a second time.]

531
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,130
[July 23, 2021]

532
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,370
I want all the news coverage

533
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,450
on Xu Wei Yi's death.

534
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,560
I want it now.

535
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,270
[Chu Xia.]

536
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,110
[Believe it or not,]

537
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,510
[even until the last moment,]

538
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,160
[I had never thought of hurting you.]

539
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,830
[No matter where are you now
in the universe,]

540
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,800
[just don't reappear before me.]

541
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,740
[Let's respect]

542
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,550
[the will of the universe.]

543
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,540
[Let's put an end to it.]

544
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,000
Chu Xia!

545
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,440
Chu Xia!

546
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,750
[Unable to detect Chu Xia's signal.]

547
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,070
[Unable to connect to Turing.]

548
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,270
[Unable to locate Lei Chu Xia.]

549
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,710
Mr. Wei.

550
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,780
This is the document that you asked for.

551
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,570
Mr. Wei.

552
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
Someone is waiting for you.

553
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,590
Ms Qin came to the office today

554
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,590
looking for you.

555
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,620
However, I didn't tell her your schedule.

556
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,350
When did that happen?

557
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,480
Quite some time ago.

558
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,920
Okay.

559
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,780
Next time,

560
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,920
send me a message.

561
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,350
Sure, Mr. Wei.

562
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,520
What's wrong?

563
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,420
Nothing.

564
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,530
You just seem a little different from before.

565
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,400
You may leave now.

566
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,100
Xuan He.

567
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
You are back.

568
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,220
I cooked for you.

569
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,470
Let's go inside.

570
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,510
I won't necessarily come back here.

571
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,630
You might not get hold of me

572
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,070
if you wait here.

573
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,470
It's okay.

574
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,750
I'm experienced in this.

575
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,400
If you still don't come back

576
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,310
in an hour,

577
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I will wait for you in the office.

578
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,740
If I can't find you in the office,

579
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,050
I will go to the other places

580
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,170
where you usually frequent.

581
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,310
No matter what,

582
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,370
I will surely find you somewhere.

583
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,200
Listen.

584
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,170
Waiting for you is my hidden talent.

585
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,690
Is your effort

586
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,030
worth it?

587
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,430
You mean the dishes?

588
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,260
I can finish it.

589
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,440
I am incredible.

590
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,240
You know what I am trying to say.

591
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,980
Actually...

592
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,880
Xuan He.

593
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,780
Stop talking.

594
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,270
I like you.

595
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,020
That's why

596
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,880
when I know that you have feelings
for someone else,

597
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,850
I am unable to keep my emotion at bay.

598
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,620
However, it doesn't affect my love for you.

599
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,410
I will continue loving you.

600
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,070
I will keep loving you

601
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,230
until your feelings for others are gone.

602
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
I think by that time,

603
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,510
I would've mastered
the art of controlling my bad temper.

604
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,160
Hence, for the time being,

605
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,620
please show me the way, Mr. Wei.

606
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,860
I will work hard

607
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,900
to get rid of my bad temper.

608
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,660
However,

609
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,030
you have to work hard too.

610
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,480
Please work harder

611
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,550
to get rid of the feelings for someone else.

612
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,870
Okay?

613
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,830
Let's go home.

614
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,790
There is a bench not far away.

615
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,840
Let's take a break.

616
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,530
Here.

617
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:04,860
Slowly.

618
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,830
Show me your leg.

619
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,760
It's scrapped.

620
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,030
Can you walk?

621
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,870
It's okay.

622
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,679
I knew it. Something bad always happens

623
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,690
when Chu Xia goes out with Wei Xuan He.

624
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,230
Ten years ago...

625
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,719
Ten years ago,

626
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,290
Chu Xia had a fight with him.

627
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,460
Then, all of a sudden,

628
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,840
she disappeared for ten years.

629
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,969
The same thing happened again.

630
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,440
She said that

631
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,670
she was going for psychological counselling.

632
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,030
Then, she disappeared all of a sudden again.

633
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,630
If I can't find Chu Xia,

634
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,320
I won't spare him.

635
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,460
We have searched everywhere for her around here.

636
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,840
But we couldn't find her anywhere.

637
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,350
We can't reach her by phone too.

638
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,070
Chu Xia is always associated
with paranormal phenomenons.

639
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,440
Is it possible that

640
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
she has left this world

641
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,360
and travelled to another time and space?

642
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,560
No way.

643
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,480
No way!

644
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,150
What if

645
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,800
her magnetic field became unstable temporarily?

646
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,720
What if she was transported to another city?

647
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,980
What if she lost her memories

648
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,320
and forgot us?

649
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,710
She might have

650
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,980
brushed past us last night

651
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,840
but she couldn't recognize us.

652
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,230
We must

653
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,340
find Chu Xia now.

654
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,880
We must not

655
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,040
leave her alone.

656
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,160
We must look for her.

657
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,030
Slow down.

658
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,840
Let me help you.

659
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,060
Xiao Dong.

660
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,090
Xiao Dong!

661
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,550
-Xiao Dong!
-Xiao Dong!

662
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,270
[Summer Time]

663
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,280
Xiao Dong.

664
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,440
Have you found Chu Xia?

665
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,840
Have you found her?

666
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,980
No.

667
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,550
Have you found her?

668
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,660
Yuan Yuan.

669
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,130
Xiao Rui.

670
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,480
Take Yuan Yuan back for a rest.

671
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,710
I will look around for her.

672
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,790
No, I don't want to go back.

673
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
I want to look for her too.

674
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,830
No way.

675
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,230
I will feel more guilty

676
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,710
if you come along.

677
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,000
We should go back together.

678
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,320
Don't be stubborn.

679
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,190
Xiao Dong,

680
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,070
if you are worn out,

681
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,320
who else can Chu Xia rely on when she is back?

682
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,980
Same goes to Yuan Yuan.

683
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,910
Didn't you promise Chu Xia

684
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,230
you would look after Summer Time?

685
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,640
Your leg is injured.

686
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,280

you cleared yet another level,

I'm sure she will be very happy.

show it to mum by yourself?

That's because

756
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,970
I know that

757
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,390

758
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,850
If she knows that

759
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,080
you have become so good at playing the game,

760
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,710
she will surely feel more happy

761
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,880

However,

770
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,150

771
