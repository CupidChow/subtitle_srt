00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,800
But

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
only love

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240

187

Dad, Mum,

188
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,550
if something happened,

189
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,670
and no matter what you do

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,000
you might not be able to

191
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
change the outcome,

192
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,040
what would you do?

193
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Persevere of course.

194
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,830
How would you know it won't change

195

until you reach the end?

196
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,870
Sometimes people don't

197
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,240
do things to get results,

198
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,360
but to avoid regret.

199

weird phone call.

205

A strange woman

206
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,790
said she was looking for

207
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,550
Old Fairy Lady

208
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,150

209
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
is running away from home.

210
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,120
It's just bizarre.

211

216
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,270
So mysterious.

217
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
I've been looking for you for half a day.

218
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Why are you still thinking of running away from home?

219
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Is it because your dad didn't come back

220
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,430
and you're afraid that he

221
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,750
won't keep his promise?

222
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,510
I'm an adult now.

223
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,870
I'm very independent.

224

I don't need him.

225
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,480
If you're independent,

226
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,270
why are you

227
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,190
so close to home

228

when you miss someone,

231

you'll look up at the moon.

232

Do you know why?

233
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,550
Because the moon never changes.

234

the person you're missing

350
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,750
Were you really on a business trip?

351
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,910
Why?

352
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,110
Is Madam Chu Xia losing trust

353
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,400
in her boyfriend

354
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,280
and soon-to-be husband?

355
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,550
Stop working with Zhao Yao Yang.

356
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,470
Don't steal from others

357
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,590
with dirty tricks.

358
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you talking about?

359
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,640
I know everything.

360
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
The system source code that

361
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,310
you gave to Piggy Tech

362
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,400
for your cooperation with Zhao Yao Yang

363
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
was stolen from Xu Wei Yi,

364
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,720
isn't it?

365
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,270
Let's talk about this somewhere else.

366
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,190
Who told you

367
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,070
all that you said?

368
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,680
Don't trust in the lies.

369
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,400
It doesn't matter who told me.

370
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
Stop the press conference.

371
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,110
Don't work with Zhao Yao Yang.

372
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,950
This patent

373
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,830
is the blood and sweat of Xu Wei Yi.

374
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,160
By doing this,

375
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,310
you're pushing him over the edge.

376
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,240
To ask me to stop the press conference now

377
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
is pushing me over the edge.

378
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,510
You're finally admitting to it.

379
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,320
I'm doing this because

380
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,640
my hands are tied.

381
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,040
You know that

382
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,720
my company is barely surviving.

383
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,800
I can't

384
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,920
ask for money from my family

385
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
and I can't let my father know that

386
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,160
his son

387
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,270
is such a failure.

388
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,200
It's not too late to turn around.

389
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,320
Or else you might

390
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,680
bring misfortune to a lot of people.

391
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,680
Misfortune?

392
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,800
Do you know what's

393
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,680
the biggest misfortune?

394
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,240
I, Wei Xuan He,

395
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,790
son of Wei Guo Peng,

396
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,310
born to an affluent family with all eyes on me

397
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,510
but have no success.

398
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,750
With Xu Wei Yi's patent,

399
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,160
I can get my first pot of gold,

400
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,590
I can carry on with my entrepreneurship,

401
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
and I can bravely face

402
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,950
the criticism that people

403
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,830
throw at me.

404
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,510
If I have to stop now,

405
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
I can only beg for mercy

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,960
from my father.

407
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,990
I'll be turning into

408
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,640
a good for nothing

409
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,000
spoiled rich kid,

410
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,720
a degenerate who only disappoints my father

411
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,160
and shames the family?

412
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,510
But why

413
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,880
are you stealing from others?

414
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,400
Xu Wei Yi isn't just anyone,

415
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,400
he's a genius.

416
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,190
But this genius

417
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,160
just had to develop things

418
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,160
that are in the same direction as me.

419
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,070
He's the one

420
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
who's pushing me over the edge.

421
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,880
A genius can develop

422
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,440
the first revolutionary system,

423
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,200
and he'll be able to make the second,

424
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,070
third, fourth, fifth...

425
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,880
With his brains,

426
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,390
countless patents will be his

427
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,160
in the future.

428
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,960
But I

429
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,880
only have this one chance.

430
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,640
Have you changed

431
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,230
or have I never

432
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,270
really understood you?

433
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,680
Why am I doing this?

434
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,270
I'm doing this

435
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,270
for the both of us.

436
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,800
This success

437
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,640
will not only give you

438
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,590
a better future,

439
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,440
my father will officially

440
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,030
accept you.

441
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,640
I've rejected

442
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,270
the marriage arranged

443
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,510
by my family for you.

444
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,510
Was I wrong?

445
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,720
Chu Xia,

446
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm begging you.

447
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,430
Don't you want to be

448
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,310
with me happily?

449
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,790
You can't build your happiness

450
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,350
on the suffering of others.

451
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,190
Xuan He,

452
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,440
you really shouldn't do this.

453
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,270
You'll ruin yourself.

454
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,270
I only have this one chance.

455
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,960
It's not like that.

456
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,790
You have talent and capability.

457
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,160
You can proudly

458
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,880
get achievements that only belong to you.

459
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,150
You don't get it.

460
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,200
I really only have this one chance.

461
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,070
I'm not as good as you imagined.

462
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,310
Wei Xuan He!

463
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,030
Anyone there?

464
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,180
[2021]

465
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,680
Mr. Wei, you asked for me?

466
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,880
Tell the related departments

467
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,270
to get everything ready.

468
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
The Family First system

469
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,680
will be launched soon.

470
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,840
But Mr. Wei,

471
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,710
the technical team said

472
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,600
that there are problems related to the system

473
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,480
that haven't been resolved.

474
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,670
Didn't I already

475
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,950
give Xu Wei Yi's source code

476
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,880
to them?

477
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,440
Do they need me

478
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,720
to hold their hand?

479
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,200
Proceed.

480
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,920
There's no time

481
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,110
for worries.

482
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,150
Xuan He!

483
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,920
Okay.

484
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,830
I'll get it done.

485
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,200
Xuan He!

486
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,720
You've been avoiding me for a day.

487
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,480
You haven't answered my question.

488
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,720
Xuan He,

489
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,400
could you answer me?

490
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,270
Have you been

491
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,880
working with Wang Yi Xin

492
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,750
and forcibly removing Lei Chu Xia

493
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,350
without caring if she lives or dies?

494
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,760
So...

495
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,920
So everything Lei Chu Xia said

496
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,350
was true?

497
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,600
You stole Xu Wei Yi,

498
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,000
Xu Xiao Dong's dad's patent?

499
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,350
You were the one who caused Lei Chu Xia

500
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,440
to fall off the cliff a decade ago?

501
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,560
I've never thought of

502
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,480
putting her in harm's way.

503
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,160
She was the one who tripped.

504
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,830
Xuan He,

505
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,720
I've always thought

506
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,680
that we're the same type of people.

507
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
We'll never hide our desire

508
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,750
when it comes to things that we set our eyes on,

509
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,400
and will go all out to get it.

510
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,070
But I was wrong.

511
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,550
We're nothing alike.

512
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,990
I will never

513
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,800
build my success

514
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,680
on the sufferings of others.

515
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Xuan He,

516
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,070
was I wrong about you,

517
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,750
or have I never

518
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,310
known the real you?

519
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,600
[You can't build your happiness]

520
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,400
[on the suffering of others.]

521
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,110
[We're nothing alike.]

522
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,510

702
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,920
is the result of

703
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,630
diligent research

704
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,800
by my company for the past three years.

705
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,800
We've also registered for a patent.

706
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,670
You're plagiarising.

Do you have anything to say about this?

711

here

717
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,190
I would like to firmly announce

718
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,840
that Piggy Tech

719
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,190
has successfully

720
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,550
registered our patent earlier on.

721
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,760
This is a patent document

722
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,480
that has full legal effect.

723

See for yourself.

724
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,800
That's impossible.

725
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,920
That's impossible.

00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,190
If we're looking into plagiarism,

727
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,800
we should look at you, Xu Yi Wei

728

Mr. Xu,

735
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,110

737

Why would that happen?

738
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800

739

copy or steal,

We need to always look at the evidence.

What is this?

748
