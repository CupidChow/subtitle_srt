<i>Long, long ago,</i>

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,530
<i>a high school girl had her heart broken and tried to jump from the school's roof.</i>

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,810
<i>The incredibly handsome schoolteacher, Haiba Jin, came to the rescue.</i>

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,130
<i>She fell in love instantly.</i>

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,660
<i>After some twists and turns, the girl found new friends,</i>

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>and the suspension bridge effect created a forbidden love.</i>

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,942
<i>The girl and Haiba Jin reached the goal, had a son and a daughter, won the lottery...</i>

8

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,100
What are you doing?

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,130
What do you mean? I'm thinking up new ideas.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,605
Most of those ideas are overused fantasies.

14
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,130
And what are you up to?

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,880
No, seriously.

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,630
Your drawing flew away so I'm picking it up.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,320
That's dangerous. What if you fall?

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm surprisingly athletic.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,255
But still...

20
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,248
And this area...

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,740
actually has a big buffer before the edge.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,365
I wish I could go back a year and tell ourselves that.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,884
And shouldn't you be in class?

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,510
Well, you know...

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,065

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,450
Didn't you quit by switching to candy?

28
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,660
In line with the times.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,380
<i>That's what I'm doing.</i>

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,578
<i>In line with the times.</i>

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,850
The times are rough nowadays and not depicted here.

32
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,885
You shouldn't try to act meta to try to evade everything.

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,868
In other words, you weren't able to quit, right?

34
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,800
It's harder than people think.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,540
For me, the nicotine fairy was calling, every day louder than the last.

36
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,530
Sensei...

37
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,150
Just stop there.

38
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,470

00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:12,620

47
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,260
<i>This kind of relationship isn't half bad.</i>

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,350

So why are you painting?

70
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
It's for the art class.

71
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,060
Do you need a model?

72
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,170
I'll do it. I'm wearing white today.

73
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,495
White is a rare look for you.

74
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,190
Yes.

75
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,870
I'm wearing my favorite cardigan.

76
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,360
I don't want chalk on it, you know?

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,910
Is that why you're wearing white?

78
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,690
So how should I pose?

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,085
No, it's fine.

80
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,760
I have to draw a core memory.

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,800
"A core memory"?

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,490
A landscape within my heart.

83
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,410
One that feels nostalgic.

84
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,340
So the place where you fell in love with me is okay?

85
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,965
No, it's not.

86
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,945
Then why would you come here?

87
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,280
I wanted to look through my memories in a quiet place.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,366
- What kind of memories? Memories of me?
- Not even close.

89
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:41,230
- Don't be shy about it.
- It's not like that.

90
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,020
Okay, show me.

91
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,180
What are you painting?

92
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,120
Sensei.

93
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:52,780
What is this?

94
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,350
Me in the forest.

95
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,600
What's with this harmony of navy and gray?

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,790
It's from in my heart.

97
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,429
Your heart is covered in darkness.

98
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,654
Deep in the woods? Why were you there?

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,580
I got lost here when I was little.

100
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,550
But...

101
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,000
I felt sad while painting it.

102
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,350
So...

103
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,860
I added an adult.

104
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:48,720
I wish I had been with an adult back then.

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,108
So I infused those feelings.

106
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:58,220
Wait.

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,070
Wait, an adult?

108
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,640
- Hey, is that adult...
- My older brother.

109
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,155
But I'm dependable, too.

110
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:07,940
Even anatomical models scare you.

111
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,030
You don't see those outside of school.

112
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,810
Thus, I'm dependable outside of school.

113
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,245
You're a teacher. Don't be proud of that.

114
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,945
What?

115
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,150
And...

116
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,410
What if you got lost...

117
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,640
deep in the woods?

118
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,570
Sensei, what if you saw a rotting corpse or skeleton?

119
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,280
You'd become totally hopeless.

120
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,005
I'd help in other ways.

121
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,140
Either way, I got out without an adult.

122
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,460
What was the point of all that?

123
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:08,580
Well, okay. What's important is that you were safe.

124
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,714
I'm glad you got out.

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,755
Yes.

126
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,972
If I didn't get out...

127
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,903
I wouldn't have met you.

128
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,625
Oh?

129
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:33,860
I see.

130
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,365
Wait, I didn't mean anything special by it.

131
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:40,430
It's just that you're always helping me.

132
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,797
It's okay to admit it.

133
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,805
Don't act so embarrassed.

134
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,520
I'm not embarrassed.

135
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm...

136
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,561
glad we met, too.

137
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,825
Oh, I found Ochiai.

138
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:23,510
It's time to return to the art room.

139
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,740
Oh, okay.

140
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,675
Oh? It's Haijin-chan!

141
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,900
- What are you doing?
- Are you proposing?

142
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,430
It's not like that.

143
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,391
Don't interrupt us. Get going.

144
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:37,430
Is Haijin for real?

145
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,839
It's not like that. He picked up my brush and...

146
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,410
They're just teasing me. Don't get flustered.

147
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,420
I know you think that, but...

148
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,649
But really...

149
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,613
Will you marry me?

150
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,940
You shouldn't tease me either.

151
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
Oh.

152
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,730
Oh.

153
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm so sorry.

154
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,830
Don't worry.

155
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,020
I remember I bought it with my very first paycheck, though.

156
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,270
I'm joking.

157
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,145
You are?

158
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:54,695
And it's 70% my fault for teasing you.

159
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,000
- I'd say 80%.
- 70%. Don't push it.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,714
You panic too easily.

161
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,811
But...

162
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,178
Proposing to me there, even as a joke is...

163
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,697
I think it's normal that I panic.

164
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,090
That's true.

165
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,049
I'm sorry about that. It's 100% my fault.

166
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,299
Are you not angry?

167
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:40,260
I don't get angry over stuff like this or hate anyone for it.

168
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,292
Don't worry.

169
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,510
<i>I feel comfortable with him.</i>

170
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,440

<i>core memories...</i>

173
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,820
All right, let's go home. It's late.

174
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:18,340
<i>It was surprisingly easy to paint my core memory.</i>

175
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,160
<i>Is it because...</i>

176
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,060
So, Sensei...

177
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,174
Did we ever...

178
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,180
meet a long time ago?

179
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,130
We did.

180
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,540
Do you remember that fateful day?

181
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,840
That's when you said,

182
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,860
"I'll give myself to you when I turn 17!"

183
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,050
I never said that.

184
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,970
I must be imagining things.

185
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,435
It's true! In a field of flowers under a starry sky.

186
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:19,380
Is that so?

187
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,886
I shouldn't have asked.

188
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,000
<i>It bothered me... just a tiny bit.</i>

189
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,185
Why am I...

190
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,100
the only one you call "High School Girl"?

191
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,520
Why ask him and not me?

192
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,610
I mixed you two up. Your names are too similar.

193
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,605
Wait, are you angry, High School Girl? Are you upset?

194
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,500
At first, I didn't think it was a big deal.

195
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:20,097
But gradually, as I paid attention to my peers more...

196
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,210
<i>Next question.</i>

197
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,290
<i>I noticed it.</i>

198
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,990
<i>Riko-pi.</i>

199
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,127
<i>Oh... Sorry.</i>

200
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:31,860
<i>- It's too hard.
- What?</i>

201
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,770
<i>Okay, then...</i>

202
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,100
<i>Makochi.</i>

203
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,120
<i>I don't know either.</i>

204
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,850
<i>And don't call me that.</i>

205
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,350
<i>Can't help it. There are three Aokis in the class.</i>

206
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,020
<i>At least use my name.</i>

207
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,335
<i>- Makochi-san.
- Come on, that's gross.</i>

208
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,530
<i>Be reasonable.</i>

209
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,710
<i>Well... Okay then.</i>

210
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,510
<i>High School Girl.</i>

211
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,920
<i>Why?</i>

212
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,780
First, step away from Jin.

213
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,920
I seriously can't handle gore.

214
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,170
You hate this thing, yet you still call it by name.

215
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,460
But I'm "High School Girl."

216
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,705
In other words, am I just one of the many other high school girls?

217
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,440
No, you got it all wrong.

218
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,830
This is a misunderstanding.

219
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,940
As an adult with good judgment...

220
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,345
Is that a joke? I'm not in the mood.

221
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,485
This isn't a joke.

222
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,819
Come here.

223
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,141
Let's have a serious chat.

224
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:51,916
Is this just about your name?

225
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,113
Yes.

226
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,611
It only crossed my mind for a split second though.

227
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,490
<i>His name for me isn't like the others'.</i>

228
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,311
<i>It sparked a slight unease in me.</i>

229
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:11,344
Does this guy...

230
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:17,770
actually have feelings for me?

231
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,150
Do you still doubt me?

232
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,856
I wouldn't say that.

233
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,930
I'm the only one you call "High School Girl."

234
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,027
How do I put this?

235
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,205
I'm just...

236
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:35,439
jealous of everyone. Isn't it only natural?

237
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,322
There's no deep meaning to it.

238
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:47,860
You just use it for no reason?

239
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,360
Yes.

240
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,020
Is there no reason for it?

241
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,740
Oh, there is!

242
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,320
There's a deep reason for it!

243
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,330
Oh.

244
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,850
Well...

245
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,970
So...

246
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,730
High School Girl,

247
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,990
HSG, is an acronym for "Honestly, So Gorgeous."

248
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,045
HSG.

249
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:26,080
You haven't given this much thought, huh?

250
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,505
Even Kawasaki has a better name.

251
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,420
BKB? Do you call her Kawasaki?

252
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,555
Just so you know, my name isn't the only thing you're sloppy about.

253
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,890
You gave me pachinko prizes and a suicide note.

254
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:45,355
And it wasn't in the J-drama, but you gave me a bottle of air for Valentine's Day.

255
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,449
Sensei?

256
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,990
Do you...

257
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,990
really like me?

258
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,050
Yes. I can see why you'd doubt me.

259
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,640
I feel down now that I think about it.

260
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,077
That's everything that bothered me.

261
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:14,032
I'm sorry. I really do like you.

262
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,680
<i>We're talking about Sensei.</i>

263
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,309
<i>If he's still staying silent,</i>

264
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,020
<i>he must have his reasons.</i>

265
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,880
Hey, do you hate being called High School Girl that much?

266
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,682
It... It's more like...

267
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,460
I'm jealous of everyone else.

268
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,940
Okay. I won't call you that anymore.

269
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,070
What?

270
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,820
It's not like I enjoy that nickname either.

271
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,040
What? Then why?

272
00:18:56,612 --> 00:19:01,750
It's because you're too forward lately. That's why.

273
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,380
What?

274
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,660
You moved your hand toward me.

275
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,550
Oh, that was...

276
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,349
You even acted jealous today.

277
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:23,354
I do remember being like that, but how is that related?

278
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,640
Oh.

279
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,068
I see.

280
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:35,140
If I'm acting forward, and you give me a nickname too,

281
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:41,420
there's a higher risk hat people will find out, right?

282
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:47,160
Oh, in that case, I'm sorry for being petty about my nickname.

283
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,022
Well, it's more like...

284
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,740
<i>Wait.</i>

285
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,945
<i>Did he limit the presents he gave me</i>

286
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:01,510
<i>to avoid being found out and causing trouble?</i>

287
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,061
<i>If that's true...</i>

288
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,690
Did you call me High School Girl

289
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,770
out of concern for those around us?

290
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:21,440
