Oh, High School Girl.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,030
Hey, are you listening to music? That's rare.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,510
You're surprisingly in a good mood.

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,500
Well, it is summer break tomorrow.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,400
But I'm not.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,480

[Episode 4 - Nightmare]

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,130
Mr. Haiba.

28
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,510
Can you kill someone with just sound?

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,560
Is that your plan?

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,160
Oh, sorry. That came out wrong.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,610
Can you kill someone with just your voice?

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,240
No, that still sounds bad.

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,820
Why? Are you writing an essay on it?

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,260
No.

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,100
Mr. Haiba...

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
I've told you this before, but...

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,280
I'm not...

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,310
good at singing.

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm quite bad.

40
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,220
Oh. Really?

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,970
It could even cause a mental breakdown.

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,820
No way. That could never actually...

43
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,910
It's me in the forest.

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,880
No, really.

45
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,460
happen.

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,500
Did you get a bad grade in Music?

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,580
- I'm not taking Music.
- Oh, really.

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,200
But someone from class said,

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,390
"This is our last summer break."

50
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,260
"Let's go sing karaoke
with everyone in our class."

51
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,820
Must be tough for you.

52
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,010
Such despicable peer pressure...

53
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,350
You couldn't say no, huh?

54
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,180
Saying "everyone in class" is cheating,
don't you think?

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,730
I was dragged there as a high schooler too.

56
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,820
- You went, huh?
- Yeah.

57
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,520
Those out-of-style songs
still echo faintly in my ears.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,960
"What song is this?"

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,850
My voice drowned in the instrumental.

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,190
- I was on my phone 70% of the time.
- Oh.

61
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,280
But you listened 30% of the time?

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
I was in the restroom.

63
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I want to go even less now.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,620
Basically, I got through it, so you can too.

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,310
But my singing is still...

66
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,390
Did you not sing much before?

67
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,010
You know, before high school,
you have Music classes and singing contests.

68
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,160
I faked it.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm impressed.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,260
I thought you'd be against class hangouts.

71
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,760
I expected you to say,
"Let's go together instead."

72
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,700
You don't mind if I go with all those guys?

73
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,370
Why do you want my permission?

74
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:22,860
Because every time I go out with guys,
you act all jealous.

75
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,110
Did that happen? My memory is like a floppy disk.

76
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,140
"Floppy"?

77
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,060
Just so you know, I'm keeping myself in check.

78
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,820
I don't want to mess with your friendships.

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,880
So, at least let me be
a little jealous afterwards.

80
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,980
What?

81
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,420
Well...

82
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,540
I want to hear your voice first,
before everyone in class hears it.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,080
Really?

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,580
Why don't you sing here?

85
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,680
Oh, I'm kidding, High School Girl.
Don't glare at me.

86

99
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,050
Huh? Back already?

100
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,498
How was karaoke?

101
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,662
Did you not go?

102
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:18,198
Come here, Monroe.

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,270
Could it be?

104
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,940
Are you actually worried
about your voice killing people?

105
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,580
No.

106
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,940
I did go.

107
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,780
I spent the time hiding in the crowd at first.

108
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,360
But then...

109
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,550
"Did everyone sing?" Someone had to ask.

110
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,920
I see. Kindness that no one asked for.

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,820
They found out that I didn't sing a single song,

112
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,000
and they said, "Ochiai, sing something."

113
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,710
I suddenly got sick and left without singing.

114
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,990
You got sick so conveniently.

115
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,920
They were really concerned for me.

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,780
They're so nice.

117
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,380
The guilt is crushing me. My heart's in pain.

118
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,320
You look like you're actually sick.

119
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,460
Why did you lie like that?

120
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,060
Well...

121
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,320
You said...

122
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,220
you want to hear my singing voice first.

123
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,040
Sing then.

124
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
I'm terrible.

125
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,530
It doesn't matter to me if you're good or bad.

126
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,140
And I'm a fan of your voice itself.

127
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,010
I knew you'd say that.

128
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,750
But there's more.

129
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,220
<i>Sing lullabies for our future children.</i>

130
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
<i>Let's get married.</i>

131
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,410
- Sing...
- I'm not singing lullabies.

132
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,930
How did you know? Are you psychic?

133
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,500
Because you always make passes at me
with the same stupid lines.

134
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,490
Don't change the topic. Sing for me already.

135
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,395
You're the one who got off-topic.

136
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,325
Hurry.

137
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,790
Are you serious?

138
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,670
Absolutely.

139
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,410
What should I sing then?

140
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,285
Anything's fine. Even the anthem.

141
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,890
Then...

142
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,960
Mickey...

143
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
You'd better not sing that.

144
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,240
Copyright and stuff.

145
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,970
Didn't you want me to sing?

146
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,520
Well...

147
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,240
Yeah, but...

148
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,300
I also didn't think
you'd say no to karaoke for me.

149
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,580
I told you to have fun.

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>But, Mr. Haiba...</i>

151
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,220
<i>You're usually fussier than me.</i>

152
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,100
Well, don't think too hard. Just have fun.

153
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,320
<i>Sometimes, you act so mature
and restrain yourself.</i>

154
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,360
Don't blame me for losing friends.

155
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,300
I wouldn't.

156
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,580
Or rather...

157
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,110
It's okay...

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,860
if you bind me a little bit.

159
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,000
<i>The sounds that came from my mouth
were contrary to how I felt.</i>

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Okay, then.

161
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,900
Don't you dare say that to anyone else.

162
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,360
What's wrong?

163
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,520
My ears died and my mind's halfway there.

164
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,920
Should I sing a requiem?

165
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,300
Sounds can kill people, so be careful.

166
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,530
I'll die even if you pet me.

167
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,980
That's news to me.

168
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,780
<i>He always acts contrary to how he feels.</i>

169
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,560
<i>I think I get him a bit better now.</i>

170
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,920
<i>An ambiguous feeling
that's a bit different from reality.</i>

171
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,300
Mikoto.

172
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,540
I got Jin's diary.
You said you wanted first dibs.

173
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,100
<i>A dream?</i>

174
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,220
<i>Is this Mr. Haiba from high school?</i>

175
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,300
<i>It's probably my imagination,
since I've never seen it.</i>

176
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,960
<i>And yet...</i>

177
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,820
<i>Mr. Haiba's old self doesn't seem too friendly.</i>

178
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,140
I must have fallen asleep
while doing my homework.

179
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,040
I guess there's no point
in doing it in my dreams. Right?

180
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,340
Homework?

181
00:12:53,648 --> 00:13:00,170
You studied with me so much
that now you're dreaming of it, High School Girl?

182
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,820
<i>It's creepy how he's just like his current self.</i>

183
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,130
What's with the face?

184
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,060
It's nothing.

185
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,635
Anyway, you're studying in a dream?
You're such a good student.

186
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,140
Mr. Haiba.

187
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,080
Mr...

188
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,140
You're studying too, right?

189
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,720
No, I'm writing a diary. Kind of like a will.

190
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,700
Mr. Haiba.

191
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:44,824
<i>I don't belong here.</i>

192
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:51,864
<i>But I probably don't belong anywhere
in this entire world.</i>

193
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,300
<i>I shouldn't exist in this world.</i>

194
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,830
[Today was a failure. What should I do tomorrow?]

195
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,610
You spelled this wrong. Jeez.

196
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,870
You made that happen. It's your dream.

197
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,300
You spelled "failure" wrong. It should be...

198
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
High School Girl.

199
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,780
This is a dream. Who cares about that?

200
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,110
Don't just grow up randomly. That scared me.

201
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,250
You made this happen too.

202
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,910
It's a reflection of your fantasies.

203
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,170
Fan...

204
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,840
So...

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,640
You can do whatever you want in your dream.

206
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,900
There are no laws here.

207
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,020
That's...

208
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,840
Give me some shaved ice.

209
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,910
Jin, you're finally headed home?

210
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,930
Yeah. It's so hot outside.

211
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,050
Mikoto's here.

212
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,470
Really? Why?

213
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,900
She was waiting for you.

214
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Forget the shaved ice.

215
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,970
High School Girl.

216
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,380
You're late, Mr. Haiba.

217
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,830
I almost fell asleep waiting for you.

218
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,360
I see. Nice bedhead.

219
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,840
Why were you waiting?

220
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,940
I wanted you to help me with
my physics homework again this year.

221
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,470
Why not at my house?

222
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,520
When we're alone, you joke around more.

223
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,790
And I might fall asleep at your house.

224
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,660
Bedhead's on the other side.

225
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,960
Why are you trying to hide it?

226
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,540
There, there.

227
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,400
You're diligent with your homework
again this year. What a good student.

228
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,220
That's sarcasm.

229
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,240
So, how many pages left?

230
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,780
One page.

231
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,290
Stop being a good student.
Did you really want to study with me?

232
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,145
You're giving me too much praise.

233
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,535
It was only twice.

234
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:05,650
<i>Dang it. He said it once in my dream.</i>

235
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,630
I only became studious recently.

236
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,650
Before high school, I'd do my homework
last-minute like a delinquent.

237
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,960
That makes you a delinquent?

238
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,860
But I can't imagine that from you.

239
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,700
It's because I had a diary.

240
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,300
A one-sentence diary.

241
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,540
I think I understand.

242
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,380
The empty space never fills up.

243
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,720
You should've just written whatever.

244
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,580
Are you telling me to lie?

245
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,180
No, I'm not.

246
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,450
Things like, "I wish
I could've hung out with friends."

247
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,940
"I wish we had a family vacation."

248
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,300
Just write about your wishes.

249
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,710
Because those aren't lies.

250
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,800
They feel just as empty as lies though.

251
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,360
Then...

252
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:03,840
in your diary...

253
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,460
did you write your wishes?

254
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,870
Hm...

255
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,920
Who knows? I forgot.

256
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,560
Well, that's not important.

257
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,060
Hurry up and finish so I can flirt with you.

258
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:39,118
<i>Whether it's my dream or in reality,</i>

259
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,998
<i>he still tries to hide himself with his jokes.</i>

260
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,562
[Today was a failure. What should I do tomorrow?]
[People don't die that easily.]

261
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:50,460
[I want to get rid of everything.]

262
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,200
Mr. Haiba.

263
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,660
Yeah?

264
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:01,110
Want to light up fireworks?

265
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,775
Huh? What?

266
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,365
Your homework.

267
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,800
I'm done for today.

268
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,245
I've already asked Shota if we can use his place.

269
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:13,120
Oh, that's why you're here.

270
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,398
Sometimes, making summer memories is more important than studying, even for me.

271
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,860
So let's forget about my homework,

272
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,600
and have a good time shooting up fireworks.

273
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,360
You've become a delinquent.

274
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,860
That makes me a delinquent?

275
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,535
And I almost finished all of it
while waiting for you, so it's fine.

276
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:40,325
You never planned to study with me.

277
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,410
Well...

278
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,940
If you don't like fireworks...

279
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,280
we can do homework then.

280
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,540
Of course, I like them.

281
00:19:57,411 --> 00:19:59,171
I'd love to.

282
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,580
High School Girl.

283
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,750
These aren't fireworks.

284
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,580
It's incense.

285
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,970
Why did we wear yukata?

286
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,920
I can tell.

287
00:20:24,695 --> 00:20:30,780
The fireworks and incense were in the same area.
I must've brought the wrong ones.

288
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:32,820
How?

289
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,925
I thought I bought a pack
of ten different sparklers...

290
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:39,645
Oh, so you meant to buy sparklers.

291
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:44,765
I thought that adults would prefer
a calmer type of fireworks.

292
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,665
Sorry to disappoint you.

293
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:51,680
But still, that would fit the mood here perfectly.

294
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,995
Sparklers, I mean.

295
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,645
But even those...

296
00:20:57,525 --> 00:21:00,630
Oh, incense is nice too.

297
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,190
We can just look at them.

298
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,430
These summer memories will stay with us.

299
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,300
This feels like a bad omen though.

300
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,090
Well, it's rare to see you be this proactive.

301
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,985
It's so rare, you just weren't used to it yet.

302
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,565
It's fine.

303
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,260
We'll do fireworks next time.

304
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:35,030
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by the
💕Sensei, please seduce me! Team 📚 @Viki.com</i>

305
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,000
After meeting you,

306
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,240
my summer vacations
have been incredibly fulfilling.

307
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,450
If I had to write a diary for this year,

308
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,540
I wouldn't be at a loss.

309
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,040
This is...

310
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,040
all thanks to you.

311
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,200
♫ <i>In the emptiness of dawn</i> ♫

312
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,000
I wanted to return the favor.

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,910
♫ <i>I wake up from a hollow dream</i> ♫

314
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,590
What if you had to write a diary this year?

315
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,380
♫ <i>The discarded shirt doesn't suit the flower's name</i> ♫

316
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,750
If you feel fulfilled,
that inevitably means I feel fulfilled too.

317
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,625
♫ <i>The lingering scent of your skin that I touched</i> ♫

318
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:41,600
Would you be able to fill it with fun memories?

319
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,380
Even my future is packed to the brim.

320
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,760
♫ <i>You are not aware of them</i> ♫

321
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,895
Mr. Haiba, I assumed you were the type
to procrastinate.

322
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,670
But you're a good student.

323
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,240
You noticed?

324
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,400
Even if it's not fireworks,

325
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,140
if there's anything you want to do, let's make it happen.

326
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,210
In that case...

327
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:23,570
I want a pajama party.

328
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,390
No.

329
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,625
You said "anything".

330
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,065
Try again, but hide your ulterior motives.

331
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:38,480
I have no right to see my younger sister.

332
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,510
- Do you like your brother?
- Yes, of course.

333
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,145
Thank you, Jin, for making sure
Mikoto will never be alone.

334
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:50,096
High School Girl, I'm thinking of dying tomorrow.
