00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:17,980
<i>I have no right to see my younger sister.</i>

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,090
Four taiyaki, please.

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,930
Sure. That's quite an appetite.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,020
I want to give some to my brother.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,140
<i>It's been a long time since I last looked
into her eyes and spoke to her.</i>

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,660
<i>I don't know how I could ever show my face to her.</i>

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,740
<i>I want to see Mikoto.</i>

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,960
<i>It's been so long since I saw her at school.</i>

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,980
<i>I want to see her...</i>

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,180
<i>Darn it. School's already over.</i>

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,820
M-M-Mr. Shimabukuro?

[Episode 5 - One's Final Days]

14
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,860
Why is he here?

15
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,950
I ran into him, but he wouldn't talk,
so I brought him here.

16
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,260
I didn't have a choice.

17
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,180
You should've ignored him.

18
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm not a monkey.

19
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,420
By the way, Kazuma was looking for you.

20
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
Huh?

21
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,570
He hasn't contacted me.

22
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,890
A pigeon came and told me.

23
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,430
You use carrier pigeons?

24
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,230
Just go.

25
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,340
Okay.

26
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,140
Goodbye, Mr. Shimabukuro.

27
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,100
So, what is this?

28
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,195
Visiting her class.

29
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,925
What kind of guardian would come with that on?

30
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,940
I ran into her by accident
and put this on immediately.

31
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,050
I know you don't want her to see you,
but this is a school.

32
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,550
Use your common sense.

33
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,980
Look who's talking.

34
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,080
Take that thing off then.

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,890
Stop.

36
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,990
- Come on!
- You'll get detention.

37
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,300
There we go!

38
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,800
Why do you have two on?

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,860
- Magic.
- Can I punch you?

40
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,504
I... wanted to watch her from afar.

41
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,190
I didn't plan on wearing this.

42
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,540
She caught me off guard.

43
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,680
What's the big deal if she sees you?

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,445
She can't.

45
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:13,940
And... it would only trouble her too.

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,660
Why?

47
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:25,940
As a kid, she'd never tell our parents
about class visits and such.

48
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,060
You already know this,

49
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,620
but I have a frail body.

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,220
I think...

51
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,140
she must have been really lonely.

52
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,700
So, the reason why Mikoto
pushed down her feelings...

53
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,570
was because of me.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,760
That's why she can never see me.

55
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,700
Jeez, put that away.

56
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,460
So, before she comes back...

57
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,640
I told you, Mikoto.

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,710
Everything he says is a lie.

59
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,100
The pigeon stuff did sound weird.

60
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,360
Why did you believe that?

61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,110
- I was just humoring him.
- Dang it. They're here.

62
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,660
Hey, Haijin. I wasn't looking for her.

63
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,300
Huh?

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,300
What is this? An amateur robbery?

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,920
This is Mr. Shimabukuro.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,060
He's Mr. Haiba's friend.

67
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh, someone with a common interest.

68
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,460
Who do you think I am?

69
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,300
Hm?

70
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:56,640
Huh? What's with the kid?

71
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,690
Oh, this is Yuki.
It seems he can't find his sister.

72
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,810
Why bring everyone here?

73
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,020
Everyone who's lost should be kept in one area.

74
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
This isn't a center for lost kids.

75
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,680
Whatever. Ask the office
to make an announcement.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,160
No way. You go do it.

77
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,460
What? Why do I have to do it?

78
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm busy grading right now.

79
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,020
Who cares? What the heck.

80
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,620
Hey, what are you doing?

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,100
Hey, stop. What is this?

82
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,065
Let's play.

83
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,245
Huh?

84
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,260
Yuki, want to make origami with me?

85
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,980
Yeah!

86
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,660
Maybe I'll try too.

87
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,575
Oh, then take this.

88
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,870
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,300
What should we make?

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,320
Those are my papers.

91
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,100
What?

92
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,410
Who's that young man?

93
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,934
Hm?

94
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,699
Oh, that's Kazuma. High School Girl's friend.

95
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,100
Her friend?

96
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,140
Mikoto has a friend?

97
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,110
I've never seen her...

98
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,740
smile like that.

99
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,220
That's amazing.

100
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,200
You know...

101
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,400
She has changed.

102
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,260
You did great.

103
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,070
Big Sis!

104
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,920
Where were you? I was looking for you.

105
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,310
Oh, he's your brother, Rikopi?

106
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,080
Yeah. Isn't he cute?

107
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,460
Oh, were you playing with him, Ochiai?

108
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,450
- Thank you so much. Really.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,730
I had fun too.

110
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,235
Yuki, I'm glad you found your sister.

111
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,435
Yeah.

112
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,010
By the way, High School Girl.

113
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,645
You have a sibling too, right?

114
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,165
Yes, a big brother.

115
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,980
Do you like your brother?

116
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,750
Yes.

117
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,420
Of course.

118
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,340
I see.

119
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,100
Hey.

120
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,820
Leaving already?

121
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,020
Yes.

122
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,500
Are you sure?

123
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,060
I've never seen that side of Mikoto.

124
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,860
It's... a side she never showed at home.

125
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,650
Thank you,

126
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,140
Jin,

127
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:01,020
for making sure Mikoto will never be alone.

128
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,450
Excuse me.

129
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,660
Mr. Shimabukuro.

130
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,840
I almost forgot.

131
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,620
Thank you for the cake
you left at the birthday party.

132
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,080
I told Mr. Haiba to thank you for me.

133
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,495
Oh, I forgot.

134
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:41,925
I didn't know you'd be here for class visits.

135
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,740
What about you?

136
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,180
Did anyone come?

137
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,020
My...

138
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,140
home is a bit far.

139
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,780
And, well...

140
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:03,490
If you miss them, I can be your guardian.

141
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,740
You need to be the teacher.

142
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,420
And...

143
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,420
I'm fine with it now.

144
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,130
This will be the last year I feel lonely.

145
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,780
Huh?

146
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,010
I...

147
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,920
I...

148
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,610
I came to see you.

149
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,460
Is that true?

150
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,560
Thank you.

151
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,820
Mr. Shimabukuro.

152
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,240
Right...

153
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,860
You may already know this...

154
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,760
but my brother came to visit my class today.

155
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,470
Huh? You noticed?

156
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,954
He texted me earlier.

157
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,414
[I was relieved that
you were taking the class seriously.]

158
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,405
<i>He didn't reveal himself?</i>

159
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:31,835
<i>That chicken.</i>

160
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,340
We almost met today.

161
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,820
I only got to hear his voice.

162
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,100
How much do you know?

163
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,220
Nothing at all.

164
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,220
I don't think I'll know for a while.

165
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,010
High School Girl.

166
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,890
I'm thinking of dying tomorrow.

167
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,580
What?

168
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:58,730
Can you go through my bucket list with me?

169
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,380
Your bucket list?

170
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,980
It's basically a list of things
I want to do before I die.

171
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:11,690
I was curious what you were going to say.

172
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,405
I'm dying tomorrow, so help me go through it.

173
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,900
<i>But I'm studying for entrance exams.</i>

174
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:24,260
Um... I can help you,

175
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,660
but why are you dying tomorrow?

176
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:00,040
What are you trying to pull?

177
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,775
Wait. Put your fists down.

178
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,125
Let's talk it out.

179
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,440
All right.

180
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,780
I want to act young.

181
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,885
You want to act young?

182
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,045
Yeah.

183
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,089
Well, that's easy enough.

184
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,910
All right. Then let's head out right away.

185
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,155
Where?

186
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:34,285
Youth is best experienced
playing sports in the gym!

187
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:44,870
Why are we roller skating?

188
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,955
It's youthful. I'm good at roller skating.

189
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:52,205
My idea of youth doesn't involve roller skating.

190
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,640
No way.

191
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,890
You don't do this in P.E.?

192
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,350
No.

193
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,125
Is this a generational gap?

194
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,050
Seriously?

195
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,620
What a horrible way to start off.

196
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:11,400
<i>Mr. Haiba...</i>

197
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,180
<i>You must have a lot of regrets from your youth.</i>

198
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,950
Um...

199
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,940
Can we start from somewhere else on your list?

200
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,490
Sure.

201
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,300
<i>He wasn't just focused on his youth?</i>

202
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,180
Something else...

203
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:48,220
A date at the horse races.
High School Girl can't get in yet.

204
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:53,000
Pretending to be young is fine.

205
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,175
What? Does it sound fun?

206
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:57,545
It's the only decent thing on your list.

207
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,540
<i>I don't know why he's trying
to get through his list now,</i>

208
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,900
<i>but maybe I can tag along
without reading into it sometimes.</i>

209
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,580
If you want to pretend,

210
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,220
how about wearing a school uniform?

211
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,460
A uniform, huh?

212
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,980
There should be a spare in the Healthcare Room.

213
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,180
You can skate?

214
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,990
How's this?

215
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,460
I can surprisingly bear it.

216
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,900
You thought you wouldn't be able to bear it?

217
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm glad our uniform has a simple design.

218
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,050
I think I can look youthful with this on.

219
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,600
All right, let's go ride a bike now.

220
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,660
A bike? Why?

221
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,595
What do you mean? It's a staple.

222
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:11,005
I'll go steal...

223
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,940
I'll go borrow one,
so wait by the bike parking area.

224
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,770
You'd better borrow it.

225
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm here.

226
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,490
<i>He totally stole it.</i>

227
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,330
Are you satisfied, now that you've ridden one?

228
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,614
Huh?

229
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,980
No. We both have to ride.

230
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,345
Get on.

231
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,845
Both of us?

232
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,970
All right. Grab on tight.

233
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,130
Mr. Haiba.

234
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,460
I think you know this,

235
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,900
but this is illegal.

236
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,037
- Just for a bit.
- Mr. Haiba.

237
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,085
Fine. I won't move.

238
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:21,670
What am I doing here?

239
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,040
Sitting still like this
really does make it feel weird.

240
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,350
I'm glad you have a normal response to this.

241
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,180
I'll go return this now.

242
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,140
Don't move so suddenly.

243
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,140
It's not every day I get to see you
holding onto me like that.

244
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,300
I love youth.

245
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,250
A-Actually, I think
you need a more fulfilling youth.

246
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:09,230
I'm preparing for entrance exams, so let's study.

247
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,820
I knew it.

248
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:38,710
Jeez. We're in the middle of my bucket list,
but I'm not doing anything!

249
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,140
I recommend this kind of youth.

250
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:44,080
If we're doing this,

251
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,000
why don't you stop studying
and make your own list?

252
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,845
Oh, I already decided on several things.

253
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:53,915
Oh.

254
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,970
[Before I die, I'd like to attend
the horror movie festival.]

255
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,940
Seems a bit lethal.

256
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,356
You must have other ideas.

257
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,686
Other ideas?

258
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:15,234
Think. Something we can do right now.

259
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,460
<i>Mr. Haiba probably wants me
to write something flirty.</i>

260
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,980
<i>How annoying.</i>

261
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,660
<i>What I want to do right now is study.</i>

262
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:36,500
<i>But what does Mr. Haiba want to do?</i>

263
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,650
- What do you want for your birthday?
- You'll give me something?

264
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,935
I want a date.

265
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,645
A date?

266
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,580
I can't think of anything on the spot.

267
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,100
If this is youth...

268
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,210
What a bother.

269
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,220
If he holds my right hand,

270
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,500
I can't study.

271
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,300
If you don't have enough money, go print more!

272
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,980
You're finally awake.

273
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:35,465
Huh? Where's my money bath?

274
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:38,365
Don't make any counterfeit money, okay?

275
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,340
Yeah.

276
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,140
I had such a nice dream.

277
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,430
Maybe it's because I got emotional acting young.

278
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,300
Did we finish one of the things on your list then?

279
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,220
Yeah.

280
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,700
That's great.

281
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:08,340
The rest seems too difficult for now,
so let's leave it for later.

282
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:14,740
There's no "later".
I told you, I'm dying tomorrow.

283
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,390
So...

284
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,100
let's have a date tomorrow.

285
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,260
What?

286
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,940
A real date, just the two of us.

287
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,660
<i>Is making good memories before death
a good enough reason?</i>

288
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:47,580
Where did you want to take me?

289
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,135
My special place.

290
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:52,205
Thank you for being born.

291
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,640
You saved my life too.

292
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,860
You're the only one I love.
