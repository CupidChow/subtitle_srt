The rumor.

people get really excited about who's dating who, right?

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,050
Really?

43

- No.
- Don't pause like you're on a game show.

But I guess it wasn't enough to kill you.

Why is Kazuma in the rumor?

64
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:18,090
I was shocked too.

65
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,290
But I went with him to the summer festival, the light show,

66
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,710
and even the flower garden the other day.

67
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,340
Thinking back, it makes sense that people suspect us.

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,660
Wait. You never told me that.

69
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,330
You seemed busy predicting the annual Oka Sho horse race.

70
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,120
That's why you didn't respond? I wanted your favorite number.

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,220
If you're going to gamble, at least take it seriously.

72
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,187
And are you okay with it?

73
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:51,937
If that rumor spreads about you and him, won't it get messy?

74
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,900
It's only reached some seniors.

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,910
Kazuma's bodyguards are going around to each grade and putting out the fires.

76
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,125
All of a sudden, he sounds so shady.

77

And...

78
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,330
Luckily, I have a weak existence.

79
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,180
Like that moss over there.

80
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,360
It won't spread much.

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,460
Well, moss is nice too.

82
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,020
Like the color...

83
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,500
If people find out we've done it, it'll spread like wildfire.

84
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,740
It's okay. You're more than just moss.

85
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,450
We haven't done it.

86
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,030
Yes, that's how it seems.

87
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,920
Stop trying to gaslight me.

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,404
Well, you know.

89
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:42,074
If no one has found out about us, no need to worry.

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
What?

91
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,920
"I don't need to worry about it"?

92
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,060
What did Kazuma say?

93
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:57,200
I don't know if Kazuma knows yet.

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,260
According to his guards, we can put these rumors out with just a bit of wit.

95
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,730
we can put these rumors out with just a bit of wit.

96
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:09,215
Is it just me, or is that "wit" another way of saying money and violence?

97
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:12,280
Ignorance is bliss.

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,240
Well, you're against it, right?

99
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,250
It's a good cover for our relationship.

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,950
Let's just let it happen.

101
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,965
A wonder lasts only nine days, but student rumors last a week.

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,730
Then...

103
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,880
Mine would only last three days.

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,285
Yes, my moss child.

105
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,305
I understand.

106
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:47,260
<i>I'm glad he doesn't seem bothered, but it's like...</i>

107
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,500
<i>It's like he's...</i>

108
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,420
<i>A bit sad?</i>

109
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,534
<i>Ochiai, I heard that it's not Kazuma.</i>

110
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:09,579
<i>Yes, that's right. We're just friends.</i>

111
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,070
<i>Then who's that necklace from?</i>

112
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,140
<i>- That's...
- Then it must be...</i>

113
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,690
Sensei...

114
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,100
Are you...

115
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,680
interested in lovers' suicide?

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,090
No.

117
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh. I'm shocked.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,560
I am sometimes, but not right now.

119
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,720
Hey, stop hiding.

120
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,717
Are you so shy that you'd hide during a chat?

121
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:51,547
If anyone sees us together, it could spell trouble.

122
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:55,725
Trouble? What about the Kazuma rumor?

123
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,225
Well...

124
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:02,605
<i>Then who's that necklace from?</i>

125
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:07,200
<i>- That's...
- Then it must be Haijin, perhaps?</i>

126
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,840
<i>Ochiai, do you like Haijin?</i>

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,220
So then, they kept asking if I liked you.

128
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,160
It's so obvious, though.

129
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,940
- Wait, being obvious is bad.
- It is.

130
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,360
Who asked? Why?

131
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,620
They were the students who talked to us on the rooftop.

132
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:34,300
And how did you reply?

133
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,400
What did you say?

134
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:45,370
More importantly, this won't be a problem, right?

135
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,060
We haven't been found out, right?

136
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,180
If people find out...

137
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:00,100
The lovers' suicide is our only option.

138
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,970
You're so extreme.

139
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,860
Not in the slightest. It's an old tradition.

140
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,863
The Love Suicides at Sonezaki. Romeo and Juliet.

141
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:13,460
Well, Romeo and Juliet was a copycat.

142
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,330
What else did they ask?

143
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,720
No, that was it.

144
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,450
They're just teasing me again.

145
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:29,195
If they didn't say anything definitive, they have no proof, so we haven't been found out.

146
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:34,440
If they find out and the news spreads at school, I'll be unemployed tomorrow.

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,515
That wouldn't be your only concern.

148
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:41,645
Hey, would you still marry me?

149
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,230
- No, you're unemployed.
- Don't sound so serious.

150
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,140
This isn't the time to propose to me.

151
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,335
In any case, we haven't been found out.

152
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:10,775
After all, I had them totally fooled on the rooftop too.

153
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,865
Really?

154
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,665
<i>A trigger.</i>

155
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,040
That's true.

156
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:33,010
<i>We set a trigger off, Mr. Haiba.</i>

157
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,520
Huh? It's Haijin.

158
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,790
Hey, I bet you have a girlfriend. Is it Ochiai?

159
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,840
<i>Undo it at Mach speed.</i>

160
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,060
How would one do lovers' suicide?

161
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,145
What? A Lovers' suicide?

162
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,245
Lovers' suicide used to be popular long ago.

163
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,890
Guess I have to go with the big trends.

164
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,355
You keep mumbling. Are you listening?

165
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,825
Phew.

166
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,140
What's this? Why are you asking that?

167
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,350
You were flirting on the rooftop.

168
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,140
Also, you and Kazuma are the only guys who hang out with her.

169
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,410
You taught her last year.

170
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,915
And I don't think she'd find guys outside.

171
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:13,325
So it must be you.

172
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:15,910
You girls.

173
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,640
You can talk about me all you want, but consider Ochiai's feelings.

174
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,760
I... I know.

175
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,410
I only told my friends.

176
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,760
- It's weird when someone like you says something mature.
- <i>Right?</i>

177
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,190
But also, I'd be shocked if you had a girlfriend.

178
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,420
Your looks are all you've got.

179
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,690
His looks aren't my type.

180
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,725
- Looks?
- Imagine him as your boyfriend.

181
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:43,260
Do you think we offended Ochiai?

182
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,400
We should apologize.

183
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
I...

184
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,880
I have a girlfriend.

185
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,440
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>
- What? No way!

186
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,450
For real?

187
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,210
I said it by accident.

188
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,910
<i>- That wasn't an accident.</i>
- Who?

189
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,225
You don't know her. Keep it down.

190
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,285
What's she like?

191
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,780
Well...

192
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:10,720
She's pretty. And smart.

193
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,980
She gets angry at me a lot, but she's the kindest.

194
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,660
My reason for living.

195
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,560
- What's that last one?
- Nothing.

196
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,279
Got a photo? I'm curious.

197
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,370
- No.
- You don't?

198
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,870
So cute.

199
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,790
Is it because it's actually Ochiai?

200
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,010
You're so nosy.

201
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,520
- It's not...
- Or...

202
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,540
She's not real.

203
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:45,470
Of course, I have a photo.

204
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,770
<i>- Save me, God.</i>
- I knew it. Show it already.

205
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,660
<i>He's a pitiful man who feels like he has to save face.</i>

206
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,020
<i>What is he going to do?</i>

207
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,500
Oh, she's pretty.

208
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,260
- You look good together.
- Yes, you do.

209
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,100
Satisfied? Go home already. Go on.

210
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,570
Okay.

211
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,130
Take good care of her, Haijin.

212
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,765
- You won't find another.
- Leave me alone.

213
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,680
Go home.

214
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,710
<i>[Physics Classroom]</i>

215
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,420
Is it from the birthday party?

216
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,040
Oh, you saw it?

217
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm glad I had a photo on hand.

218
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,521
Both of us...

219
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,180
ended up with different people in our rumors.

220
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,870
<i>That's just one more lie in the pile.</i>

221
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,680
<i>Ochiai, do you like Haijin?</i>

222
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:50,140
<i>We desperately...</i>

223
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,780
<i>No.</i>

224
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,140
<i>cover up our relationship with lies.</i>

225
00:13:55,835 --> 00:14:01,000
<i>Because we fell in love with someone taboo.</i>

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,355
<i>All we can do is endure it.</i>

227
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,035
If it's too much,

228
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,940
there's the lovers' suicide.

229
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,110
Right?

230
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,120
Yes.

231
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,660
<i>When...</i>

232
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,960
<i>I can't bear this distance any longer...</i>

233
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,690
I can't bear it.

234
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,280
I can't bear it, High School Girl.

235
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,160
Let's go to the other side.

236
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,315
Your will is like jelly.

237
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,405
Ugh...

238
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,550
<i>I sincerely hope that day never comes.</i>

239
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,570
Lightning.

240
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,570
About 100 million volts on average.

241
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:28,150
The electricity in the clouds occur
between positive and negative currents.

242
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:35,810
A 70% fatality rate in Japan.

243
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,540
Oh man, I'm so wet.

244
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,640
I thought the lightning would kill me.

245
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Welcome home.

246
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:57,690
I'm sorry, I got the wrong house.

247
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,330
Why are you looking at me like I'm a ghost?

248
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,571
- I'm not a monster.
- I didn't say anything.

249
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:08,331
You called me here since Monroe's afraid of lightning.

250
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,740
Right.

251
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,940
<i>Students at school almost found out about us,</i>

252
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,900
<i>so we need to be more careful.</i>

253
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,430
<i>I thought that's how Mr. Haiba felt.</i>

254
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,750
Besides, if I don't use Monroe as an excuse,

255
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,700
you'll run like a cat that's about to die.

256
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,680
<i>It seems like he's his usual self.</i>

257
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,100
Well, a lot has happened,

258
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,470
but we're finally alone.

259
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,980
Huh?

260
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,200
Leaving already?

261
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,470
You may have forgotten, but I have college exams to study for.

262
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,253
I can't get distracted by love.

263
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,938
- Bye.
- Hold on.

264
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,940
What?

265
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,850
- Don't go.
- That's all you've got?

266
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh, got it. I'll tutor you.

267
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,165
I'm a teacher, remember?

268
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,445
Oh, I had no idea.

269
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,550
Um...

270
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:09,672
Hm?

271
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,500
To be honest...

272
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,500
you're in the way.

273
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,975
You're acting shy, but that was pretty direct.

274
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,280
I can concentrate better on my own.

275
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,485
Ask me something. Anything you don't get.

276
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:32,080
Okay, how do you study effectively?

277
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,745
Cheat.

278
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,705
<i>He really is no help.</i>

279
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,440
Oh, how about...

280
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,980
if I get something wrong, you slap me and make me remember?

281
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,340
That's torture.

282
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,800
Please hit me if I mess up.

283
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,240
What?

284
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,650
I could never hit you, even if the world flipped upside down.

285
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:58,780
Really?

286
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,515
Then I'll hit you.

287
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,265
Why?

288
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,340
Does someone have to get hit?

289
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,660
Oh, I got it wrong.

290
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,560
Well? Did it help?

291
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,985
Sort of.

292
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:34,405
I went through that pain only for it to "sort of" help?

293
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,460
Is this pain even necessary?

294
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,700
Just a touch is good enough.

295
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,706
So whenever you got one wrong,

296
00:19:49,706 --> 00:19:53,086
how about I get closer to you?

297
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,925
That won't work.

298
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:58,665
I'm still going to do it.

299
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,710
Study with me.

300
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,550
You study with Kazuma, right?

301
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,540
I hold myself back at school

302
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,420
so I want a reward.

303
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:17,120
But that's only because you...

304
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,670
Oh.

305
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,720
You spelled this wrong.

306
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,035
Huh?

307
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:24,545
Oh.

308
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,040
Whatever the reason...

309
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,565
Even if you're just studying, it still makes me jealous.

310
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,540
Hurry. Solve the next problem.

311
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,668
This is wrong.

312
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,508
It should be an "e," not an "o."

313
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:00,370
That was one question. You're way too close.

314
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,950
This is wrong too. You missed a preposition.

315
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,565
I was going to write it.

316
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,325
This should be the subjunctive.

317
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,250
Did you mess up on purpose?

318
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,480
You're distracting me.

319
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:21,870
Also, Sensei, you're enjoying this too much.

320
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,700
I'm trying to seriously study.

321
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:32,090
But hey, your grades right now are fine.

322
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,740
Why are you so desperate?

323
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,460
I don't want to be embarrassed.

324
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,420
I think.

325
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,230
A teacher.

326
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,530
I want to fit in with...

327
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,600
that kind of crowd.

328
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,040
I want to walk alongside them at the same speed.

329
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,760
And to talk at the same level.

330
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,030
I want to...

331
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,420
push myself.

332
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,340
You'll have to work hard, huh?

333
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,820
Yes.

334
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,855
So don't get in the way.

335
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:50,605
