1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:08,020
<i>It's a lot easier than I expected
for people to die.</i>

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,285
It's okay. We're almost there. Stay strong.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,725
Oh, I found one. Over there.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,300
I can't.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,100
<i>Or rather, their image.</i>

6
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,980
[Episode 6 - The Red Spider Lily]

7
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,690
<i>And I was so excited too.</i>

8
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,500
Let's have a date tomorrow.

9
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,135
A date?

10
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:38,160
Um, if we're together, we can't let anyone see us.

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,840
That's true.

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,565
Then... what are you planning?

13
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,860
You'll see when we get there.

14
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,540
Are you okay?

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,860
Yesterday... I drank too much.

16
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,180
A hangover?

17
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,010
And... the train ride...

18
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,365
was too long.

19
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:28,925
Is that so?

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,580
<i>Then... it would've been fine
to go somewhere closer.</i>

21
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:43,420
<i>And he knows we should go on a date
where there are people.</i>

22
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,470
<i>But he still pushed for it.</i>

23
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,460
<i>High School Girl.</i>

24
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,235
<i>I'm thinking of dying tomorrow.</i>

25
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:55,245
<i>I wonder why he said that.</i>

26
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,420
I feel a lot better.

27
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,100
I'm glad to hear that.

28
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,690
<i>I get this feeling that someone's been watching us</i>

29
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,185
<i>even after our long trip.</i>

30
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:14,205
<i>Could it be someone from school?</i>

31
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Hey.

32
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:29,190
Isn't that guy so hot?

33
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,895
Yeah, he's so cool.

34
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,745
<i>Oh, so that's why people are watching.</i>

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,740
<i>Could it be...</i>

36
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:47,020
<i>that Mr. Haiba is actually popular
if he keeps his mouth shut?</i>

37
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,120
What?

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh, nothing.

39
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,020
There's a place I want to take you today.

40
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,280
What? A place you want to take me?

41
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,815
Yeah.

42
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:14,885
I bet you're thinking,
"Why did he bring us so far out?"

43
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:21,500
I mean, if you're doing all this,
it'll just cause you inconvenience.

44
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:26,650
Don't be silly.

45
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,465
Coming out all this way
is exactly why we can have a date.

46
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:32,575
D...

47
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,940
Where did you want to take me?

48
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,300
My special place.

49
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,120
<i>Is this his special place?</i>

50
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,780
<i>Is this his special place?</i>

51
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,220
<i>Where is his special place?</i>

52
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:25,245
- The forest.
- We're here.

53
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:31,280
Even if girls like you, they'd hate you
in a second. What a relief.

54
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Hate me? Why?

55
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,470
Our date spot is one hint.

56
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,665
I'm the only one who could endure this date.

57
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:41,025
Well, you're the only one I'd date.

58
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,220
And today's not just any date.

59
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Huh?

60
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,460
It's a pilgrimage for my suicide note.

61
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,540
What?

62
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,420
This is where I failed, long ago.

63
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,740
Failed?

64
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:13,880
The most important thing
for making sure it goes well

65
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,900
is to avoid being seen.

66
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,580
I see.

67
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,440
But I failed.

68
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,010
Did someone see you?

69
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,070
Yeah.

70
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:30,552
I was supposed to die that day.

71
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,900
So, I wanted to thank you.

72
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,660
Why me?

73
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:48,200
High School Girl, does this place scare you?

74
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,140
I'm not scared.

75
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,610
It actually...

76
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,300
feels familiar.

77
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,720
I figured.

78
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,180
You weren't scared back then either.

79
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,330
Huh?

80
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,420
This is where you got lost.

81
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,420
What?

82
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,540
<i>I got lost here when I was little.</i>

83
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,060
This is the forest I got lost in?

84
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,900
Hold on a second. How did you know that?

85
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,655
I told you.

86
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:57,685
I failed, a long time ago.

87
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,900
<i>I was looking for a place to die that day,
just like every other day.</i>

88
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,970
<i>It was dark, quiet, and eerie.</i>

89
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,500
<i>I knew no one would be around.</i>

90
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,820
<i>I can succeed if I do it here.</i>

91
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,980
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

92
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,190
Whoa!

93
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:45,160
<i>A kid?</i>

94
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,290
<i>Why?</i>

95
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,111
<i>No, wait.</i>

96
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:53,570
<i>There's no way a kid would be here.
It must be a ghost.</i>

97
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,740
That's just as bad.

98
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,485
Wh...

99
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:59,765
<i>She talked.</i>

100
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,380
Who are you, Mister?

101
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,460
W-W-Who am I?

102
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:16,280
<i>I entered these woods to avoid being seen.</i>

103
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,940
<i>Yet a small little girl found me.</i>

104
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,910
<i>That girl's name was...</i>

105
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,910
Mi...

106
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:30,860
Mi... Mikoto.

107
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,965
Mi-mi-mikoto.

108
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,645
You just had to make a joke, huh?

109
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,610
What are you doing here?

110
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,950
<i>She looks quite put together.</i>

111
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,552
I'm not dangerous.

112
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,610
Where's home? Is it close?

113
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,395
Flirt... ing?

114
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,405
Who taught you that word?

115
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,700
Are you lost?

116
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:10,170
L... Lost?

117
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,060
You don't know "lost"?

118
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,140
Are you alone?

119
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,110
<i>What?</i>

120
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,390
<i>What am I supposed to do here?</i>

121
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,480
It's better...

122
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,260
if I don't exist.

123
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,300
What?

124
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,900
Hey.

125
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,824
I'm actually a scaredy-cat,
so I don't know what to do.

126
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,780
Could you join me?

127
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,740
I...

128
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,740
am so lonely, all by myself.

129
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,730
Huh?

130
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,820
S-S-Sure.

131
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,630
<i>So warm.</i>

132
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,820
Thank you.

133
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,660
You saved my life too.

134
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Mr. Haiba...

135
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,900
Honestly,

136
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,620
I don't really... remember what happened.

137
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,240
I see.

138
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,950
But...

139
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,220
it sounds like you saved me back then too.

140
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,940
Thank you.

141
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:03,570
I'm sorry I don't remember.

142
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,070
But it's there.

143
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,260
Deep in your mind.

144
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,340
Huh?

145
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,140
The adult in your creepy painting was me.

146
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,810
No, that was my brother.

147
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,970
It was me.

148
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,985
You might be right,
but I was thinking of my brother.

149
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:29,485
It was me!

150
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,640
I'm the one who's stuck in your mind!

151
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,660
<i>Stop assuming what's in my mind.</i>

152
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,950
Did we come all this way
so you could thank me?

153
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,100
Well, there's that, and...

154
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,060
Today's my birthday.

155
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,910
What?

156
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,480
Just so you know.

157
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,420
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,660
Because...

159
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,840
I don't want you to think
I'm even more of an old man.

160
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,035
So, I'm dying today. I'm not going to get older.

161
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:25,525
<i>The things he worries about are insane.</i>

162
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,790
That's why...

163
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,410
you said you would die?

164
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,525
- I'm here.
- That took so long.

165
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:58,620
You left me here all alone. Where were you?

166
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,820
Outside of the forest, there was a flower shop.

167
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,300
White lycoris.

168
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,460
<i>He's so easy to understand.</i>

169
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,460
<i>The reason why he said he'd die today...</i>

170
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:31,900
<i>What if someone felt like
they didn't deserve to be born?</i>

171
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,620
<i>was because he was avoiding his own birthday.</i>

172
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,900
Mr. Haiba.

173
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,780
Happy birthday.

174
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,580
Lycoris, huh?

175
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,330
I haven't heard of it before,
but its other name is common.

176
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,780
The red spider lily.

177
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:04,980
<i>I accidentally gave him a flower
related to the afterlife.</i>

178
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,320
You look pale.

179
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,177
I'll exchange them. Please wait.

180
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,582
I'm done waiting. It'll get dark.

181
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,180
I'm surprised you got me Lycoris on my birthday.

182
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,080
It's normal to get flowers on your birthday.

183
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,595
I know. I'm not dumb.

184
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:23,645
I gave you some before.

185
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,265
<i>An air bouquet.</i>

186
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,005
Did you know that air bouquets aren't normal?

187
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,140
They weren't in season back then,
so I had no choice.

188
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,100
No choice?

189
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,860
Actually,

190
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,130
I chose these flowers for your birthday too.

191
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,020
Huh?

192
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,620
So,

193
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,260
let's just say I got these flowers for you.

194
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,300
Mr. Haiba...

195
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,420
To make up for the air bouquet.

196
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,690
Then pay up.

197
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,058
Do I have to?

198
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,603
And these flowers were my gift to you.

199
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,810
But...

200
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,530
we chose the same flowers.

201
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,260
How funny.

202
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,220
You also know what these flowers mean, right?

203
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,340
Huh? Mr. Haiba.

204
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,295
No one's here.

205
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,745
Yes, but...

206
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,220
These flowers are perfect for you.

207
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,660
<i>The meaning of white Lycoris...</i>

208
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,660
<i>"You're the only one I love."</i>

209
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,580
Mr. Haiba.

210
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,660
Yeah?

211
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,090
Thank you...

212
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,820
for being born.

213
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,250
Thank you...

214
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,220
for finding me...

215
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,860
on that day.

216
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,340
After I graduate.

217
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:50,295
Why? This is the perfect moment.

218
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,765
No.

219
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,030
Can you just quit school?

220
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,780
You're an awful teacher.

221
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:03,260
All I do is wait. It's killing me.

222
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm gonna die.

223
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,185
This always happens.

224
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,795
Maybe I should die.

225
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,720
Mr. Haiba.

226
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:21,920
As a pilgrimage date for your suicide note,
it doesn't end until we get home.

227
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,039
If you die here, the date won't end properly.

228
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,870
Let's go home.

229
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,000
<i>Since then...</i>

230
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,180
<i>the countless attempts that failed...</i>

231
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
<i>and the future...</i>

232
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,750
<i>don't spark any regret in me.</i>

233
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,460
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

234
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,550
<i>Yes.</i>

235
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,380
<i>Since that day.</i>

236
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,900
<i>That's how I've always felt.</i>

237
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,860
[Two years ago]

238
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,220
- Don't run in the halls.
- Okay!

239
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,470
Oh, no!

240
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,895
- Are you hurt?
- Hey, are you okay?

241
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,635
Did you get hurt?

242
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,980
<i>I decided to watch over her future
from here on out.</i>

243
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,780
<i>So that she won't ever lose that future.</i>

244
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,700
<i>To see with my own eyes...</i>

245
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,660
<i>what kind of adult she becomes.</i>

246
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,540
What are you doing?
