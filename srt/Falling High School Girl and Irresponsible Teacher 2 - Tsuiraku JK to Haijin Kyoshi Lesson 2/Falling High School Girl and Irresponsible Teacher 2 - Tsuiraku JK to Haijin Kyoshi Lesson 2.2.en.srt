00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:06,530
She may be my sister, but this is bad.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,250
Are you Mikoto's brother?

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,490
I'm Tsukasa Ochiai. Thank you for watching after her.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,860
Do you two know each other?

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,200
Yes, for a brief time long ago.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,620
Well, that's the essence.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm surprised we live so close.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm traveling a lot. I'm often out of town because of work.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,900
There's more to it.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,480
I...

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,340
can't bring myself to see Mikoto.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,310
Are we talking about something serious?

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,980
Please refer to volumes 10 to 14 in the manga.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,660
You don't have any better excuses?

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,130
I don't know the full story, but Mikoto is walking over right now.

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,600
What?

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,260
Hey, hurry and leave.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,960
- It's rude to walk while eating.
- Who cares?

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,550
Hey, Mikoto.

20
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,310
Shota, did you see Sensei?

21
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,380
Well...

22
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,220

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,720
Who is this?

41
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,580
He's, you know...

42
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,080
Well... My friend,

43
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,760
Paper Bag.

44
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,240
It's Shimabukuro.

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,660
I'm not surprised he's your friend.

46
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,690
What do you mean?

47
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,100
Oh, Mikoto?

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,440
Kazuma.

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,450
- Are you going home now?
- Yes. And you?

50
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,570
Me, too.

51
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,830
Oh, it's Kazuma.

52
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,180
Haijin...

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,030
What? Did you follow High School Girl here?

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,630
Of course not. We ran into each other.

55
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,790
Indeed. Kazuma's not like you.

56
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,540
Who do you think I am?

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,000
A typical stalker.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,420
Did you really say that?

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,170
I'm upset. I'm sulking now.

60
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,740
Stop talking.

61
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,900
I'm totally sulking.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,990
Kazuma? What's wrong?

63
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,780
Nothing.

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,140
Haijin, we need to talk.

65
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,560
Okay.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,430
Sorry, HSG.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,520
It looks like an important talk between men.

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,250
Bye, then.

69
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,880
Bye. See you later.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,560
Okay.

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,700
Oh, I forgot to get my tie back.

72
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,340
Four taiyaki, please.

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,240
Sure. That's quite an appetite.

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,180
I want to give some to my brother.

75
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,700
When I leave them at his doorstep, he always eats them.

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,100
<i>I think he likes them.</i>

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,720
Here you go.

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Thank you.

79
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
By the way, was it okay for Sensei to leave you like that, Mr. Shimabukuro?

80
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,330
Oh?

81
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,060
Why are we here?

82
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:29,750
What better way is there to chat than while sitting naked?

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,860
Is that how your generation does it?

84
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,010
No. I'm not that old.

85
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,260
What I meant is that we should lay it all in the open.

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,080
What happened?

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,640
I heard everything.

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,790
<i>I love you,</i>

89
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,200
<i>Sensei.</i>

90
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,220
The one Mikoto likes

91
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,700
is you, right?

92
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,700
I see. She was confessing her love, wasn't she?

93
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,970
What?

94
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,520
She was covering my ears.

95
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:20,480
What? Why?

96
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:25,707
Probably because it'd be bad if I heard, since I'm a teacher.

97
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,680
So if that bothered you,

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,340
does that mean you like her?

99
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,850
What? Yeah, right.

100
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,060
Be honest. That's why we're in a bath.

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,870
- Wh...
- Come on.

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,010
Just say it.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,760
Ugh, jeez.

104
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,260
You're right. So what?

105
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,860
I see.

106
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,880
And how do you feel about her?

107
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,490
Be honest. That's why we're in a bath.

108
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,090
What does honesty have to do with bathing? I don't get it.

109
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,180
Those were your words. Your memory sucks.

110
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,630
Come on.

111
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,280
I already told you.

112
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,220
So that means...

113
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,100
Wait, who are you?

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,190
If anyone hurts Mikoto, I'll send them to hell.

115
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,640
What?

116
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,040
What is he talking about?

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm Mikoto's brother.

118
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,270
Her older brother? The one who never shows his face?

119
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,460
He thinks his little sister is so cute, he has a huge sister complex and can't even look at her.

120
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,650
What? That's why you don't go home?

121
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,590
I do go home quite often when she's at school or sleeping.

122
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,170
Her sleeping face is so cute.

123
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,990
Well, I get to see her face while she's awake all the time.

124
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,660
What's with you two?

125
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,940
Arguing until you get dizzy in the bath? You're such kids.

126
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,020
Seriously.

127
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,090
Haijin... Her confession...

128
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,910
Will you give her a reply?

129
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,860
As I said, her confession...

130
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,240
I didn't hear her say it.

131
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,590
Oh.

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,100
That's right.

133
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,740
But...

134
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,120
I do have it recorded.

135
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,960
Why?

136
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,430
No idea. My hand moved on its own.

137
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,960
Should I report you?

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,870
All right.

139
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,100
I guess I'll put my reply in here.

140
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,620
What?

141
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,190
Hey, this is a private matter.

142
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,610
Go home.

143
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,300
- What?
- Go home.

144
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,740
I'm sorry, High School Girl.

145
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:46,980
Team credit

146
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,420
Senpai?

147
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,980
Oh, this is for you.

148
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,700
Here. Give it a listen.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,260
<i>I'm sorry, High School Girl.</i>

150
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,930
Kazuma?

151
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,620
<i>I'm sorry, High School Girl.</i>

152
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,320
<i>I...</i>

153
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,960
<i>won't hand you over to some guy who can't make you happy.</i>

154
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,920
What?

155
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,900
What's wrong?

156
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,100
That bastard was testing me.

157
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,010
Senpai, everything he said is a lie. Don't listen to it.

158
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,240
That guy...

159
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,060
He was only honest when we were naked.

160
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,010
What?

161
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,573
Naked?

162
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,370
<i>Until the day we die,</i>

163
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,500
<i>it's a so-called special day we're likely to see maybe 80 times.</i>

164
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,510
<i>When was it that I stopped believing it was special?</i>

165
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,430
High School Girl.

166
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,620
Happy birthday.

167
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,240
Sensei...

168
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,410
- My birthday was yesterday.
- I'm not late. There's no way.

169
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,980
<i>He thinks passion will save him.</i>

170
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,790
After all, I didn't sleep.

171
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,420
My yesterday is still ongoing.

172
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,220
<i>That's absurd.</i>

173
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,620
My birthday is not a big deal.

174
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,670
I never told anyone the day. I'm impressed you even knew.

175
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,970
You're so disillusioned.

176
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,260
I don't consider it that special.

177
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,460
And if I don't tell anyone,

178
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,790
it's not a surprise if no one celebrates it.

179
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,720
I won't be so disappointed.

180
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,060
Your mind is so gloomy.

181
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,810
Don't say something so sad.

182
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,270
Do you want anything?

183
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm not sure. It's so sudden.

184
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,580
<i>[Happy Birthday Mikoto]</i>

185
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,040
I don't know.

186
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,500
I'll celebrate with you.

187
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,940
Think it over before we leave.

188
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,360
Okay.

189
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,170
<i>What do I want?</i>

190
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,900
<i> I want to be smart. I can't get that, though.</i>

191
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,470
<i>Time. Stamina. Passive income. Happiness.</i>

192
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,940
<i>All unreasonable requests.</i>

193
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,860
What do you want for your birthday next week?

194
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,220
I want a date.

195
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,790
- A date? Oh, no.
- What's the big deal?

196
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,240
<i>Truly unreasonable.</i>

197
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,700
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have been born.</i>

198
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,470
<i>As someone who thinks that way, I don't deserve to be celebrated.</i>

199
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,400
<i>[The Birthday Dictionary]</i>

200
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,110
<i>I'll go home before Sensei finds me.</i>

201
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,900
I caught you.

202
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,460
Did you decide?

203
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,220
I think...

204
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,160
as someone who doesn't think she deserved to be born,

205
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,960
it doesn't feel like a special day.

206
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,520
Sensei.

207
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,200
Hey.

208
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,030
Do you consider Takamine's birthday not that special either?

209
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,260
No, not at all.

210
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:40,980
What if someone felt like they didn't deserve to be born?

211
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,060
It's still an important day.

212
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,840
Okay, then. Happy birthday again.

213
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,500
I don't have a present so...

214
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,560
An air bouquet.

215
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,760
Thank you.

216
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,760
A quiet celebration like this is nice.

217
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,080
Oh, it might not be that quiet.

218
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,680
What is this?

219
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,380
What?

220
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,990
You brought her already?

221
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,440
I told you to keep her busy.

222
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,170
I tried.

223
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,500
You're useless.

224
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,210
Come on, it's fine. Right?

225
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,530
Oh, you're...

226
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,130
Shota's wife.

227
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,910
Shota and Jin have told me a lot about you.

228
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,810
I rented my friend's restaurant.

229
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,170
You shouldn't have.

230
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,613
Don't say that.

231
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:48,208
It's a special day. Let's party it up!

232
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,240
Um, Mikoto.

233
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,525
I'm sorry for being late a day and for not being done prepping yet.

234
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:59,445
We didn't have time yesterday.

235
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,700
Oh...

236
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,250
<i>Could it be</i>

237
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,710
<i>that Sensei was late a day to match everyone's schedules?</i>

238
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,610
It's not well-planned, but...

239
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,670
- All right.
- Put it on.

240
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,240
It's fine.

241
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,370
Happy birthday, Senpai!

242
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,080
Happy birthday!

243
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,790
Wait, Senpai.

244
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,280
Do you not like stuff like this?

245
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,680
<i>Is this really okay?</i>

246
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,730
<i>[Happy Birthday Mikoto]</i>

247
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,030
<i>Happy birthday, Mikoto.</i>

248
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,085
<i>- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.</i>

249
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,780
<i>Hello?</i>

250
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,260
<i>What? Tsukasa?</i>

251
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,935
<i>Okay, we're on our way.</i>

252
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,465
<i>The hospital?</i>

253
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,620
<i>I'm sorry, Mikoto.</i>

254
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,070
<i>[Happy Birthday Mikoto]</i>

255
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,060
<i>Is it really okay to celebrate?</i>

256
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,000
Thank you.

257
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,475
I'm so glad.

258
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:56,325
Let's start the party!

259
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,520
Got alcohol, Shota?

260
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Of course!

261
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,810

<i>[Happy Birthday]</i>

264
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,540
There's so much cake.

265
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,680
Well, there's a whole cake for each person.

266
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,980
Why did no one notice?

267
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,740
Who brought all these cakes?

268
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,880
Mai baked them all.

269
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,760
We can't have leftovers then.

270
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,560
I can see the nicotine fairy.

271
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,250
What's wrong with leftovers?

272
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,260
We can eat them tomorrow.

273
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,590
Senpai is the type to feel bad if there are too many leftovers.

274
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,925
True. I bet she'd offer to take it all home.

275
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,410
Hey, what is this?

276
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,690
Oh, right!

277
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,190
Before you two showed up, Shimabukuro brought two whole cakes.

278
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,200
That stupid paper bag.

279
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,630
She can't eat anymore.

280
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,165
No, I'll eat it.

281
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:30,595
There are starving people out there.

282
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,120
She's not kidding.

283
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,040
Your turn, Haijin.

284
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:57,700
Look! A UFO!

285
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,500
Huh? Where?

286
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:04,540
Wow, what a kid.

287
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,690
Shut up.

288
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,645
Playing this kids' game with you means I'm plenty mature.

289
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,385
What?

290
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,280
Whoa!

291
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,040
What is this?

292
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,980
I'm happy.

293
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,080
This cake is for me.

294
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm... happy.

295
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,990
Are you a demon?

296
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,840
Stop eating. That's not good for you.

297
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,240
Give it back!

298
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,610
Hey!

299
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,830
You're seriously trying to take it back?

300
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,640
Everyone prepared these cakes just for me.

301
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,150
I know that everyone's feelings are important to you, but I can eat this one on my own.

302
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,440
<i>It's okay.</i>

303
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,960
<i>Ever since I became an adult, I've been eating whole cakes on my own.</i>

304
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,280
<i>I spent Christmas alone too.</i>

305
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,510
<i>A whole cake.</i>

306
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,040
<i>Merry Christmas to me.</i>

307
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,340
<i>You don't look okay to me.</i>

308
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,380
Since you insist, I'll give you half.

309
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,390
Half, huh?

310
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,880
Well...

311
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,600
If you want it that bad, I guess you can have some.

312
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,720
Here.

313
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,660
What?

314
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,900
No, um...

315
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,210
Here.

316
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,570
Can't you just hand it over?
