2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,720
(Mom and dad,)

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,880
(Sorry, I can't accept the marriage)
(Mom and dad,)

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,919
(you arranged for me.)
(I'm sorry.)

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,900
(I might have disappointed you.)

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,300
Did Qianxun

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,566
run away from her marriage?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,666
There's two hours left before the wedding.

9
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,120
If we broke off the engagement now,

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,366
we would be a total disgrace!

11
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,066
Our company is facing
the difficulty of capital turnover.

12
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,066
Without the support of Gu's,

13
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,066
we would be in great debt.

14
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,800
I would be going to jail!

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,166
Qiange, you and your sister are twins.

16
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:44,866
You two look identical.

17
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,119
Maybe you can take your sister's place

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,233
and marry Gu Chengze.

19
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:48,766
Are you crazy?

20
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:49,133
I won't do that.

21
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,566
(Is this what I have to face
after returning from abroad?)

22
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,000
(I might as well stay abroad.)

23
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,833
We haven't asked you
for anything until now.

24
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,566
We always let you live your own life.

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,433
It's time for you
to do something for our family!

26
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,240
The Gu's are not dumb.

27
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,079
You think they couldn't tell

28
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,400
if the bride was replaced?

29
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,600
You stayed abroad for the past two years,

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,920
and haven't met with Gu's.

31
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,033
You've been smart since childhood.

32
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,366
I'm sure you're capable
of handling this for a while.

33
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,200
I won't do that.

34
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you going to sit by
and watch me go to jail?

35
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:21,866
If the Xia's daughter
didn't show up for the wedding today,

36
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:22,833
then tomorrow,

37
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,600
I would show up in the hospital!

38
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,866
Make your choice!

39
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,300
My dear,

40
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,266
how could you just leave me like this?

41
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,133
Take me along with you!

42
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,966
Since your father
owed a great debt to our boss,

43
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,400
this house is now taken as repayment.

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,366
Move out of this house in one day!

45
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,766
Pay back! Pay back!

46
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,933
They think that I'm disappointing.

47
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,066
What if I brought shame on them
after marriage?

48
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:51,600
In my opinion,

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,300
you should marry to him
to deal with the mess ahead.

50
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:58,066
When your sister is found,
your job will be done.

51
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,000
What if she couldn't be found?

52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,760
Then let it play out.

53
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,566
As far as I know,

54
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:07,900
Gu Chengze is rich,
handsome and faithful.

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,066
There's a possibility

56
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,700
that you fall in love with him finally.

57
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,233
Are you serious?

58
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,766
I've already done research on him.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,133
He's definitely
the well-qualified guy to marry.

60
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,566
Don't worry.

61
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,240
Should I say thank you?

62
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,333
(However,)

63
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,366
(it does make sense.)

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,466
(No, no way.)

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,133
(He should be my elder sister's husband.)

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,360
(I can't do this to him.)

67
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,500
(Is he Gu Chengze? Jesus.)

68
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,200
(Did I have sex
with my elder sister's husband?)

69
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,166
(What should I do?)

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,300
(I accidentally had sex
with Gu Chengze yesterday,)

71
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,900
(Now I'm married to him.)

72
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,199
(How could this happen?)

73
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,866
What's going on?

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,133
I... I think I'm having my period.

75
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,266
I'm going to use the bathroom.

76
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,200
Xia Qiange.

77
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:00,866
Stay calm, please.

78
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,333
You've met so many cute guys.

79
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,260
It's no big deal for you.

80
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,666
He's your sister's husband.

81
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,900
You can't do something out of line.

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,346
(How to properly suggest)

83
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,340
(sleeping in separate rooms
on wedding night?)

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,966
(Tell your partner
that you have neuroinsomnia,)

85
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:17,900
(and you will grind teeth
and snore when you're sleeping.)

86
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,733
(And you can't fall asleep
with others in bed.)

87
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:21,766
(No way.)

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,039
(But I just slept with him yesterday.)

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,733
(Find ways to start an argument,)

90
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,366
(criticize your partner for nonsense.)

91
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,700
(This might work.)

92
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,466
Qianxun, I'm going outside.

93
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,626
Okay.

94
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,530
Finally.

95
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,013
It's killing me.

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
It's not suggested to have sex
during period.

97
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,933
You naughty girl.

98
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,966
Are you always thinking
about sexual stuff?
