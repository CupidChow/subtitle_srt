00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,700
Qianxun.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,760
It's been a while since we married.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,130
Maybe we should...

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,030
No.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,930
Not yet?

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,000
What's the reason this time?

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,860
I...

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,140
I have

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,260
phobia or disorder in that aspect.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,830
That's fine.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,700
I'll help you cure it.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,500
(No, no. I can't do this.)

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,860
I'll take a bath.

15
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,660
It takes a while. You sleep first.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,700
Think I can't deal with you?

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,360
Sleep tight, babe.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,030
You're still waiting. Drink some water.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm not thirsty.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
You can drink as you like.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,200
Then we can get to the real business.

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,000
Drink a little.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,330
Don't waste my effort.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,460
You're not drinking?

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,730
(Three.)

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,830
(Two.)

27

(One.)

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,230
(Oh.)

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,090
(Damn it. I must have lost my virginity last night.)

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,000
You're up.

31
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,630
Last night, did you...

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,560
Don't worry.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
I won't take advantage of the weak.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
I'll wait for your permission.

35
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,300
Besides,

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,000
you grind your teeth and snore.

37
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,890
Who can put up with that?

38
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,400
Breakfast is on the table.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,430
Off to work I go.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,140
Right. That's her.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,830
Stop her!

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,060
That's the woman.

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,530
-It's the woman that bullies our Sula.
-Beat her.

44
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,600
She seduced Sula's boyfriend.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,630
Beat her.

46
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,830
Have some self-awareness.

47
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,630
Wanna be a bitch?

48
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,530
Get divorced and quit.

49
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,590
Look how ugly you are.

50
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,970
This is what a bully looks like?

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,835
You shameless bitch.

52
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,260
Get the hell out!

53
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,860
Can't you be self-aware?

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,220
-Get divorced and quit.
-You shameless mistress.

55
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,260
Go to hell!
