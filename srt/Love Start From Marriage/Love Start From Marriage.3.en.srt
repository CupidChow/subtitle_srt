Here. Drink this.

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,500
The salesclerk said this could help.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,940
(Criticize your partner for nonsense.)

(Best timing
to start an argument.)

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Do you not care for me?

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,660
I never use this brand.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,400
Looks like you don't care for me.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,119
You can go now.

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,200
Leave me alone.

(Should he be a jerk?)

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,630
These are all the brands
I can find in the store.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,530
Pick as you like.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,200
Is it not too late

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,810
that I start caring for you now?

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,800
-Miss Jin's here.
-Miss Jin, look at here.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
What's your opinion

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,530
about Mr. Gu's marriage

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,630
since you were his rumored girlfriend?

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,930
May all of Ms. Xia's wishes come true.

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,980
Do you think it was all planned

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,080
that Ms. Xia married CEO of the Gu's?

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,730
Was it the reason

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,130
why you and Mr. Gu's relationship
went south?

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,100
I didn't say that.

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,260
Stop guessing.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
Does your Weibo post

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,430
"Love does not mean commitment"

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,730
implies that you and Mr. Gu's relationship
was affected by a cheater?

31
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,230
Just some instant emotion.

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,330
No need to dig for news.

33
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,230
So does it have something to do
with Mr. Gu's marriage?

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,900
We can leave it here.

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,380
Miss Jin needs some rest.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,260
Miss Jin, Miss Jin.

Who's the victim in this marriage drama?

Dear, how have you been lately?

Do you feel like winning from a lottery?

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,300
Compare Gu Chengze to Lizhuo.

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,760
Could it be any better?

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
Forget about Li Zhuo.

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,479
That guy is only the past.

48
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,130
But... Gu Chengze is good indeed.

49

(There's something different
with Qianxun.)

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,300
(What happened?)

55
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,160
Qiange. I heard you returned back, too.

56
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,930
We haven't got the chance to hang out.

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
Can't believe we met here.

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,460
What a coincidence.

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,030
Qiange. All I have to say

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,830
is that me and Li Zhuo met first.

61
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,430
I didn't break you guys up.

62
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,630
Actually, Li Zhuo loves me
from the begining.

63
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,960
Stop shaming yourself.

64

Madam,

this is the wife of CEO of Gu's,

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,630
Xia Qianxun,
the elder sister of Xia Qiange.

67
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,260
Figure out your audience
before starting acting.

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,900
You need to work on that harder.

69
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,840
Hi, dad. Where's Qianxun?

70
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,060
She's not around.

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,860
She hasn't been home recently.

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,460
What's going on?

73
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,830
Is this Qiange's bestie

74
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,600
who's obsessed with trash guys?

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,160
Makes sense.

76
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,030
Looks like a total bitch.
