2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,666
Hey. What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:10,600
Where have you been?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,233
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,633
Why didn't you answer my phone?

6
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,866
(Did he call my sister?)

7
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:18,813
There's no signal.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,880
Bee-boo, bee-boo. You got a text.

9
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:27,100
We were in the underground parking lot.

10
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,233
There was no signal there.

11
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:40,866
I think I ate something bad.

12
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,533
I'm having a stomachache.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,600
Let's go home.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,293
(Isn't it the pattern that I customized?)

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,566
This is for you.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,933
(Xia Qiange,)

17
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,233
(it's you.)

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,233
(Now your secret is in my hand.)

19
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,066
What are you laughing at?

20
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,600
I'm afraid you can't control yourself.

21
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,066
For the sake of both of us,

22
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,200
it's better we sleep in separate rooms.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,800
Chill.

24
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,900
I thought you're having a bad health.

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,700
Get some rest.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,133
Do not cross this line.

27
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,900
Hey. Do you hear the noise?

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,100
No.

29
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,400
Pay attention.

30
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,200
Something is crawling.

31
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,400
I think... so.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,900
Could it be a cockroach?

33
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:09,966
Perhaps.

34
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,066
Wait. It's Xiaobai.

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,533
Xiaobai?

36
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,433
I kept some reptiles as pets.
Xiaobai is one of them.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,733
But Xiaobai went missing a few days ago,

38
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,466
and hasn't been found.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,466
Is it still in the house?

40
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,166
There, there.

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,133
I'm not seeing any.

42
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,880
There, look at there.

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,706
Stay still.

44
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,300
I thought you can't cross the line.

45
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,400
The rule is for you. Not for me.

46
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,453
(I found Xiaobai.
Come and have it handled tomorrow.)

47
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,133
Superstar Jin Sula posted late night,

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,600
allegedly exposing
that Xia Qianxun, the bride,

49
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,500
affected their relationship
and took her place.

50
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,700
(Latest News)
Who's the victim...

51
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:13,866
Mr. Gu.

52
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,466
Did you see today's news?

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,666
I did.

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,866
What's with the gossip?

55
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,533
How come I didn't know any of it?

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,653
Before,

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,973
Jin Sula hyped
about your relationship with her.

58
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:25,439
Many people took it seriously.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,966
It's my fault that let it go virus.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,333
I'll have it settled soon enough.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,900
Hold on.

62
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:41,833
What's with the gossip?

63
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,900
It's just fabrication
by some nameless media.

64
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,166
Is it just fabrication,

65
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,633
or someone's stealthy acts?

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
We'll find out.

67
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,700
Mr. Gu, are you implying that

68
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,900
someone's maneuvering this behind?

69
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:57,566
What do you think?

70
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,100
Jin Sula.

71
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,500
Do you know how much we've invested
for your popularity?

72
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:06,666
If you don't want to get fired,

73
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,100
keep your mind focused on work.

74
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,566
(Gu Chengze, you'll soon belong to me.)
