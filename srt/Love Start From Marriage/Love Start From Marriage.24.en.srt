00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,830
Mr. Gu.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,106
Were you aware of the fact
that the twins were switching identities?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,733
I decided to divorce you.

5
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:14,000
Could you make clear of what you said?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,166
Mr. Gu.

7
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,666
After you divorce Miss Xia Qiange,

8
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,566
will you consider
making up with Miss Jin Sula?

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,033
-Clear the way.
-Will Xia Qiange

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,940
-Mr.Gu.
-be held accountable.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,660
be held accountable.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,700
Xia Qiange.

13
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:28,133
I never thought that

14
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:30,066
the one I've been looking for is you.

15
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:31,366
It was my fault

16
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,500
that I haven't found you until now.

17
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,866
Therefore,

18
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,700
will you marry to me

19
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,433
in the identity of Xia Qiange?

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,866
Bitch!

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,533
Why don't you go to hell?

22
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:01,933
Why don't you go to hell!

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,933
Why don't you go to hell?

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Miss Jin,

25
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,680
we are investigating an abduction
that you're involved with.

26
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,626
Could you come with us?

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,500
How did you know

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
it was Jin Sula that tried to abduct me?

29
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,933
Who else would do that besides her?

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,733
Moreover,

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,400
whoever tried to hurt you,

32
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:28,200
I'll do whatever I can
to figure them out.

33
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,166
Thank God, uncle Gu sent some guys
to ask to meet me that day.

34
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,933
That saved my life accidentally.

35
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:37,600
That's why

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,000
we are meant to be family.

37
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:51,333
Who are you guys?

38
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:54,500
Miss Jin asked us to
have a conversation with you.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,933
You asshole!

40
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:12,933
Who sent you?

41
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,700
Scamp!

42
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,760
Hey.

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,026
The job is done.

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,966
When are we signing the contract?

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,260
Send me what I need.

47
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,900
(I got nothing.)

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,600

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,653
You two bitches!

50
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,733
I heard you offered Li Zhuo
five hundred thousands.

51
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,100
What?

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,666
Trying to finish the payment
for your ex-boyfriend?

53

By any means necessary,

54
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,866
go get the money back.

55
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:21,666
Understand?

56
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,333
Got it, my dear.

57
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,433
You won't hide from me again, right?

58
