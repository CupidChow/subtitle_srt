2
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,100
You're Qiange, not Qianxun.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,466
You can't be blinded by anger
and marry Mr. Gu

4
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:14,433
because of me and Li Zhuo.

5
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:15,266
By the way,

6
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,133
I haven't met your twin sister yet.

7
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,066
She didn't attend our meeting.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,933
(Are you really not Qianxun?)

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Sure you waited for a while.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,500
Let's go.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,966
Do you remember this song?

12
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,233
What's the lyrics?

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,533
What's with the woe of meeting and departing?

14
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:38,133
You don't like the song?

15
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,266
No.

16
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,500
I can't get the vague sentiment of it.

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,533
There's something delicious there!

18
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,733
(One year ago.)

19
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,440
I kind of like this song.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,700
Very sad.

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,200
But very gentle.

22
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,266
Gu Chengze!

23
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,266
Watch out!

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Are you good?

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,333
Hurt badly?

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,566
I'm fine.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,133
What were you thinking?

28
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,633
Why didn't you dodge the car?

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,540
It hurts.

30
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,266
What happened to you?

31
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,700
Are you thinking of something?

32
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:09,366
Qianxun.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,700
What?

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,033
Nothing.

35
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,540
I got business to talk tonight.

36
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,533
Don't wait for me.

37
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,433
Mr. Gu, don't drink more.

38
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,233
I'll ride you home.

39
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:04,800
If...

40
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,500
the person that you love

41
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,299
has been lying to you,

42
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,166
what would you do?

43
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,100
Mr. Gu, you're drunk.

44
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,066
Let's leave.

45
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,133
I'm not leaving.

46
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:16,700
I'm not leaving!

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Mr. Gu.

48
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:22,733
What happened?

49
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:23,633
Mr. Gu is drunk.

50
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,466
I'm getting him to the hotel.

51
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:25,400
Let me help.

52
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,233
No, thanks.

53
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,766
That's fine. You're here.

54
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:29,933
What else could I do?
