2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,066
What's this?

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:11,433
Find out yourself.

4
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:15,560
(Boss, it's all my fault!
Pinch me, and forgive me!)

5
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,500
Qianxun, it was all my fault
to let those news trend.

6
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:20,833
It won't happen again.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,533
Public comments
are gradually under control.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,766
This will soon be past.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,820
(Qianxun becomes cuter)

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,133
(after marriage.)

11
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,533
Since you're into designing,

12
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,766
do you want
to join Gu's Design Department?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Wonderful.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,700
I haven't done any designing
since I came back.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,466
What?

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,500
I mean...

17
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,099
Since I got married.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,033
Why did my endorsement
get canceled?

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,033
Were all bad news these days

20
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,566
not enough to hit the Gu's?

21
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,000
That wasn't my fault.

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,033
It was paparazzi that fabricated news.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,566
Don't think I know nothing
about your sneaky acts.

24
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,166
You'd better do your own part.

25
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,033
What kind of person
do you assume me as?

26
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,599
How would I do anything bad for you?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Mr. Gu, why can't you just trust me?

28
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,100
I've already found out the truth.

29
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,633
Otherwise I wouldn't be here
talking to you.

30
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:30,766
Sorry.

31
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,033
It was all because I love you so much.

32
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:33,300
Therefore...

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,533
I'm not interested in you.

34
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,700
Plus, I'm married.

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,466
I promise it won't happen again.

36
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,500
Could you get my endorsement back?

37
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,700
Talk about it later. You're good to go.

38
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,399
(Gu Chengze, I'm not giving up.)

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,200
Your elder sister's gone missing.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,366
Your parents forced you back to Gu family.

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,133
This time, you can't fly the coop.

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,733
But it will get exposed sooner or later.

43
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,800
What if I go missing?

44
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,026
Your parents would freak out.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,566
I'm not seeing a way out.

46
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:10,900
First,

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,633
you have to become Xia Qianxun.

48
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,566
Then,

49
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,466
you should try
to know Gu Chengze better.

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,033
(Qianxun)

51
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,266

(Qianxun is self-disciplined in life.)

(She never eats junk food.)

56
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:32,266
Try some?

57
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,933
Have less junk food.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,733
Wait a moment. I'm not ready.

59

00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,766
What are you cooking today?
