2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,900
You and Jin Sula really...

3
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,533
None of your business.

4
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,133
I meant what I said in press conference.

5
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:21,933
Ok.

6
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,566
In return for my favor,

7
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:27,900
could we make a deal?

8
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:30,266
On the show coming in half a month,

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,233
if I help the Gu's win the first place,

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,466
could you help us Xia's company?

11
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,333
Is that okay?

12
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,466
First,

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,800
I will find out the truth
and gain back my innocence.

14
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:48,500
Besides,

15
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,833
you and your family
deceived me with the marriage.

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,833
You're lucky that I haven't sued you.

17
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,900
Now you're asking me a favor?

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,166
You're so greedy.

19
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,200
The Gu's has lost to the V Group
on the National Runway Show

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
in the past three years.

21
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,233
If the Gu's got the first place this time,

22
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,833
its market value would surely surge.

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,466
Think about it.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,233
You'd better do what you say.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,700
If you fail to win the first place for Gu's,

26
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:19,566
I will not only make the Xia's go broke,

27
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,700
everyone will know
about this marriage fraud.

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,633
I chose Gu Chengze.

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,366
And we are married.

30
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,500
I trust him unconditionally.

31
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you okay,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,100
superstar?

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,100
I heard the Gu's
is terminating your contract.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,066
Don't get cocky.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,966
You think Gu Chengze likes you?

36
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,966
At least I'm still the wife of Gu Chengze.

37
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,233
And you,

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,433
are leaving the Gu's in no time.

39
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,439
Do you think Gu Chengze
will help you against all odds

40
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,960
if everyone knows your true identity?

41
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,966
Mind your own business.

42
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,000
I knew it's you

43
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,433
who set up Gu Chengze.

44
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,600
Show your proof.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
I have work to do.

46
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,400
Off you go,

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,966
superstar.

48
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:33,933
Qiange.

49
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,866
Did I not tell you

50
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,166
not to talk to me?

51
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,733
Help me once again.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,266
Please ask Mr. Gu to sign this contract.

53
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,733
With the fund of the Gu's,

54
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,333
I'll succeed for certain!

55
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:44,866
Get out.

56
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,066
Stop tangling me.

57
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,633
Xia Qiange,

58
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:48,766
wait and see!

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,100
(Xia Qiange, how blinded you were!)

60
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,033
(How come you loved a jerk like him?)
