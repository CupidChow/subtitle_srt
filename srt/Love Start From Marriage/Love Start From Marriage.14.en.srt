2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,966
Find out the truth as soon as possible.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,700
Look for an excuse to fire Jin Sula.

4
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:10,933
Clarify the gossips first.

5
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,400
Pull the news out of the spotlight.

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,933
Do you really remember nothing
from what happened yesterday?

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,066
Did you

8
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,733
have sex with her?

9
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:19,033
No.

10
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:20,933
The photos are out on the street.

11
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,000
How do we clarify it?

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,666
You discussed
about the script late night?

13
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,633
Or she actually is your long-lost sister?

14
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,100
If you can't deal with this thing,
there's no need for you to work for me.

15
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:31,833
By the way.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,366
What about Mrs. Gu?

17
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,633
You're off now.

18
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:37,493
Ok.

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,200
(Qianxun)

20
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,833
(What exactly is it with him and Jin Sula?)

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,333
(Why hasn't he
called and explained to me?)

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,066
Xia Qiange.

23
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:12,566
Love with lies is bound to be lost.

24
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:13,800
I'll clarify one more time.

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,333
I am Xia Qianxun, not Xia Qiange.

26
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,166
Alright, stop acting.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560
Mr. Gu has found out
you're not Xia Qianxun.

28
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,233
The night before,

29
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:25,433
he was talking about divorcing you,

30
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,566
then marrying me.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,233
Do you think if I should

32
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,599
invite you to our wedding?

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,233
(She should be seeing the news.)

34
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,266
(Why is she not saying anything?)

35
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,499
Come in.

36
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,800
How is your health?

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,966
Now that you know the truth,

38
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,200
when are you going to divorce me?

39
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,800
Ok, fine.

40
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,040
Let's put everything on the table.

41
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,766
When the crisis is gone,

42
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,466
I hope you and your family

43
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:09,366
will give me a reasonable explanation.

44
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:11,533
Besides,

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,733
play your part as Mrs. Gu.

46
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,866
I don't want
you release any news of our feud

47
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,100
to do harm to Gu's.

48
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,533
(Even if I'm not Xia Qiianxun,)

49
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,766
(this is not your excuse to cheat on me.)

50
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,000
(And you want me to ignore it?)

51
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,500
Is it necessary?

52
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:25,100
Yes.

53
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,666
Divorce?

54
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,966
Because of Jin Sula?

55
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,466
Yes and no.

56
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,766
He found out that I'm not Xia Qianxun.

57
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,599
He's been dodging me.

58
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,866
So he cheated on you?

59
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:44,300
Don't add fuel to the fire.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,566
I thought Gu Chengze was a good guy.

61
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,166
Turns out you're attractive to trash guys.

62
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,400
Only works don't lie.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,866
I'm gonna work harder.

64
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,566
You can't hide from problems.

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,333
The National Runway Show
will start in half a month.

66
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,166
I'll have to impress Gu Chengze.

67
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,533
Mr. Gu.

68
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,400
If no proof is found,

69
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:15,266
then the rumor will become the fact.

70
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:16,766
Yes.

71
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,166
It will do no good

72
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,800
but harm to our company.

73
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,800
Some business partners are starting
to cancel contracts.

74
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,800
And how will Mrs. Gu feel?

75
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,966
I don't care her feelings.

76
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,700
Gu's can afford the compensation.

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,966
Mr. Gu. Do not get caught in traps.

78
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,233
This is obviously planned by someone.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,833
To solve it,

80
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,566
the key is to find out the person behind.

81
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,100
Have you found the person
who sent photos to the media?

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,900
It's in follow-up.

83
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,866
And, have Jin Sula tracked.

84
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,300
If she's not the one behind,

85
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,100
then that's better.

86
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,200
If so...
