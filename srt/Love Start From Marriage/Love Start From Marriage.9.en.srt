(Why is he acting like this?)

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,466
Did you change my clothes last night?

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,933
Who gave you permission to do that?

10
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,600
Don't you know the necessary distance
between men and women?

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,700
What's the problem

12
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,000
with me changing my wife's clothes?

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,300
(What a big problem.)

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,466
From now on, you're not allowed...

15
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,466
From now on, go out drinking less.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,900
Or,

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,800
I will break your leg.

18
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,633
Master's work.

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,700
Mr. Gu,

20
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,766
may I buy dinner for you and Mrs. Gu tonight?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Not available.

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,166
Mrs. Gu's bestie is going, too.

23
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:44,266
She feels sorry

24
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,966
that she couldn't attend your wedding

25
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,233
because she was abroad.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Bestie?

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,966
Yes.

28
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,100
Her closest bestie.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,233
It's also a good chance for me
to say sorry to her,

30
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,333
for creating so much drama last time.

31
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:00,133
Maybe she's still upset about it.

32
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,433
Send me the address.

33
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,166
Fine.

34
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:18,533
(Seems like our first official date.)

35
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,066
(Feels kind of good.)

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,300
(Is this what's called surprise?)

37
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,366
(They're trying to mess with me together.)

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,500
Thought you called it surprise.

39
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:37,233
One is your rumored girlfriend.

40
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,466
The other is the woman
who stole Qiange's boyfriend.

41
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:40,833
What,

42
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,266
are you making me an apology event?

43
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,399
What's wrong with you?

44
00:02:59,033 --> 00:02:59,999
Mr. Gu.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,466
I had no idea they had this beef.

46
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,533
If I knew...

47
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Gu.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,666
Don't blame Miss Jin.

49
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,066
She doesn't want you deceived.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Qiange,

51
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,666
today I'm here to say sorry to you.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Could you please forgive me?

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
You can't be blinded by anger
and marry Mr. Gu

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,766
because of me and Li Zhuo.

55
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,100
He's innocent.
