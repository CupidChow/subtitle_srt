2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,233
What a coincidence.

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,633
How did you appear like that?

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,833
I couldn't reach you.

5
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,133
So came straight here looking for you.

6
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:14,633
Thank you.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,533
Qianxun, it was my fault.

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,466
I failed to protect you.

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:23,633
Qianxun.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,633
Promise you won't disappear like that again.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm worried.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,833
I won't.

13
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:36,700
Cheers.

14
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:42,866
To be honest,

15
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,033
it's been a long long time

16
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,266
since I devoured food like this.

17
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,099
You're not afraid
Gu Chengze found out?

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,466
I suppose rich people like him,

19
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:54,966
won't show up in places like this.

20
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,533
What do you think of him?

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,433
He is pretty good.

22
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:08,433
Cheers.

23
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,066
How much have you two drunk?

24
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,500
Can we stop drinking?

25
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,066
None of your business.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,100
And you.

27
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,500
Can't you behave yourself
now that you're married?

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's go to another round!

29
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:22,833
Yeah!

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Here.

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,700
You.

32
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,466
Take care of the bill.

33
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,466
Where are you going?

34
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,633
How much did you guys drink?

35
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,333
Rose.

36
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,733
Isn't it the trash guy Li?

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,100
Why did he also come back?

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Exactly.

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,933
Let me send him to hell!

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,133
You're Mrs. Gu now.

41
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,033
You can't do that.

42
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,400
Can't you behave yourself?

43
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,133
Thank you.

44
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,066
Wait for me.

take all the advantage?)

48

(Dream on.)

49
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,733
Babe. Get in the car.

50
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,333
I won't.

51
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,966
-Behave yourself.
-I want more beer.

52
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:53,566
Get in the car.

53
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,266
Get in the car.

54

Stop here, please.

55
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,099
-I'm not getting the car. -Place your legs.

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,733
Let me go.

57
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,000
What's up?

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,600
Is V Group going broke?

59
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,166
You got time to bully people, huh?

60
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,200
I won't forget what you did today.

61
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,933
What the hell am I up against?

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,333
How dare you beat me?

63
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,433
You trash.

64
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,833
What did you just say?

65
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,533
You're not trash.

66
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,366
You're handsome.

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,400
You're really hot.
