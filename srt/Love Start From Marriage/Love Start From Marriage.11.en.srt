00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,933
This is our new design director,

3
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:10,600
Xia Qianxun.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,400
Welcome.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,666
We'll be working together.

6
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,200
I would appreciate your guidance.

7
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:20,366
(How can I stay low key
with the title of boss lady?)

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,833
Sula,

9
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,766
why don't we go and talk to her?

10
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,400
With all the gossips, you can nearly flop.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,633
Who are you bitching?

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,000
Mr. Gu.

13
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,566
Why did you hire Xia Qiange?

14
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,633
She's Xia Qianxun, the wife of CEO Gu.

15
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:45,833
Notice,

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,500
knock before you come in.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:48,833
Mr. Gu...

18
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,300
Don't ever make a fuss
about Xia Qianxun's identity.

19
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,260
You're off from work for the next few days.

20
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,466
What do you mean?

21
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:57,533
Like I said,

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
put away your sneaky ideas
that shouldn't be.

23
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,466
Since you struggle to do that,

24
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm lending you a hand.

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,200
I am a hit of the Gu's.

26
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,033
Upset as you are,

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,133
there's no need to suspend me.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,433
Your popularity comes from the Gu's capital.

29
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,166
Anyone can replace you.

30
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,666
Mr. Gu, that's not what I meant...

31
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,100
Get out.

32
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:19,433
Before I call the security.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,133
Jin Sula,

34
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:31,900
right?

35
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,166
Is there any beef between you and me?

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,766
Why do you keep targeting me?

37
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,100
Xia Qiange, you know better.

38
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,306
Dear.

39
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,833
Could you make me a cup of coffee?

40
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,866
(How is it possible for Mr. Gu
to make coffee for someone?)

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Here.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
I don't like this flavor.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,000
What would you like to drink then?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,800
Let's buy it together.

45
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:19,166
Qiange.

46
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,133
Haven't seen you for a while.

47
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,100
You're prettier.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,466
You're talking to the wrong person.

49
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,633
Come on.

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,166
After all these years with you,

51
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,333
you think I can't recognize you?

52
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,766
I am the wife of Gu Chengze, Xia Qianxun.

53
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:34,333
There's a special scar
on that private area of yours.

54
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,200
I suppose Gu Chengze doesn't know it, huh?

55
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:40,800
Qiange.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,566
How could you just marry a random guy

57
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,700
just because I broke up with you?

58
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,800
Stop being a smart ass.

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,700
Get straight to the point.

60
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,133
I've been working on a program.

61
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,466
But there's a lack of fund.

62
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,900
Now that you're the boss lady of the Gu's,

63
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,966
I suppose a borrowing
of two-hundred thousand won't be too much.

64
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,866
Why don't you just go robbing?

65
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,366
I think you have my back.

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,733
Moreover, we had something beautiful.

67
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,233
For old time's sake,

68
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,533
lend me a hand.

69
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,466
One hundred thousand at most. No bargain.

70
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,733
Deal.

71
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,366
Don't ever talk about my identity.

72
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,200
Trust me.

73
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,033
One more thing.

74
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:18,300
Keep Susu near yourself.

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,933
Do not let her appear in my sight.

76
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:20,966
Qiange.

77
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,833
I know you've always had me in your heart.

78
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,366
Hit the road.

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,233
Alright.

80
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,966
You are...

81
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:31,833
Hi, Mr. Gu.

82
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,633
My name is Li Zhuo.

83
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,266
I'm Xia Qian...

84
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,033
I'm classmates with Xia Qianxun in college.

85
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,633
Welcome to suggest.

86
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,540
(He's the ex-boyfriend of Xia Qiange,)

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,730
(Li Zhuo.)

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,633
Please forgive me.

89
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,966
You can't be blinded by anger
and marry Mr. Gu

90
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,933
because of me and Li Zhuo.

91
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,800
(What's his purpose of talking to Qianxun?)
