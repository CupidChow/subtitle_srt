2
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,833
Susu, are you saying that

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,133
Xia Qiange took place
of Xia Qianxun and married Mr. Gu?

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,033
Susu,

5
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:21,333
you need to show some proof
to convince us.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,433
You're Qiange, not Qianxun.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,966
Just confess to Mr. Gu.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,866
He's your elder sister's husband after all.

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,266
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

10
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:31,600
Miss Su.

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,600
If you can't provide any proof,

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,833
I have no choice but send you to the police.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,400
Qiange, say something.

14
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,100
I'm looking out for you.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,800
Stop making it worse.

16
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,140
What proof do you have?

17
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,600
Last time, I saw

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,633
you still using the phone shell
that I gave you as a gift.

19
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:53,433
You're still using it.

20
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:54,866
That's so moving.

21
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,966
(How could I miss that?)

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,933
Why are you holding my phone?

23
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,400
The phone shell belonged to my sister Qiange.

24
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,566
But she gave it to me.

25
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,333
What's the matter?

26
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:18,533
However,

27
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:20,866
fingerprints don't lie, am I right?

28
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:21,600
Qiange?

29
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:22,933
Mr. Gu.

30
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,100
Marital fraud is a big deal.

31
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,699
Maybe we should clear the air.

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,166
Xia Qianxun can unlock the phone of Xia Qiange.

33
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,333
Mrs. Gu got some explaining to do.

34
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,900
This is always the phone
of Xia Qianxun's, mine.

35
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,300
I can unlock it for sure.

38

What?

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,933
Did you, Miss Susu, think that

40
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,200
by stealing my phone

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,340
you're good to frame me?

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,166
Dear.

43
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,800
Please call me at my number

44
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,466
so that they can give up framing.

(A call from Gu Chengze)

47

Your elder sister's phone has been decoded.

48
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,500
Use it.

49
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,333
That's not possible.

50
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,833
You must have done some work on it!

51
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,533
Enough!

52
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,566
Who do you think you are?

53
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,200
I'll teach you a lesson
if you keep tangling us.

54
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,266
And you, Jin Sula.

55
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,000
Do what you should've been doing.

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,900
Or,

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,133
I'll promise the Gu's won't hire you anymore.

58
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,900
Is this what you've got?

(Qianxun after marriage does look weird.)

62
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:30,866
By the way,

63
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,733
I haven't met your twin sister yet.

64
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,666
She didn't attend our wedding.

65
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,333
Are you also suspicious of me?

66
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,433
No. Just asking.

67
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,000
You can come and work at the Gu's next week.

68

Everything has been set ready for you.

Okay.
