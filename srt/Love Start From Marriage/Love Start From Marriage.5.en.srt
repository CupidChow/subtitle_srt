2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,200
Female star Jin Sula
allegedly was cheated on.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,279
Her rumored boyfriend
immediately married another girl.

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,766
(He finally married another woman)
Jin Sula posted late night

5
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:13,066
'Love does not mean commitment'

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,433
which sounds very heartbreaking.

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,566
Do people have no bottom line now?

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,400
(Oh my god! This woman is too bad.)
Paparazzi captured the scene

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,566
that they met secretly in hotel.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,300
It was pretty stimulating.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,000
(Sula is a good girl,
how could this man do this to her?)

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,133
What's your opinion

13
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,900
about Mr. Gu's marriage

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,933
since you were his rumored girlfriend?

15
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,066
(Sula is so kind. You have us, Sula.)
May all of Ms. Xia's wishes come true.

16
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,966
Do you think it was all planned

17
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,100
that Ms. Xia married CEO of Gu's?

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,640
(The girl was married
through proper action!)

19
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:42,600
(Nonsense! Are you serious?)
I did not say that.

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,399
Stop guessing.

21
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,200
(Curse you! You mistress!)
Stop guessing.

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,480
(Sula, don't be sad. We always love you.)

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,300
(Jin Sula is the third person!)

24
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,400
(Gu Chengze never said he loved Jin Sula.)

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,039
(Stop those bullshit
before knowing the truth!)

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,520
(It's that woman! Shame on her!
How dare she show up here!)

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,986
(Notification: You've been reported
as a violation and banned from commenting.)

28
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,500
How dare you, Gu Chengze.

29
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,799
How dare you two-time me?

30
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,933
Hi, Rose.

31
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:16,100
Can I borrow your account?

32
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,266
Too late. I'm banned.

33
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,466
What? You are banned too?

34
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,933
Those fans are being crazy.

35
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:24,200
I was going to defend you,

36
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,933
but was reported
as soon as I sent my first comment.

37
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,400
I should've written an article
before commenting.

38
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,599
Gu Chengze.

39
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,833
You read the news?

40
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,900
What exactly is it with you and Jin Sula?

41
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,233
You know how much hate
I received on the Internet?

42
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,266
There's nothing between me and her.

43
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,600
I'll take care of this thing.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Trust me.

45
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,633
I can't take your word for it.

46
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:11,566
Prove it.

47
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:12,799
I'm so disappointed in you.

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,066
Please hear me out.

49
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,433
It's not what you think.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,100
(Finally I have the reason
to leave Gu family.)

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,766
I'm going back to my home.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,733
I accompany you.

53
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,166
I'll have our luggage prepared.

54
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:24,900
No.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,166
After what has happened,

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,166
I need to explain to my parents.

57
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,100
You'd better deal with this mess

58
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,033
before you come with me.

59
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:32,833
Otherwise, explanation won't help anything.

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,300
I'm back.

61
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,433
Can you behave like a fair lady?

62
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,366
I'm exhausted
from playing your elder daughter these days.

63
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:51,533
Don't get on my back.

64
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:54,400
Have you found Qianxun?

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
What am I gonna do?

66
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,000
Say something.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,933
What are you gonna do
now that you're married?

68
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,300
He wanted to marry Qianxun,

69
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,066
not me.

70
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,933
Either way, it's the daughter of Xia's.

71
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,000
What's the difference?

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,266
You should say this in his face.

73
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,800
Not until our company turns better.

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,633
You should go back now.

75
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,933
The police is going to find Qianxun.

76
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,466
What if it got exposed?

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Have you thought about the consequence?

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
Have you thought about me?

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,466
Kevin, tell Department of Public Relations
to handle it faster.

80
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,500
Hype with the wedding logs
of me and Qianxun.

81
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,466
If none of them works,

82
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:24,733
expose the scandal of Jin Sula.

83
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:25,866
Best if it goes up on the trending,

84
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,166
so that my wife can see it.

85
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,700
She's our artist after all,

86
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,666
is it the right thing to do?

87
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,233
Why? You have doubts on me?

88
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:32,933
No, I don't.

89
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:33,933
Then what are you doing here?

90
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:34,533
Yes.

91
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,053
Hold on, one more thing.

92
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,600
Do you have tips for pacifying women?

93
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,566
Leave it to me.

94
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:45,100
I'll make sure Mrs. Gu won't
be mad at you anymore.
