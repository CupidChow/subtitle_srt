2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,133
How dare you Xia Family!

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,333
Tried to deceive me?

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,766
Uncle Gu,

5
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,333
my father was trying to
save face for two families.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,946
This was the last plan we had.

7
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:20,080
I did that out of despair.

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,800
You were trying to
save the support from us Gu's!

9
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,633
Sorry, uncle Gu.

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,866
I suppose the Xia Family

11
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,333
has nothing to help.

12
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:35,000
Dad.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,966
Your wife was replaced.

15
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,200
What's there to negotiate?

16
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:40,866
You found out.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,600
Looks like you found out earlier

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
that she's a counterfeit.

19
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:46,633
It's not what you think it is.

20
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:46,866
We...

21
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,300
I'm giving you three days

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,033
to clear up this mess.

23
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,700
Send this girl back to
wherever she should've been.

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,366
Our Gu Family won't tolerate her!

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,366
No. She's still helpful to me.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,566
Are you fine?

27
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,633
Stop here, please.

28
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,700
Yo go home first.

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,666
I'm going to the hospital to see my dad.

30
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:13,833
I'll go with you.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Don't bother.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,533
Help! Help!

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,900
I suppose you Xia Family has nothing to help!

34
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,233
Xia Qiange can help the Gu's

35
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,900
win the first place at the national runway.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,100
Our market value will surge.

37
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,566
You're sure you're not
helping out this woman?

38
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,133
We're together only because of interests.

39
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,133
You're up.

40
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:17,700
What happened to me?

41
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,100
Doctor said you were extremely startled.

42
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,100
But you're fine.

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,566
You'll recover with some rest.

44
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,133
Where's Gu Chengze?

45
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,466
You're still thinking about him?

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,733
I can summon him for you.

47
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,200
Can't you be serious?

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,733
Hey.

49
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,433
Circle, oval, rectangle,

50
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,233
there's nothing about me that's square.

51
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:41,366
Do you agree that,

52
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:43,700
if Gu Chengze was half thoughtful as I am,

53
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,600
I'd not take a lot of trouble.

54
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,166
Alright. Whatever you say.

55
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,733
Who are you guys?

56
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,200
What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,766
Abduct me in broad daylight?

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,933
I'm telling you,

59
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,033
if the Gu's is not sued and broke, I'll...

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Answer my questions one by one.

61
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,533
Let go!

62
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,833
What is the relationship
between you and Xia Qiange?

63
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,280
Look at you being so mindful of her.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,333
And you're afraid to express?

65
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,466
What? Does Mr. Gu get cold feet?

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,300
Not up to you to ask.

67
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,433
Are you really having a grudge

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,166
because she's Xia Qiange?

69
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,533
Wait, I might have a chance on her.

70
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,033
Dare you.

71
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,966
Well, enough of joking.

72
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,466
However,

73
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:50,699
I wish you meant you said that day.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Once I

75
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,600
did not believe in love at first sight.

76
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,966
But when I met this girl

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,240
who's outgoing, confident and kind-hearted.

78
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,000
And I fell deeply for her.

79
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,573
The girl that you fell for on runway,

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,933
was not Xia Qianxun.

81
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:07,566
What do you mean?
