2
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,633
Go. Don't mess it up again.

3
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:15,600
Don't worry.

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,200
I won't blow it up this time.

5
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:22,233
Qiange. Eat something first.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
I brought you some congee.

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,633
I'm not hungry. You eat it.

8
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:26,500
Try a little.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,766
If you're too busy,

10
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:35,566
I can feed you.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,933
Try some.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,733
Try it.

13
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,233
Now, our selected designers

14
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,933
will elaborate on their designs.

15
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,066
A successful design

16
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,033
is not subjected to

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,500
colors and forms visible to the audience.

18
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,633
Eyes are also...

19
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:14,373
Qianxun.

20
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:15,826
Qianxun.

21
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:17,480
What happened to her?

22
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,360
Qianxun.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,100
Find a doctor!

24
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:22,530
Doctor!

25
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,266
Clear the way.

26
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,333
Don't jam together.
Keep the air circulating.

27
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:31,733
Might be allergic.

28
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:33,800
Doctor,

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,733
I saw Qianxun have some porridge.

30
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,080
Could you check that?

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,893
The congee contains something

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,633
that was eaten by her with a large amount,

33
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,900
leading to her allergic shock.

34
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:06,833
You're up.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,033
What's the result of the competition?

36
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,766
It doesn't matter.

37
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:15,500
What matters is that you're good.

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,360
What happened to me?

39
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:21,506
Allergic shock.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,560
Someone slipped something
in the congee I gave you.

41
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:24,866
Sorry.

42
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:26,500
It's fine.

43
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,233
What's going on with the runway?

44
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,440
(The Gu's trapped in a marital fraud?)
How could this happen?

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,680
(The Gu's trapped in a marital fraud?)
I thought it's Qiange who has allergy.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,166
(Insider exposing Xia's daughters deceiving CEO)
How come Qianxun has it too?

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,100
(Insider exposing Xia's daughters deceiving CEO)
Could it be that...

48
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,733
(Insider exposing Xia's daughters deceiving CEO)
Oh, nothing.

49
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:42,966
I was just blabbing.

50
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,533
Don't take it serious.

51
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you going to do?

52
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,099
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

53
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,566
Mr. Gu.

54
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,966
What do you have to say
about your wife's identity?

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Were you aware of the fact
that the twins were switching identities?

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
In regard to this absurd action,

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,533
what is your final resolution?

58
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,300
Do you have the plan of divorcing?

59
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,533
Be quiet.

60
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,133
Xia Qianxun.

61
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,600
Our encounter was a misconstruction
in the first place.

62
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,400
I have known the whole story.

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,333
Therefore,

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,900
I decided to divorce you.
