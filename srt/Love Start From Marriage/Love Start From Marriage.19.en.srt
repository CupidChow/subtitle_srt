00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,566
I...

3
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:12,600
You're welcome.

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,466
Ah?

5
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:16,400
It's not that hard to say thanks.

(Qianxun)

8
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,766
Qianxun didn't go home.

9
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,166
Maybe she's still in the company.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,866
You make her a call.

11
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,933
Kevin, you're fired.

12
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,066
Sleep as you want.

13
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,100
I have nothing to do with her.

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,733
Who do you want to trust you?

15
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,033
Xia Qiange?

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,800
Or Xia Qianxun?

17
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,200
But for the sake of our raising you,

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,700
can you please keep your marriage going?

19
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,933
Go back to the Gu Family.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,766
You think Gu Chengze
will have less girls around him?

Hey. Where are you?

24
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:51,566
It's late now.

25
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,466
Go back home soon.

26
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,133
I'm at Shang Nan Road.

27
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm heading home soon.

28
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,233
What's going on?

29
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,933
Several guys are stalking me.

30
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:03,166
Hold the call,

31
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,033
I'll be right there.

32
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,100
Stay near to the crowd.

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,833
Don's panic. Chill.

34
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,533
Keep the call hanging.

35
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:21,166
Help! Help!

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,666
Xia Qiange! Xia Qiange!

37
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,599
Who exactly are you! What do you want!

38
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,366
Cops are coming! Run!

39
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,366
Run!

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,500
Mr. Gu, your father
asked to meet Miss Xia.

41
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,800
(Why does he meet me this late?)

42
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,800
(It wouldn't be something good.)

43
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,300
What does Mr. Gu meet me for?

44
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:01,866
He didn't make it clear.

45
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,700
He just asked to meet Miss Xia.

46
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,000
How dare you Xia Family!

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,200
Tried to deceive me?
