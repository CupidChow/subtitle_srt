2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,433
Hi, everyone. I'm Jin Sula.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,333
About the sleepover photos,

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,900
they're all true.

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,833
Gu Chengze and I

6
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:21,333
have been in a relationship for a while.

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,133
But he's been unwilling to make it public.

8
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,633
And he canceled my contract.

9
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,166
I always think things will pass.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,166
But now...

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,933
I found that

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,466
I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,166
(Sneaky as always.)

14
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,133
Here's my pregnancy report.

15
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:40,266
This time,

16
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,666
I have to stand up for my baby.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,700
Gu Chengze is responsible for this.

18
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,300
Baby is innocent.

19
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,333
(Xia Qiange must have seen this by now.)

20
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:58,300
(Xia Qiange,)

21
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,766
(are you really ignoring all of this?)

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,433
Xia Qiange.

23
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,800
I asked you to come back
and give me a hand.

24
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:13,833
But you went straight

25
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,700
to the runway of the Gu's.

26
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:17,233
You said you have to help your sister.

27
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,433
What about this time?

28
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:19,966
You're assisting the Gu's

29
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,100
up against me?

30
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,700
She's Mrs. Gu.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,433
It's totally fine helping her own husband.

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,700
Not when he got a third woman pregnant.

33
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,300
Then get divorced and live your own life.

34
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:35,066
You're better off alone.

35
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,333
My advice for this fake Mrs. Gu

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,566
is to come to her senses.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,300
Don't get too attached to it.

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Oh wait.

39
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,600
I just made the idea that

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,933
I'll attend the National Runway Show
on behalf of the Song's.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,866
Show me all you've got

42
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,499
in the competition.

43
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,300
Mr. Gu.

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,166
After investigation,

45
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,600
(Ultrasonic Inspection Report)
the pregnancy report is authentic.

46
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,700
The baby can't be mine.

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,266
This incident

48
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,800
has affected the Gu's share price.

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,033
We can't sit around anymore.

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,600
We can find a doctor to do the test again.

51
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,920
Jin Sula would not agree.

52
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,033
How about

53
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,733
we settle Jin Sula down first.

54
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,066
When the baby is born,

55
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,100
we do a DNA test.

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Keep investigating.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,566
Got it.

58
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,533
I'll go for it now.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,566
Xia Qiange,

60
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:27,566
you know what?

61
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,333
Gu Chengze is a jerk for sure.

62
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,966
I sent you back to your house
the day you got drunk.

63
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,466
You know what? He punched me!

64
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,066
And he told my clients

65
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,966
to stand me up.

66
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,566
What a total jerk, right?

67
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:39,200
Right.

68
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,000
Since he cheated on me,

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,759
why can't I cheat on him?

70
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,100
She's joking. She's joking.

71
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,666
Let me go.

72
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,333
Let me go!

73
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,866
I'm a jerk?

74
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:00,666
Wanna cheat on me?

75
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,633
Xia Qiange,

76
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,266
are you gonna flirt everyone you see?

77
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,366
This is what you've got
for the national runway show?

78
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,400
Who gives you the power to boss me?

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
From marital perspective,

80
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,966
you're the one cheating first.

81
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
You even have a baby
with other woman.

82
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,733
From the employment perspective,

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,433
you have no right to ask about
the personal life of your employee.

84
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,700
That's not true.

85
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,366
I have nothing to do with that baby.

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,493
Then how do you explain those photos?

87
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,400
Believe it or not.

88
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,133
Who do you want to trust you?

89
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,566
Xia Qiange?

90
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,400
Or Xia Qianxun?

91
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,900
(I didn't believe in)

92
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,566
(love at one sight before.)

93
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,500
(But when I met a girl)

94
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,146
(who's outgoing,
confident and kind-hearted,)

95
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:50,693
(I couldn't help but fall for her.)

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,693
(Turns out he loves Qiange so much.)
