2
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,466
Xia Qianxun was occupied that day.

3
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,533
And Xia Qiange replaced Xia Qianxun.

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:26,966
(Qiange.)

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,200
(It was you all the time.)

6
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,133
(The one that I love)

7
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,466
(has always been you.)

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,366
(From now on)

9
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,666
(I will hold you tight.)

10
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:36,333
(And never let you go.)

11
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,500
With the fund from the Gu's,

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,233
our company is finally recovering.

13
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,000
What about Qiange?

14
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:11,433
What about her?

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,966
Keep her in the Gu Family.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,766
With all that's happened at this point,

17
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,700
when the national runway is done,

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,866
we'll get divorced.

19
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,533
Break up in peace.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,200
Save some room for each other.

21
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,000
I won't divorce.

22
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,933
Can I have another chance?

23
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm done with playing Xia Qianxun.

24
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,066
I want to get back to being Xia Qiange.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,266
Then be yourself.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,433
You're sure the one you love is Xia Qiange,

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
not Xia Qianxun that I've been playing?

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,266
I appointed your date
with the Lin's daughter.

29
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,433
You'll meet her this afternoon.

30
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,166
What's that for?

31
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,100
Since you're with her only for interests,

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,233
get divorced as soon as possible.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,233
I don't want that exposed

34
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,133
accusing the CEO of the Gu's

35
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,066
of being a tool

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,566
that got tricked by a woman!

37
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,833
I won't get divorced.

38
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:28,333
Yes you are!

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,966
This is not a negotiation.

40
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:30,933
This is your last order!

41
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,866
If I get divorced,

42
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,666
I won't mind losing the whole Gu's to her.

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,266
How dare you threaten me with a woman!

44
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm just properly dividing

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,800
the common property of husband and wife.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,840
Get lost!

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,786
Out of my sight!

48
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,466
I am not divorcing.

49
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,066
Qiange, Qiange.

50
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,133
I know it might be late for me
to come to realize the truth.

51
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,533
But it's you
that I've loved with my whole heart.

52
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
When I saw you with another man,

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,666
I almost got mad.

54
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,533
I realized

55
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,366
I was always afraid to
embrace the true self.

56
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,013
Whatever version of you,

57
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:04,013
I like it.

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,306
Sorry,

59
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:08,068
I was listening to music.

60
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:08,560
Didn't hear you.
