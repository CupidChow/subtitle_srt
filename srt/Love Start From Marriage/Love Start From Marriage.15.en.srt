00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:16,533
Xia Qiange.

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,366
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,733
How come Gu Chengze cheated on you

5
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,500
shortly after you got married?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,533
I got exposed.

7
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,266
We'll get divorced soon.

8
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,666
Dad, by the way.

9
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,200
Gu Chengze asked a reasonable explanation
from our family.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,233
You...

11
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:32,366
Hello?

12
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,133
Dad?

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,900
Are you still there?

14
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,600
I'm hanging up.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,933
Are you gonna piss me off?

16
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:40,533
Dear.

17
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,233
Dear, are you fine?

18
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:43,633
What happened? Don't scare me.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,300
Dad? Dad?

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
Mom. How's dad going?

21
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,966
He's now out of danger.

22
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,000
But he can't be provoked again.

23
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,700
I though dad's always in good health.

24
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:57,666
Qiange.

25
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,633
I know that we failed you before.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,066
But for the sake of our raising you,

27
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,800
can you please keep the marriage going?

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,200
I...

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,366
Your dad was deceived in an investment.

30
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,800
The whole company is in great debt.

31
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,533
Just do him a favor.

32
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,640
He can't be provoked anymore.

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,719
You can only think of me
when you need me.

34
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,159
Every time.

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,799
(Inpatient Department)

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,933
Dad. Eat an apple.

37
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,133
I don't need you here.

38
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,766
Go back to the Gu family.

39
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:32,320
Don't you care
about those gossips about him?

40
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:38,566
Hello.

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,900
I need you to attend the press conference

42
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,433
in the identity of my wife.

43
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:43,766
I'm not available now.

44
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,133
I'll be there.

45
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,666
Mr. Gu. What do you have to say

46
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,266
to those private photos?

47
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,499
With all the gossips shortly after wedding,

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,000
is this marriage something
could be taken lightly to you?

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,933
-Mr. Gu.
-Mr. Gu, is it true?

50
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,733
Will this affect the Gu's stock?

51
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:57,719
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu.

52
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,320
Mr. Gu.

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,199
Was your marriage out of interests?

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,700
Calm down, please.

55
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,233
It was all my mistake

56
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,200
to let those photos being taken.

57
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:06,533
Someone staged the scene

58
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,920
and set me up when I was drunk.

59
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,366
I will find out the schemer

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,366
and charge the person
according to criminal law.

61
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,300
I don't want my company and family

62
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
will be affected because of my negligence.

63
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,560
Mr. Gu.

64
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,933
Do you have anything to say to Mrs. Gu?

65
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,879
I didn't believe in

66
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,600
love at one sight before.

67
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,900
(But when I met a girl)

68
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,133
(who's outgoing,
confident and kind-hearted,)

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,733
(I couldn't help but fall for her.)

70
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,033
(We meet a lot of people everyday,)

71
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,866
(while forget a lot of people every day.)

72
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,200
(But the one that could leave a mark
in my heart,)

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,666
(is only you.)

74
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,433
I never took my marriage lightly.

75
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,200
Neither now,

76
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,300
nor in future.

77
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,833
Mrs. Gu.

78
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,400
With all the gossips
between Mr. Gu and Jin Sula,

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
have you thought about divorcing?

80
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,233
I chose Gu Chengze.

81
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:06,099
And we are married.

82
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
I trust him unconditionally.
