00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,250
(Han Jung-wan)

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,420
(Jun. Q)

3
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,420
(Cha Shi-hyuk)

4
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:57,480
( Individual Circumstances)

5
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,420
What's the matter?

6
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,930
When did you get here?

7
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,750
Oh, you mean that...

8
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,210
I can't keep wasting my time.

9
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,230
I'm analyzing the original work.

10
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,280
What is it? Do you need my help with anything?

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,500
Ask away.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,760
I can't finish this all by myself.

13
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,950
But why did you do it?

14
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,020
What?

15
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,960
Why do you do this?

16
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,900
Swirling the wine

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,229
so the air can contact it,

18
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,039
making the wine richer and more mellow.

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,770
You've changed a lot.

20
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,800
We used to be happy back then.

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,770
Back then?

22
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,729
We got into quarrels over the most trivial things.

23
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,080
We tunneled in on the writing of scripts as if we were possessed.

24
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey, you smiled.

25
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,010
No, I didn't.

26
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,300
The air feels really nice tonight.

27
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,010
Stop drinking.

28
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,470
Why? I'm still awake.

29
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,140
I can keep it going.

30
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,780
You are drunk.

31
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,790
Give it here.

32
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,360
That's enough for you...

33
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,230
I told you to stop drinking.

34
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,530
-Sorry.
-Darn it.

35
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,900
I told you to stop, but you...

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,540
I apologized, okay?

37
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,900
That's all you have to say?

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,620
What more do you want from me?

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,780
How else am I supposed to apologize?

40
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,620
What?

41
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,590
I came here to beg you and curry favor with you.

42
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,400
You've been mean to me, but I put up with it.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,810
Yes, you are right.

44
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,600
I came here out of desperation.

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,860
But you shouldn't have...

46
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,920
You do things however you please.

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,880
However I please?

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,950
Yes.

49
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,620
You think and act from your perspective only.

50
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
You ignore others' good faith.

51
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,140
You care nothing about others' feelings.

52
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,760
If I hadn't come here,

53
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,770
would we have met each other again?

54
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,840
See?

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,510
Even now, you're still imposing your opinion on me.

56
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,800
Didn't you miss me at all?

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,420
You went missing when you felt like it.

58
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,290
What are you talking about? What was that supposed to mean?

59
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,960
-Back then...
-Forget it.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,120
What?

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
Forget about it.

62
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,140
Darn it, no one's here.

63
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,800
I thought I left it here.

64
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,950
What are we getting for dinner?

65
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,980
I'm fine with anything.

66
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,900
Not again.

67
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,480
Get whatever you like.

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,230
Okay. What should we get?

69
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,190
-By the way, why aren't you wearing it?
-What?

70
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,220
The hoodie I got you.

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,190
I got some smudge on it, so I sent it to dry cleaning.

72
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,680
I forgot to tell you. Sorry.

73
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,230
To use the High-Speed Access Card, please insert the card.

74
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,110
Director Ha.

75
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,800
I didn't expect you to arrive so soon.

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,670
I'll direct it.

77
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,040
What?

78
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,110
I don't care if it goes in a bang or a boom.

79
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,040
You know, the silly script.

80
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,870
Are you sure about this?

81
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,990
Whatever. Give me the script.

82
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,840
Did something happen:?

83
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,320
This is too sudden.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,640
Wait, you wanted it filmed.

85
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,270
Why didn't you ask me?

86
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,400
Why didn't you say anything?

87
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,590
Because you never asked.

88
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,050
If I ask you now,

89
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,950
can I get an answer?

90
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,440
I won't know unless you ask.

91
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,940
Do you really want to know?

92
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,730
What do you think we are to each other?

93
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,060
It's...

94
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,650
We are...

95
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,740
I'm scared to think of this as love.

96
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,280
That's because...

97
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,409
I am scared that you might be gone one day.

98
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:41,350
What are you afraid of?

99
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,610
The moment it's defined by words,

100
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,680
there is fear of the end.

101
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:55,840
(The next day, Bi-so is gone.)

102
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,270
What is it?

103
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,290
Is it not doable?

104
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,990
I said I'd direct it.

105
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,880
We'll start auditioning the actors.

106
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,630
The news articles are coming out.

107
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,720
Ha Yeon-woo's next series. The title is done.

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,180
Where are you going?

109
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,670
I'm getting some fresh air.

110
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,180
Director Ha.

111
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,950
Yeon-woo.

112
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,429
I don't know what you've been through,

113
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,669
but don't give up so easily.

114
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,360
Life is short.

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,720
Do what you want while you can.

116
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,370
(Soo-hyuk)

117
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,790
Hello?

118
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,560
Yeon-woo, how have you been?

119
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah, not bad.

120
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,090
Did the deal with Mr. Seong go sour?

121
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,870
Yeah. We couldn't agree on certain things.

122
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,230
Did anything bad happen?

123
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,830
No, it was nothing.

124
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,550
J-DOG is losing their patience.

125
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,970
Not to mention he put up a notice about taking a hiatus.

126
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,480
What?

127
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,340
Anyway, it seems you're still in the dark.

128
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,560
Sorry to call you at this hour.

129
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,400
It's okay.

130
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,210
(Yeon-woo)

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,020
Where is Woo-jae?

132
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,040
What did you do?

133
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,310
Now is not the time to talk about that.

134
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,100
We have to find Woo-jae.

135
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,410
Fine. We'll talk after we find him.

136
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,240
Any idea where he might be?

137
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,020
I don't know.

138
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,220
Any particular place where he'd go?

139
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,170
He takes a lot of scenery photos.

140
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,760
He goes out on his bicycle.

141
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,900
But he didn't take the bicycle or camera with him.

142
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,760
Could he be meeting a friend?

143
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,310
There is no one Mr. Seong would meet in private.

144
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,530
Anyway, I'll go looking for him.

145
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,160
I'll ask around the neighborhood.

146
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,390
Okay.

147
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,010
Well, I should've asked.

148
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,610
Please enter the code.

149
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,680
What could it be?

150
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,940
(Are you going to change it?)

151
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,040
Well...

152
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,320
What about the last few digits?

153
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,190
Should we use the birthdays?

154
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,980
Why don't we use

155
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,660
our birthdays as the password?

156
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,920
What?

157
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,270
I mean.

158
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,630
Wouldn't that be interesting?

159
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,500
We'll always remember each other's birthday.

160
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,480
Hold on.

161
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,080
When is your birthday?

162
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,100
Wait, hold on.

163
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,820
You seriously don't know?

164
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,330
I can't recall.

165
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,050
I won't allow that! Say it now.

166
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,870
-Say it!
-Hold on!

167
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,030
-Say it!
-Fine, I get it.

168
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,610
October 12?

169
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,010
Could it be...

170
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,160
Great, more challenges.

171
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,430
(Hint: The first day we met. Forgot your password?)

172
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,310
The day we first met?
(Hint: The first day we met. Forgot your password?)

173
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,280
The day we first met?

174
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,910
We...

175
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,700
Movies are the art of directing.

176
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,960
That's all for today.

177
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,380
Next week, we'll talk about the filming of movie festivals.

178
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,190
Thank you for coming.

179
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,730
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

180
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,730
What is it?

181
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,710
The lesson is already over?

182
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,050
When was it?

183
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,330
See you around.

184
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,040
Thanks.

185
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,200
Which grade are you from?

186
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,730
I'm from the 14th grade.

187
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,120
A 95's kid?

188
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,870
Me too.

189
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,140
Nice to meet you.

190
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,610
I'm Ha Yeon-woo from the Film Major.

191
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm Seong Woo-jae from the Film Major.

192
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,850
Why haven't we met until now?

193
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,610
Due to some personal reasons, this is my first day at school.

194
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,870
Anyway, I hope we get along well.

195
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,090
Sure.

196
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,060
I want to be a screenwriter, but I also want to be a director.

197
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,560
Can I be both?

198
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,030
Woo-jae.

199
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,020
What do you want to be?

200
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,030
A screenwriter.

201
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,190
A screenwriter? That sounds nice.

202
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,620
We could write the script together.

203
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,220
I prefer writing my own script alone.

204
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Oh, is that so?

205
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,500
Sorry.

206
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,880
No, it's alright.

207
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,700
You'll be the screenwriter, I'll be the director. How about that?

208
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,360
That should do it.

209
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,030
Hey, say something.

210
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,280
Hey.

211
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,670
Come on, answer me.

212
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,210
Fine, I get it.

213
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,640
So be it.

214
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,600
By the way, wait here.

215
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,600
Sorry for the long wait.

216
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,050
It's White Day.

217
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,380
It's a token to remember our friendship by.

218
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,210
Wow, I got in.

219
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,070
(How To Break Up With Your First Love_Final Episode.hwp)

220
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,500
(Next episode)

221
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,430
Why do you want to know?

222
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,770
Is he giving you a lot of trouble?

223
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,420
You could have told me you were hurt.

224
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,890
I showed my heart.

225
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,250
(I showed it to you instead of using words.)

226
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,819
(Bi-so is tired of hiding it any longer.)

227
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,140
But...

228
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,550
Hyo-jae wasn't there.
