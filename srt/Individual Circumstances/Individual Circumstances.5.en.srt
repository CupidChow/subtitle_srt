(Han Jung-wan)

00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,320
(Jun. Q)

3
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,450
(Cha Shi-hyuk)

4
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:57,370
(Individual Circumstances)

5
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,300
Here's a little something for signing the contract.

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,650
Take it.

7
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,080
Don't do unnecessary things.

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,140
Do what you're told.

9
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,789
(Bi-so made her decision.)

10
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,490
(Bi-so made her decision. She wanted to end things. But Hyo-jae had something different in mind.)

11
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,030
(But Hyo-jae had something different)
(Bi-so made her decision. She wanted to end things. But Hyo-jae had something different in mind.)

12
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,289
(Bi-so made her decision. She wanted to end things. But Hyo-jae had something different in mind.)

13
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,470
(in mind.)
(Bi-so made her decision. She wanted to end things. But Hyo-jae had something different in mind.)

14
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:33,970
(in mind.)

15
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,690
Going well?

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,070
As long as you don't talk to me.

17
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,009
You wanted me to do my best to help you, didn't you?

18
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,590
What do you want me to do?

19
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,320
Do your best

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,620
to make yourself invisible.

21
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,410
That's not something I can do.

22
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,880
What to do?

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,120
Oh, you've decided.

24
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,590
Anything stalling you?

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,579
It's none of your business.

26
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,670
No, maybe I can help you in some way.

27
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,850
I can understand how Hyo-jae is feeling.

28
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,170
What?

29
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,630
Hyo-jae is afraid.

30
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,890
Of what?

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,720
That the moment things are said out loud,

32
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,290
everything will be over.

33
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,640
Mr. Jeong.

34
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,910
Hello?

35
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,970
Are you actually looking for a script?

36
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,030
Yes. Don't worry.

37
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,870
Ten days. Just give me another ten days.

38
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,470
I'll return with a great script.

39
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,030
Fine. You better.

40
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,820
Make sure it's a cost-effective one.

41
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,880
You need to pay the right price for a good script.

42
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,090
Yes.

43
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,810
Oh, get that away from me.

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,980
You'll get tanned.

45
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,390
There's no sunlight!

46
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,570
The sun is always there.

47
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,050
It's just covered by the clouds.

48
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,080
What are you doing?

49
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,960
Give that to me.

50
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,490
-What are you doing? -What?

51
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,390
Let me do it.

52
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,460
What? No. I'm doing it myself.

53
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,080
-Give it here. I'll do it. -I'll do it myself.

54
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,950
-Let me do it. -No!

55
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,120
-Let go! -What are you trying to do?

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,650
-Hey! Jeez! -The water is spilling!

57
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,370
Oh, you…

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,360
Sheesh…

59
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,790
(I was going to ask him to help me…)

60
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,900
Hm?

61
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,720
How can I help you?

62
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,440
Run an errand for me.

63
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,420
Okay. Name it.

64
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,370
Get some wine for me.

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,460
Wine?

66
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,920
It should take no more than about an hour.

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,570
Huh?

68
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,590
I can't write without my wine.

69
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,690
-Well, you can drink some other wine... -Or you can leave.

70
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,030
One hour, right?

71
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,440
Okay.

72
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,440
(Where do they sell this wine?)

73
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,640
(No idea.)

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,450
Hello.

75
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,430
Sir, do you sell wine imported from France?

76
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,610
It has 101 on it. Do you sell that?

77
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,850
I'm afraid we don't carry that wine.

78
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,080
-Got it. -I'm sorry.

79
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,220
-Thank you. -Goodbye.

80
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,080
This is what you wanted, right?

81
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,160
There's only one restaurant that sells red wine around here.

82
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,100
I called them, but no one answered.

83
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,150
So I headed there directly. Turns out they were actually closed.

84
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,200
I was in a pickle. But just as I was about to leave,

85
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,630
the restaurant owner showed up.

86
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,070
I think the owner left something behind.

87
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,130
Lucky, right?

88
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,190
Shall I get you a wine glass?

89
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,850
You took over an hour.

90
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,480
Well, it took a lot of time to find this.

91
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,020
Did you sleep well?

92
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,750
I wanted to continue writing,

93
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,060
but the yard was too dirty.

94
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,360
I can't concentrate.

95
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,010
I'm the best at cleaning.

96
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,870
Give that to me.

97
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,270
I'll clean the place up.

98
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,810
My, my, it's so clean now.

99
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,250
What do you think?

100
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,180
Are you hungry?

101
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,660
No.

102
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,440
But I am.

103
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,820
By the way, shouldn't you feed me before making me do chores?

104
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,460
I don't think that's in the contract.

105
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,190
So mean…

106
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,570
(I'm hungry!)

107
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
Yes?

108
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,830
Will you be writing today too?

109
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
Can you come with me to a place?

110
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,460
No.

111
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,070
Just this once. Please.

112
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,920
30 minutes.

113
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,950
What?

114
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,310
I need to get ready.

115
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,190
We're here.

116
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,490
Being with you made me remember the past.

117
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,690
We both fell asleep at my house after drinking.

118
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,910
My mother came to my room and kept nagging.

119
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,140
I mean,

120
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,190
how does such a frail woman pack such a punch when she hits you on the back?

121
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,930
You got hit, too, right?

122
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,840
Yes.

123
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,210
We got tired of her nagging

124
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,370
and tried to sneak out, but she caught us again.

125
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,940
We thought we were in for a lecture, but she told us to eat.

126
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,580
-She made us all that food... -Why are you bringing this up?

127
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,150
But she wouldn't touch any of the food.

128
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,060
She just kept watching us as we ate.

129
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,810
I don't have time for this. Why did you bring me all the way out here?

130
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,060
My mother…

131
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,360
I scattered my mother's ashes here.

132
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,620
(Woo-jae disappeared without a trace.)

133
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,040
Hello?

134
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,420
Yes.

135
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,810
It's today.

136
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,100
The anniversary of her death?

137
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,580
Seong Woo-jae,

138
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,930
thank you for coming here with me.

139
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,260
My mother hasn't seen you in a long time. I'm sure she must be happy.

140
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
Let's go.

141
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,870
Sorry for taking up so much of your time.

142
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,630
Um… Want to get something to eat?

143
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,690
What?

144
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,750
I asked if you were hungry.

145
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,070
Let's go.

146
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,010
Mmm, delicious.

147
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,300
Want some more?

148
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,070
No, I'm full.

149
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,530
I'm stuffed.

150
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,370
-Um… -Um…

151
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,900
You go first.

152
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,860
Your mother…

153
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,730
She…

154
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,600
She had a chronic illness.

155
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,110
In fact, she was suffering.

156
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,010
She said more than once

157
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,150
that she wanted to end everything…

158
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,910
But…

159
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,480
I was too selfish.

160
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,530
More than her pain and suffering,

161
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,160
I was more afraid of being left alone.

162
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,740
I didn't know.

163
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,150
I didn't tell you.

164
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,000
It's in the past now.

165
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,530
Today made me realise that fact even more so.

166
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,470
-I'm sorry… -Huh?

167
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,000
I couldn't be there

168
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,240
at her funeral…

169
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,380
I'm sorry.

170
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,040
Oh, when did you get here?

171
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,360
Oh, this…

172
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,410
Well, I can't spend my time doing nothing.

173
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,340
I'm analysing the original work.

174
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,780
What is it? Do you need me to do something?

175
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,820
Tell me.

176
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,930
I think this is too much for me to finish by myself.

177
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,410
(Next Episode)

178
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,040
You always think and act from your own standpoint.

179
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,100
And ignore others' sincerity.

180
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,610
You don't care how everyone else feels at all.

181
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,840
I'll direct it.

182
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,990
That "Banging Return" or "Booming Return" thing.

183
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,830
That ludicrous script!

184
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,200
Are you sure?

185
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,260
Don't you miss me

186
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,550
at all?

187
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,380
