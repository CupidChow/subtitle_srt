("How To Break Up With Your First Love" Scriptwriter: Seong Woo-jae)

6
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,640
You're back.

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,670
Why are you here again?

8
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:41,009
I heard from Sung Joon, so I rushed here.

9
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,750
Since when are you two this close?

10
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,000
He was the one who picked up my call.

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,039
Have you eaten?

12
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,200
You…

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,380
Why is that the first thing you ask when you see me?

14
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,880
Just wondering.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,230
But why?

16
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,220
Because…

17
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,960
You used to ask me that too.

18
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,970
(Film Department, VTR Room 2)

19
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,340
Have you eaten?

20
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,070
No.

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,900
-Let's get something to eat.
-What do you want to eat?

22
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,079
Something spicy.

23
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,450
Spicy…

24
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,710
Okay. Challenge accepted.

25
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,090
-Really?
-Yes.

26
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,160
-Great!
-Let's go.

27
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,710
I heard you stopped updating the novel.

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,650
I can't carry on.

29
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,810
What?

30
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,550
I can't write the ending.

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,650
I remember seeing the final chapter on your laptop.

32
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,780
Did you read it?

33
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,430
No, I didn't open the file.

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,540
That's not enough.

35
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,110
Then what is the problem?

36
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,430
I can't…

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,320
understand Hyo-jae.

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,820
Where are you, Director Ha?

39
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,070
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeong.

40
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,210
What?

41
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,250
I can't direct the film.

42
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,550
-I'll issue a statement then.
-Mr. Jeong,

43
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm really sorry.

44
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,900
Get up.

45
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,279
What's the matter?

46
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,160
Hey,

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,380
you won't figure things out if you stay cooped up in here.

48
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,730
Let's go out.

49
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,120
To where?

50
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,210
Well…

51
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,020
Anywhere.

52
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,120
Come on!

53
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,900
Mr. Seong!

54
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,680
You came.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,020
Did you know how worried I was about you?

56
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,220
What do you plan to do now?

57
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,950
I've been hounded by the higher-ups.

58
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,400
Stop it.

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,310
-Is he giving you a lot of trouble?
-Sung Joon.

60
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,480
That's enough.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,860
Huh?

62
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,700
I'll wrap things up properly. Don't worry.

63
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,240
Let's go.

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,760
(Museum)

65
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,910
Let's go inside.

66
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,120
Will that be all right?

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,210
It's not a big deal.

68
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,140
We'll just sneak in and take a look.

69
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,200
(Museum)

70
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,890
Beautiful.

71
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,800
-Yes.
-Right?

72
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,790
I didn't know there was a place like this here.

73
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,950
Maybe it's the holidays. It's really quiet in here.

74
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,060
Who's there?

75
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,430
Hey!

76
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,660
What's wrong?

77
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,090
It's just…

78
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,200
Isn't this thrilling?

79
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,360
Run!

80
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,750
(Perhaps one never changes his mind.)

81
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,740
Tired?

82
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,690
Exhausted…

84
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,600
Oh, you need to exercise more.

85
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,850
You sit and write your novel on your laptop all day long.

86
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,970
See?

87
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,710
All that running made you forget everything, right?

88
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,690
Who cares about the ending? It's all gone now.

89
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,440
Ah, this is nice.

90
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,290
What are you doing?

91
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,420
I was just curious

92
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,320
about the ending you wrote.

93
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,190
I told you that wasn't the final version.

94
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,010
You'll rewrite it, right?

95
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,170
Let's rewrite it together.

96
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,450
What was the real reason Mi-so disappeared?

97
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,570
The real reason?

98
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,280
I could never figure that out.

99
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,810
Why?

100
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,180
Did Mi-so really love Hyo-jae?

101
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,540
Yes.

102
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,330
More than anyone.

103
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,900
So why did she leave him?

104
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,410
She abandoned Hyo-jae.

105
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,080
She was hurt by his actions.

106
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,160
Trying to graduate is hard…

107
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,080
It really is.

108
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,460
Taking care of a dummy called Ha Yeon-woo sure is exhausting.

109
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,070
Listen.

110
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,060
That should be my line.

111
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,520
You're the one who wanted to work with me in the first place.

112
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,330
So you had thought about working with someone else instead of me?

113
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,450
Oh, you're serious.

114
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,080
But I have always wanted to work with you.

115
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,170
Why?

116
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,930
I just

117
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,150
really like your novel...

118
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,260
Hey,

119
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,150
let's work together as a scriptwriter and a director in the future.

120
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,190
You keep saying things like that. That's why people talk about us.

121
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,190
It's just gossip… Don't take it to heart.

122
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,840
Hey, don't let them get to you.

123
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,930
Sorry.

124
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,500
Well,

125
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,560
she could have told him that she was hurt.

126
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,310
(She did.)

127
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,500
(She showed him with her heart instead of words.)

128
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,980
No.

129
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,020
Mi-so thinks Hyo-jae doesn't love her.

130
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,100
Then why did she accept him when he came back?

131
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,530
That's because it couldn't be helped…

132
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,440
Mi-so is despicable.

133
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,300
Did you just say that she was despicable?

134
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,410
Is she not?

135
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,700
She didn't have the guts to say it out loud and ran away.

136
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,500
But when she saw him again, she smiled unconsciously.

137
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,090
That's just how she is.

138
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,780
That makes her even more selfish and despicable.

139
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,960
She expected him to understand the way she loved.

140
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,450
Mi-so isn't the only one to blame here.

141
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,490
What about Hyo-jae?

142
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,090
Don't you think he would be sad and hurt

143
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,170
when she was gone too?

144
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,830
Sorry.

145
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,170
Hello?

146
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,360
Is this Ha Yeon-woo?

147
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,850
Yes, that's right.

148
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm calling from the hospital.

149
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,570
Your mother collapsed and is in the emergency room.

150
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,180
Please come immediately.

151
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,590
But he had to grit his teeth and move on.

152
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,370
Of course, Hyo-jae was hurt too.

153
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,740
Mi-so kept everything to herself.

154
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,880
She thought that was how she loved someone.

155
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,900
But she didn't consider Hyo-jae's feelings, who was waiting for her.

156
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,980
And at that moment,

157
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,180
instead of confronting Mi-so about why she disappeared,

158
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,360
being able to see her again was enough for him.

159
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,070
Mi-so was tired of hiding it any longer, either.

160
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,440
But

161
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,660
Hyo-jae was already gone when she wanted to voice it out.

162
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,680
(Yeon-woo)

163
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,050
Excuse me, have you guys seen Yeon-woo?

164
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,300
That came out of nowhere. How would I know?

165
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,280
-Did you see him?
-I don't know where he is.

166
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,820
-Try calling him.
-Oh, okay. Thanks.

167
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,730
(The number you dialed is unavailable.)

168
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,370
(Please try again later.)

169
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,370
Woo-jae…

170
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,640
Is this our story?

171
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,290
