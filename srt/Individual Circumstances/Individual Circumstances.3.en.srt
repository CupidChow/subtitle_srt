(Han Jung-wan)

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,260
(Jun. Q)

3
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,330
(Cha Shi-hyuk)

4
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:57,390
(Individual Circumstances)

5
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,120
Why not live in my house instead? What is this about anyway?

6
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,880
(Yeon-woo)

7
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,550
Hello.

8
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,650
Mr. Seong, I'll come back tomorrow.

9
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,730
Forget it. You don't have to come back.

10
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,159
Mr. Seong, you don't know him.

11
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,580
What if he is a bad guy?

12
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,440
You can just stay out of this.

13
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,480
How can I do that?

14
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,360
I'll come back tomorrow.

15
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Do not come back.

16
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,230
Hello, Mr. Seong.

17
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,050
(In the four years that Bi-so was gone,)

18
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,630
(Hyo-jae had never once looked for her.)

19
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,000
(She thought)

20
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,450
(that she didn't mean anything to Hyo-jae.)

21
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,120
(And a misunderstanding was born.)

22
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,900
(In the four years that Bi-so was gone, Hyo-jae had never once looked for her.)

23
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:11,820
(The misunderstanding would eventually turn into hatred through a snowball effect.)

24
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,360
(But)
(The misunderstanding would eventually turn into hatred through a snowball effect.)

25
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,840
(when she encountered Hyo-jae again,)

26
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,050
(she had completely forgotten why she chose to leave.)

27
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,330
(Why?)

28
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,659
(The real reason)

29
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,409
(that Bi-so left was...)

30
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,780
Goodness.

31
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,700
Darn it.

32
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,370
Thank you

33
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,890
for the flu medicine.

34
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,810
I just don't want you to die at my house.

35
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,100
Where did you go yesterday?

36
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,090
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

37
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,590
You can eat by yourself.

38
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,350
Soybean sprout soup.

39
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,780
Make it for me.

40
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,460
No.

41
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,480
Here.

42
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,590
What are these?

43
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,060
Take a nap after you finish these dishes.

44
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,920
Bon appetit.

45
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,300
How is it?

46
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,350
Is it not good?

47
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,670
It's delicious.

48
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,700
That's great.

49
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,450
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital?

50
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,040
Why should I?

51
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,070
With these dishes, I'll recover in no time at all.

52
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,040
Aren't they spicy?

53
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,200
These are my medicine.

54
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,540
You cooked these dishes for me. Of course, I have to finish them.

55
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,210
If you don't want to eat yours, give it to me.

56
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,850
I'm going to finish everything here.

57
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
Wow.

58
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,780
Are you taking care of me?

59
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,590
-I haven't eaten this in years.
-Leave

60
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,960
after you're done.

61
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,460
Wait.

62
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,820
Where's the rice?

63
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,830
He has such an ill temper.

64
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:37,500
(Hyo-jae asked Bi-so carefully, "Have you eaten?")

65
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,480
(Hyo-jae sounded almost dismissive when he asked Bi-so that question.)
(Hyo-jae asked Bi-so carefully, "Have you eaten?")

66
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,890
(Hyo-jae sounded almost dismissive when he asked Bi-so that question.)

67
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,590
(And Bi-so)

68
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,350
(couldn't suppress the anger in her that was about to erupt.)

69
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,930
Have you eaten?

70
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,190
Is this the only thing you want to ask?

71
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,250
Shouldn't you ask me why I was gone?

72
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,690
You are in front of me now.

73
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,370
And that's enough.

74
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,420
(Bi-so couldn't quell her anger anymore)

75
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,560
(Bi-so thought that he would ask her where she had gone. But she was disappointed.)
(Bi-so couldn't quell her anger anymore)

76
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,400
(and said a lot of hurtful things to Hyo-jae.)
(Bi-so thought that he would ask her where she had gone. But she was disappointed.)

77
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,910
I've finished the food.

78
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,670
Your culinary skills have improved even further.

79
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,760
Let's talk.

80
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,500
How are your parents?

81
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,070
Why are you here?

82
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,380
Is it inconvenient

83
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,750
to live here by yourself?

84
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,820
Do you really dislike my presence here?

85
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,160
You really have a lot of questions.

86
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,500
Because it has been a long time.

87
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,120
Why me?

88
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,770
Why...

89
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,080
I've always liked this novel.

90
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,790
Although it's not as exciting as the other novels,

91
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm always curious about the next chapter.

92
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,300
What else?

93
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,120
Is there anything more important than that?

94
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,160
After receiving your phone number, I believe

95
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,420
that if we work together, we can do it.

96
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,650
By the way, I think I've come here before.

97
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,620
Yes.

98
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,280
This looks like the road that Bi-so and Hyo-jae walked on.

99
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,370
Who are you?

100
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,050
I could ask you the same thing.

101
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,080
(Next Episode)

102
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,150
Stop doing these useless things.

103
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,180
Just do what you're here to do.

104
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,270
Best friend?

105
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,500
Why did you do that?

106
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,190
I didn't do anything.
