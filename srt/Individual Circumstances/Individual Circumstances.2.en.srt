1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,090
(Han Jung-wan)

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,260
(Jun. Q)

3
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,250
(Cha Shi-hyuk)

4
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:57,270
(Individual Circumstances)

5
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,620
Um… You and I…

6
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,040
Let's work together!

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,289
That crazy bastard.

8
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,030
What is this?

9
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,800
Whatever.

10
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,620
Give me a break.

11
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,620
A round of applause.

12
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,980
Woo-jae!

13
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,790
Woo-jae!

14
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,780
Let's talk about your novel.

15
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,480
How did you find me?

16
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,510
I want to make a movie using your novel.

17
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,100
No way.

18
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,200
Huh? Hear me out.

19
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,760
I said no! Just leave already!

20
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,560
Hey, are you alright?

21
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,430
Do you want some?

22
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,610
We received a report. We're here to investigate.

23
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,870
-You file the complaint, right?
-Yes.

24
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,720
Is this your home?

25
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,330
Yes.

26
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,720
Is this a fight between two friends?

27
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,950
Arh...

28
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,680
My friend seems very mad.

29
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,900
You can't simply ask the police to come and go

30
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,540
over something so trivial.

31
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,210
That's not it.

32
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,220
Just proceed with the protocol.

33
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,330
We need to verify your IDs.

34
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,400
Come on, forget it.

35
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,500
This is between two friends.

36
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,620
It's no big deal.

37
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,080
Yeah. The people here really lack the human touch.

38
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
What are you doing right now?

39
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,650
Oh my.

40
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,150
I'm sorry you have to come all the way here.

41
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,900
I came to apologize to my friend.

42
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,520
I promise I'll settle everything with him.

43
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,200
We are busy. Don't waste our time.

44
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,810
Apologize to your friend now.

45
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,740
So, what do we do now?

46
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,780
There will be a line at the cafeteria.

47
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,840
I am hungry.

48
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,130
Thank you. Have a nice day.

49
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,570
Thank you.

50
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,160
Woo-jae.

51
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,470
-Let me use the bathroom.
-No.

52
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,220
It's urgent. Please.

53
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,250
I said no!

54
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,270
I'll have to do it here, then.

55
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,330
Okay?

56
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,110
Just this time. Please.

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
Wow, I almost exploded.

58
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,460
This is a pretty house.

59
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,210
Are you writing your novel?

60
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
You haven't had any updates in a while.

61
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,620
If you're done, get out.

62
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,570
Hey, hold on.

63
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,610
How did you get this address?

64
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,100
Someone I know at the office told me.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,270
What?

66
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,380
-Get out.
-What?

67
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,030
-Get out now.
-No!

68
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,190
Don't be so mean.

69
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,960
I won't know unless you say something.

70
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
Didn't you miss me at all?

71
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,180
Yeah, I didn't miss you.

72
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,570
But I missed you a lot.

73
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,880
The one who left without a trace

74
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,360
was you.

75
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,630
Who's there?

76
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,190
The guy who lives here is my friend.

77
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,290
You know where he is now?

78
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,800
Oh, the student?

79
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
(He suddenly checked out)

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,670
(and moved away.)

81
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,230
(Woo-jae...)

82
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,870
Have you seen Woo-jae?

83
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,650
No.

84
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,340
We haven't seen him since last week.

85
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,909
Why do you ask?

86
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,340
Did you two have a fight?

87
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,530
No.

88
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,970
I couldn't reach him.

89
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,170
Come on. Just wait a little longer.

90
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,400
If it wasn't a fight, he'd come back for sure.

91
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,420
Let's go.

92
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,810
(Hyo-jae never asked Bi-so why she left so suddenly.)

93
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,070
(Hyo-jae never)
(Hyo-jae never asked Bi-so why she left so suddenly.)

94
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,150
(Hyo-jae never asked Bi-so why she left so suddenly.)

95
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,060
(asked Bi-so )
(Hyo-jae never asked Bi-so why she left so suddenly.)

96
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,020
(why she left so suddenly.)
(Hyo-jae never asked Bi-so why she left so suddenly.)

97
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,490
(Hyo-jae never asked Bi-so why she left so suddenly.)

98
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,420
(There was a time of emptiness between the two.)

99
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,430
(Although it had faded, as she looked at Hyo-jae, who was still somewhat caring,)

100
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,410
(Bi-so couldn't)

101
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,860
(say a word to him at all.)

102
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,560
(Bi-so couldn't say a word to him at all.)
(say a word to him at all.)

103
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,940
(Bi-so couldn't say a word to him at all.)

104
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,800
(The seed of doubt had been planted)

105
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,680
(in Bi-so's heat.)

106
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,680
(Why didn't Hyo-jae ask her anything?)

107
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,160
(When Bi-so was gone,)

108
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,160
(maybe it wasn't the thought of Bi-so that kept him going.)

109
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,320
(Maybe it was anguish that drove him.)

110
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,490
(Doubts and suspicion were piling up.)

111
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,100
(The misunderstanding between the two was snowballing.)

112
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,900
(It didn't help with their predicament.)

113
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,120
(As for Bi-so,)

114
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,220
(she decided to keep all the questions to herself.)

115
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,700
Morning.

116
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,390
Did you sleep well?

117
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
The weather is nice today.

118
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,550
Woo-jae, did you have your breakfast?

119
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,450
You used to eat breakfast.

120
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,410
I gave it some thought.

121
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,120
In chapter 212, Bi-so...

122
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,710
That's mean.

123
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,830
Where are you going?

124
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,590
None of your business.

125
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,850
When are you coming back?

126
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,410
Let's eat together.

127
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,980
Hey.

128
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,460
Explain.

129
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,560
What?

130
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,330
Oh...

131
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,160
-Find me the truth.
-Understood.

132
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,210
Mr. Seong.

133
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,530
Yes?

134
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,110
I'm sorry, it was me.

135
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,590
Is this how you handle my private information?

136
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,850
My apologies.

137
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,600
I'll head over tomorrow and resolve the issue.

138
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,140
Got it.

139
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,690
Why not live in my house instead? What is this about anyway?

140
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,140
(Yeon-woo)

141
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,230
(Next Episode)

142
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,840
(Mr. Seong, you don't know him.)

143
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,270
(What if he is a bad guy?)

144
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,200
Who are you?

145
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,510
I could ask you the same thing.
