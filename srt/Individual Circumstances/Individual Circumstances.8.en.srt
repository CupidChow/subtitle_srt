(Individual Circumstances)

5
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,590
You've been expressing your feelings in your own way.

6
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,600
No.

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,900
It was selfish and despicable.

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,760
That's not your fault.

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,050
I was the one who hurt you.

10
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,530
I wasn't considerate enough.

11
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,600
That is another form of love.

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,070
No.

13
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,780
If one can't sort out his own feelings,

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,430
how is he supposed to understand someone else's?

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,650
My mother collapsed that day.

16
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,630
She had emergency surgery, and I thought everything was fine.

17
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,600
But after one week, things suddenly...

18
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,220
I know it sounds like an excuse, but I didn't know what to do.

19
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,150
My mind went blank.

20
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,850
I didn't know that.

21
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,729
I was so scared.

22
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,970
Truth be told, I shouldn't have thought that way.

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,410
I always let my affection bottle up.

24
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,460
I thought being with you

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,079
was good enough for me.

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,430
But...

27
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,990
You went missing.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,480
-Back then...
-Yes, another excuse.

29
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,390
I have something to say too.

30

Yes?

45
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,800
It's been a while since we met.

46
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,190
You don't seem too happy today.

47
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,920
That's not it. How have you been?

48
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,310
Good.

Mr. Seong.

53
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,950
I've never seen you this happy before.

54
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,090
I've always looked this way.

55
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,550
You always yelled at me.

56
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,940
You chased me out or outright ignored me.

57
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,420
Sorry.

58
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,650
Don't worry.

59
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,159
I'm still fond of you, nonetheless.

Yeah.

63
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,470
Many production companies called.

64
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,330
They want to adopt it into a movie or a TV series.

65
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,770
But you don't want any of them, do you?

66
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,570
The company asked me to get your opinion on this.

67
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,010
They want a reply as soon as possible.

68
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,210
Many of them offer a great package.

69
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,740
I'll think about it.

70
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,810
Mr. Seong.

71

Follow your heart.

72
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,710
The cost is too high.

73
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,210
But the story is good.

74
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,280
But the cost is still too high.

75
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
Yes.

76
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,480
The story is good, I'll admit it.

77
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,730
But he is a rookie.

78
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,540
I can't invest that much

79
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,790
on a nobody.

80
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,020
-I can take a pay cut.
-My goodness.

81
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,940
Now, that's not a laughing matter.

82
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm fine with it.

83

If words got out,

84
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,159
you'd be taken advantage of by everyone in the industry.

But...

107
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,300
You're so petty. You came here by yourself.
