1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,010
(Han Jung-wan)

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,300
(Jun. Q)

3
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,210
(Cha Shi-hyuk)

4
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:57,310
(Individual Circumstances)

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,920
Who are you?

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,280
I could ask you the same thing.

7
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,130
That's right.

8
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,830
You are the person who stole his address and came here.

9
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,880
Listen to me. It's a criminal offense.

10
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,289
What did you say?

11
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,930
What do you mean by a criminal offense?

12
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,590
How did you find this place, then?

13
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,650
Woo-jae is my friend.

14
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,390
What?

15
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,270
You are lying.

16
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,840
It's true.

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you back?

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,050
What do you mean?

19
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,940
I heard that this was a troublesome issue.

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,850
Troublesome?

21
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,260
Me?

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,430
You said that you would never accept this kind of proposal.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,980
You did.

24
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,040
But

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
are you going to collaborate with this director?

26
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,079
We will work together.

27
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,500
Besides, I still know my craft.

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,980
Mr. Seong.

29
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,410
Woo-jae.

30
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,030
Mr. Seong.

31
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,940
I'll talk to him nicely to make him leave.

32
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,150
You have the support of the company and me.

33
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,760
Just give me the green light.

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,860
I don't know.

35
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,230
What?

36
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,130
Have you been drinking?

37
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,670
I want to confirm something.

38
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,940
The ending of this novel...

39
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,110
Mr. Seong.

40
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,610
You are awake. Are you okay?

41
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,550
Do you want to drink some water?

42
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,080
Can you leave?

43
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,790
Me?

44
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,070
You too.

45
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,040
Get out now.

46
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,660
Seong Woo-jae, you are crazy.

47
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,910
This is your fault.

48
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,630
What are you talking about?

49
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,350
What's your real reason for being here?

50
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,800
Didn't you hear me?

51
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,020
I said that I was going to collaborate with Woo-jae.

52
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,690
I know a thing or two about someone like you.

53
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,310
You are just trying to use Mr. Seong's popularity as your stepping stone.

54
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,350
No. Who do you think I am?

55
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,880
I've always liked this novel.

56
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,370
That's why

57
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,050
you chose Mr. Seong's novel.

58
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,690
Let me finish.

59
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,510
I've always liked this novel.

60
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,330
And this is a novel by my best friend, Woo-jae.

61
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,430
Best friend?

62
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,190
I know everyone who's related to Mr. Seong.

63
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,890
But I've never seen you before.

64
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,490
And he has never mentioned you.

65
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,440
And you call yourself his best friend.

66
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,750
No. How can you not believe me?

67
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,630
So, stop wasting your energy and get out.

68
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,410
You'll just get in his way.

69
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,050
Wasting my energy?

70
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,670
-Are you done now?
-Hey.

71
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,880
Do you want to hit me?

72
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
Really? Come on.

73
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,410
Come on. Hit me.

74
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,980
-I can't believe you. Hey!
-Hit me.

75
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,320
-Darn you.
-Hit me.

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,640
Hey!

77
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,909
What are you doing?

78
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,140
Mr. Seong, this man is ridiculous.

79
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,040
Woo-jae.

80
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,940
I just want to collaborate with you.

81
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,710
Mr. Seong.

82
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,350
Do you want to eat some?

83
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,960
Forget it.

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay.

85
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,390
This is great.

86
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,910
This is the last one.

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,810
-Hi, Eun-jung.
-Editor-in-Chief.

88
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,590
How's Mr. Seong?

89
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,670
I'm sure he feels uncomfortable.

90
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,620
You should apologize to him.

91
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,270
No.

92
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,650
He said that he wanted to be alone. So, I came out too.

93
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm going to go crazy.

94
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,200
It's because of that man.

95
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,990
Don't blame me for this, okay?

96
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,250
What?

97
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,980
Okay.

98
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,090
Why did you do that?

99
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,290
Why did you do this? Why did you bring so much trouble to them?

100
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,320
What?

101
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,790
So, why did you keep on pestering him

102
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,960
and upset him so much?

103
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,990
I didn't do anything.

104
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,270
Is it wrong for me to visit my friend?

105
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,990
Do you know how much you've troubled Soo-hyuk and Mr. Seong?

106
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,510
What's wrong with you?

107
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,120
You are the one who gave me his address and asked me not to pester Soo-hyuk.

108
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,660
Anyway, just apologize and leave.

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,470
Yes. Don't stay here. Leave.

110
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,110
I won't leave.

111
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,550
Let's talk. Come in.

112
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,020
I'm really sorry. I promise that it won't happen again.

113
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,809
Okay.

114
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,370
Mr. Seong, what did you want to say just now?

115
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,500
He was about to bring it up.

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,780
Stop rushing him.

117
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,380
-Be quiet.
-What did I do?

118
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,780
I will think

119
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,410
about your suggestion.

120
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,690
Mr. Seong, are you okay?

121
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,040
But...

122
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,630
We'll go back first, then.

123
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,270
Bye.

124
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,940
Mr. Seong.

125
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,800
Are you really going to collaborate with him?

126
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,320
Yes.

127
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,050
Are you really okay?

128
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,110
Yeon-woo.

129
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,460
You have to thank me for this.

130
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,250
Just now, you were talking

131
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,660
about how much I had troubled Soo-hyuk.

132
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,490
-Right?
-When did I say that?

133
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,420
Anyway, after the filming,

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,280
remember to treat Soo-hyuk and me to a meal.

135
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,370
Yeon-woo, all the best.

136
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,990
-He has never said yes to anyone before.
-Okay.

137
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,340
-We'll get going now.
-Okay.

138
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,270
-We'll get going now.
-Go now, please.

139
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,050
Let's put these in.

140
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,570
Where are you going?

141
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,180
I'm moving in.

142
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,800
Theoretically, I can go inside now, right?

143
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,360
Wait.

144
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,580
It's too early for you to celebrate.

145
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,210
Why are you still here?

146
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,610
I'm going to stay here.

147
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,870
You should leave too.

148
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,170
What?

149
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,800
Mr. Seong, this rascal is still here.

150
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,460
Of course, I have to protect you.

151
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,230
Me? Protect?

152
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,180
You don't have to do it. Hurry up and go back now.

153
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,550
I'll go back now, then.

154
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,490
Remember to call me if anything happens.

155
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,290
Don't worry about me.

156
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,290
I can't wait for the ending too.

157
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,540
You'd better behave.

158
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,190
I'm watching you.

159
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,940
I really hate him.

160
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,450
Are you crazy?

161
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,180
No.

162
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,630
I have to clean myself,

163
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,290
but you won't let me in.

164
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,870
I just said that you couldn't sleep at my house.

165
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,450
I'll go in and take a shower then.

166
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,820
I haven't showered properly for three days already.

167
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,100
This feels so nice.

168
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,980
Hey.

169
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,490
Can you please

170
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,160
put on some clothes?

171
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,360
-I don't have any clothes.
-What?

172
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,810
-Haven't you realized?
-Stay away.

173
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,260
I've been wearing the same clothes for days.

174
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,110
As I said, stay away!

175
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,030
-I didn't bring anything because I didn't expect this.
-Hey!

176
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,480
Darn it.

177
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,300
Wait here.

178
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,470
Woo-jae.

179
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,010
What is it again?

180
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,720
Lend me some underwear too.

181
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,790
You are crazy.

182
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,960
Thank you.

183
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,890
I can't lend you my underwear.

184
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,830
What do you think?

185
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,340
I bought one for you too.

186
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,800
It's a gift to celebrate our collaboration.

187
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,040
Take it.

188
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,950
Hey.

189
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,440
That's a boring reaction.

190
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
Drink this.

191
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,340
Thank you.

192
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,140
What is this?

193
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,510
Last time, you said that this was nice.

194
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,240
Let me take a look.

195
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,330
-How can I wear this?
-What?

196
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,240
It's exactly the same as yours.

197
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,190
What if they misunderstand us?

198
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,690
You are right. I'm sorry.

199
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,990
It's okay.

200
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,140
We just have to wear it on different days.

201
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,290
We are going to be late. Let's go.

202
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,650
It's time for our tuition class.

203
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,220
-Do we have to go now?
-Of course.

204
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,800
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

205
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,230
Let's go.

206
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,290
I don't need it.

207
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,510
Stop doing these useless things.

208
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,230
Just do what you're here to do.

209
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,960
(Next Episode)

210
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,790
What are you afraid of?

211
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,690
Can you come with me to a place?

212
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,030
I didn't know.

213
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,310
I'm sorry.
