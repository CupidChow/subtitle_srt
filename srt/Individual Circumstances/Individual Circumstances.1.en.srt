00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,400
Have you decided on the ending?

27
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,280
Can we put it on hiatus?

28
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,800
All right.

29
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,450
I'll explain it to the company.

30
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,060

What?

33

No way! Bi-so should be much angrier!

Mr. Jeong, are you still producing scripts like these?

Director Ha.

50
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,670
You direct it.

51
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,780
What?

52
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,200
That script.

53
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,950
An adult film?

54
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,790
Jeong, I'm the Ha Yeon-woo.

55
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,140
It's not an adult film. It's an adult comedy.

56
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,830
Sheesh!

57
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,120
I know the plot of the last one wasn't the best.

58
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,810
Fine. I'll find one with a better subject matter, okay?

59
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,540
Find me one that's good,

60
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,120
or you're directing this film.

61

63

Did you see his face?

65
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,039
After he became a sensational hit with "Hotel Alcoholics",

66
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,500
his two following films were screw-ups. Remember that?

67
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,789
It was a lot of work deleting all those nasty comments.

68
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,980
Honestly, more than his directing,

69
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,130
I think it was his looks that got him all that popularity.

70
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,400
Right?

71
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,550
I heard he might be directing an adult film.

72
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,170
It does seem like it.

Yes.

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,200
What about it?

84
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,480
Can you give me his number?

Well, it's urgent.

All right…

can you arrange a meeting for us?

It's about a novel adaptation. I would like to talk to him in person.

Well, if that's the case,

I don't think it'll work out.

118

The author doesn't want his work to be adapted into a film.

Could you please help me ask him?

Well…

122
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,290
Help me out just this once. Please?

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,770
Ah…

No!

Mr. Seong is really against that.

130

You already know my stance on that. Why did you bring it up?

131
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,420
Um…

132
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,930
The editor-in-chief told me to ask you…

133

You're my agent.

134
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,760
Why do you keep doing things that I don't like?

Sorry…

You should go back to Seoul for now.

Se… Seoul? Why?

138
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,580
Just go.

139
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,180
All right.

140
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,190
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,230
But I should be helping you by your side…

142
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,920
Enough!

143
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,390
Leave. I want to be alone.

144
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm sorry.

(Good morning, Soo-hyuk!)

146
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,180
(Good morning, Soo-hyuk! Have you contacted the author?)

147
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,680
(I guess you're busy, Soo-hyuk.)

148

(I guess you're busy, Soo-hyuk. Please reply when you see this message.)

153
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,090
Yeon-woo, what are you doing?

154
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,900
Hm? What's the matter?

155
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,150
Are you a stalker?

156
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,310
Why have you been pestering my man all day?

157

I contacted Mr. Seong.

163

He won't budge.

164
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,640
He said no.

165
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,050
I see…

166
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,040
Yeon-woo, about that…

167
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm hanging up, Yeon-woo. We're going to eat.

168
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,210
(Ha Eun-jung, 2:13 PM, J-DOG, 010-29349-1012)

169
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,120
(31 Street, Bansa Village, Gyuam Township, Buyeo County, Chungnam Province.)

170
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,000
(I'm sending you this without his knowledge! Handle the rest yourself! Leave us alone!)

171
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,290
Either way,

172
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,420
I got what I wanted. That's good enough for me.

173
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,760
(010-29349-1012, 31 Street, Bansa Village,
Gyuam Township, Buyeo County, Chungnam Province.)

174
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,440
(I'm sending you this without his knowledge! Handle the rest yourself! Leave us alone!)

175
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,050
What are you doing?
(I'm sending you this without his knowledge! Handle the rest yourself! Leave us alone!)

176
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,710
What are you doing?

177
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,170
An unknown number keeps calling me.

178
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,910
Just change your phone number.

179
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,230
That's too much of a hassle.

180
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,210
I should take this chance to change my number and clean up my contacts too.

181
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,190
Should I change mine too?

182
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,720
Are you really going to change your number?

183
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,830
Mm…

184
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,140
What should I choose for the last few digits?

185
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,520
Birthday?

186
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,440
Why don't we use our birth dates

187
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,060
for the last digits of our phone numbers?

188
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,380
What?

189
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,740
Well…

190
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,100
Wouldn't that be fun?

191
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,050
That way, we won't forget each other's birthdays.

192
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,750
Mr. Seong, if anything happens, please call me.

193
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,820
Hurry up and leave.

194
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,970
Don't drink too much alcohol.

195
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,630
-Oh, right. I put the dirty laundry into the washing machine…
-Please stop.

196
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,140
Mr. Seong, about the clothes I put in the dryer…

197
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,050
What is this?

198
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,770
I'm practically in the middle of nowhere.

199
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,170
It doesn't look like anyone's here.

200
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,500
I should just go to sleep for the night.

201
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,240
Oh…

202
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,230
It has been a while.

203
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,760
Have you eaten?

204
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,410
I'm Yeon-woo.

205
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,360
I know. Why are you here?

206
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,420
Um…

207
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,380
Um… You and I…

208
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,800
Let's work together!

209
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,700
That was quite the greeting.

210
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,920
Oh, that's salty.

211
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,110
That crazy bastard.

212
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,880
(Next Episode)

213
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,220
Huh? Hear me out.

214
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,520
I said no! Just leave already!

215
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,340
We received a report. We're here to investigate.

216
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,560
You file the complaint, right?

217
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,800
That's not it.

218
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,730
(Just proceed with the protocol.)

219
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,440
(The one who left without a trace)

220
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,890
(was you.)

221
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,370
Oh, the student?

222
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,560
(He suddenly checked out)

223
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,170
(and moved away.)

224
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,720
(Why do you ask?)

225
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,250
(Did you two have a fight?)
