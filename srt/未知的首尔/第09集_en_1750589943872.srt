DATA PROCESSING ROOM

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,880
What are you waiting for? Scan it.

4
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,930
Pardon?
Scan your fingerprint.

5
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,010
Ah, my finger's like this, so I can't.

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,810
Hurry up and scan it.

7
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,480
What? Did you hurt your finger too?

8
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,230
Or…

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,900
is there another reason why you can't?

10
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,040

YU MI-RAE
VERIFIED

13
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,720
Verified.

14
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,940
The only lesson I learned
from battling my childhood illness…

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,480
is that there are some fights in life
you just can't win.

16
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,570
Where are you going?

17
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,030
Dusonbong Peak.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,450
I also know…

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,540
that you always gain something
at the end of a fight.

20
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,760
But I didn't have the strength
to keep fighting until I won.

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,090
You failed by just three points?
You'll definitely pass next time, Mi-rae.

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,140
I didn't pass either.

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,180
I made it to the second round
last time, though.

24
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,310
I had to make a quick decision
between a fight I could win…

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
PUBLIC CORPORATIONS

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,440
…and a fight I could not win.
Mi-rae.

27
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,980
What are you doing? Let's go.

28
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,690
Maybe that's why…

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,820
I was so concerned about Su-yeon,
who was fighting for what was right…

30
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,870
KIM SU-YEON

31
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,990
…unlike me.

32
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,700
Ms. Kim Su-yeon said…

33
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,250
She lit up a small light

34
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,620
that I didn't even know
existed inside of me.

35
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,170
That light led me…

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,380
It's all true.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,260
…to jump into a fight
I would've normally walked away from.

38
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,640
Exhausted from fighting a hopeless fight,

39
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,390
I grabbed hold
of the finger Mi-ji extended,

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,850
and I ran away.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,770
And then…

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,020
Is staying here an option, by any chance?

43
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,400
…I unexpectedly found
another light in the place I had run to.

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,650
Someone to take over?

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,360
I think he's going to the States

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,650
to start working again or something.

47
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,370
I felt ashamed
that I had tried to rely on that light,

48
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,620
so I ran away again.

49
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,830
Excuse me.

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,330
I went back to the place
I had run away from.

EPISODE 9
BACK AGAIN, ONCE MORE

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,460
STRAWBERRY FARM

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,890
How would you like your hair?

54
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,220
I want hair extensions.

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,980
You didn't tell me you were coming.

56
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,900
You didn't answer my calls.

57
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,990
What's going on?
Well…

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,660
This is…

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,420
My name is Kim Tae-i,
a coworker of Ms. Yu.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,480
You brought someone from work here?
Have you lost your mind?

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,310
I had no choice. It wasn't something
we could talk about outside.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,860
Hey, why would you be talking
to someone from work about--

63
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,900
He's Kim Su-yeon's younger brother.

64
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,450
What?
You know, your senior coworker.

65
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,870
Tae-i is the younger brother
of that coworker who blew the whistle.

66
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,620
Why is Su-yeon's brother…

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,290
I thought that SY stood for Sang-yeong,

68
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,580
but it was Su-yeon.

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,250
He said he joined the company
to collect evidence for his sister.

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,210
He mentioned a guarantee or something.

71
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,550
Anyway, he's done collecting evidence,
so he said you need to make a decision.

72
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,720
About what?
Reporting the company.

73
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,550
You need to tell the world
what those jerks have been doing!

74
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,310
Why would I do that?
What?

75
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,140
Because…
Why are you dragging me into this?

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,730
Tell him to do that.

77
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,400
Tae-i said he can't do it
because he's not someone on the inside.

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,770
You're the one who saw
what happened to her from the start,

79
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,480
and you're the only one who testified.

80
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,980
He said only you can do this.

81
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,990
Why do I have to fight?

82
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,450
Hey.

83
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,240
Don't you think this is unfair?

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,080
The bad guys didn't even get punished,

85
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,620
while the person who spoke up
was bullied and then driven out.

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,750
You two are doing this
because you don't know better,

87
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,330
but this is a fight we can't win.

88
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,130
You won't know if you'll win or lose--

89
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,420
I already fought, and I lost.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,710
I learned the hard way

91
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,840
that I'll be the only one suffering
if I fight them.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,470
You want me to go through that again?
Why should I?

93
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,220
You said you're going to quit anyway.

94
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,850
But before you do,

95
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,230
you could at least teach
the people who bullied you a lesson.

96
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,690
Who said I'm quitting?

97
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,650
I said I'd think about it.
You're not quitting?

98
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,230
You're going to keep working there?

99
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,610
If you're staying,
then more reason to fight.

100
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,900
You're gonna go back to staring
at walls and wasting away?

101
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,700
Why do you keep running away
when you did nothing wrong?

102
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,870
So what about you, Mi-ji?
What?

103
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,790
Do you have some plan
to get your life together now?

104
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,750
Mi-rae.

105
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,420
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

106
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,800
Stop butting into my life
and focus on your own.

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,920
We're done pretending to be each other.

108
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,840
Fine.

109
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,930
Do whatever you want with your life.

110
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,780
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE
BUT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU

111
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,160
I heard…

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,620
that Su-yeon trained you.

113
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,170
I'm the one who trained Su-yeon.

114
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,050
I look forward to working with you.

115
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,100
Right…

116
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,350
Why'd you even bother…

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,810
BACK FROM PATERNITY LEAVE

118
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,360
Why not? She's part of the team.

119
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,530
Gosh.

120
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,030
Here you go.

121
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,240
Here's your latte,
and here's your Americano.

122
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,160
Oh, I…
I already had a cup earlier.

123
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,010
CHECK FOR ERRORS
SUBMIT THE EDITED FILE BY SUNDAY

124
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,850
These people are unbelievable.

125
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,350
You can't do this all by yourself.

126
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,190
Just leave it. I'll do it.

127
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,190
I'll help you.

128
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,480
That's what senior coworkers are for.

129
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,190
That's what senior coworkers are for.

130
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,150
Do the same
for your junior coworker in the future.

131
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,530
What?

132
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,410
Did I sound like an old geezer?

133
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,740
No.

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,290
Thank you.

135
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,330
Let's wrap this up quickly
and head home.

136
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,880
You really don't have to take me home.

137
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,340
Come on. We're headed
the same way, so hop in.

138
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,800
We worked late together,
so let me give you a ride.

139
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,400
PARK MI-RAE

140
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,240
My daughter's name is Mi-rae too.

141
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,070
I was pleasantly surprised
when I learned you two had the same name.

142
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,700
When I was on paternity leave,
I wanted to come to work so badly.

143
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,210
But now that I'm back in the office,
I miss my daughter so much.

144
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,340
Sir…

145
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,260
Here.

146
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,810
What's this?

147
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,100
A gift voucher for gas?

148
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,270
Gosh, it's okay. You don't have to.

149
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,730
Please take it.

150
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,940
I feel bad that you're always helping me
and giving me a ride.

151
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,820
Gosh…

152
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,070
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

153
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,740
I wasn't there
when you really needed help.

154
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,920
Okay, then…

155
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,670
When you buy your coffee in the morning,

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,550
bring one for me too, okay?

157
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,130
Okay.

158
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,890
MI-RAE! I LOVE YOU!

159
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,750
Hey.

160
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,710
Mi-ji.

161
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,770
Ma'am.

162
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,440
What brings you here at this hour?

163
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,700
I wanted to say goodbye
before going to work.

164
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,540
I'm dropping out of the new HQ project.

165
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,750
What?

166
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,370
Are you backing out because of me?
Because I said I'm not selling?

167
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,000
Gosh, of course not.

168
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,710
I just… Hold on.

169
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,090
You decided not to sell the restaurant?

170
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,920
I see. I'm really glad to hear that.

171
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,590
They're the ones in a hurry, not you.

172
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,260
Just take your time deciding.

173
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,310
Are you saying that
because you're not part of it now?

174
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,060
Who cares?
I'm out, so I can say whatever I want.

175
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,940
Gosh, that feels so good.

176
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,940
Why are you here to say goodbye, though?

177
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,280
Are you going somewhere far away?

178
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,490
No, it's not like that.

179
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,160
It just won't be easy for me
to come see you anymore.

180
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,540
So I wanted to say goodbye one last time.

181
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,170
You're kind of special to me.

182
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,970
I know I'm not
that special to you, though.

183
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,050
But looking back,

184
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,680
I realized
that ever since I came to Seoul,

185
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,850
you were the only person
who accepted me for who I am,

186
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,020
regardless of my job
or educational background.

187
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,740
To be honest, it's been a really long time
since I got to know someone new.

188
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,780
We may not be friends,

189
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,950
but you're kind of special to me.

190
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,550
Have you…

191
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,470
heard of an adult guardianship?

192
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,680
A guardianship?

193
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,520
I've never told you this before.

194
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,850
But I have a son.

195
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,020
You have a son?

196
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,070
He's been living in a facility
for a while now.

197
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,070
Because he's not of sound mind.

198
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,000
I need someone to look after him
if anything happens to me.

199
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm sure you've noticed,

200
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,670
but I have no one around me
to ask for help.

201
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,550
If you're up for it,

202
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,380
I'll give you a bit of money
for the trouble,

203
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,260
so please think about it.

204
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,020
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

205
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm sorry about yesterday.

206
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,860
I didn't know you had family coming.

207
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,580
Ms. Yu, can we talk for a moment?

208
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,910
Ms. Yu, you're not busy
right now, are you?

209
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,960
Come with me for a second.

210
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,130
May I go now?

211
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,920
Yes, you may go.

212
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,110
What's going on?

213
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,980
You said she was Mi-rae's twin,
but the prints match.

214
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,190
They matched?

215
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,580
Ms. Yu.

216
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,120
Can we talk?

217
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,330
No, I--

218
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,790
It won't take long.

219
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,130
There's something
I didn't tell you yesterday.

220
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,550
A few years ago,

221
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,550
my sister called me out of the blue.

222
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,390
She started talking about her company,
which I didn't know much about.

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,350
Re-do it.

224
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,100
She said she was doing work
that wasn't her responsibility,

225
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,940
but her bosses kept making
unreasonable demands.

226
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,940
She was told to pressure
a third-party evaluator

227
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,030
into giving favorable results
for a specific company.

228
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,110
And so she…

229
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,610
She blew the whistle.

230
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,030
Let's skip what we both know.

231
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,290
Over the past three years,

232
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,920
among the payment guarantees
provided by KFMC to midsize companies,

233
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,590
the Planning Strategy Team
oversaw 20 cases,

234
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,590
and 60% of them were focused
on a single company.

235
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,180
Sixty percent.

236
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,470
Can you believe it?

237
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,890
The company recently chosen
as the contractor for the new HQ

238
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,640
is that same company,
which is headed by our new CEO's relative.

239
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,400
The one that my sister supposedly gave
preferential treatment to "voluntarily."

240
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,360
Sihan Construction.

241
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,570
There's obviously something going on.

242
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,030
But no one's doing anything about it.

243
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,570
Someone has to raise the issue.

244
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,330
And that someone is me?

245
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,620
You already said all this yesterday.

246
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,790
You didn't hear about it from me, though.

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,420
You showed up late.

248
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,590
You did seem strange lately.

249
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,390
The way you were acting recently
was so different from how you usually are.

250
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,150
I never would have imagined
that you had a twin.

251
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,310
So…

252
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,400
are you going to blackmail me?

253
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,150
The company would likely
be more intrigued by the younger brother

254
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,700
collecting company secrets
to avenge his sister

255
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,240
than by baseless rumors
about twins switching lives.

256
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,290
But you're not going to tell the company.

257
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,620
I don't plan on telling them either.

258
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,130
If the evidence is that solid,

259
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,170
then you can make a move yourself.

260
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,920
As you just said,

261
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,050
if I get involved,

262
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,050
everyone will focus more

263
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,390
on the younger brother seeking revenge
than on the real issue.

264
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,390
You're the only one
who can do this, Ms. Yu.

265
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,640
Why me, of all people?

266
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,310
You know how things are at work
for me right now.

267
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,440
You're the only one who testified.

268
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,230
The Planning Strategy Team?

269
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,570
They all saw it,
but they turned a blind eye.

270
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,440
They can't do anything
even if they wanted to

271
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,910
because everything they said
would become a lie.

272
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,660
This is a chance to prove
that you were right.

273
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,490
I don't want to prove anything.

274
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,710
I know it must have been hard
for you all this time, but…

275
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,710
No.

276
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,130
You don't know.

277
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,920
Do you know why those people bullied you?

278
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,760
They did that to hide their wrongdoing.

279
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,720
We should expose them
and have them face the consequences.

280
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,970
Don't you resent them for what they did?

281
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,430
I'm saying this
because I've been through it.

282
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,100
No matter how clear the evidence is,
it's useless if the company covers it up.

283
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,110
It's a fight we can never win.
We may lose, but…

284
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,360
But it's not right
to keep letting those guys win.

285
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,200
I don't care if we win or lose.
I don't want to fight anymore.

286
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,780
That's enough.

287
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,490
I'm sure Su-yeon doesn't want
her brother getting hurt either.

288
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,250
Why did you help my sister, then?

289
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,630
You didn't help her just so she could win.

290
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,090
You did it
because it was the right thing to do.

291
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,170
You're not like those cowards!

292
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,810
You're really amazing, Mi-rae.

293
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,650
On behalf of all the cowards,

294
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,400
I want to apologize to you.

295
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,200
You're a very brave person, Mi-rae.

296
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,750
I'm brave?

297
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm not.

298
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,890
I don't even have the courage
to be a coward.

299
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,310
Yes.

300
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,480
It was the right thing to do.

301
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,520
But…

302
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,520
if I had known…

303
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,190
that doing the right thing
would make things this hard…

304
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,950
then I never would've done it.

305
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,250
Why did I step forward?

306
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm nothing.

307
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,170
I should've just stayed out of it.

308
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,640
I keep thinking about it

309
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,260
and regretting it.

310
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,390
And I betray Su-yeon every night.

311
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,940
That's why…

312
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,320
with each passing day,

313
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,410
I hate myself more and more.

314
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,280
No, Director Yoon.

315
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,030
The offer is very tempting,
and I'm grateful.

316
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,870
But I still have quite a bit
to take care of here.

317
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,130
I'll decide within the week.

318
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,250
Yes, I'll contact you. Okay.

319
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,520
CALLS
DIRECTOR YOON

320
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,100
BUSINESS PARTNER

321
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,570
Where did my business partner go?

322
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,230
She left a while ago.

323
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,650
She left?

324
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,700
I told her you were looking
for your replacement,

325
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,990
and she bolted,
afraid that she'd get stuck with the farm.

326
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,580
Why did you tell her that?

327
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,120
I told you it wasn't confirmed yet.

328
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,840
The person you are trying to reach

329
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,380
has their phone turned off. Please--

330
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,800
I NEED TALK TO YOU IN PERSON

331
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,090
You said you needed to
tell me something. Why can't I reach you?

332
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,300
Did something happen?

333
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,720
BUSINESS PARTNER

334
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,560
I'll be in Seoul for a while.
I'll get in touch when I'm back.

335
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,190
She's in Seoul right now?

336
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,150
This should be good enough, right?

337
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,400
Who are you texting?

338
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,610
The strawberry farm owner
we met that time.

339
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,200
We'll be working together from now on,
so I should keep in touch with him.

340
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,540
What will you two be doing?

341
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,420
Farm work.

342
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,960
I'll be taking over
from Mi-rae once I'm back.

343
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,590
I should get going now.

344
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,180
Go where?

345
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,430
Duson-ri.

346
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,680
I should go back since Mi-rae is here now.

347
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,350
Why?
What do you mean?

348
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm done filling in for her,
so I should go and take back my place.

349
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,320
Now that you're done filling in for her,
it's no longer about whose place is where.

350
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,690
You can just stay wherever you want.

351
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,700
That is true, but…

352
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,660
I have nowhere to stay in Seoul,

353
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,580
and I can't stay at Mi-rae's
since we fought yesterday.

354
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Then stay here.

355
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,330
What?

356
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,670
If you're going back
because you have nowhere to stay,

357
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,210
then sleep here.

358
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,010
But we…

359
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,930
Can… we…

360
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,390
do…

361
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,350
that?

362
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,930
Why not?

363
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,310
Don't confuse the toothpaste
with the cleansing foam.

364
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,690
There are more towels here,
so use them.

365
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,060
Okay.

366
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,860
What? You don't want to shower?

367
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,820
Of course, I should shower.

368
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,820
I should, for the sake of hygiene.

369
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm going to shower.

370
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,740
Okay, then.

371
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,490
Shower.

372
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,040
Thanks.

373
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,750
I'm just sleeping over.
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

374
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,920
Just think of this place as a motel.
Wait. No!

375
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,340
Don't do that.

376
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes?

377
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,630
I'll leave some clothes by the door.

378
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,590
My gosh, thank you.
The service here is great!

379
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,470
Stop overreacting. Seriously.

380
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,490
Are you going somewhere?

381
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,700
What? No.

382
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,330
Are you done washing up?
Yes.

383
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,620
Should I sleep here?

384
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,750
No, you sleep in my bed.
I'll sleep here.

385
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,460
You said you have
an interview tomorrow, though.

386
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,630
You should sleep comfortably in your bed.

387
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,420
Then whoever gets sleepy first
can take the bed.

388
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Okay.

389
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,970
Your hair is still wet.

390
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,430
These are hair extensions,
so they get tangled without conditioner.

391
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,560
I'll just let it air dry.

392
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,600
That's right.
Your hair was a bit shorter before.

393
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,690
Yes.

394
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,860
May I take a look?
Sure.

395
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,910
This is so interesting.
So that's how they're attached.

396
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,330
Yes… I'm going to remove them all soon.

397
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,250
It's been a while
since I've had long hair.

398
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,420
It doesn't suit me, right?

399
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,130
You look pretty.

400
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,010
Your old hairstyle was pretty too.

401
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
It looked pretty even when it was shorter.

402
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,510
Hold on…

403
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,600
What are you thinking right now?

404
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,270
What am I thinking?

405
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,980
What do you mean?

406
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,020
Never mind.

407
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,690
Forget it. I'm sorry.

408
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,290
Why?

409
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,420
What are you thinking about?

410
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,590
What? I…

411
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,510
There's so much going through my mind
that I don't know where to begin.

412
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,840
Tell me everything.

413
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,050
Well… Am I being too clumsy?

414
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,970
Do I seem pathetic, doing this
when I've got nothing going for me?

415
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,100
I don't know how long
I'm supposed to hold my breath for.

416
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,650
And have I turned you off
and ruined the mood by saying all this?

417
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,690
Why am I even thinking
about this right now?

418
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,650
I must seriously have a problem.

419
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,410
I can't stop talking.

420
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,530
I wish I could be as relaxed as you are.

421
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,700
Mi-ji.

422
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,080
Should I tell you what I was thinking?

423
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,750
"Is she only staying

424
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,170
because I asked her to,
not because she wants to?"

425
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,220
"What's the latest we can leave
to catch the last bus to Duson-ri?"

426
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,800
"When would be the best time
to set up the bedding for her?"

427
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,760
"Should I sit on the couch or the floor?"

428
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,640
"If I wear short sleeves,

429
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,440
my scars will show,
so should I wear something on top?"

430
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,520
I put this on and took it off three times.

431
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,150
Jeez…

432
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,700
You're an idiot.

433
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,580
None of that bothers me at all.

434
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,430
You don't bother me, either.

435
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,930
No matter what you're thinking…

436
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,940
Regardless of whether
you can stop talking or not…

437
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,960
Did you see this?

438
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,460
What is this? Wow.
Is this for real?

439
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,960
If this is true, it'll be chaos.

440
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,340
It will be really disastrous.

441
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,720
Hey, Ms. Yu. Did you do it?

442
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,680
Pardon?

443
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,520
Did you upload that post
on the anonymous company forum?

444
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,360
What are you talking about?

445
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,320
Yes, sir. I just saw it.

446
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,070
Yes, sir.

447
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,290
WELCOME, MS. YU MI-RAE

SIHAN CONSTRUCTION
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

450
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,550
SIHAN CONSTRUCTION BECOMES
CONTRACTOR FOR KFMC'S NEW HQ

451
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,960
POST DELETED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR

452
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,060
How could you let an employee
post something like this on your watch?

453
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,390
I'm sorry, sir.

454
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,070
But we deleted the post right away,
and it was posted anonymously.

455
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,860
So in terms of credibility--
That's not the issue!

456
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,030
People will remember Sihan Construction,
thanks to this post!

457
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,620
What if the media catches wind of it
before we break ground on the new HQ?

458
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,500
I'll make sure that doesn't happen, sir.

459
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,210
We need to start construction
before this causes more talk.

460
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,750
How is the land acquisition going?

461
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,250
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lee.

462
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,090
You're sure that we'll be able
to buy Rosa Restaurant, right?

463
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,430
You can never guarantee anything 100%.

464
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,350
I'm doing my best to increase
our chances, so don't worry.

465
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,060
We don't have time for such…

466
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,020
I'll give you a month.

467
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,310
If we can't buy it by then,
we won't wait anymore.

468
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,030
What will you do then?

469
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,820
The company will use another law firm
for everything, not just this case.

470
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,240
You know how much our company
pays Wongeun every year, right?

471
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,120
Do you have the power to do that
as a director?

472
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,080
This isn't coming from me.

473
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,670
Our CEO ordered this.

474
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,210
I'm not threatening you right now.
I'm begging you for your help.

475
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,010
You make the impossible happen.

476
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,300
The fate of our new HQ is in your hands.

477
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,470
A month.

478
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,470
This means I need to make a risky move.

479
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,310
Will you be okay with that?

480
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,950
Why did you make that post?

481
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,820
You said you wanted no part in this,

482
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,740
so I made a move by myself.

483
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,290
So you thought making
an anonymous post was the best move?

484
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,080
It was deleted within a day.

485
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,000
Did you really think
you could fight the company like that?

486
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,760
Stop this before you get sued.

487
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,050
It has nothing to do with you.

488
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,510
It has nothing to do with me?

489
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,600
Haven't you noticed
that people think I wrote that post?

490
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,770
This is why I said I didn't want to fight.

491
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,440
People say, "We're in it together,"
but I still get blamed for everything.

492
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,190
It's not like you wrote the post yourself.

493
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,820
I'll be the one getting sued, so…

494
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
That…

495
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,530
doesn't matter to people.

496
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,870
Even if you get sued,
people will still suspect me

497
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,500
because they already think
I'm capable of doing that.

498
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,460
No one cares…

499
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,880
Sir!

500
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,300
Hey, Mi-rae. Over here.

501
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,510
No one cares about the truth.

502
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,760
Say hello.

503
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,220
This is my favorite
junior coworker from my team.

504
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,390
She's our ace.

505
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,680
Nice to meet you.

506
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,930
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

508
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,730
I was going to call a driver,

509
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,030
but I guess I was too drunk
and called you instead.

510
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,200
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,370
Why don't you hop in my car
since you're here anyway?

512
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,370
I'll just drive.

513
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,830
You?

514
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,590
I'm a good driver. I'll drive you home.

515
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,090
Okay. Let's go.

516
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,440
Sir, you should put on your seatbelt.

517
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,320
Sir?

518
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,790
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep…

519
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,330
What are you doing?

520
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,170
I thought you liked me too.

521
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,960
Pardon?

522
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,550
Wait, Mi-rae. I mean, Ms. Yu.

523
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,220
Wait. Stop.

524
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,890
I…

525
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,110
I admire you as a senior coworker.
I don't see you in that way.

526
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,190
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

527
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,150
I'm drunk, so I'm not thinking straight.

528
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,990
Damn it.

529
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,530
I must've lost my mind.

530
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,370
Just hit me once.

531
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,460
Yes, you know what?

532
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,420
Just hit me until you feel better.

533
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,630
Sir, please don't do this.

534
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,750
No, I…

535
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
What…

536
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,300
What should I do for you to forgive me?

537
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,340
I'll do whatever you want.

538
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,600
Let's…

539
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,600
Let's just pretend this never happened.

540
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,480
What?

541
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,980
I said,

542
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,320
let's just pretend this never happened.

543
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,370
Are you… sure about that?

544
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,870
I don't want things to get weird
between us over this.

545
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,960
I just want us

546
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,210
to be good coworkers
like we have been until now.

547
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,550
Yes, right.

548
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,720
I understand. Let's do that.

549
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,050
Thank you. Thank you so much.

550
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
Thanks.

551
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,480
Ms.…

552
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,790
Ms. Yu.

553
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,170
Thank you, but please stop doing this.

554
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,050
I don't feel comfortable.

555
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,460
Pardon?

556
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,230
Sir, what is wrong with you?

557
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,560
Why are you acting like this?

558
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,270
I want to ask you that.

559
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,860
I think I'm acting
appropriately right now.

560
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,690
If you keep acting like this…

561
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,910
then people will think I'm being weird.

562
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,280
If this is because of what happened,

563
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:41,330
we agreed to forget about it
and carry on as usual.

564
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,080
Ms. Yu.

565
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm a married man.

566
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,670
People are watching us.
Please don't cross the line.

567
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,300
I'd rather not meet privately
like this anymore, either.

568
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,030
Am I your first customer today?

569
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,540
That's right. You don't serve solo diners.

570
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,540
So…

571
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,750
Did you give it some thought?

572
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,260
If you don't feel comfortable
speaking one-on-one,

573
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,720
shall I ask Ho-su to come?

574
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,050
Why have you come back?

575
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,800
I told you I have no intention of selling.

576
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,850
I wanted to give you one last chance.

577
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,680
You're going to sell it anyway.
If you do it voluntarily,

578
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,810
then everyone will be happy.

579
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,270
Are you saying
you'll take it from me if I refuse?

580
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,530
That's what thugs do.

581
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,780
I will create circumstances…

582
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,330
that will force you to sell.

583
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,420
I will uncover secrets you want to hide,

584
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,460
expose them,

585
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,090
and determine whether you have
the right to the restaurant.

586
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,970
Gosh.

587
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,970
Let's stop before it gets that far.

588
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,180
That way, you can keep protecting
the things you've always protected.

589
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,980
Things like… your secret

590
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,480
or your son
at the Seonham Mental Nursing Home.

591
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,110
How did you find out about that?

592
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,530
Who knows?

593
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,450
Maybe there are many people around you
who are helping me.

594
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,250
A guardianship?

595
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,620
Here.

596
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,710
So…

597
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,430
I'll give you until tomorrow
to think about it.

598
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,270
Why are you so nervous?
It's not a formal interview.

599
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,190
You were recommended, right?

600
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,400
I don't know. I just have a bad feeling.

601
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,110
Should I have just said no?

602
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,990
I didn't think
you had moments like this too.

603
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,450
Let me.

604
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,090
You look decent now.

605
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,260
It's more crooked now.

606
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,060
Are you going to see Ms. Ro-sa today?

607
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,690
Yes, I should.

608
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,980
I'm supposed to give her
an answer by today.

609
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,650
What did you decide to do?

610
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,190
Are you going to tell her the truth?
Yes.

611
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,110
What if she gets really mad, though?

612
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,280
What if she calls the company

613
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,910
and reports me to the police,
and I end up in jail?

614
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,700
And I--
Don't go that far.

615
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,500
Don't be so worried.
Remember what I said.

616
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,630
There must be a reason

617
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,010
why she asked you for that favor
but couldn't ask me.

618
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,800
And you're telling her the truth
because you want to help her.

619
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:29,140
She let the lie
I told Ji-yun slide before,

620
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,600
so since I'm doing this to help,
she'll forgive me, right?

621
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,070
Your honesty is your best weapon, Mi-ji.

622
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,740
Right.

623
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,200
How do I look?

624
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,950
You look like…

625
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,330
someone who failed the interview already.

626
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,080
Hey, stop being so scared.

627
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,460
If they don't hire you, it's their loss.

628
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,130
Even if you don't get the job,
don't cry until you see me.

629
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,340
How many times are you going to tell me
that I'm going to fail?

630
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,590
Jeez. I'm trying to cheer you up.

631
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,300
Ho-su, you've got this!

632
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,260
You can do it! Go for it!

633
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,770
Yes.

634
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,400
I'm Bae Gi-cheol. Please have a seat.

635
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,960
I'm here, ma'am.

636
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,180
I…

637
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,270
I've thought about
the guardianship you mentioned.

638
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,060
But…

639
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,440
I want to be honest with you
about something first.

640
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,700
Go ahead.

641
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm…

642
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,280
not Yu Mi-rae.

643
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,330
What?

644
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm her twin.

645
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,630
Something happened,
so I was pretending to be her.

646
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,420
So what happened to the girl
who was here before?

647
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,260
That…

648
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,390
was me.

649
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,310
It was me all along,
from the first day I met you.

650
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,350
So?

651
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,070
Is that it?
You don't have anything else to tell me?

652
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,230
Pardon?

653
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,530
What…

654
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,650
Go.

655
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,660
Don't ever come back here again.

656
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,080
Ma'am, are you mad?

657
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,420
I just wanted to help…

658
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,590
Why help when there's nothing more
to dig up?

659
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,130
Did that lawyer tell you to do that?

660
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,010
Lawyer?

661
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,800
Which lawyer?

662
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,930
You're really gonna keep
acting clueless?

663
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,890
How would the lawyer have found out
where my son is, if it weren't for you?

664
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,980
Ma'am, it wasn't me.
I never mentioned that to anyone.

665
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,230
Then who did?

666
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,770
You're the only one I trusted
and mentioned it to.

667
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,490
Ma'am…

668
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,530
I'm such an idiot.

669
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,450
Even after going through it
all those years…

670
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,330
I had no one else to turn to,
so I trusted you…

671
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,460
You should go now.

672
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,670
Let's stop all these lies here and now.

673
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,050
Ma'am.

674
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,970
I swear I haven't lied
about anything else.

675
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,310
I meant everything I said and did
every time I saw you…

676
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,350
Ma'am.

677
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,110
I don't know you.

678
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,860
I don't even know who you are!

679
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,360
Get out right now!

680
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,400
Mi-ji, I think I did well.

681
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,900
What do you mean?
The interview.

682
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,360
I think I got the job. I'm having lunch
with the executives tomorrow.

683
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,660
Really?

684
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,950
See? I told you that you'd do well.

685
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
You're right. I was worried for nothing.

686
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,080
What about you? Did you tell her?

687
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,000
Of course, I did.

688
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,790
Really? What did she say?

689
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,840
She was very surprised,

690
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,010
but it turned out fine.

691
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,550
I'm glad.

692
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,060
We were both worried about today,
but things worked out for both of us.

693
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:22,640
When do you apply for guardianship?
Before you go to court--

694
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,850
Hey, that's not important right now.

695
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,690
You're employed again!

696
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,400
Let's have a party.

697
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,900
It's not even confirmed yet, though.
Let's celebrate tomorrow.

698
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,030
No, let's party today.

699
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,780
What do we need first for the party?

700
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,570
Let's buy a cake first.

701
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,620
We should get party poppers
and balloons too.

702
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,790
And party hats too.

703
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,210
I thought it was strange that she agreed
to back out of the project so easily.

704
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,840
I told you that Mi-rae
would cause problems.

705
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,680
But we don't know who made that post yet.

706
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,340
What other employee
would write a post like that?

707
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,470
We should've nipped it in the bud.

708
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,890
We put it off,
and now it's coming back to haunt us.

709
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,190
Hey.

710
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:09,060
Get rid of Mi-rae.

711
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,690
Pardon? But…

712
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,940
How--
You know how to handle her.

713
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,160
We've got to act now.
We don't have time to just sit around.

714
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,580
If this gets any messier…

715
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,580
won't you be in trouble too?

716
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,520
This is the evidence
I've collected until now.

717
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,770
Why are you giving this to me?
I told you that I'm staying out of this.

718
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,150
Just throw it away, then.

719
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,030
It's useless unless you use it, anyway.

720
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,420
Why do you keep running away
when you've done nothing wrong?

721
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,590
I hadn't intended
to run away from the start.

722
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,630
I actually tried to just hang in there,

723
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,720
clinging to that faint belief
that at least I was in the right.

724
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,610
Ms. Yu?

725
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,780
I used to work here.

726
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,620
You thought I wouldn't hear about
what you've been up to at the office?

727
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,120
How dare you seduce a married man!

728
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,830
Honey, what are you doing? Please stop.

729
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,710
Let go of me. You keep being too soft.

730
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,000
That's why she's not getting the message!

731
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,790
Come on. Please stop.

732
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,960
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

733

HUMAN RESOURCES

734
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,720
We're a public corporation,
so we have a responsibility

735
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,560
to maintain professional conduct.

736
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,810
We'll let this incident slide
with a warning.

737
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,100
But please stop making--

738
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,150
Why am I getting punished
when I'm the victim?

739
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,570
For assault cases, the parties
should settle the issue among themselves.

740
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,950
For a case like this,

741
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,410
you can't claim
that you're an innocent victim…

742
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,120
What kind of case is this?

743
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,160
Pardon?

744
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,750
It wasn't an affair.

745
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,760
It was sexual harassment.

746
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,720
I'm the victim.

747
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,600
Then why didn't you report it
as soon as the incident occurred?

748
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,610
At that moment,
a seed of doubt was planted inside me.

749
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,650
Did I do something wrong?

750
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,780
At the time,
I didn't want to cause any trouble.

751
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,320
We spoke to members of your team.

752
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,910
They said that even after the incident,
you kept buying him coffee.

753
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,790
After an incident like that,
it's not normal to keep buying coffee

754
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,620
for someone who harassed you, is it?

755
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,420
At the time, I thought it was best
to maintain our relationship as usual--

756
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,670
But I heard

757
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,130
that you two worked overtime together
all the time,

758
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,050
and you carpooled too.

759
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,600
People also said
that you were more friendly with him

760
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,140
than with the others.

761
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,770
Are you sure you didn't have
a personal relationship with him?

762
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,860
Did I really do nothing wrong?

763
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
Did I give him the wrong idea?

764
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,030
Did I really have no part
in how this all went down?

765
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,240
Jeez, don't worry.
It's nothing to worry about.

766
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,580
Just relax.

767
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,620
She's just making a fool of herself.

768
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,750
Okay?

769
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,550
Am I…

770
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,260
really the victim?

771
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,470
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE

772
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,560
I'm sorry I'm late.

773
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,480
When the onslaught of questions started…

774
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,280
I had to run away.

775
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,540
I couldn't answer a single question.

776
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,210
Because more than anyone else,

777
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,920
I was doubting myself.

778
00:50:53,930 --> 00:51:00,770
CONGRATS ON GETTING A JOB

779
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,370
So what about you, Mi-ji?

780
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,250
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

781
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,420
I don't know you.
I don't even know who you are!

782
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,540
Ho-su.

783
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,710
Yes, Mi-ji. What is it?

784
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,920
Your hair…

785
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,800
I think I should go.

786
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,220
Go where? At this hour?

787
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,100
Duson-ri.

788
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,100
Why the rush?
Did something happen back home?

789
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,060
Nothing's happened.

790
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,980
I just don't have a reason
to stay in Seoul anymore.

791
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,150
Of course you do.

792
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,240
You need to register as a guardian and…

793
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,870
I lied.

794
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,910
I couldn't even talk to her
about the guardianship.

795
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,500
Ms. Ro-sa…

796
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,130
got very…

797
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,840
very angry.

798
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,180
It was probably because she was shocked.

799
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,820
She said she doesn't know who I am now.

800
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,400
I don't know what I was expecting.

801
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,580
It all started with a lie
in the first place.

802
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,410
This all belongs to Mi-rae.

803
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,290
It was only possible because I was Mi-rae.

804
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,670
I want to go back to where I belong.

805
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,970
I have no reason to stay here anymore.

806
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,060
Mi-ji.

807
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,150
You belong where you choose to stay.

808
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,860
We can come up with a reason together.

809
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,570
I'd love to do that, but…

810
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:02,870
But for some reason,
I feel like I don't belong here.

811
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,370
I feel like there's no place
for me in Seoul.

812
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,470
Then let's go.

813
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,260
Let's leave as soon as the sun comes up.

814
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,720
Get some sleep until then, okay?

815
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,220
Mi-ji.

816
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,140
What are you doing?
Why aren't you going in?

817
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,600
Is the gate locked?

818
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,520
No, I just…

819
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,770
Are you okay?

820
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,900
Did you fight with your mom?

821
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,490
Gosh, I'm no match for her.
I can't even put up a fight.

822
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,910
I was just staring at the gate,

823
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,370
wondering if it's always looked
this worn-out.

824
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,950
Oh, that? If you repaint it,
it will look brand new in no time.

825
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:35,250
I guess I should repaint it sometime.
I'm going to keep living here anyway.

826
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,710
Well, have a good day.

827
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,220
Okay, see you.

828
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,340
Bye.

829
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,730
Mom, I'm home.

830
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,940
You're back early.
I thought you'd stay longer.

831
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,690
No, I just came back.

832
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,070
Mi-rae is at work anyway,
so what would I do by myself in Seoul?

833
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,950
Wow, there were so many people
that everything felt chaotic.

834
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,490
Why? Did something happen?

835
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,330
No, what would happen to me?

836
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,590
Did you go somewhere?

837
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:31,890
Seoul.

838
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,400
I'm feeling a little carsick
because I've not taken the bus in so long.

839
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,860
Mom, I'm going to go sleep.
Don't wake me up.

840
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,570
STRAWBERRY FARM

841
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,710
I'm sorry. I was in Seoul.
What should I start with?

842
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,340
I guess Mi-rae left?

843
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,510
Can I work instead of her?

844
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,730
Of course, you can. I hired you
because of your resume, Ms. Seoul.

845
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,520
My name is Mi-ji.

846
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,070
Mi-ji.

847
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,660
Mi-ji. The name's finally
starting to stick.

848
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,240
Let's go, Mi-ji.

849
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:11,450
Okay.

850
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,250
Ok-hui.

851
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,380
I heard you got hurt. Are you okay?

852
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:27,970
Did the kids switch places?

853
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,140
What?

854
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,810
Was Mi-ji actually Mi-rae this whole time?

855
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,220
Did you know about it?

856
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,560
You did.
Ok-hui.

857
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,110
Jeez, forget it. Whatever.

858
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,440
Ok-hui.

859
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,150
Don't…

860
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,610
Don't scold the kids too much.

861
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,030
Mom.

862
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,490
What do you all take me for?

863
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,460
Ok-hui…

864
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,550
Ok-hui…

865
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,770
I guess Mi-rae

866
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,190
has decided what to do,
considering she's back in Seoul.

867
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,480
I don't know. That's her business.

868
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,020
She doesn't tell me every single detail.

869
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,740
How does it feel to be back?

870
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:30,660
Crappy.

871
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,160
Then why did you return?
You could've just stayed in Seoul.

872
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,700
Because I felt even crappier
staying there.

873
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,830
I didn't do anything wrong,

874
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,500
but I felt uneasy for some reason.
I felt like I needed to come back.

875
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,300
I guess I'm just destined
to just live here forever.

876
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,800
Don't you feel a little like this?

877
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,090
Like a runaway teenager
bouncing around friends' places.

878
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,760
I know that feeling too.

879
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,850
I don't think you have any idea.

880
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,480
You studied abroad and lived in Seoul.

881
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,110
It doesn't matter
if it's the States or Seoul.

882
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,360
Anyone who's away from a place
they care about feels that way.

883
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,740
Do you still feel that way?

884
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,610
Not anymore.

885
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,080
The reason I cared
about the place is gone now.

886
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,450
Don't get the wrong idea.
I mean my grandfather, not Mi-rae.

887
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,790
I think this is a matter of the heart,
not destiny.

888
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,750
That's why I don't open up
to people very easily.

889
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,090
Because I might feel like
I've run away again.

890
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,050
A&A has been focusing

891
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,770
on barrier-free access
for the past few years.

892
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,600
And we're continuing to make improvements
to the office building.

893
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,400
Among major law firms,
we're also the most actively involved

894
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,230
in public interest cases.

895
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:52,530
You seem like the perfect person

896
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,570
to represent our company's goals, Mr. Lee.

897
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,620
Me?

898
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,290
Gosh, you two need to stop already.

899
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:06,080
I told them why you ended up
leaving Wongeun,

900
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,250
and I guess they were very impressed.

901
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,960
Of course we were.

902
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,470
You defied orders
and left Wongeun of all places

903
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:16,050
to protect the weaker party
and not the client. My gosh.

904
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,140
It's just like a movie.

905
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,560
Oh, that's--

906
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,100
Plus, I heard the senior lawyer
you clashed with was Mr. Lee Chung-gu.

907
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,980
I've heard so many rumors about him.

908
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,480
What's he actually like?

909
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,030
I tend to be a bit oblivious
when it comes to rumors--

910
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:36,320
He's famous for handling sensitive cases
while using his disability as a shield.

911
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,330
How can he be so cruel to the weak
when he's vulnerable too?

912
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,410
It's worse because
he actually knows what it's like.

913
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,540
He makes us look good in comparison,
so it works for us.

914
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:48,040
A senior and a junior lawyer,
both with disabilities,

915
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,050
making completely opposite choices.

916
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,260
It's a great story.

917
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,640
Sir.

918
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,520
Mr. Lee isn't like that.

919
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,230
He may use cheap methods sometimes,

920
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,980
but he doesn't use
his disability as a shield.

921
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:11,940
He's not like that.

922
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,400
What those two were saying earlier--
And…

923
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,120
I'm not like that, either.

924
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,580
I didn't step up to protect the weak.

925
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,870
I just couldn't ignore
a client's wrongdoing, so if anything,

926
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,750
I'm not fit to be a lawyer.

927
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,210
Justice, disability…

928
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,930
If you're looking for someone
to represent things like that,

929
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,430
then I don't think
I'm the right person for the job.

930
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:51,020
Then, uh,

931
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:54,360
if you don't represent things
like the vulnerable or justice,

932
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,240
what do you think you represent?

933
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:02,490
I don't think
I've ever really thought about that.

934
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,000
Then think about it,

935
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:08,830
and if you want to work for us, call me.

936
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,800
Come to think of it, it seems like
we were the ones being interviewed.

937
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:16,630
I should get going.

938
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,100
I'm back.

939
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,270
Mom, what are you doing here?

940
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,780
Come here. We need to talk.

941
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:40,030
I'm tired from work. Let's talk later.

942
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,070
Mi-ji.

943
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,240
Are you going to keep treating me
like an idiot?

944
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,580
I know you switched places with Mi-rae.

945
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,830
Were you ever going to tell me?

946
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,710
How could you be so brazen?

947
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,130
What were you thinking,
doing something like that?

948
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:00,130
It's nothing serious.
We just switched places briefly for fun.

949
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,300
For fun?

950
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,930
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

951
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,600
Why did you switch places?

952
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,020
Did something happen to Mi-rae?

953
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,560
Nothing happened to Mi-rae.

954
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,520
And I didn't ruin her life. Happy now?

955
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,520
Mi-rae is not the type
to go along with your plans

956
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,280
when everything is okay.

957
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:22,240
What happened?
Jeez, it's all over now!

958
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,200
You couldn't even tell us apart,
so why make such a big deal about it now?

959
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,540
What did you say?

960
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,620
Just because I can't tell you two apart,
it's okay to treat me like an idiot?

961
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,590
Do you even consider me family?

962
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:38,170
Your bedridden grandma knew about this,
so why didn't I?

963
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,340
Do you two even see me as your mom?

964
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,470
So what about you?
Do you see me as your daughter?

965
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:46,010
What?

966
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,140
You're always going on and on
about Mi-rae.

967
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,060
I'm your daughter too.

968
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,890
Why don't you ask if I'm okay?

969
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,360
You were nice to me at the hospital,
thinking I was Mi-rae.

970
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,400
Do you hate me now that you know it's me?

971
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,730
What in the world are you talking about?

972
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,440
You two are both my daughters--

973
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,150
We're not the same to you!

974
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,280
You can't even tell us apart.

975
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,580
What's so different
between me and Mi-rae?

976
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,950
I don't even expect to be treated
the same way.

977
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,710
Why can't you just look at me once
for a change?

978
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,370
Hey.

979
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,420
Do you think my mom was interested in me
when I was growing up?

980
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,380
This is all I learned growing up,
so what do you expect me to do?

981
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:24,760
How am I supposed to be a good mom?

982
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,260
I just can't figure it out,
so why don't you tell me?

983
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,060
You're a daughter too.

984
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,480
You may not know how to be a good mom,

985
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,730
but you must understand how I feel.

986
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,110
You kept waiting for Grandma
to notice you too.

987
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:41,400
What do you want me to do?

988
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,780
Should I stare at you all day?
Is that what you want?

989
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,320
Forget it. I can't talk to you
about anything.

990
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,780
Hey, what do you mean by that?

991
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:54,160
I'm asking because I don't know.
I'll do what you want me to do.

992
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,040
I said, forget it!

993
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,340
This is why I didn't want
to come back here.

994
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,670
Then you should've stayed in Seoul!
Why did you come back?

995
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,550
Because you're here by yourself.

996
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:08,850
If I leave, then you'll be left all alone
and you'll have to care for Grandma alone.

997
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,270
Hey.

998
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:15,980
Why would you worry about that?

999
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,940
I don't know. Jeez.
It's not like we have a good relationship…

1000
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,940
I'm annoyed too.

1001
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,820
I want to live freely too,
without thinking about things like that.

1002
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,780
But I can't help it, so I have no choice.

1003
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,080
Mi-ji, no one ever asked you
to worry about those things.

1004
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,660
I may not seem like a mom to you,

1005
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,670
but why would you worry
about things like that?

1006
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,880
Then who will?

1007
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,750
Who else would worry about that
besides me?

1008
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,220
I might suck at everything else,

1009
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,430
but being here is something I can do.

1010
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,510
Of course you can do other things.

1011
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,350
I told you countless times that
you're capable of everything and anything.

1012
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:59,020
Why do you keep trying to live like me?

1013
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,110
Why do you keep making me
a poor excuse for a mom?

1014
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,360
Why are you crying?

1015
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,240
You should go.

1016
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,950
Go wherever you want
and do whatever you want.

1017
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,000
I'll stay here,
so you should leave, Mi-ji.

1018
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,210
Why would you worry about those things

1019
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,090
and break my heart like this?

1020
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,760
Don't cry.

1021
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:31,680
Mom, I'm sorry. Please stop crying.

1022
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,640
I'm sorry.

1023
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,600
Mom.
Hurry up and go.

1024
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,140
I told you to go.

1025
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:45,190
Go wherever you want.
Don't worry about things here and just go.

1026
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,040
What is it this time?

1027
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:04,000
How many times do I--
Do you want to go see my sister?

1028
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,420
Right now.

1029
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,060
Are we…

1030
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,060
really going to go see Su-yeon right now?

1031
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:24,940
There's something
I didn't tell you earlier.

1032
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:28,190
You probably won't be able
to see my sister.

1033
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,320
Pardon?

1034
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,660
She's in her room.

1035
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:36,200
It's been about half a year
since she last left it.

1036
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,330
But she'll probably hear everything
you say if you talk outside her door.

1037
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,180
Su-yeon.

1038
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,300
Ms. Yu is here.

1039
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,970
I'll let you two talk.

1040
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,700
Su-yeon, it's me.

1041
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,660
Mi-rae.

1042
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,870
You came early.

1043
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,500
It's your first day of work.

1044
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,590
I'm Kim Su-yeon.

1045
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,920
Why are you here like this?

1046
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:37,260
You left, so you should've forgotten
about everything and moved on.

1047
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,350
Is it because you resent what happened?

1048
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,230
I came to tell you
that I can't help you this time.

1049
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,820
You know how it is.

1050
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,240
This is a fight we'll never win.

1051
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:57,620
To be honest, I don't even know
why I need to fight.

1052
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,330
I can barely take care of myself,

1053
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:03,500
so I'm not interested in punishing anyone.

1054
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,790
I'm scared and tired.

1055
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,500
You left because
you were scared and tired too.

1056
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,880
I get it, so…

1057
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,890
So please try to understand me
just this once.

1058
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,810
Your brother worked very hard.

1059
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,150
But I'm ruining everything.

1060
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,610
I'm sorry.

1061
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,410
No.

1062
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,750
Su-yeon?

1063
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,960
I'm the one who ruined everything.

1064
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:54,800
I'm so sorry, Mi-rae.

1065
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,090
Why…

1066
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,300
are you apologizing?

1067
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,970
I ran away by myself…

1068
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,480
even though I knew
how hard things would be for you.

1069
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,770
I'm just as bad as those people.

1070
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,990
That's why I'm so ashamed,

1071
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,660
and I'm sorry.

1072
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,280
But why are you sorry?

1073
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:24,330
Why are you apologizing?

1074
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,250
The people who should feel sorry
aren't even apologizing.

1075
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,170
No.

1076
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,630
It was my fault.

1077
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:33,210
What was your fault?

1078
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,670
You're a victim.

1079
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,220
You did the right thing,
so why are you here like this?

1080
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,760
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you here like this?

1081
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,540
You're back late.

1082
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,260
I thought you might have moved,

1083
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,720
but I guess you still live here.

1084
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:28,100
Why have you come all this way to see me?

1085
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,230
You kept avoiding me, so I had no choice.

1086
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,070
Can you spare me a few minutes?

1087
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:39,690
Say what you need to here.

1088
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm sorry, but please move
to the Childal branch for a bit.

1089
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,000
The Childal branch? Why should I?

1090
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,420
What do you mean why?

1091
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,460
You pulled out of the new HQ project
without any warning.

1092
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,340
It's a high-profile project,

1093
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,640
so I guess the higher-ups
can't just let this slide.

1094
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,850
What are you talking about?
You said you'd take care of it.

1095
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,600
You said if I backed out of the project,

1096
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,810
you'd make sure I wouldn't be penalized.

1097
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,850
You told me this yourself.

1098
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,190
But if you're not backing out…

1099
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,940
PROMISED NO REPERCUSSIONS
REFER TO RECORDING

1100
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,400
…because you're worried
about the repercussions,

1101
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,030
then I can take care of that for you.

1102
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:27,280
That was before the post was made.

1103
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,700
You acted like you were going
to let this go quietly.

1104
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,500
Why did you make a post like that?

1105
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,250
I didn't upload that post.

1106
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:37,960
Ms. Yu. Do you expect me to believe that?

1107
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:43,590
Even if you didn't write it,
the higher-ups already think you did.

1108
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:47,720
And honestly, the company was ready
to take legal action,

1109
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,640
but I talked them out of it,
on the condition that you go to Childal.

1110
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,520
I'm not the reason
the company can't take legal action.

1111
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:58,610
You didn't learn
from what happened to Su-yeon.

1112
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,860
Don't pick a fight you can't win.
You're only going to get hurt.

1113
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,700
Move to the Childal branch for now.

1114
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,370
I'll help you come back
once things quiet down.

1115
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,660
By that time, I'll be a team leader.

1116
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,160
And I'll have the power
to transfer you back to HQ.

1117
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,500
This is just like last time.

1118
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,460
What?

1119
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,170
The day you tried to kiss me,

1120
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:25,590
you got down on your knees and begged me
to forgive you when we were alone.

1121
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,260
Then you suddenly acted like
you were the victim in front of others.

1122
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:32,060
Do you really think
I'll fall for the same trick twice?

1123
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,560
Let go! Let go of it!

1124
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:40,520
Let go! Give me that!

1125
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,980
DON'T SAVE

1126
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:43,990
Hey!

1127
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,150
Damn it.

1128
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,660
Mi-rae, why are you so naive?

1129
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,910
Let go! Give me that!

1130
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,740
Damn it.

1131
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,750
You can do this crap all you want,
but no one will believe you.

1132
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:59,790
This isn't like some kind
of truth-telling game.

1133
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,090
It's basically a battle of reputations.

1134
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,210
Let go!
You still don't get it?

1135
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:08,880
No matter what you try to do,
no one is on your side.

1136
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:13,720
No matter what I do, you'll end up
getting blamed for everything.

1137
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,650
No, I did nothing wrong.

1138
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,730
Damn it.

1139
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,690
Hey!

1140
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,400
You jerk!

1141
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,900
Darn it.

1142
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,950
You bastard! Because of you, I…

1143
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,240
Mi-ji! Hey, Mi-ji!
Because of you, Mi-rae…

1144
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,790
You jerk!

1145
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,660
Damn it.

1146
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,710
Hey, are you okay? Wait.

1147
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:43,590
Why, you little!
Hey…

1148
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,250
Hey, hit him a little more.

1149
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:47,760
You really…

1150
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:49,760
No one's coming.

1151
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,090
PEOPLE'S POLICE

1152
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,970
Hey, Ho-su.

1153
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,900
I'm the perpetrator's lawyer.
Is it okay if I sit in?

1154
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,360
Does having a lawyer show up
change the fact that you assaulted me?

1155
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,230
I refuse to settle.

1156
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,320
Mr. Park Sang-yeong was previously accused

1157
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,280
of sexual harassment against
Ms. Yu Mi-rae within their company.

1158
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:16,410
That same individual came to her house,
grabbed her wrist, and threatened her.

1159
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,660
So shouldn't this
be considered a rescue instead?

1160
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,960
Hey, look.

1161
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,130
I believe Ms. Yu Mi-ji's action
was a lawful and justified act.

1162
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:34,550
Is it true that you were accused?

1163
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,560
No, that was just a false accusation.

1164
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,890
She accused an innocent person
of sexual harassment,

1165
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,900
but she couldn't even follow through
and dropped it midway.

1166
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,900
Is that true?

1167
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,980
This time, I won't drop the charges.

1168
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:53,070
I want to press charges against Mr. Park
for sexual harassment and defamation.

1169
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,450
The void left behind by my self-doubt

1170
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,870
began to fill with courage.

1171
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,840
Why does it feel
like I've run away from home again?

1172
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:24,310
With that courage,
I take a heavy step forward…

1173
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,560
SEOUL

1174
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,230
…into a fear I've already faced,

1175
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,530
one I know all too well.

1176
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:32,650
1 HOUR 58 MINUTES
119 KM

1177
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:40,700
Yes, ma'am. Did you decide what to do?

1178
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,790
No matter what future awaits us
at the end of the fight…

1179
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,290
I have no intention of selling.

1180
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,510
So that's what you decided to do.

1181
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:56,180
Okay, I understand.
Well, we'll meet again somewhere else.

1182
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,480
Yes, Reporter Im.

1183
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,650
I'm going to send an email right now.

1184
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,860
It's a bit urgent,
so release an article tomorrow.

1185
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,660
THE WOMAN WHO STOLE HER FRIEND'S LIFE

1186
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,120
Thank you for always helping me out.

1187
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:23,910
Yes.

1188
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,500

YU MI-RAE

1192
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:03,950
I'll do it my way, at my own pace.

1193
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,250
I don't want to lose a fight
I already lost once.

1194
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,580
Did she just scoff?

1195
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:09,920
The restaurant,
assets, and her only son.

1196
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
They should all go back
to the rightful owner.

1197
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,300
Are you in there?

1198
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,170
It's a violation of privacy, and illegal.

1199
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,170
It's not the time
to worry about legal stuff.

1200
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,890
Not everyone can ask for help.

1201
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,010
I finally found you.

1202
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,430
Se-jin?

1203
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:25,890
So this is your usual look.

1204
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:28,730
Let's go. We don't have much time.

1205
