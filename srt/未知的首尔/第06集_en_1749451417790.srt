OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,590
I…

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,390
I liked you too.

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,150
Ho-su.

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,280
I liked you too!

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,240
You're drunk.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,030
Let's pretend you didn't say any of that.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,160
Hey, Ho-su.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,620
Why are you always so difficult?

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,960
What's going on?

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,710
Just say it.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,090
Who do you like right now?

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,130
I also…

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,640
EPISODE 6
THE SILENT, EVER-PRESENT FOOL

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,900
What the…

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,940
Why am I here?

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,780
<i>Mi-rae.</i>

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,120
I liked you too! Darn it. Yes, you!

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
Holy crap!

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,910
Duson-- The person you like…
Hey, just say it.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,870
I also…

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,460
Oh, darn it.

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,630
Why did I say those things as Mi-rae?

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,090
But wait.

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,090
"Also"?

26
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,550
Did he mean, "I also like you"?

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,010
Jeez. What happened after that?

28
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,680
Come on, think!

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,480
You're up.

30
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,650
Yes.

31
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,200
How did I end up sleeping here last night?

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,700
You should've sent me home if I was drunk.

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,330
Do you really think I didn't try to?

34
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,290
Anyway, sorry for the trouble.

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,790
My bad.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,250
Here, take this.

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,430
I never thought I'd buy a hangover cure
first thing in the morning.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,350
<i>Why is he being low-key nice?</i>

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,600
<i>Is it because I said I liked him?</i>

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,220
- What?
- Hey.

41
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,230
Let me ask you something.

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,270
Did I do anything stupid last night?

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,360
Like what?

44
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,980
When I get drunk,

45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,940
I say things I don't mean,
but I sound like I do.

46
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,240
It's gotten me into trouble before.

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,070
So I just wanted to check.

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,950
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,910
You said a lot last night.

50
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,880
You know, things like outrageous lies

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,710
or maybe a love confession.

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,000
If I said I liked you or whatever,

53
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,680
please don't take it the wrong way
and make things awkward between us.

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,260
So you remember up to that part.

55
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,140
Even if I said more after that,

56
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,770
I didn't mean any of it.

57
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,600
I don't see you that way at all.

58
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,150
You're just another person to me.
Maybe an old classmate at best.

59
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,150
That's it.

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,320
Looks like
you don't remember much after that.

61
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,650
Don't worry.

62
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,820
What?

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,280
I've already sorted things out,
so you don't need to worry.

64
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,250
Well, then… Okay.

65
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,750
<i>Wait. Sorted what out exactly?</i>

66
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,250
<i>What else happened after that?</i>

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,380
What now?

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,300
I think we need to clear up some things.

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,970
Even if it's a little embarrassing,
we should both know what happened.

70
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,680
That way, if there's anything to explain,
we can talk it out.

71
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,230
- Mi-rae.
- What?

72
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,980
Shouldn't you go to work?

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,280
My phone.

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,900
Hey, what time is it?
Don't you have a clock?

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,610
Holy crap!

76
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,830
EASY MORNING
HANGOVER CURE

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,630
Yu Mi-rae isn't here yet?

78
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,130
She went to the restroom.

79
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,090
She's never around when you need her.

80
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,300
I need some copies made.

81
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,680
I can do it.

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,680
The copying, I mean.

83
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,230
Oh, sure.

84
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,570
I don't have my phone and wallet.

85
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,490
- Where are they?
- I got them. Here.

86
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,070
Thank you.

87
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,200
Oh! My bag.

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,240
- I'll drop it off for you later.
- What?

89
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,200
- Or else they'll know you're late.
- Really?

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,200
- Okay, then.
- I called a cab. It's waiting downstairs.

91
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,580
What? Thanks. I'll get going.

92
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,480
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Mr. Shin.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,730
Making your bathroom break public?

94
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,900
- Mind your manners.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,990
Mr. Shin.

96
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,150
Sorry you had to do
someone else's work.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,030
- If you're ready, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,990
Where are you going?

99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,540
You're coming too.

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,950
Me? Where…

101
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,080
Me?

102
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,340
We've secured
about 62% of the land so far.

103
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,090
The key challenge
is still the Aesim Shopping Center,

104
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,630
so we're in talks
with the merchants' association…

105
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,930
Yes?

106
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,640
What about the buildings next to it?
How many have we secured?

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,640
Well, as of now…

108
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,110
So far we've secured…

109
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,400
It's 79%.

110
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,570
It's 79%.

111
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,110
I think securing the sites next to it
will be even more challenging.

112
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,870
What kind of residential units
are in the other buildings?

113
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,740
The residential units…

114
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,660
The area is 83.6% general residential,
all with less than seven floors…

115
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,830
I'm not asking for percentages.

116
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,750
What kind of housing are they?

117
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,460
Right.

118
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,880
- Well…
- There are two single-family homes,

119
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,720
and the rest are multi-unit buildings.

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,510
That's what I thought.

121
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,350
I figured there'd be multi-unit buildings.

122
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,600
I see.

123
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,140
Multiple owners means more conflict
and more chances of a holdout.

124
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,520
Will everyone be moved out
before construction?

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
We're preparing a meeting with
the residents to keep things on schedule.

126
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,070
If a meeting were enough,
I wouldn't be worried.

127
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,950
Do you really think it's possible?

128
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,990
If it's the multi-unit buildings
you're worried about,

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,870
I already checked.
They're in the process of moving out.

130
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,790
You went there just to check?

131
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,670
Not really.

132
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,420
I'm in charge of a restaurant nearby,

133
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,130
so I just happened to notice.

134
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,630
A restaurant?

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,760
Wait, are you in charge
of Rosa Restaurant?

136
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,350
Yes.

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,640
What's your name?

138
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,060
Oh, I'm…

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,350
I'm Yu Mi-rae, a Senior Specialist.

140
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,820
NEW HQ PROJECT REPORT

141
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,870
<i>So all that work</i>
<i>wasn't for nothing after all.</i>

142
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,590
Jeez…

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,560
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE
BUT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU - SY

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,690
Ta-da.

145
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,440
Is this from overseas?

146
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,980
"Sang-yeong Park."

147
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,030
Mr. Park sent it as a gift
before returning home.

148
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,530
- Wow.
- He must be coming back soon.

149
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,290
I bet he'll be back next month.

150
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,450
Look, they have our initials.

151
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,410
TO MI-JEONG, FROM SY

152
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,830
Oh my.

153
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,420
He really knows how to pick the best gift.

154
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,550
- Goodness.
- Wow.

155
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,960
Sang-yeong?

156
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,800
<i>Mr. Park, why are you doing this?</i>

157
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,380
<i>If you do this,</i>

158
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,090
<i>I'll look like the problem.</i>

159
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,560
<i>- If this is about before…</i>
<i>- Ms. Yu.</i>

160
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,560
<i>People are watching.</i>
<i>We should keep some boundaries.</i>

161
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,600
<i>And we shouldn't meet in private anymore.</i>

162
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,350
Why is she keeping
the door closed?

163
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,020
Mi-ji, why are you still in bed?
What about the farm?

164
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,360
I quit.

165
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
What?

166
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,740
Hey, did you quit
because of what I said before?

167
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,620
I just quit.

168
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,870
Let me sleep a bit longer.

169
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,880
Gyeong-gu's here with the delivery.
Aren't you coming out?

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,000
Later.

171
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,670
Ms. Kim, this <i>ramyeon </i>is on me.

172
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
- Hey, Gyeong-gu.
- Yes?

173
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,810
Is something up with her?

174
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,520
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

175
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,480
It's just that she's been down all day.
She even quit the farm.

176
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,020
- She quit the strawberry farm?
- Yes.

177
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,650
Wow, Mi-ji.

178
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,490
You really<i> are </i>loyal.

179
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,110
The strawberry farm guy and the jam?

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,950
I knew it all meant nothing.

181
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,200
You can be our assistant deputy manager.

182
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,290
Mi-ji!

183
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,870
What's with her?

184
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,630
Why don't you take her out
for some fresh air or something?

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,630
All right, I guess.

186
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,840
Just let her be for a while.

187
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,140
Man.

188
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,970
What are you doing,

189
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,140
stacking all this out here?

190
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,180
- Well…
- Yes?

191
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,810
It's annoying going back and forth
to the storage area.

192
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,690
You know that fine dining places
manage tasks down to the second, right?

193
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,400
You really find
creative ways to waste time.

194
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,820
Hurry and put them inside.

195
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,410
What if the typhoon floods the whole farm?

196
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,870
It's freezing. What typhoon?

197
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,450
What kind of farmer
doesn't check the weather?

198
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,870
A big typhoon is hitting
the central region this weekend.

199
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,670
You should check
if the embankment is okay,

200
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,790
otherwise this whole road
might end up underwater.

201
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,040
If it floods, it floods.

202
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,550
Don't talk nonsense.

203
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,510
Do it while I'm here.

204
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,550
We've got sand right here.

205
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,680
Just tell Mi-ji
to bring some extra sacks on her way.

206
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,020
She quit.

207
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,480
Quit… Mi-ji quit? Why?

208
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,480
Knowing you, I wondered
how she lasted that long.

209
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,030
Then go get the sacks yourself

210
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,280
- before I change my mind.
- It's fine.

211
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,110
We're the only farm on this side
of the river, so it doesn't matter.

212
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,070
Will you swim out of here when it floods?

213
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,040
If the bridge breaks,
you're stranded here, genius.

214
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,790
So what? Did the bridge
kill my grandfather?

215
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,880
So you're not fixing
the embankment today?

216
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,180
SOBER UP!
SPARKLING GRAPEFRUIT

217
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,890
<i>Just say it.</i>

218
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,850
Who do you like right now?

219
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,810
I also…

220
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,980
Yes?

221
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,900
I also want to say it.

222
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,400
But not now. Not when you're like this.

223
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,450
- What?
- Wait.

224
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,830
Let's talk when you sober up.

225
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,950
What?

226
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,940
Why did I close my eyes?

227
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,000
PARK JI-YUN

228
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,420
Hey, Ji-yun.

229
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,010
What? Slow down.

230
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,310
Didn't you say
it was urgent and important?

231
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,390
It is urgent and important.

232
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
I can't take photos
and do everything myself.

233
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,770
- You could've come with someone else.
- Hey.

234
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,110
Focus. You might break the heart.

235
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
You're right.

236
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,070
It didn't have to be you.

237
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,580
But I told you last time

238
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,740
that I'd make sure
you have a good time.

239
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,670
This shot came out great.
Do you want to see it?

240
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,800
I guess you really like this job.

241
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Me?

242
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,300
That was random. Why?

243
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,260
It just seems like you enjoy it.

244
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,060
Well, I do like
new and interesting things.

245
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,480
The job itself isn't bad.

246
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,270
But it feels like
it's just about chasing trends.

247
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,900
I'm thinking about moving somewhere
with more long-term potential.

248
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,820
- Are you free tomorrow?
- I have plans in the afternoon.

249
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,830
Then let's grab lunch before that.

250
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,120
Sorry.

251
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,500
I just realized I have something
in the morning too.

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,080
Come on. Have lunch with me.

253
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,710
The place I want to go to
only takes reservations for two or more.

254
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,510
Go with your coworkers.

255
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,970
I don't even know much about food.

256
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,640
It's awkward with people from work.

257
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,720
Please?

258
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,770
Just lunch, then.

259
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,650
I really do have plans in the afternoon.

260
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,940
Hey, Ho-su.

261
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,570
What?

262
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,530
You're surprisingly easy to convince.

263
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,610
- That's not--
- Whatever. No take-backs.

264
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,660
We're meeting tomorrow, okay?

265
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,090
<i>I've got your bag.</i>
<i>I'll come by your office.</i>

266
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,380
Just say it.

267
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,550
I also…

268
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,930
I've already sorted things out,
so you don't need to worry.

269
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,600
What on earth could've happened
for him to say it's all sorted?

270
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,190
What did I do last night?

271
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,400
Come on, brain. Give me something!

272
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Mi-rae!

273
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,370
How come you two came together?

274
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,120
We were nearby--

275
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,250
We had dinner together,
and I tagged along to see you.

276
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,790
Here's your bag.

277
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,880
Right.

278
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,750
Being here brings back memories.

279
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,430
You don't need to borrow
my shoes today, right?

280
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,510
What shoes?

281
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,510
Interview day, remember?

282
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,220
Don't act like you don't know.

283
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,730
The shoes. Right.

284
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,360
Why is there always a line at that place?

285
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,820
AEWOL CROQUETTE

286
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,570
That place was only on Jeju.
I guess they opened one here.

287
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,820
Want to check it out?

288
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Now?

289
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,860
Weren't you going back to work?

290
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,870
It'll just be a quick stop.

291
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,950
Mi-rae, we'll get going.

292
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,450
- Okay.
- Let's go.

293
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,750
You're coming
to the hospital tomorrow, right?

294
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,250
Yes.

295
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,960
See you there.

296
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,300
All right. Bye.

297
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,260
What the heck, Ho-su?

298
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,350
Did you sort things out because of her?

299
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,100
HIGH-QUALITY STRAWBERRY
GROWING GUIDE DRAFT

300
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,570
DAILY FARM LOG

301
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,400
EMPTY TRASH

302
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,040
No. I can't let you go like this.

303
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,120
I should at least know why.

304
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,290
Don't dodge it with something vague
like "it's my problem."

305
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,880
Let me know what's wrong!

306
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,550
There are rumors.

307
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,970
People are getting
the wrong idea about us.

308
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,800
That's ridiculous…

309
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,470
Are you seriously quitting
because of that?

310
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,230
Because of stupid rumors
people are spreading for fun?

311
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,440
You can just deny it.

312
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,820
Wouldn't it look weirder
to quit over some rumors?

313
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,950
I'm getting rid of the reason
for the gossip.

314
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,740
People who get swayed by gossip

315
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,450
don't care about the truth anyway.

316
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,200
You're the one getting swayed
the most right now.

317
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,290
Those rumors are fake.

318
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,790
But those strawberries are real.

319
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,210
You're saying something fake
is more important than something real.

320
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Fine.

321
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,390
Thank you for everything.

322
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,550
Take care.

323
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,650
- Hey.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

324
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,490
Nothing much. Everything okay?

325
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,870
Just the usual.

326
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,830
Same old stuff at work.

327
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,040
How have you been, Mi-rae?

328
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,630
You know, I realized

329
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,420
I always talk about myself,
but I never ask how you're doing.

330
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,760
<i>What do you do besides visiting Grandma?</i>

331
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
I just…

332
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,930
worked at the strawberry farm.

333
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,220
That 200,000-won-a-day job?

334
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,140
No way. <i>You</i> worked on a farm?

335
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,390
<i>How was it?</i>

336
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,190
It's helped me to eat and sleep better.

337
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,820
And it stopped me from overthinking.

338
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,110
<i>That's good.</i>

339
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,820
Getting your body moving
helps clear your mind.

340
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,530
Hang in there until I come down.

341
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,200
<i>I'll take over when I get back.</i>

342
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,500
- I quit.
<i>- Why?</i>

343
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,460
I just started wondering what I was doing.

344
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,750
You're over there
dealing with my problems,

345
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,210
and I'm here running away from reality.

346
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,510
<i>So what if you are?</i>

347
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,300
It's not like I have it that bad.

348
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,600
The impact is different for you and me.

349
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,810
I'm fine.

350
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,430
I've been feeling anxious.

351
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,020
The fact that I'm worrying again
might mean I'm getting back to normal.

352
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,270
As for me,

353
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm only here until you're okay.

354
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,280
We can switch back anytime.

355
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,950
<i>But if you're only saying this</i>

356
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,910
because you're worried about me,

357
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,580
I can manage a bit longer.

358
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,160
But are you really okay?

359
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,210
It's just,

360
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,290
I don't think it matters where I am.

361
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm still the same.

362
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,840
You've been saying "just" a lot.
Something's fishy.

363
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,890
Are you sure you're okay to come back?
What about the resignation letter?

364
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,140
I'll write it.

365
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,520
Actually, let's end this next week.

366
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,150
What? Next week?

367
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,900
You want to switch next week?

368
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,200
Yes. I was thinking of going back
around then anyway.

369
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,780
We can switch sooner if you want.

370
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,160
No, it's fine. Let's do it next week.

371
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,080
Okay. Get some rest.

372
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,630
Next week?

373
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,010
There's nothing I can do as Mi-rae.

374
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,220
As for Ho-su,

375
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,970
I'll settle things for real
once I'm back to myself next week.

376
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,430
Whatever happens, happens.

377
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,520
First, I need to clean up the mess I made
before Mi-rae comes back.

378
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,810
DELETE TEXTS, HAIR APPOINTMENT
TALK TO TAE-I

379
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,900
What do I do with this one?

380
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,030
NEW HQ PROJECT

381
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,280
She'll be so mad at me
for not staying put.

382
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,790
What are you looking at?

383
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,670
Oh, it's nothing.

384
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,960
Wait.

385
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,170
How come you're not eating
at the cafeteria today?

386
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,880
No way.

387
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,180
You didn't follow me here, did you?

388
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,320
Hey, Tae-i.

389
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,490
The other day, you asked

390
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,200
if I knew Mr. Park was in charge
of the new HQ project when I took it on.

391
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,200
Why did you ask?

392
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,620
I didn't mean to accuse you or anything.

393
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,210
I was just worried.

394
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,040
About what?

395
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm just curious what others think.

396
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,210
I figured working with Mr. Park

397
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,050
might be uncomfortable for you.

398
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,680
But if you're okay with it,
then that's all that matters.

399
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,470
No need to avoid him
just because it's awkward.

400
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,060
So don't mind what I said.

401
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,560
Okay.

402
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,700
Who are you texting
that's making you smile?

403
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,000
Wait, are you seeing someone?

404
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,370
It's not like that.

405
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,800
It's the old classmate
from the triple blind date.

406
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,840
The lawyer from Wongeun?
The silent, cool guy?

407
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,470
What should we eat?

408
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,810
Is it true they're not renewing
Ji-yun's contract?

409
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,640
The team leader said
they're doing open recruitment.

410
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,900
That's kind of harsh.

411
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,570
Still, thanks to us,
she landed a lawyer boyfriend.

412
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,650
Maybe that's a silver lining.

413
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,490
Is she really seeing a lawyer? Wow.

414
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,410
Does he know she's on contract?

415
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,200
He does, actually.

416
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,240
We told him at the blind date,
before she arrived.

417
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,830
The elevator's here.

418
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,550
Aren't you going to take a photo?

419
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,970
Why did you come today?

420
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,010
Because I asked you to?

421
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,890
You said you felt awkward
coming with your coworkers.

422
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,390
So was it out of pity?

423
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,440
I thought I was teasing you,
but it was the other way around.

424
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,440
- What do you mean?
- You knew.

425
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,320
That I was on contract.

426
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,030
I bet you were laughing on the inside.

427
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,450
I didn't know you knew,

428
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,790
and I was out here
acting like I was some big shot.

429
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,460
Does that matter?

430
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,750
I knew you'd say that.

431
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,010
It probably doesn't seem important to you.

432
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,970
You don't care what other people think,
because you don't have to.

433
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,760
Maybe it's because
I'm not as successful as you,

434
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,520
but I can't ignore what others think.

435
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,230
Since no one really sees me for who I am,

436
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,560
I just go along
with what people want to see.

437
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,940
That's why I didn't mention it.

438
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,860
If anyone knew I was on contract,
would they even care to look at me?

439
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,700
You're unbelievable, though.

440
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,410
If you knew, you should've just told me.

441
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,120
Now I'm too embarrassed about lying
to ask you to meet up again.

442
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,750
I even boasted about
making sure you'd have a good time.

443
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,340
But at least you had fun
watching me, right?

444
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,430
Look.

445
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,060
I get what you're saying, but…

446
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,390
I never thought you lied.

447
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,610
I don't see why anyone
has to mention being on contract.

448
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,690
You love your job and work hard.

449
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,820
That's not a lie.

450
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,820
And I don't ignore what others think.

451
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
I'm just awkward.

452
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,080
It's not a choice.
I can't do things like you do.

453
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,590
That's why I didn't realize
how you would feel.

454
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,010
I didn't think you'd feel deceived
just because I didn't say anything.

455
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,930
If I hurt your feelings,

456
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,510
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,390
What are you, a fool?

458
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,020
Why are<i> you</i> apologizing?

459
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,150
The more I get to know you,
the stranger you seem.

460
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,070
Hey.

461
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,820
Photo first!

462
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,660
Did Mi-ji say anything to you?

463
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,370
What?

464
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,040
About what?

465
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,920
Anything.

466
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,670
She's been acting strange lately.

467
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,260
What if she stays holed up
in her room again?

468
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,020
Ask her to come and see you.
Say you miss her.

469
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,770
She won't say no to you.

470
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,980
Mi-ji…

471
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,190
wouldn't do that.

472
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,190
Gosh.

473
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,780
How do you know?

474
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,740
What if giving her space
only makes her worse?

475
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,870
She promised me.

476
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,330
Mi-ji won't do that anymore.

477
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,960
- She won't.
- Gosh.

478
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,760
We can never see eye to eye.

479
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,470
The owner of Rosa Restaurant
is hospitalized,

480
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,350
so we're waiting for her to recover
before scheduling another meeting.

481
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,890
If possible, I'd like to
speak with the owner alone.

482
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,850
That might be difficult.

483
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,770
She barely agreed to have a meeting.

484
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,110
Who's in charge of Rosa Restaurant?

485
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,780
That'd be me.

486
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,070
Come on.

487
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,900
You didn't convince her.

488
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,660
Who's doing the work?

489
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,200
She'll be off the project soon.

490
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,370
Why?

491
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,500
The previous person in charge
is coming back from overseas training.

492
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,000
And those two are not on good terms.

493
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,050
I'd like to meet the employee privately.

494
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,840
Right now.

495
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,230
How did you know
the whistleblower was my classmate?

496
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,910
Sorry to bother you.

497
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm Lee Chung-gu, the attorney
helping with the Rosa Restaurant case.

498
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,910
Hello, I'm Yu Mi-rae
from the Planning Strategy Team.

499
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,630
You must have met
Ms. Kim Ro-sa several times.

500
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,130
Have you gotten close?

501
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,630
I've seen her a lot, so yes,
compared to when I first met her.

502
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,220
How about Mr. Lee Ho-su?

503
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,680
Since he's her representative,
I'd imagine you'd see him even more.

504
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,560
If you're asking if we've gotten close,

505
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,560
we already knew each other
from high school.

506
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,350
Really? Was it a coincidence?

507
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,860
- Or did you introduce them?
- No.

508
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,150
Why would I go out of my way
to make things complicated?

509
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,820
They had their own ties.

510
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,990
I see.

511
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,320
You seem honest.
I feel like I can trust you.

512
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,250
About the new HQ project,
I heard you might step down

513
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,710
over some tension with someone.

514
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,790
If I took him out of the picture,
would you take the lead?

515
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,880
What do you mean?

516
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,420
Relax. Speak your mind.

517
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,090
I don't really know anything
about the office politics here.

518
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,970
All I need is to acquire the restaurant,

519
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,930
and I think you're
the perfect fit for this job.

520
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,440
CONFIDENTIAL

521
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,650
NEW HQ AND LRT LINE INTEGRATION PROJECT

522
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,240
They're building an LRT station
at the new HQ site?

523
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,250
Yes, you'll see the details there.

524
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,460
The location of Rosa Restaurant
is crucial.

525
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,250
Very few people know about this.

526
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,090
If this information gets out,
things could get messy.

527
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,590
Then why are you telling me…

528
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,260
Because you're in charge.

529
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,720
You should know the gravity of your work.

530
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,430
Obviously, this is confidential.

531
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,180
You can't tell anyone.
Not the owner, not your team,

532
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,810
and not your family.

533
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,690
And not your old classmate
you ran into by chance.

SEOUL SAEWON MEDICAL CENTER

536
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,120
He's not here yet?

537
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,660
Tell him we'll go on our own.

538
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,000
He said he already left.

539
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,000
Why is Ho-su taking so long?

540
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,720
I was only in the hospital
for a few days, and look at all this.

541
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,840
- Let me carry one.
- No way.

542
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,970
Come on. Stop fussing over me.

543
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,760
Seriously, no.

544
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,680
You still need to be careful.

545
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,930
Gosh.

546
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,980
And…

547
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,780
things have been hectic lately,

548
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,780
so I didn't get a chance to say this.

549
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,110
Thank you.

550
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,070
Pardon?

551
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,830
I said, "Thank you."

552
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,080
When I threw out my back that day,

553
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,710
I figured I'd have the worst luck,

554
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,880
and starve to death lying there.

555
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,260
No one was going to check on me,

556
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,090
so I thought about
biting my tongue to end it.

557
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,510
Then you showed up.

558
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,600
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have been so mean to you.

559
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,940
But how could I have known?

560
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,190
Anyway, you saved me.

561
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,240
Thank you.

562
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,370
There's no need to thank me.

563
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,790
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,290
Sorry for what?

565
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,540
Well…

566
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,880
I mean… Actually…

567
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,470
Sorry we're late.

568
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,510
Ms. Ro-sa, please get in.

569
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,220
Hello, ma'am.

570
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,270
Hey, Mi-rae.

571
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,480
Hey.

572
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,480
Why did you bring Ji-yun? It's awkward.

573
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,320
She offered to give
your great-aunt a ride. I couldn't say no.

574
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,990
How did you even…

575
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,030
Quiet.

576
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,740
What are you two whispering about?

577
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,200
We were talking

578
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,830
about where to put this
so it's easy to read.

579
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,920
Should I leave it here?
No, it's better to stick it up here.

580
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,460
POST-CHOLECYSTECTOMY PRECAUTIONS

581
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,840
Is this you when you were young?

582
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,760
You still look like your old self.

583
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,850
Of course I do.
I may have aged, but I'm still me.

584
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,190
"Ro-sa and Sang-wol."

585
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,320
So the "Sang-wol" in "The Sea of Sang-wol"
was a person?

586
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,860
Wait. Is she Sang-wol?

587
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,990
Is it okay to leave your friend alone?

588
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,120
- Shouldn't you go downstairs?
- I'll go check on her.

589
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,540
No, don't.

590
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,250
Let me. I'll go.

591
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,960
You can put this up.

592
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,880
I don't mind going.

593
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,010
Why are you taking so many pictures?

594
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,260
Because I love it here.

595
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,480
I've only seen retro-themed places,
but this place is real.

596
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,730
Where's Ho-su?

597
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,850
Upstairs. He'll be down soon.

598
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,650
You've been seeing him a lot.

599
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,190
What? Does it bother you?

600
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
No, I'm just saying you see him a lot.

601
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,950
What do you think of Ho-su?

602
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,130
Ho-su is just Ho-su. What do you mean?

603
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,880
Are you interested in him?

604
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,800
I want to give it a shot with him.

605
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,340
I wanted to check with you.

606
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,680
Do whatever you want.
Why do you care what I think?

607
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,180
You know,
we always wanted the same things.

608
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,690
College, jobs…

609
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,230
You always got

610
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,570
everything I desperately wished for.

611
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,700
I tried everything to get into KFMC,

612
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,240
but you got in half-heartedly
after quitting the civil service exam.

613
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,660
Would you have applied there
if I hadn't pushed you to?

614
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,370
Honestly?

615
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,170
You're right.

616
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,630
Anyway, you're doing well now,
so it all worked out.

617
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,340
I'm on contract.

618
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,510
It's about to end,
so I'll be unemployed soon.

619
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,890
And for some reason,

620
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,270
I just didn't want to tell you, Mi-rae.

621
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,480
I wanted to pretend
I was doing just as well.

622
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,730
It's all just insecurity, I guess.

623
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,150
So this time, I'm calling dibs.

624
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,780
I don't want to lose Ho-su too.

625
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,620
Why do you like Ho-su?

626
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,580
At first, he got my attention
because he's a lawyer.

627
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,170
But I don't know…

628
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,000
He seems so cold and indifferent,

629
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,840
but he's actually gentle,
tender-hearted, awkward,

630
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,970
and surprisingly…

631
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,890
kind of…

632
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,180
Foolish, right?

633
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,190
Yes, he is.

634
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,520
He's way too soft.

635
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,730
He's so mysterious.

636
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,570
That makes me want
to get to know him better.

637
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,780
And see what's going on inside him.

638
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,660
What?

639
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,620
Do I sound childish?

640
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,210
No. It sounds very mature.

641
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,540
What? Are you teasing me?

642
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,130
No.

643
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,510
I mean it.

644
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,550
I like how honest you are.

645
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,520
<i>That being said…</i>

646
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,730
You two go ahead.

647
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,230
I have to stop by somewhere.

648
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,030
Okay, Mi-rae.

649
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,280
Stay on the main roads.

650
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,240
Ho-su.

651
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,450
Okay.

652
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,090
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

653
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,550
<i>It's like I've lost</i>
<i>before the fight began.</i>

654
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,220
<i>We spent ten years out of sync.</i>

655
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,310
<i>Is our timing off again?</i>

656
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,480
<i>I just need one more week.</i>

657
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,610
<i>I never really</i>
<i>got to talk to him as myself.</i>

658
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,860
<i>But even if I go back to being me,</i>

659
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,650
<i>do I have a chance?</i>

660
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,700
<i>First loves belong in the past,</i>

661
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,750
<i>and I have nothing to be proud of.</i>

662
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,210
<i>It's just sad.</i>

663
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,800
<i>My feelings always go to waste</i>

664
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,300
<i>before they're ever heard.</i>

665
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,400
What do you mean
you want me to counsel Mi-ji?

666
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,900
That's nonsense.

667
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,020
Why not?

668
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,570
Don't you have a counseling certificate?

669
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,700
That's for kids. Mi-ji is…

670
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,700
Besides, young people these days
don't like people interfering.

671
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,200
Mi-ji is still a child inside.

672
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,540
Just think of her as a fifth grader
and talk to her, will you?

673
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,420
If you're so worried,
talk to her yourself.

674
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,420
I'm asking because I can't!

675
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,460
Why not?

676
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,050
You're her mom.

677
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,800
Some moms aren't as good as others.

678
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,470
What kind of mom
can't tell her own kids apart?

679
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,600
Come on.

680
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,270
Mi-ji and Mi-rae look exactly alike.

681
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,230
Anyone would be confused.

682
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,440
But I'm their mom.

683
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,780
I spent all their childhood working,
barely paying attention to them.

684
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,070
Trying to act like a mom now won't work.

685
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,490
After their dad died
and their grandma collapsed…

686
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,250
Mi-ji doesn't have anyone
she can really open up to.

687
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,590
Just let her know how much you care.

688
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,720
- Then it should be fine.
- I don't know.

689
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,590
I just can't do that with Mi-ji.

690
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,810
She reminds me so much of myself,
and I always say the wrong thing.

691
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,360
How long has Mi-ji been in her room for?

692
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Three days.

693
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,530
Are you kidding me?

694
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,780
Ok-hui!

695
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,530
I don't leave my room
for five days during the break.

696
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,910
You're so dramatic
for someone who doesn't care.

697
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,290
- Bun-hong.
- Get out of the way.

698
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,670
I'm not being dramatic.
I'm seriously worried!

699
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,130
Talk to me again
if she stays in there for a month.

700
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,510
And stop humble-bragging
about having daughters.

701
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm swamped as it is…

702
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,100
Are we done?

703
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
No!

704
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,840
<i>Please throw this junk away.</i>

705
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,170
I bought you that expensive chair
so you could get rid of this junk.

706
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,550
And those clothes!

707
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,350
So you ditched the Gore-Tex vest
and went back to that rag again?

708
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,550
Toss it already.

709
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,470
It doesn't have any holes.
How is it a rag?

710
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,020
Why don't you throw out
those worn-out sneakers?

711
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,770
These are intentionally distressed.

712
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,070
Man, it's so shabby
that I can't bear to look at it.

713
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,610
If you don't want to see it,
just go back to Seoul.

714
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,490
Why do you keep coming down here?

715
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,030
Just to throw away perfectly good stuff?

716
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,450
You didn't know?

717
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,960
My goal is to clear out everything you own
and replace it all with new stuff.

718
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,090
Or you can move to Seoul with me.
Let's see who wins.

719
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,760
Wow. This place is bigger than I thought.

720
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,520
Your grandfather ran all this by himself?

721
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,480
If it's too much to handle…

722
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,610
Did you lose something?

723
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,690
The LRT…

724
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,450
I think I left something on the LRT.

725
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,240
You can go.

726
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,040
Where could it be? It's not at home.

727
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,170
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

728
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,260
Hey, Seung-hyeon.

729
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,850
What?

730
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,720
The wedding?

731
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,270
- Is that this weekend?
<i>- Yes.</i>

732
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,600
If you're going, let's go together.
I'll pick you up.

733
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,020
<i>I can just take the bus.</i>

734
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,190
You haven't seen where it is, have you?

735
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,110
The venue's up on a hill,
so you'll need a car to get there.

736
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,290
Wait. Do you already have
someone to go with?

737
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,250
I just thought you might be going alone

738
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,420
<i>since Ji-yun is going with Ho-su.</i>

739
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,710
Ho-su is going with Ji-yun?

740
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,050
<i>Yes, didn't he tell you?</i>

741
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,970
No. I didn't even know he was going.

742
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,130
Really?

743
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,180
Maybe they wanted
some alone time.

744
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,350
<i>If you're okay with it, I can pick you up.</i>
<i>I'm heading that way anyway.</i>

745
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,220
It's so itchy.

746
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,810
Why is this…

747
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,930
It's too tight…

748
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,060
Can you…

749
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,850
JI-YUN

750
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,190
Jeez.

751
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,530
Hey, what's up?

752
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,030
<i>Didn't you lose something?</i>

753
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,070
What do you mean?

754
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,250
Do you have that LRT file?

755
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,500
Anything else?

756
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,470
Why don't you just give me
your door code while you're at it?

757
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,680
Door code? 36936--

758
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,100
No.

759
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,470
Why are you telling me
something you're not supposed to?

760
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,770
Have you told anyone else besides me?

761
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,640
No, just you.

762
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,730
If this gets out,
the lawyer said I could get sued.

763
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,900
Not "could." You 100% would.

764
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,190
If someone else heard this,
you'd be in serious trouble.

765
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,160
I know.

766
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,950
Shouldn't we tell Ms. Ro-sa about this?

767
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,540
I can't ask her to sell the building
while hiding something so important.

768
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,000
It's just wrong.

769
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,880
You work for KFMC, not her.

770
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,380
That's your job.

771
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,550
I didn't know about it before,
but now I do.

772
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,720
If I go through with it anyway,
it'd feel like I'm deceiving her.

773
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,760
What if she sells
and then regrets it later?

774
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,520
I get how you feel.
But you need to drop it.

775
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,360
You didn't say anything today,

776
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,990
and I didn't hear a thing.

777
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,490
But that doesn't make it go away…

778
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,490
Fine, then let's put it this way.

779
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,370
You told me, but I chose not to tell her.

780
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,330
But from this moment on, officially,

781
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,830
you have said nothing. Got it?

782
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,920
Nothing.

783
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,300
Fine.

784
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,020
YU MI-RAE
SENIOR SPECIALIST

785
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,650
About the LRT station.

786
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,860
Have you told anyone?

787
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,530
Me? Not at all.

788
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,700
Then why are you so nervous?

789
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,780
We're on the same team.

790
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,040
We are, right?

791
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,160
Of course.

792
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,960
On the same team.

793
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,420
So, I think we should start negotiating.

794
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,720
Can you set up a meeting next week
with Rosa Restaurant's representative?

795
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,890
Sure. Next week it is.

796
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,970
And there's something I wanted to ask you.

797
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,350
It's hard to match faces
since it's an old photo.

798
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,520
From what I've heard…

799
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,820
this is poet Kim Ro-sa. Is that right?

800
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,660
Is this you when you were young?

801
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,790
Wait. Is she Sang-wol?

802
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,920
SEPTEMBER 3, 1975

803
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,500
What? That's not her?

804
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,210
Jeez.

805
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,920
The photo is too old. I can't tell.

806
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,550
If that's Kim Ro-sa, the sociology major,
then it must be her.

807
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,760
I was just checking.

808
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,100
She looks so different
from her recent photos.

809
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,940
Well…

810
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,790
<i>That woman. I swear that was Sang-wol.</i>

811
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,830
<i>Did they have the same major?</i>

812
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,000
<i>But he said she was Kim Ro-sa, the poet…</i>

813
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,380
Ho-su is running a bit late.

814
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,220
- Have you finished writing?
- Yes, I'll put this up.

815
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,300
This is yours, right?

816
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,560
Did you take a look?

817
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,140
I did. I was wondering what it was.

818
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,100
I mean…

819
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,650
It's confidential.

820
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,740
Because of company policy…

821
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,200
How can you be so careless
with something like that?

822
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,320
Here.

823
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,280
What?

824
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,330
Is that…

825
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:17,500
all?

826
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,410
Aren't you going to say anything else?

827
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,870
Take better care of your stuff.

828
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,590
Did you write that we're closed
on weekends for now?

829
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,220
What? Yes.

830
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,260
CLOSED ON WEEKENDS
FOR THE TIME BEING

831
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,320
<i>I did. I was wondering what it was.</i>

832
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,360
Did you write that we're closed
on weekends for now?

833
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,070
I put a note on your door.

834
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,620
- You didn't see it?
- What note?

835
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,120
This is poet Kim Ro-sa. Is that right?

836
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,750
Wait. Is she Sang-wol?

837
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,420
What are you doing standing there?

838
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,760
Ho-su.

839
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,090
Yes, I know.

840
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,550
You know?

841
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,350
So she can't read?

842
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,310
It's not that she can't read at all.

843
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,350
I think she has dyslexia.

844
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,940
She can read and write
simple words, like names.

845
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,360
How did you…

846
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,650
When did you figure it out?

847
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,690
I just noticed over time.

848
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,490
That's probably why
she made me her representative.

849
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,240
Why?

850
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:42,160
Is it even possible
to go to HNU if you can't read?

851
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,670
There was someone like that
in my department too.

852
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,670
Dyslexia isn't an illness.
It's a condition.

853
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,710
It can definitely be improved.

854
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,960
Maybe some people do get better,

855
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,260
but she still can't read.

856
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,390
So what are you trying to say?

857
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,430
You think she faked her degree?

858
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,770
How are you so calm?

859
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,850
Doesn't this seem weird to you?

860
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,150
It does.

861
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:12,440
But so what? Are we supposed to dig up
her student records from 50 years ago?

862
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,610
For what?

863
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,530
It's not just about her degree.

864
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,950
She's a poet.

865
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,290
If she's hiding something…

866
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,000
People always have a reason
for hiding things.

867
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,130
And you need a reason to dig it up too.

868
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,790
So we just pretend we don't know?

869
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,340
Isn't it kind of shady to act that way?

870
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,760
We don't know everything, do we?

871
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,470
And if you don't know the full story,

872
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,520
it's better to keep quiet sometimes.

873
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,100
Are you telling me
to keep my mouth shut?

874
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,400
We all have that one question
we don't want to be asked.

875
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,860
Does choosing not to ask it
count as being deceitful?

876
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,910
But still…

877
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,450
Whatever. Let's just say
I'm the shady one.

878
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,950
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

879
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,330
- Bye.
- Hey, Ho-su.

880
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,670
When did he figure all that out?

881
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,180
He's impossible to read.

882
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,270
What are you doing?

883
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,280
Why weren't you answering your phone?

884
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,820
I had to make a scene just to see you!

885
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,110
Get in.

886
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,490
Where are we going?

887
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,160
Well,

888
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,120
it's urgent, so just get in.
I'll explain on the way.

889
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,420
We don't have time, okay? Hurry up.

890
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,090
Fine, I'm coming.

891
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,220
I'm coming.

892
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,480
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING

893
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,810
Traffic's pretty bad.

894
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,860
It's nice to spend
more time with you, though.

895
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,070
Dang, you really went all out today.

896
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,650
Trying to outshine the bride?

897
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,570
Oh, please.

898
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,120
Anyway, thanks for the ride.

899
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,460
No problem.

900
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,420
By the way,

901
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,840
I heard there will be
some familiar faces today.

902
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,250
Did you get a heads-up?

903
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,050
No. Who?

904
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,550
I guess they're dropping by unannounced.

905
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,270
A couple will make a surprise appearance.

906
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,240
How are you?

907
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,070
- Good.
- It's been a while.

908
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,070
- You're here!
- Hey.

909
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,210
So that's why you wanted me
to save two seats.

910
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,710
You were coming with Mi-rae.

911
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,750
Man, the traffic was insane. Right?

912
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,340
Ho-su, you made it.

913
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,970
Yes.

914
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,560
Ho-su, isn't that hilarious?

915
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,930
Look at that.

916
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,140
What? Oh.

917
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,980
Over there.

918
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,940
Yes, it is.

919
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,230
Where are we even going?

920
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,400
You'll see when we get there.

921
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,410
Jeez, stop rushing me.

922
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,160
We're almost there.

923
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,330
You dragged me all the way
to Seoul while saying that.

924
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:54,040
Why are you getting so worked up?

925
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,960
Just take a look at the thing back there.

926
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,640
Seriously, where are we going?
And what's with this outfit?

927
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,390
It's pretty, isn't it?

928
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,060
What you're wearing is not appropriate.

929
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,190
We're going to a wedding!

930
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,480
Whose wedding?

931
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,110
You know them.

932
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,570
Their kid just turned one,
and they're finally holding the ceremony.

933
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,740
Min-jae and Eun-su?

934
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,570
You got an invitation too?

935
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,910
Man, those two.

936
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,490
If they invited you as well,

937
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,210
they must be trying to cash in
on wedding gifts.

938
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,080
Anyway, the wedding is just an excuse.

939
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,250
Let's just have a cozy little date,
just you and me.

940
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,210
- A date?
- Yes.

941
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,760
You've been holed up lately,
digging around in your own world.

942
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,810
Mi-ji, I know you were
shutting yourself in

943
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,850
just to get some attention.

944
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,060
This guy got you out for some fresh air,

945
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,860
rented a car and booked a hotel.

946
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,610
What? A hotel?

947
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,940
We just got here.
We should stay overnight.

948
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,700
Don't worry. I told your mom

949
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,990
we're going to the wedding.
We've got a solid alibi.

950
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,410
Have you heard
of the Sauron Tower in Jamsil?

951
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,040
It's amazing.

952
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,120
I even paid extra for a river view--

953
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,290
Pull over.

954
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,500
Why? We're almost there.

955
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,630
I said pull over right now!

956
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,810
Hey, Mi-ji!

957
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,140
Hey!

958
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,020
What's with you all of a sudden?

959
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,690
No, what's with <i>you?</i>

960
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,570
This is way out of line!

961
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,030
What is?

962
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,740
You basically kidnapped me in your car.

963
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,820
And what? You booked a room?

964
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,370
You know the kidnapping thing
was just an act.

965
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,080
- That's our thing.
- What thing?

966
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,500
Just because you're my ex,
I'm supposed to go along with whatever?

967
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,670
Mi-ji, you…

968
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,250
I tried to overlook it,
but I can't anymore.

969
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,630
There are boundaries
between men and women.

970
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:10,180
You really shouldn't cross the line
just because we're close!

971
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:14,850
What's going on?

972
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,430
What?

973
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,240
You're not Mi-ji, are you?

974
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:32,780
Hey, guys!

975
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,700
It feels like his birthday party,
not a wedding.

976
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,740
I can't think straight
because of this kid.

977
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,410
What are you talking about?
He's the star of the wedding, right?

978
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,670
Thanks for coming, everyone.

979
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,170
Let's all get together

980
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,460
- for an after-party soon, okay?
- Sounds good.

981
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,630
Enjoy your food.

982
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,050
The food here is great.

983
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,720
Isn't this venue nice?

984
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,260
Yes, it is.

985
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,890
<i>Are you two here to check out the venue?</i>

986
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,070
Mi-rae, you're going hard today.

987
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,490
Ho-su, do you want some too?

988
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,250
What's with you?
You're making him feel awkward.

989
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,040
Don't mind him.

990
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,390
He said he'd come, no matter how late,
but it looks like he's not coming.

991
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,890
Why? Is someone coming?

992
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,720
Yes, surprise guests.

993
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,680
Gyeong-gu.

994
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,190
Song Gyeong-gu?

995
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,520
Remember the couple I told you about?

996
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,940
Gyeong-gu was supposed
to bring Mi-ji today.

997
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,110
Mi-ji?

998
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,740
This could've actually been fun for once.
What a shame.

999
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,370
Why would that be fun?

1000
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,330
I haven't seen them in so long.

1001
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,120
What's so fun about
seeing those two after so long?

1002
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,670
Don't be a buzzkill. I was just…

1003
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,010
Aren't you a bit old
to still find that crap fun?

1004
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,010
No.

1005
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,430
It's more fun now that I'm older.

1006
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,430
You've always been like this…

1007
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,640
What, you jerk?

1008
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,310
- You think I don't know?
- About what?

1009
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,020
Ho-su, what's your problem?

1010
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,770
- Stop, Ho-su.
- Knock it off.

1011
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,280
- A lawyer throwing punches?
- What's wrong?

1012
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,400
Come on.

1013
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,490
Ho-su, wait up.

1014
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,030
We'll get going.

1015
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,040
Jeez.

1016
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,910
What's with him?

1017
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,920
I've never seen Ho-su
act like that before.

1018
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,330
He's always been weird around me.

1019
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,630
Does he have anger issues or something?

1020
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,050
Did something happen between you two?

1021
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,390
Back in the day…

1022
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,850
It's embarrassing to even talk about.

1023
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,980
Remember Gyeong-gu's
big love confession in senior year?

1024
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,270
<i>I like you.</i>

1025
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,780
What do you think?

1026
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,120
Do you think she'll fall for me?

1027
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,540
What the heck?

1028
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,580
What do you think? I was rehearsing.

1029
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,830
To ask her out.

1030
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,840
Were you messing with me?
I almost punched you.

1031
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,710
Look at these goosebumps.

1032
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,380
You actually bought it?

1033
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,130
- I'm not crazy, dude.
- You scared me.

1034
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,930
So who do you like?

1035
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,900
- What?
- Who are you rehearsing for?

1036
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,230
Wait. Don't tell me.

1037
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,700
It's Mi-ji, right?

1038
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,120
- Yes.
- I knew it.

1039
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,620
You two always hang out together.
It was obvious.

1040
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,200
I guess.

1041
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,620
But seriously, you can't do it like that.

1042
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,290
- What?
- If you're going to do it,

1043
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,040
you've got to go big and bold.

1044
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,210
Right.

1045
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,010
I'll coach you.

1046
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,550
Try again and do it right.

1047
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,180
- Okay.
- All right. Let's do this.

1048
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,550
- Should we do it here?
- Here?

1049
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,760
Where else? Say, "Mi-ji, I like you."

1050
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,680
- In broad daylight?
- Just do it!

1051
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,390
Mi-ji, I like you.

1052
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,110
Gyeong-gu.

1053
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,440
Holy cow!

1054
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,700
What is it?

1055
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,410
Do you really like Mi-ji?

1056
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,990
- What?
- As more than a friend?

1057
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,040
Do you like her?

1058
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,540
Yes.

1059
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,090
Why do you ask?

1060
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,540
Then don't do it.

1061
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,010
Don't tell her.

1062
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,630
Just don't.

1063
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,470
Gyeong-gu, what are you doing?

1064
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,140
Let's get ready for the big moment.

1065
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,600
Hurry!

1066
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,060
Okay, coming.

1067
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,570
Mi-ji, I like you. Go out with me.

1068
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,240
Don't wimp out! Man up and say it.

1069
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,120
Bring out more emotion.

1070
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,330
Try again.

1071
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,290
Mi-ji, I like you. Go out with me.

1072
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,130
- You mean like that?
- Hey.

1073
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,380
- Mi-ji's here.
- Shoot.

1074
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,630
- What? I mean…
- Hurry, quick!

1075
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:40,920
Now's your chance!

1076
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,130
Screw it!

1077
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,390
Mi-ji.

1078
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,900
I like you.

1079
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,610
Go out with me.

1080
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,860
<i>Fine.</i>

1081
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:06,070
Look at her face.
Let's see that again.

1082
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,370
Gosh.

1083
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,200
This is hilarious.

1084
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,750
He actually did it.

1085
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,370
So Mi-ji has no idea about him?

1086
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,460
She'll figure it out eventually.

1087
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,750
Who knows.
They might stay together for a long time.

1088
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,920
Mi-ji kind of has a boyish vibe.

1089
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:24,420
Oh man…

1090
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,150
There's a fight!

1091
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,450
Stop it, you two!

1092
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,700
- Shouldn't we break it up?
- What?

1093
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,000
- Cut it out!
- That's enough.

1094
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,830
- Knock it off!
- Calm down.

1095
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,790
- You're way too worked up.
- Enough.

1096
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,000
Stop it.

1097
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,060
Gosh.

1098
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,440
I had no idea.

1099
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,860
I just thought you were her ex.

1100
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,990
Wait, does Mi-ji…

1101
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,530
Of course she knows.

1102
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,950
That's why I could tell it was you.

1103
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,750
I told Mi-ji the truth
right after we started dating.

1104
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,750
I was going to tell her anyway,

1105
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,580
but Ho-su just kept giving me
death stares.

1106
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:44,670
It was just like today.

1107
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,760
He suddenly charged over and asked
if I thought it was funny.

1108
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:51,890
So Ho-su knew everything?

1109
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,600
He never said anything to you?

1110
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,390
Then that bastard was acting
clueless the whole time.

1111
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,190
He's always been creepy like that.

1112
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,060
And he's been fooling you for ten years!

1113
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,070
I'm glad you finally found out, Mi-rae.

1114
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,780
But you knew the whole time too.

1115
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,990
I mean…

1116
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,200
It's not really about who knew what.

1117
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,830
The whole thing is Gyeong-gu's fault.

1118
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,410
Can't you see?

1119
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:19,410
He's still pretending to be with Mi-ji
after all these years.

1120
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,000
He says they've been together
for ten years now.

1121
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,840
Wait, don't tell me
Mi-ji still doesn't know.

1122
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,510
Isn't that kind of a scam--

1123
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:31,590
Hey!

1124
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,470
I mean…

1125
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,270
The 28th student council president
of Duson High, Choi Seung-hyeon.

1126
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:44,480
I get that it's your biggest
achievement in life,

1127
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,570
but maybe it's time to graduate.

1128
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,820
How are you still
in your high school phase?

1129
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,910
- Mi-rae, you--
- I swear, I'll punch you!

1130
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,320
You should be thankful that I'm Mi-rae.

1131
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:57,490
If I were you, I'd stay away from Mi-ji
starting next week.

1132
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,620
- Wait…
- Get out of my face!

1133
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,580
Shoot…

1134
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,580
Hello.

1135
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,790
Ho-su, where are you?

1136
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,130
I'm in the parking lot.

1137
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:51,420
Then just stay there for a sec.

1138
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,720
I need to talk to you.

1139
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,590
- About what?
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>

1140
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,010
What? What's going on?

1141
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,230
Mi-rae wants to see me for a minute.

1142
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,650
- You can go.
- No, it's fine.

1143
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,610
You can talk to her. I'll wait.

1144
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,480
No, don't wait for me. You can go.

1145
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,080
Who are you going to go see?

1146
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,370
She's not Mi-rae.

1147
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,500
It's Mi-ji.

1148
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,420
I know.

1149
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,130
What?

1150
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,340
I know

1151
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,430
that it's Mi-ji.

1152
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,520
Sorry.

1153
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:46,980
I have to go.

1154
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,390
Ho-su.

1155
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:30,100
I don't want to lie to you.

1156
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,730
The truth is,

1157
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,200
I'm Mi…

1158
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,160
No, stop.

1159
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,780
Don't say it. No.

1160
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,530
Don't.

1161
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,410
But I feel uneasy.

1162
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,790
Uneasy.

1163
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,840
Good night.

1164
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,760
Mi-ji.

1165
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:47,100
Okay.

1166
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,190
Mi-ji.

1167
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,490
Yes?

1168
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,120
Mi-ji.

1169
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:11,500
Why do you keep calling me?

1170
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,760
<i>People always have a reason</i>
<i>for hiding things.</i>

1171
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,180
What shoes?

1172
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,020
Don't act like you don't know.

1173
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,730
The shoes. Right.

1174
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,230
Why is there always a line at that place?

1175
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,310
What?

1176
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,070
That place was only on Jeju.
I guess they opened one here.

1177
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,620
<i>We all have that one question</i>
<i>we don't want to be asked.</i>

1178
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:58,460
<i>Does choosing not to ask it</i>
<i>count as being deceitful?</i>

1179
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,520
Ho-su.

1180
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,540
You two got guts. I'll give you that.

1181
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,210
Is everything okay with Mi-ji?

1182
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,090
Let's hope so.

1183
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,260
Are you going to tell anyone?

1184
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,970
Who would I tell?

1185
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,850
Should I go tattle to your mom?

1186
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,730
Things like this
are just meant to stay secret.

1187
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,350
So stop talking nonsense.

1188
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,480
If you're going to do it, do it right.

1189
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,650
Your mom thinks you're Mi-ji,
and she's really worried sick.

1190
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,450
You should go out more.

1191
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,990
Why did you suddenly quit
the strawberry farm?

1192
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:11,740
Did he…

1193
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,740
hire someone new?

1194
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,870
How would I know?

1195
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,370
He didn't say anything.

1196
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,340
Why? Do you regret it now?
Hard to let go of that daily pay?

1197
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,840
Maybe.

1198
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,390
Where do you want to go?

1199
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,850
Do you want to go home,

1200
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,470
or check out some other place
since we're in Seoul?

1201
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,400
I don't really have anywhere to go.

1202
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,910
Why are you limping? Did you get hurt?

1203
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,790
I ran and twisted my ankle earlier.

1204
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:57,000
It's fine.

1205
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,040
Get on my back.

1206
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,250
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

1207
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,800
- It's okay. Let me.
- Seriously, I'm fine.

1208
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,800
What? Are you afraid?
That I'll break my leg carrying you?

1209
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,600
No, it's not that…

1210
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,810
I've been in physical therapy
for 15 years. I can handle it.

1211
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,520
My leg is in better shape
than your ankle right now.

1212
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,860
Hop on.

1213
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,150
Come on.

1214
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,710
Why did you act like you didn't know?

1215
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:43,790
About what?

1216
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,000
Gyeong-gu.

1217
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:48,260
You knew all along, right?

1218
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,890
If you knew Mi-ji and Gyeong-gu
weren't a thing, why haven't you…

1219
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,220
I'm a bit shady, you know.

1220
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,720
Come on, don't say that.

1221
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,890
It's not like I know everything.

1222
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,600
Just because
I found out something by chance

1223
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,900
doesn't mean I know
what's between those two.

1224
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:09,820
Don't you ever feel it's unfair?

1225
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,610
You keep secrets that aren't even yours,

1226
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,870
and in return, you miss out,
lose out, and get misunderstood.

1227
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,330
You do so much for others,

1228
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,870
and all you get in return
is being called "shady."

1229
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,460
I don't do it for others.

1230
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,840
I can't comfort people
or fix their problems.

1231
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,090
But…

1232
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,340
I can keep a secret.

1233
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,890
You're such a fool.

1234
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:41,060
Anyway, what was it
you wanted to tell me earlier?

1235
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,640
Oh, that…

1236
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,480
I was actually planning
to tell you next week,

1237
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:55,110
but it's not just about me,
so it's a bit tricky.

1238
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,580
Still, I thought I should tell you…

1239
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,120
Just tell me later.

1240
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,040
What?

1241
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,620
Whatever it is,

1242
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,840
tell me when you feel comfortable talking.

1243
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:21,220
<i>Just like the moon that follows me</i>

1244
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,430
<i>without ever being noticed,</i>

1245
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,850
<i>this fool has been silently waiting,</i>

1246
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,020
<i>for who knows how long.</i>

1247
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,320
<i>I liked Ho-su</i>
<i>and this foolish side of him…</i>

1248
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,320
<i>and I still do.</i>

1249
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,350
Gosh, please!

1250
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,910
Fuck, stop already!

1251
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,530
There's nothing left now!

1252
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:30,000
What are you doing here?

1253
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,850
Grandpa?

1254
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,070
Get up.

1255
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:58,700
How did you…

1256
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,370
We can talk later.

1257
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:02,830
Get up now.

1258
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:10,420
CHANGHWA FARM

1259
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:21,010
You showed up like a superhero,
so I figured you'd know what to do.

1260
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,890
But you're just as lost.

1261
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,390
Jeez. I came to help, you know.

1262
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:27,770
Sorry.

1263
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,890
I'm thankful, really.

1264
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,770
But now what?
The roads are flooded. You can't go home.

1265
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:37,820
I'll sleep over here tonight, so you can…

1266
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:44,370
That was scary.

1267
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,380
Seriously? A blackout?

1268
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:01,880
Did you call home?

1269
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:05,390
I already told Mom
I wouldn't be home tonight.

1270
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,940
I wasn't planning to come here, though.

1271
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:15,310
This is only going to fuel the rumors.

1272
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,320
We're screwed.

1273
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,450
Seriously, why did you come?

1274
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,200
My friend said he could take me
anywhere I wanted,

1275
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,500
but this was the only place
I could think of.

1276
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,040
Why?

1277
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,500
Because what's out there is fake,

1278
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,920
and this place is real.

1279
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,090
At least to me.

1280
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,470
Then why do you hate the rumors so much?

1281
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,060
There's no reason to like them.

1282
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:55,520
I like them.

1283
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,440
The rumors about us.

1284
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,480
YU MI-JI

1285
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,270
Do you even know
what Mi-rae's going through at work?

1286
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,570
<i>Use it to help the people</i>
<i>who are important to you.</i>

1287
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:44,110
There's even a novel based
on the public takeover bid for Hyudi Bio.

1288
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:46,530
<i>So you're not quiet.</i>
<i>You just chose not to talk.</i>

1289
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:49,030
- Ever considered working in finance?
- What?

1290
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,990
- Ms. Seoul?
- That 200,000 won-a-day job?

1291
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,540
Since we've run into each other,
let's go eat together.

1292
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,910
<i>Mi-rae didn't tell you about the rumors?</i>

1293
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,170
<i>She threw a fit at Mi-rae</i>
<i>in the company lobby.</i>

1294
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,750
Why are you still here?

1295
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,920
That's disappointing.

1296
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,050
I haven't gone a day
without thinking about you, Ms. Yu.

1297
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,640
