OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,920
Just like in the "Three Bears" song,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,680
the world made it seem like
a family should consist of three.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,560
But just like having two eyes
and two ears…

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,690
You missed a spot.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,690
…two always felt more natural to me.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,360
My dad and I.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,320
Hi.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,610
But one day,

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
two became three.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,280
Hey, guess what!

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,280
I just saw the old unmarried bat
in the hallway.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,410
Yeom Bun-hong!
Our fifth-grade teacher?

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,750
Is she a parent?
We became another set of three.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,460
But she's not married.
Ho-su.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,790
But for some reason,

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,380
it just made me feel
like I had three eyes instead.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,050
Why is she going?

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,090
Ho-su.

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,220
Why can't it be just us at Mom's memorial?
It's always been the two of us!

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,720
Ho-su…

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,560
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,560
Something urgent came up at school,
so the two of you should go without me.

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,940
Bun-hong.
Ironically, the day I insisted

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,520
that it be just the two of us…

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,790
Ho-su.

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,420
Ho-su!

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,250
Help! He's awake! Ho-su!
…we actually did become

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,510
two again.

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,720
Bye.

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,340
See you tomorrow.

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,720
Stop humiliating the family.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,510
You want to raise someone else's kid?

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,890
What are you going to tell people?

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,730
She's right! Don't just
decide this on your own, Bun-hong.

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,190
No one will blame you
if you decide not to raise him.

37
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,070
Listen to us. It's not easy
to raise a kid that isn't yours.

38
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,400
No, it became just one.

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,900
You'll have to take care of him
his whole life.

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,240
One broken piece.
Why take on that burden?

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,250
Excuse me.

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,330
You're Bun-hong, right?

43
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,130
Remember me?
I'm Kim Ok-hui from Sinsong Girls' High.

44
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh my gosh! Ok-hui!

45
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,670
My goodness.
My gosh.

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,940
I was wondering who was moving in
next door. I can't believe it's you!

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,140
My gosh! What a surprise.
My goodness.

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,640
Is he your son?
Yes.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,640
I didn't even hear you got married.
And now you've got a son this big?

50
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,100
Goodness, I forgot
to tell you I got married.

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,030
Nice to meet you. Your mom
and I went to the same high school.

52
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,190
Gosh, he's so handsome.
That's when I started

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,910
trying my best not to become a burden.

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,660
Just like my ears,

55
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,160
which seemed fine on the outside.

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,160
Ho-su, why did you take out
your hearing aid?

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,750
Even if it doesn't work well,
you should use it.

58
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,290
I feel more comfortable
hearing with just one ear.

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,840
As long as I pretended…

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,390
that I was fine,

61
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,890
I'd seem whole on the outside.

62
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,730
EPISODE 8
AN UNCONVENTIONAL WHOLE

63
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,860
WAITING AREA
TICKET COUNTER

64
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,240
I've liked you…

65
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,160
for a long time.

66
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,450
More than you know.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,370
Me too.

68
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,150
You should go inside.

69
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,190
You must be cold.

70
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,070
What?

71
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,370
Yes, okay.
Okay.

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,870
See you.

73
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,040
See you.

74
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,090
What are we now?

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,970
Since I said, "Me too,"
are we officially a couple now?

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,100
Or maybe we're not a couple yet.

77
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,770
Sorry. Have you been waiting long?
No, it's okay.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,570
Why are you wet though? Is that sweat?

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,150
No, I just washed my face.

80
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,570
I was rushing,
so I didn't have time to wash.

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,240
I told you that you didn't need to come.

82
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,750
You had to wake up early because of me.

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,120
Of course I needed to come.
You're leaving.

84
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,250
Jeez.

85
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,670
You didn't have to come.

86
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,130
Will you be going to work instead
of Mi-rae again when you get to Seoul?

87
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,390
Yes, but it's all going to be over soon.

88
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,890
You must be tired.
You probably didn't get enough sleep.

89
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,980
What? I slept really well.
I passed out as soon as I hit the pillow.

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,770
That's good.

91
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,400
I had a hard time falling asleep.

92
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,070
Hey.

93
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,910
Are we…
Yes?

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,040
Well…

95
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,880
When are we seeing each other again?

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm planning to return
as soon as my mom gets discharged.

97
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,470
I'll call you when I'm in Seoul.

98
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,220
Okay.

99
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,930
Hey…

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
Yes?

101
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,690
Have a…

102
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,030
All right.
Have a safe trip.

103
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,820
Thanks.

104
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,910
Go home now.
Okay.

105
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,570
Bye, then.

106
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,950
Did we seriously just shake hands?
That's so lame.

107
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,580
Yes, the amount is right.
I'll help you with the payment now.

108
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,750
You usually come right on time.

109
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,170
But this time, you were late,

110
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,010
so I was worried that
something had happened to you.

111
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,050
I was a little sick.

112
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,180
SEONHAM MENTAL NURSING HOME

113
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,720
Is there someone I can put down
as your emergency contact?

114
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,560
I need to have one on file

115
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,400
just in case something
like this happens again.

116
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,730
As I mentioned before,

117
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,780
I'm the only family he's got.

118
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,780
There's something called
an adult guardianship program.

119
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,950
What?

120
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,990
It's called an adult guardianship program.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,950
You can designate a guardian
ahead of time, even if they're not family.

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,790
You should read it over
and give it some thought.

123
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,500
Thank you.

124
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,210
Take care, ma'am.

125
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
JOIN THE ADULT GUARDIANSHIP PROGRAM!

126
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,880
Mom, I got you discharged.
Okay.

127
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,970
Leave it. I told you
that I'd pack your things.

128
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,260
Okay.

129
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,230
I didn't want to waste
the valuable time I have with you packing.

130
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,850
Ok-hui, do you want to use
this humidifier?

131
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,820
I'm getting discharged today, too.
Take it with you.

132
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,240
I have one too.

133
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Ho-su said he'd get you discharged
with me. Why are you refusing?

134
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,200
You're not the only one with a kid.
My daughter's coming too.

135
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,410
We'll get going, then.

136
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,370
Mom.
What?

137
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,920
Jeez.

138
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,840
Ho-su, are you sick?

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,840
No, I'm fine. Why?

140
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,720
You don't have a fever?

141
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,340
You always get really sick
when the seasons change.

142
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,550
You should see a doctor since you're here.

143
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,770
That was only when I was a kid.
I'm fine now.

144
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,520
Still…
Ms. Bun-hong.

145
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,190
My goodness!

146
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,810
My gosh, Ms. Su-yeong.
It's been such a long time!

147
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,650
You look ready to pop!

148
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,730
When did you say you were due?

149
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,650
Next month.
Gosh.

150
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,110
Are you her son?

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
Yes, hello.

152
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,240
You're just as handsome as she said.

153
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,950
She told me a lot about you.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,620
My goodness,
I didn't talk about him that much.

155
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,170
I hope I give birth to a son like you.

156
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,010
It's a little late,
but tell me your prenatal care tips.

157
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,090
What?

158
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,180
Goodness, there are no special tips.

159
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,310
Just relax. That's the best prenatal care.

160
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,720
What was the conception dream
for your son?

161
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,440
Many people around me
have had conception dreams for my baby,

162
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,770
and I'm struggling to decide
which to go with.

163
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,110
My son's conception dream was…

164
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,490
a giant lotus flower blooming

165
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,240
in the middle of a big lake.

166
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,780
That's why they named me Ho-su,
meaning "lake."

167
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,540
My goodness,
even your conception dream is amazing.

168
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,040
Let's talk more about that in person.

169
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,290
Text me the address.

170
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,880
Okay.

171
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,930
Sir, we're ready for the meeting.

172
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,180
Okay.

173
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,560
Let's all go to the meeting.
Yes, sir.

174
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,780
REDIAL

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,950
Kim Jin-gyu of Sihan Construction's
Business Development speaking.

176
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,080
Tae-i!

177
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,540
Hello.

178
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,580
They just started the meeting.

179
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,750
Already?

180
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,600
Did Mi-rae return to Seoul?

181
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,470
She left early this morning to go to work.

182
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Gosh, I told her to go back yesterday.
She must be tired.

183
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,770
Why did you tell her that I got hurt
when she's so busy?

184
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,320
She's family, so she should know.

185
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,360
She doesn't have to!

186
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,820
Jeez. You don't know how to keep a secret.

187
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm going to visit Seoul soon.

188
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,290
Seoul?

189
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,080
You went recently, though.

190
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,330
Mi-rae told me to visit her.

191
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,630
She did?

192
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,510
By the way,

193
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,510
why did Ho-su come here?
What?

194
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,640
I heard he came here to talk to you.

195
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,140
What did you two talk about?

196
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,230
What exactly happened
between you and Park Sang-yeong?

197
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,190
It was nothing important.

198
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,650
He just asked how I was doing.

199
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,980
He came all the way here
to ask how you're doing? That's silly.

200
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,360
Gosh, he must have a lot of time
on his hands.

201
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,160
He used to be so busy. Jeez.

202
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,490
Bun-hong acted like
it was the end of the world

203
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,790
when Ho-su quit his job.

204
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,580
But now that he has
more free time to see her,

205
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,040
she's even happier than
when he had a job. Go figure.

206
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,630
Mom, how would you feel
if Mi-rae did the same thing?

207
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,220
What do you mean?

208
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,840
What if she were to quit her job
like Ho-su and spend more time with you?

209
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,470
Hey! Don't say such ridiculous things.

210
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,520
He's a lawyer,
not just an ordinary office worker.

211
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,480
Having one unemployed daughter
is more than enough.

212
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,110
Jeez.

213
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,490
A favor?

214
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,490
I'm sorry to bother you when I told you
I didn't need your help before,

215
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,790
but I have no one else to ask.

216
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm happy to help with whatever you need.

217
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,420
What's the favor, though?

218
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,340
If you tell me what you need,

219
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,340
then I'll have it ready.

220
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,060
It's a long story to tell over the phone.

221
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,230
It's not urgent, so let's talk in person.

222
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,770
Do you have time on Monday?

223
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,990
Mom, what are you doing?

224
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm just cleaning the electric blanket
before I put it on the bed.

225
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,700
It's dusty
since I haven't used it in a while.

226
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,950
I'll do it.

227
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,740
You should've told me.

228
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,200
How did you get this out by yourself?

229
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,250
I thought maybe you weren't feeling well
because the house was chilly.

230
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,790
Wipe it for me, then.

231
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,590
What are you doing now?

232
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,010
Well…

233
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,970
I'm going to make some baesuk.

234
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,180
It always made you feel better
when you had a cold.

235
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,850
Mom, you're the patient.
Why are you taking care of me?

236
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,060
Just don't make it.

237
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,690
It's very easy to make.

238
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,480
I just need to boil everything in a pot.

239
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,610
Mom.
Yes?

240
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,030
I'll just go back this weekend.

241
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,740
What?

242
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,040
Why so soon?

243
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,830
Since you came home,

244
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,710
you haven't been able to rest
because of me.

245
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,590
Okay, I see what you mean.

246
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,760
I'll stop. I won't do anything.

247
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,680
You said that earlier too.

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,970
I think…

249
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,680
you'll only be able to rest
comfortably without me here.

250
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,980
Then…

251
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,860
let me pack up some food for you.

252
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,740
I was going to send it to Seoul,
but this is perfect!

253
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,990
Mom, I'm okay.

254
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,830
I can't just let you go back empty-handed

255
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,910
after everything I put you through.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,040
People will gossip if I don't do anything.

257
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Do you…

258
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,670
still feel uncomfortable?

259
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,380
What?

260
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,720
I'm all grown up now.

261
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,930
You don't have to try as hard
as you did before.

262
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,150
Mom, from now on…

263
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,730
just focus on taking care of yourself.

264
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,340
I guess you don't get many customers
in wheelchairs here.

265
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,010
I don't serve solo diners.

266
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,510
I just came to introduce myself.

267
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,180
I'm currently a consultant for KFMC--

268
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,310
If you're not a customer, get out.

269
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,930
Hyeon Sang-wol.

270
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,110
You know her, right?

271
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,490
Who are you?

272
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,660
I guess I've piqued your interest now.

273
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,200
My name is Lee Chung-gu. I'm a lawyer.

274
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,720
HIGH-QUALITY STRAWBERRY MANUAL

275
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,020
You scared me!

276
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,770
"You scared me!"

277
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,940
What were you doing?

278
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,310
Here.

279
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,280
"High-quality Strawberry Manual."

280
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,910
"Research on Breeding New Varieties."

281
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,910
"Future Cultivation Plan."

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,370
Are you from
the Rural Development Administration?

283
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,920
You'll be doing it alone from now on,
so I figured these could be useful.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,760
If you were bringing gifts,
you should've told me.

285
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,050
Why leave them here secretly?

286
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,090
Are you my Secret Santa or something?

287
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,760
I thought it'd be awkward
to say goodbye again

288
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,430
after the handshake
and everything the other day.

289
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,100
Why would it be awkward?

290
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,190
I circled the block a few times,
hoping to say goodbye again.

291
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,230
When are you going to Seoul?
Are you leaving now?

292
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,190
Not right away, but soon.

293
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,610
If you're not leaving today,

294
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,780
do you want to meet up tonight?

295
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,240
Why at night?

296
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,750
Because the stars are visible at night.

297
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,750
I found a great stargazing spot.

298
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,010
Do you want to go with me later?

299
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,680
Be careful.

300
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,310
Are we really on our way to see stars?

301
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,310
I'm sensing some serious distrust.

302
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,860
We're almost there.

303
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,570
You've been saying that for a while now.

304
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,490
You can do it!

305
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,840
What is it?

306
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,930
Wow!

307
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,360
Aren't you glad you came?

308
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
You almost left without seeing this.

309
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,160
So those same stars
are in the Seoul sky too, right?

310
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,870
The sky is the same here
as it is in Seoul.

311
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,080
Some things are better seen in the dark.

312
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,920
I wonder what
it would've been like in Seoul.

313
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,300
What do you mean?

314
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,550
I'm talking about us.

315
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,510
I think if we had run
into each other in Seoul,

316
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,350
that would've been interesting too.

317
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,850
You wouldn't have even noticed me.

318
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,270
Why not?

319
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,400
Even if we had met on our way
to or from work,

320
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,860
I would've just been
like one of those many stars.

321
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,320
Because I'm so ordinary.

322
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,660
Never mind.

323
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,740
You probably wouldn't have
even seen me because it's Seoul.

324
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,120
Thank goodness we didn't.

325
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,040
If we had, you would've said I'm annoying
and refused to even talk to me.

326
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,250
You're only talking to me like this
because we're here.

327
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,380
Jeez…

328
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,260
Anyway,

329
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,600
have you given any thought
to your future plans?

330
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,930
Not yet.

331
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,360
I decided to go to Seoul,

332
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,530
but I still haven't decided
what to do once I get there.

333
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,780
It's hard.

334
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,740
Wouldn't it be nice if someone made
that decision for you?

335
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,450
Yes.

336
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,790
Is staying here an option, by any chance?

337
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,540
There's not much I can do here.

338
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,420
Regardless of whether I keep working
at the same place or move somewhere else,

339
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,090
I need to keep making money.

340
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,420
I have a lot of money.
Should I lend you some?

341
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,840
So…

342
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,560
this is what you were like in Seoul?

343
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,140
I mean it when I say I want to help.

344
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,100
Instead of rushing to make a decision,

345
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,520
why don't you stay here
and see the strawberries grow with me

346
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,190
while you take time
to think about your next move?

347
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,450
I'll consider it as an option.

348
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,540
When are you going to Seoul?
I'll give you a ride.

349
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,200
In what?

350
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,750
The truck.

351
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,840
Can you even drive
on the highway with that?

352
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,300
I don't think you can.

353
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,760
I just sensed some serious distrust again.

354
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,480
PHARMACY

355
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,400
Hey, Mr. Handsome!

356
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,860
Hey! Why did you turn around?

357
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,910
Do you think you're handsome?

358
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,080
Mi-ji…

359
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
How did you know when I was arriving?

360
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,170
You said you were taking the first bus.
I calculated your arrival time.

361
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,170
It's so quiet here. I guess it's because
not many stores are open yet.

362
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,800
Doesn't it feel like we have
the place to ourselves?

363
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,470
Are we heading to a restaurant,
by the way?

364
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,640
What? I was just walking.

365
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,560
Why? Are you tired?
Do you want to sit down for a moment?

366
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,850
No, I wasn't asking because I'm tired.

367
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,020
Well, I'm tired.

368
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,860
Over there!
Let's go and sit there for a minute.

369
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,910
Wow. We've walked pretty far.

370
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,410
If I'm not paying attention,
I can walk all the way to Gyeonggi-do.

371
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,370
From now on, you need to tell me
to stop when you're with me.

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,830
You can walk all you want.

373
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,090
It's not that I want to walk.

374
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,920
We walked a lot more than I realized
because I was with you.

375
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,640
What?

376
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,810
It just feels surreal.

377
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,770
I can't believe
I'm here with you like this.

378
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,020
Should I ask if we're a couple now?

379
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,310
No, maybe I shouldn't.

380
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,570
Am I supposed to just
go with the flow like this?

381
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,280
What is it?

382
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,950
You know…

383
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,780
Are we now…

384
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,250
Are we going to eat?

385
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,380
Yes, we should.

386
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,050
You must be hungry.
What do you feel like eating?

387
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,420
Let's see what's open nearby.

388
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,760
I think we're near Seorae Village.
Should we go there since we're close by?

389
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,270
We can just go to any restaurant
that's open on our way.

390
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,640
Seorae Village?

391
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,560
Or…

392
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,060
if we go this way,
there's the Hangang River.

393
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,150
Should we go there? Where should we go?

394
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,860
How about my place?

395
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,570
What?

396
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,950
Come in.

397
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay.

398
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,560
BODY ACHE
FEVER REDUCER & PAIN RELIEVER

399
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,350
TYLENON

400
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,180
We just got here.
Why are you taking medication?

401
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,560
Are you sick?

402
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,350
It's just a supplement.

403
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,940
Have a seat.

404
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,190
Do you want to change
into something comfortable?

405
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,910
Why would I change right now
in someone else's place?

406
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,740
Isn't it a little too late to be shy now?

407
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,950
You've slept over before.

408
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,500
But that day…

409
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,960
You already knew it was me back then?

410
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,300
How long have you known?

411
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,840
I thought it was you from the start.

412
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,550
But it didn't make any sense,

413
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,930
so I was confused.

414
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,850
I couldn't tell
if Mi-rae had changed or if I had.

415
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,310
I kept getting confused.

416
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,360
I knew for sure
the night you showed up drunk.

417
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,240
All the confusing and strange things

418
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,070
made sense the moment
I realized it had been you all along.

419
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,790
By the way, what's all that?

420
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,290
What did you bring?

421
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,080
Just some of my old stuff.

422
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm bringing things back little by little.

423
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,250
Why? They're just going to be a burden.
You should've just left them there.

424
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,300
It's my stuff. I should keep them here
instead of at my mom's place.

425
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,260
Why does that matter? You're family.

426
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,640
Your mom would be hurt if she heard that.

427
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,890
I want…

428
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,980
my mom to live freely now.

429
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,980
Without any burden.

430
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,940
When did you grow up?

431
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,280
You used to cry your heart out
when your mom was gone for the day.

432
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,030
Don't you remember?
It was back in high school.

433
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,070
Your mom said
she wasn't coming home for the night,

434
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,490
and you bawled your eyes out.

435
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,420
Ho-su…

436
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,960
has your fever gone down?

437
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,090
What's all this?

438
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,020
I thought I'd start holding
your dad's ancestral rite this year.

439
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,020
Are you doing this for me?

440
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,480
No.

441
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,610
I'm doing it because I want to.

442
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,110
Then why are there two of those?

443
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,700
One of them is for my mom.

444
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,660
Well…

445
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,580
Their memorials are on the same day,

446
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,910
so I thought it'd be nice
to do them together.

447
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,630
Don't you want to?

448
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,170
Should we skip it?

449
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,180
Right…

450
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,600
I should've realized this would upset you.

451
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,930
I'm sorry about this.

452
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,350
Mom…

453
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,730
Do I make you uncomfortable?

454
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,900
Uncomfortable? Of course not, Ho-su.

455
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,610
Then why are you doing all this?

456
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,450
You don't have to pretend
we're family when nobody is around.

457
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,620
I was just doing it for you--

458
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,080
If you care about me…

459
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,290
then just ignore me.

460
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,290
I don't know
if it was because of the fever

461
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,260
or my parents' ancestral tablets,

462
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,760
but that day, I couldn't stand being
such a burden for some reason.

463
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,680
So for the first and last time,

464
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,560
I said I was fine being alone.

465
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,980
But the moment I was left alone
in that empty house,

466
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,070
I realized…

467
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,240
I had never been truly alone before.

468
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,580
Hello.

469
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,340
Hi.

470
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,500
It's me, Bun-hong.

471
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,340
Are you Mi-ji or Mi-rae?
I'm Mi-ji.

472
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,800
Mi-ji, I've just done something
very stupid!

473
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,560
I got on the wrong bus
and ended up very far from home.

474
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,600
So I won't be able to get home today.

475
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,690
Hey, Ho-su.

476
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,150
What are you doing over there?

477
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,240
Your mom called.

478
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,540
She said she got on the wrong bus,
so she can't come home today.

479
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,580
What?

480
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,790
She said she'll catch
the first bus back tomorrow.

481
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
She said to lock up before going to bed.

482
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,770
Ho-su! Why are you crying?

483
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,690
Don't cry.

484
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,080
Why did you cry that day?

485
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,620
I got so flustered
that I couldn't even ask you.

486
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,620
I thought my mom had abandoned me.

487
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,380
Hey, how could your mom abandon you?

488
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,670
Back then, I thought she did.

489
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,180
I was sitting in the living room
with the table set for the ancestral rite,

490
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,220
and it felt so quiet.

491
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,850
In that silence,
all I could hear was my own breath.

492
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,400
I felt like I was alone in the universe.

493
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,730
Since that day,
I've been preparing little by little.

494
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,950
If my mom ever gets on the wrong bus again
and wants to go far away,

495
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,280
I don't want to be a burden to her.

496
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,830
In my own way, I'm just preparing myself

497
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,540
so I don't break down
if I end up alone again like that day.

498
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,170
You weren't alone that day.

499
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,340
I waited by your side
until you stopped crying.

500
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,550
You're right.

501
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,050
You had no idea what was going on,
but you cried with me.

502
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,390
Looking back now,

503
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,640
I think it was like that every time.

504
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,640
Whenever I started thinking
about why life was so quiet,

505
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,980
you would barge in, loud as ever.

506
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,360
What? "Loud as ever"?

507
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,650
If you don't like that,
maybe I should leave.

508
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,320
No. I like that you're loud.
Gosh.

509
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,880
What? No?

510
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,630
Like this? No…
I think it's better to sit. Here…

511
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,220
Wait…

512
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,470
Oh, my alarm!
Why is the alarm…

513
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,930
Why is this…

514
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,100
going off now?

515
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,190
Probably because it's the weekend.
It's better to sleep in.

516
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,110
Wait. No way.

517
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,030
Wow! Unbelievable.

518
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,860
You still have this?

519
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,780
You wrote in the guidebook
as if you were studying for a test.

520
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,500
You told me to check
where we should go together.

521
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,670
Hey, should we follow the guidebook?

522
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,000
Right now?

523
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,760
There we go. Hold this.

524
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,420
This?

525
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,970
Wait for me.

526
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,320
There it is!

527
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,770
CLOSED TODAY DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

528
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,480
SEOUL'S HIDDEN GEMS
MI-JI & HO-SU'S SEOUL TRIP

529
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,530
Somehow, we ended up near your office.

530
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,530
Do you want to go somewhere else?
I'm sorry we ended up here.

531
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,870
No, I wanted to come here.

532
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,500
This guidebook is a complete joke.

533
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,920
Why don't the places
I wanted to visit exist anymore?

534
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Well, the book is over ten years old.

535
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,790
I should've looked them up first.

536
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm sorry for dragging you around.

537
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,300
Don't be sorry. I had fun.

538
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,400
He's quiet. Is he tired?

539
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,610
Or maybe he's bored
of hanging around with me.

540
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,280
Or is he upset
because I kept dragging him around?

541
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,450
Should we just head home
after we finish eating this?

542
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,620
Why?

543
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,080
I feel like today's not our day.

544
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,750
People always end up getting hurt
or fighting on an unlucky day like this.

545
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,920
After this, let's go somewhere
that's definitely still there.

546
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,220
It's not like Namsan or Gyeongbokgung
Palace could have disappeared, right?

547
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,130
There's an art museum nearby too.

548
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,760
No, let's go another time.

549
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,890
Why? Is it because of me?

550
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,850
No, it's not because of you.

551
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,610
I'm just realizing
that ten years is a really long time.

552
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,990
Everything's changed so much.
I feel so behind.

553
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,370
Let's buy a new one.

554
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,620
A new what?
A guidebook.

555
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,330
I'll buy this year's edition

556
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,120
and study it again.

557
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,960
Let's go right now.

558
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,630
Okay.

559
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,550
Ho-su!

560
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,810
My gosh, Mr. Lee.

561
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,100
What brings you two here?

562
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,060
We have a trial tomorrow,
so we have to work this weekend.

563
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,190
Is this the crochet lady
you were talking about?

564
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,320
Yes, she is…
My goodness!

565
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,490
Mr. Lee has told me so much about you.

566
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,450
Hello.

567
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,820
Who is she again?

568
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,240
We were classmates--
She's my girlfriend.

569
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,410
You're his girlfriend.

570
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,250
You were classmates?
So you went to our university?

571
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,420
No, we were high school classmates.

572
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,050
I see. Then…

573
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,510
are you a lawyer?

574
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,760
Why are you asking that?

575
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,350
I work at a public corporation.

576
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,930
It's a finance management
corporation near here.

577
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,140
I see.
Yes.

578
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,320
The travel section's here.

579
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,450
What?

580
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,000
Why did you do that earlier?

581
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,080
Do what?

582
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,090
You pretended to be Mi-rae.

583
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,590
They don't even know you,
so why did you…

584
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,390
I didn't want to put you
in an awkward position.

585
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,550
Why would I be in an awkward position?

586
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,770
Then what was I supposed to say?

587
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,140
You told them I was your girlfriend.
Was I supposed to say I'm unemployed?

588
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,560
I wouldn't have minded.

589
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,650
Well, they were obviously
your former coworkers.

590
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,030
I didn't want to embarrass you.

591
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,450
So you lied because of me?

592
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,580
That's not what I meant.

593
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,500
Let's head back.

594
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,960
What?

595
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,210
You were right.
Today doesn't seem to be our day.

596
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,350
All right.

597
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
TO MI-RAE

598
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,200
Speak of the devil.

599
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,540
Director Yoon.

600
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,630
How have you been?

601
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,490
Why do things keep going sideways?

602
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,660
Is it because I'm a puzzle piece
that doesn't fit?

603
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,790
No matter how much I pretend to be normal,

604
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,960
I'm still broken. Will I ever be able…

605
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,420
to form a pair with someone else?

606
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,430
Today really isn't my day.

607
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,730
One, two, three.

608
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,980
There we go.

609
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,450
He took more of his things.

610
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
Bun-hong.

611
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,140
Come with us. You even got flowers.

612
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,970
I know there's no urgent business--

613
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,270
You two should go alone.

614
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,600
I think that'll be best.

615
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,360
We can't just go without you.
We're a family.

616
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,780
Why not?

617
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,360
One day, I'll be the one ditching you
to hang out with just Ho-su.

618
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,370
I guess this is why everyone
was so against this marriage.

619
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,580
I even promised
that you would never feel lonely again,

620
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,170
but Ho-su won't listen to me these days.

621
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,840
Honey, I told you…

622
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,420
that I was the oddball in my family.

623
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,090
Feeling alone within a family

624
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,550
is lonelier than
being alone anywhere else.

625
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,970
It makes you feel sad and small.

626
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,730
What I'm most worried about
is that our Ho-su will feel that way too.

627
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,020
Let's not make Ho-su feel lonely.

628
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,780
I'll be back soon.

629
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,200
It's not like he's even healthy.

630
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,490
You'll have to take care of him
his whole life.

631
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,370
Why take on that burden?

632
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,000
Since when did you two worry about me?

633
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,040
What?

634
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,460
You two…

635
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,010
Our family…

636
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,470
When did you ever care about me?

637
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,770
You're just embarrassed.

638
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,020
You said you were embarrassed
to call me family

639
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,820
because I didn't have a decent job
and got married late to a man with a kid.

640
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,530
Hey!

641
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,740
We said those things for your sake!

642
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,780
For my sake?

643
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,990
You should go now.

644
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,660
Bun-hong.

645
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,210
If you decide to raise him,
then you're no longer family.

646
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,880
Choose. Him or us?

647
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,040
Don't you know?

648
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,340
I chose a long time ago.

649
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,180
Are you really going to cut ties with us
for that brat who's not even yours?

650
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,930
What did you say?

651
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,890
"That brat"?

652
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,060
"That brat"?

653
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,560
Who are you to call him that?

654
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,610
He's my son.

655
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,610
You have no right to call my son that!

656
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,950
Your mom and I went
to the same high school.

657
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,080
Nice to meet you.

658
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,620
It's so good to see you. Gosh!
Yes, it is.

659
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,500
He's a bit quiet.

660
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,540
Yes.

661
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,250
He takes after me.

662
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
He's always been a little shy.

663
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,550
I wish he had taken after his late dad
in that regard.

664
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,720
But he's just like me.

665
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,100
Why are you doing all this?

666
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,930
You don't have to pretend
we're family when nobody is around.

667
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,730
I…

668
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,310
I was just doing it for you--

669
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,770
If you care about me…

670
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,150
then just ignore me.

671
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,430
An-na, it's been ages!

672
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,760
What do you mean?
Who's in critical condition?

673
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,980
Your sisters didn't tell you
that your mother is sick?

674
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,690
I know they cut ties with you,
but how could they not tell you?

675
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,910
Hey, it's me! Where's Mom?

676
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,960
Which hospital is she in?
I'll go there right now.

677
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,540
Don't come. Mom is fine now.

678
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,880
Where is she?

679
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,460
You should've told me
that Mom was in critical condition.

680
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
You're not even family. Why do you care?

681
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,640
What?

682
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,760
How dare you call me
after cutting ties with us and leaving?

683
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,720
This is a family matter,
so we'll handle it.

684
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,680
Mind your own business.

685
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,810
Wait.

686
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,110
Hey!

687
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,830
One ticket for Duson Terminal, please.

688
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,750
There are no tickets for that destination.

689
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,960
The last bus just left.

690
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,500
What?

691
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,750
Hi.

692
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,580
It's me, Bun-hong.

693
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,170
Are you Mi-ji or Mi-rae?

694
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,170
Mi-ji.

695
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,180
I…

696
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,470
I've just done something very stupid!

697
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,850
I got on the wrong bus
and ended up very far from home.

698
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,400
So I won't be able to get home today.

699
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,780
Please tell Ho-su that tomorrow morning…

700
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,360
I'll get the first bus back home.

701
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,780
So could you tell him to lock up
before going to bed?

702
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,500
The truth is,

703
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,540
I had a small fight with Ho-su today.

704
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,170
Don't tell him that I told you.

705
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,590
Yes, thank you.

706
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,970
We were classmates--
She's my girlfriend.

707
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,020
So you lied because of me?

708
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,190
That's not what I meant.

709
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,650
Let's head back.

710
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,190
Jeez! Am I a compulsive liar or something?

711
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,450
Why did I lie about that?

712
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,120
This must be a new record.

713
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,370
How could I disappoint him as soon
as he introduced me as his girlfriend?

714
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,500
Why is nothing working out today?

715
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,260
MR. PARK SANG-YEONG

716
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,390
MR. PARK SANG-YEONG

717
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,810
Why is he suddenly calling me?

718
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:39,170
MI-RAE! I LOVE YOU!

719
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,030
Why did that jerk call out of the blue?

720
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,780
Is he really returning soon?

721
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,450
I need to back out of
this new HQ project before he does.

722
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,620
CONFIDENTIAL

723
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,870
How do I do that
without getting in trouble?

724
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,430
Excuse me, sir.

725
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,810
Hello.

726
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,220
Mr. Park!

727
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,980
Hey, you're back!

728
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,520
Sang-yeong!

729
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,350
Oh my.
Oh my gosh!

730
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,650
You're back already?

731
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,520
Welcome back.
How have you been?

732
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,190
You look great.
Oh, come on. I'm still…

733
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,780
You look good.

734
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,610
How have you been?
That guy is Park Sang-yeong?

735
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,120
How have you been?
How was it?

736
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,640
How have you been?
Well, I…

737
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,190
How have you been?

738
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,590
If you were to meet…

739
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,260
someone who looks just like Dad,

740
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,590
how do you think you'd feel?

741
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,140
Dad? That's a random question.

742
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,720
Well…

743
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,940
I think I'd be surprised,

744
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,270
and then I'd feel happy.

745
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,900
I would want to talk to him
and spend time with him.

746
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,240
Even if he's not our dad…

747
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,820
and he just looks like him?

748
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:55,410
I'd know that in my head,
but I think I'd still be drawn to him.

749
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,120
What about you?
How do you think you'd feel?

750
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,040
I would hope that he's a good person,

751
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,880
like our dad.

752
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,710
MI-JI

753
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,920
One, two, three. My goodness.

754
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,430
I used to fold your thermals
like that, you know.

755
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,070
Grandma, I'm going back to Seoul now.

756
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,360
Will you come back soon?

757
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,740
Or are you going to stay in Seoul?

758
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,580
I don't know.

759
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,330
Why don't you know?

760
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,950
You're the one making the decision.

761
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,870
Grandma…

762
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,130
If I decide…

763
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,840
to stay here like I am right now,

764
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,380
would it be too pathetic?

765
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:38,390
If I say no,

766
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,850
won't it be pathetic?

767
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,600
You're right. I just feel pathetic.

768
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,270
I feel like I keep making
the same mistake.

769
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,360
Mistake?

770
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,990
I shouldn't be relying on someone

771
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,870
just because I'm having
a tough time right now.

772
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,830
I already went through this before.

773
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,620
But I keep wanting to trust that person.

774
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,380
I feel so pathetic.

775
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,010
I feel…

776
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,130
very pathetic too.

777
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,720
I can't even use the restroom by myself.

778
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,060
Grandma, you can't help that, though.

779
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,810
You can't help how you feel either.

780
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,780
Don't call yourself pathetic.

781
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,640
Ma'am, I'm here.

782
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,770
Can we get more water here?

783
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,810
Okay.

784
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,490
Hyeon Sang-wol. You know her, right?

785
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,120
Why are you bringing up
a dead person's name out of the blue?

786
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,080
I heard you two were like family
up until she died.

787
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,370
You're even talking to me
just because I mentioned her name.

788
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:37,760
Sell your restaurant to KFMC.

789
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,760
Then you'll never have to see me

790
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,550
or hear the name Hyeon Sang-wol again.

791
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,640
I already declined
through my legal representative.

792
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,810
Did Ho-su tell you
that everything was settled?

793
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,900
Do you two know each other?

794
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,360
He didn't tell you?

795
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,700
He was my favorite junior colleague.

796
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,370
Enjoy your meal.

797
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,000
Ma'am, you said you had a favor to ask.

798
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,540
Should I come back later if you're busy?

799
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,510
You don't have to. I figured it out.

800
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,760
Pardon?

801
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,930
What was it about?

802
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,890
You don't need to worry about that.

803
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,810
You can go now.

804
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,110
Ms. Yu.

805
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,370
I'm sorry if I startled you.

806
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,410
You seemed uncomfortable inside
because of the other people.

807
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,080
Why…

808
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,010
Can I talk to you in private at lunch?

809
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,010
It won't take long.

810
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,230
So what did you want to talk about?

811
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:24,400
I heard earlier that you were in charge
of the new HQ project.

812
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,320
Is it true?

813
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,660
Yes, so what?

814
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,500
I was actually in charge of that project.

815
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,420
So before I officially
start working again,

816
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,420
I thought it'd be better
if we sorted things out first.

817
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,220
To be honest, I was a bit surprised
when I heard you volunteered for it.

818
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,890
Are you saying that I can't work on it
because it was your project?

819
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,760
No, Ms. Yu. That's not what I meant.

820
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,940
You already know this,
but everyone steers clear of that project.

821
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,150
People feel uncomfortable because
it's a task force led by the director.

822
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,900
And if things don't go well,

823
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,200
there's a chance that someone
on the very bottom would be blamed.

824
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,450
Just like Su-yeon.

825
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,330
That's why I decided to volunteer for it,

826
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,750
so when I heard you took over,
I was surprised.

827
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,210
I didn't mean it like that.
Don't get the wrong idea.

828
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,960
So how did you want to sort things out?

829
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,290
I think…

830
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,880
it's best if one of us
stops working on the project.

831
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,430
It'll give people less reason to gossip.

832
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,970
You want me to step down?

833
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,060
If I back out right now,

834
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,310
the company will find a way
to use that against me.

835
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,430
I can back out.

836
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,730
Pardon?
I heard that…

837
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,440
you worked very hard on it
while I was away.

838
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,190
It sounds like you made
a lot of progress too.

839
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,360
If you're willing to take the risk
and see this through…

840
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,950
then I'll back out.

841
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,910
But if you're not backing out

842
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,870
because you're worried
about the repercussions,

843
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,540
then I can take care of that for you.

844
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,090
Either way, I'll make sure
you're not put in a difficult position.

845
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,420
Do whatever you want to do.

846
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,590
Why would you go that far for me?

847
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,390
You mentioned before…

848
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,140
that I look a lot like your late father.

849
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,320
You said you still miss him sometimes
because he was such a good person.

850
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:29,280
That's probably why you trusted me
so much and relied on me.

851
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,580
But I feel like I didn't live up
to your expectations.

852
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,910
I feel bad about that.

853
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,920
I'll back out.

854
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,010
But in exchange, please make sure
that I don't get penalized in any way.

855
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,220
Okay. I will.

856
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,220
I have something to give you.
It's not much, but…

857
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,650
It's a bookmark.

858
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,070
Mi-rae helped me pick it out yesterday.

859
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:15,530
I don't know if you'll like it.
It's what Mi-rae liked.

860
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,200
What are you talking about? When did I…

861
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:22,330
I'm sorry.
That must've sounded confusing.

862
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,920
I was talking about my Mi-rae.

863
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,510
My daughter.

864
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,220
Gosh, Mi-rae has grown so much
in a short period of time.

865
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,890
I've heard that other kids
always ask for their moms,

866
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,640
but she's such a Daddy's girl.

867
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:46,020
She's always asking for me
when she's playing or sleeping.

868
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:48,860
Mi-ji.

869
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:59,240
Knock, knock. Can I come in?

870
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:05,960
Goodness.

871
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,880
Mi-ji.

872
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,300
Why are you pouting?

873
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,760
Do you want to give me a kiss?

874
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:18,430
Gosh, you're not even looking at me.

875
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,480
I guess I should just
go see Mi-rae at the hospital again.

876
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,860
Okay. I'm sorry.

877
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,900
Gosh, I'm sorry. I was just kidding.

878
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,860
Goodness.

879
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,240
What made you so upset and sad, Mi-ji?

880
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,580
You and Mom only like Mi-rae.

881
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:46,330
I wish I was sick too.

882
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,340
You're jealous of Mi-rae?

883
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,800
Mi-ji.

884
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,010
Can I tell you a secret?

885
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,350
Mi-rae said she envies you
more than anyone else in the world.

886
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,900
Why?

887
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,110
Because you can hold your breath
underwater for more than a minute.

888
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:15,650
Plus, you can drink whole milk.
You can even do a handstand too.

889
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,700
Mi-rae cried
and said that she wants to be like you.

890
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,950
Sweetie, give me your hand.

891
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,460
Mi-rae collected
all the sky blue ones for you.

892
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,000
She wouldn't give me a single one.

893
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,720
Mi-ji.

894
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,390
Even when I'm not with you,

895
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:44,810
you and Mi-rae
are still both my favorites, okay?

896
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,130
MI-RAE

897
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,050
Hello.

898
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,090
What are you doing?

899
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,640
Are you getting ready to come back?

900
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,470
Yes. Why?

901
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,180
Has something happened at the office?

902
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,060
No, I'm just calling.

903
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,610
I was just curious
if you were wrapping things up.

904
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,570
Have you decided what to do?

905
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,570
No, I haven't fully decided yet,

906
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,990
but I have an idea.

907
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,740
What is it?

908
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,580
I'll tell you later.
It's too early to tell you.

909
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,040
Then who would you talk to about it?

910
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,550
Is it something you would have
spoken to Dad about?

911
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,670
What?

912
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,840
I met Park Sang-yeong.

913
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,850
Mi-ji…

914
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,850
I don't know what he told you, but…

915
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,140
Mi-rae.

916
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:15,230
I don't care about what he says
or what the rumor says.

917
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:19,490
What I want to know
is your side of the story, Mi-rae.

918
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:23,200
Even if you can't tell anyone else,
you can be honest with me.

919
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,410
So why aren't you telling me? Why?

920
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,080
Because no one believes me.

921
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,250
No matter how much I insisted
that it isn't true, no one believed me.

922
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,090
But if you don't believe me either,
then I really…

923
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,710
But I know.

924
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,510
No one else in the world
may understand you,

925
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,800
but I know it's because of Dad.

926
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,600
I told myself I'd spit

927
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,810
in the face of that darn Park Sang-yeong
if I ever met him.

928
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,640
But when I finally saw him…

929
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,480
I started tearing up.

930
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,400
I knew he wasn't our dad,

931
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,450
but I couldn't even talk right,
like an idiot.

932
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,660
You must've felt the same way, Mi-rae.

933
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,120
So why didn't you tell me, you idiot?

934
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,790
Because I felt like a fool.

935
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,590
I feel so stupid for letting…

936
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,170
someone like him remind me of Dad

937
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,510
and for wanting him to be a good person.

938
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,220
You're so…

939
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,390
What is wrong with us?

940
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,560
We couldn't even tell each other
that we missed Dad,

941
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:40,070
so we ended up…

942
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,970
Mi-ji. Yesterday, I…

943
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,970
Are you free tomorrow?

944
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,240
I'm… sorry.

945
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,490
Your cellphone
is practically attached to you

946
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,530
now that you're in a relationship.

947
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,580
No, I…

948
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:35,000
So, why did you want to see me so late?

949
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,960
You said you were helping someone
last time. Are you done with that?

950
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,960
If you are,
then you should go for an interview.

951
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,750
You know A&A, right?

952
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,300
It's not one of the top three firms,
but it's a decent one.

953
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:50,760
Gosh, it's not just decent.
It's a great place.

954
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,010
But…

955
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,310
Mr. Lee has probably
already spoken to them about me…

956
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:57,390
Mr. Lee.

957
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,020
He's not the only one
with connections, you know?

958
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,730
I have them too.

959
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:05,690
The lawyer I worked for
as a newbie is a partner there.

960
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:09,570
I've already told them about you,
so you should go for an interview.

961
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,530
Did you also tell them
how I ended up quitting?

962
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:17,160
Gosh, I recommended you,
so they won't even care about that!

963
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,250
Let's go eat.

964
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,020
SENIOR SPECIALIST YU MI-RAE

965
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,980
I'm ready now.

966
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,940
So I'll take care of the rest myself
when I'm back.

967
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,440
Don't worry.

968
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,200
Why aren't you eating lunch?

969
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,330
I'm just organizing my desk.

970
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:58,000
You looked like you were having
a hard time yesterday.

971
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:02,960
Will you be okay handling
the new HQ project with Mr. Park back?

972
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,000
I backed out of that.

973
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,670
Pardon?
Even without Mr. Park,

974
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,550
I would've dropped the project anyway.

975
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,720
Why, though?

976
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,180
You worked so hard on it.

977
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,810
I don't know how much longer
I'll keep working here,

978
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,690
so I don't see the point
in working so hard.

979
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,650
Starting next week,
I'm going to live a little differently.

980
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,690
So don't be surprised
if I act like someone else.

981
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,410
I mean, I'm totally fine.

982
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,290
Thank you for being so nice to me, Tae-i.

983
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,920
From now on…

984
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:47,040
please be even nicer to me.

985
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,720
HO-SU

986
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,480
Do you have time after work today?

987
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,770
You look awful. My gosh.

988
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,030
Step aside.

989
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,160
What is it? What do you want?

990
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:20,160
I came to help you wash your greasy hair.

991
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,540
Got a problem?

992
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,040
Gosh, that's okay.
I can go to a hair salon.

993
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,710
Like hell you will.

994
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,800
As if you'd go to a hair salon
looking like that.

995
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,260
Come on. Hurry up.

996
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,390
What's the point of having a great son?

997
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,680
You don't have anyone
to help you wash your hair.

998
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,600
Why did Ho-su go back so soon
when he doesn't even work now?

999
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:48,770
I told him to hurry up and go back.

1000
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,900
I didn't want him
to see me looking like a mess.

1001
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,740
Jeez, you're not dating him.

1002
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,780
Why are you shy around your own son?

1003
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,580
Sometimes, when I look at you two,

1004
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,540
I feel like I'm watching
an educational show instead of a family.

1005
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,330
You're always so polite
and proper to each other.

1006
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,250
Even actors don't act like that.

1007
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,920
What I'm saying is…

1008
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,010
Ho-su isn't like other kids his age.

1009
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,720
He's so calm and collected.

1010
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,100
Was Ho-su's dad that quiet?

1011
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,020
No, Ho-su's mom was.

1012
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,480
Jeez.

1013
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,690
Quiet? The chaotic Yeom Bun-hong?

1014
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,690
He's not like you at all.

1015
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,070
You're being ridiculous.

1016
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,610
Not me.

1017
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,610
Ho-su's biological mom.

1018
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,370
Hey.

1019
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,990
What are you talking about?

1020
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,830
I'm not Ho-su's mom.

1021
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,380
Ho-su's dad remarried.

1022
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,090
I knew it.

1023
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:57,470
I knew you were sharp.

1024
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:01,050
I tried acting like a mom,

1025
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,100
but I never knew how to.

1026
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,930
No matter how hard I tried,
I was just a poor imitation.

1027
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,650
We probably never even seemed
like a real family.

1028
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,060
My gosh.

1029
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:16,530
Hey.

1030
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,240
You don't have to give birth to be a mom.

1031
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:21,570
You just give them your DNA.

1032
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,830
There are so many people
who don't deserve to be parents.

1033
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,250
Giving birth doesn't
automatically make you a mom.

1034
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,830
Take me, for example.

1035
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:31,830
I gave birth to two kids,
but I can't even tell them apart.

1036
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,800
I saw how you raised your son.

1037
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,720
An "imitation"?

1038
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,010
You think you can raise a kid
the way you did by imitating other moms?

1039
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,100
Bun-hong.

1040
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,100
You raised Ho-su all by yourself.

1041
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:52,060
If you two aren't a real family,
then who in the world is?

1042
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,530
What are you doing? Bend over.

1043
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,330
Make sure you rinse it properly.

1044
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,540
It all got into my eyes.

1045
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,170
I'm doing a pretty good job,
so stop complaining.

1046
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,840
I should just go take a shower instead.

1047
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,570
I'm ready, so talk.

1048
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,200
Ready for what?

1049
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:52,620
I'm ready to listen to whatever
you have to say, so go ahead.

1050
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:58,550
Should I just go first?

1051
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,010
I lied because I was embarrassed.

1052
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,220
What?

1053
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,390
Before, I said I lied because
I didn't want you to be embarrassed.

1054
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,730
But honestly, I lied
because I'm the one who was embarrassed.

1055
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,860
I was flustered because no one's
ever asked what my job was before.

1056
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:22,950
Everyone in Duson-ri knows
that I'm unemployed.

1057
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,320
And I pretended to be Mi-rae in Seoul.

1058
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,410
If you'd said I was just a friend,
I might not have lied.

1059
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,540
But as your girlfriend,

1060
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,960
I couldn't bring myself
to say I'm unemployed.

1061
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,500
I'm sorry I'm like this.

1062
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,590
There are so many things
I have never done,

1063
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,920
so there's a lot that I don't know.

1064
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,930
I didn't even know
we were a couple until then.

1065
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,800
We weren't a couple?

1066
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:52,600
How would I know?
I've never dated anyone before.

1067
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,560
We were hanging out like it was a date,

1068
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,440
but since you were so quiet,
I assumed you were bored.

1069
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,730
It seemed like you were in a bad mood.

1070
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:04,860
I felt like you saw me as one
of those restaurants that had shut down.

1071
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,280
I was sick that day.

1072
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:10,870
You were sick?

1073
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,120
From straining yourself that day?

1074
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:16,420
I wasn't feeling great
even before I left for Seoul.

1075
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,920
I had a fever, and my body ached.

1076
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:24,840
Did you catch a cold that night
when you were waiting for me?

1077
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,760
Why didn't you tell me?

1078
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,010
I didn't want to be a burden.

1079
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
What?

1080
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,930
I got sick just because
I was outside for a while.

1081
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,310
I couldn't even wander around with you
like you wanted.

1082
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,150
When we were choosing a destination,

1083
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:43,440
you first had to check
if there were any hills or stairs.

1084
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,650
In the future, there will be more days
when I'm a burden to you.

1085
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,280
So at least for our first date…

1086
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,080
I just wanted to be a normal boyfriend.

1087
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,290
I criticized you for lying

1088
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:05,760
when I couldn't even bring myself
to tell you that I wasn't feeling well.

1089
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:09,680
I'm sorry.

1090
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:15,640
I'm sorry too.

1091
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,940
It's a little late, but I look forward
to spending time with you.

1092
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,480
Maybe what I really wanted

1093
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:05,570
wasn't to become a perfect person or pair,

1094
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:08,650
but rather a complete whole.

1095
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,570
Broken pieces that embrace each other

1096
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,870
and make up for each other's shortcomings…

1097
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,120
somehow become one unconventional whole.

1098
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,090
Hey, there.

1099
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,220
What did you want to talk about?
I'm nervous.

1100
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,390
I've been thinking…

1101
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,470
about that option you mentioned before.

1102
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,930
Hold on. Let me take this call.

1103
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,270
I'll be right back. Warm up by the heater.

1104
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,280
Hello? Yes.

1105
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:59,750
TO: MI-RAE
FROM: SECRET SANTA

1106
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:03,420
Well, look who it is! Yu Candy is here!

1107
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,210
Where did Se-jin go?

1108
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,340
He went to take a quick phone call.

1109
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,630
I see.

1110
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:14,220
Are you planning to take over this place?

1111
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,640
Pardon?
You're not?

1112
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,720
I heard Se-jin is looking
for someone to take over after him.

1113
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,060
Someone to take over?
He didn't tell you?

1114
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:24,060
He said he doesn't think he'll be able
to finish this year's farming.

1115
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,310
So he's looking for someone to take over.

1116
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,570
Why did he make such a fuss
about those new varieties

1117
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:33,150
when he wasn't even going
to see things through?

1118
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,240
He's so fickle.

1119
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,700
Why can't he see things through?

1120
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,990
I don't know.
I didn't get all the details.

1121
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:45,830
I think he's going to the States
to start working again or something.

1122
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:52,420
Excuse me.

1123
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:56,550
You're leaving?

1124
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,310
I should've taken you home.

1125
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,350
That would be silly.

1126
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:06,850
Why would you take me home again
when I already walked you home?

1127
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,520
We would be going back and forth.

1128
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,190
I'm almost home now.

1129
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,570
I'll shower and call you again after.

1130
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:16,700
Okay.

1131
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,660
You scared me.

1132
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,250
Tae-i?

1133
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,250
What brings you here?

1134
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,880
We need to talk.

1135
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,630
What do you want
to talk about at this hour?

1136
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,140
And how did you know where I live?

1137
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:42,100
It's something I couldn't talk about
at work or over the phone.

1138
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,520
Why would you talk about
something like that with me?

1139
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:50,520
I don't know what it's about,

1140
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:54,820
but it's too late right now.
Let's talk tomorrow during the day.

1141
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,570
I'm Kim Su-yeon's younger brother.

1142
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:03,950
Pardon?

1143
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,290
My older sister is Kim Su-yeon,

1144
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,580
the Senior Specialist
who left the company.

1145
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,340
What?

1146
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,590
Mi-rae agreed to back out that easily?

1147
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,840
To be honest,

1148
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,430
it wasn't an easy decision for her.

1149
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:27,430
But when I begged her,

1150
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,480
she fortunately agreed.

1151
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,860
Good work, Mr. Park.

1152
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,690
This wasn't the original plan,

1153
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,610
but somehow things went sideways.

1154
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,280
You heard that
the contractor has been decided, right?

1155
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,870
Yes, I heard
Sihan Construction was selected.

1156
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:50,500
The project has gotten even bigger
than I thought.

1157
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,790
We can't afford to have any issues.
Yes, sir.

1158
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,050
We should've gotten rid
of any potential risks

1159
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,840
before finalizing the contractor.

1160
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,010
If you're talking about Ms. Yu…

1161
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,770
I don't think
you need to worry, given her personality.

1162
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,520
You have no idea, do you?

1163
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,020
She's been acting strange
ever since you went abroad.

1164
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,650
Don't you think so, sir?

1165
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,820
She does seem different from usual.
Gosh.

1166
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,440
We need to transfer Mi-rae

1167
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,450
to the Childal Branch
before she causes trouble.

1168
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,200
I don't know what's gotten into her.

1169
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,450
She used to just stare at the wall,
but now she's a different person.

1170
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:31,040
Maybe there are two people
that look like one.

1171
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,130
What do you mean?

1172
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:40,050
I heard that Ms. Yu has a twin.

1173
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,840
An identical twin.

1174
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:43,680
A twin?

1175
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:15,170
Ms. Yu, can we talk?

1176
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,210
Ms. Yu.

1177
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,000
You're not busy right now, are you?

1178
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,210
Come with me.

1179
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,850
SECURITY OFFICE
EMERGENCY RESPONSE ROOM

1180
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,400
What is it?

1181
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,860
It's nothing. I'm just amazed.

1182
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,070
RESTRICTED AREA

1183
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,860
Why are we
at the data processing room?

1184
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:49,330
The director said there's something
he needs to check in the call recordings.

1185
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,990
Hello, sir.

1186
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,960
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning.

1187
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,750
What are you waiting for? Scan it.

1188
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,050
Pardon?

1189
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,170
DATA PROCESSING ROOM

1190
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,340
Scan your fingerprint.

1191
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:14,020
Why are you asking me to do it
when you can do it?

1192
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,190
My finger's like this, so I can't.

1193
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,900
Hurry up and scan it.

1194
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,360
What?

1195
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:28,780
Did you hurt finger too?

1196
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:30,870
Or…

1197
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
is there another reason why you can't?

1198
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,700
YU MI-JI

1199
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,410
If this is true, it'll be chaos.

1200
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:11,870
Did you upload that post
to the anonymous forum?

1201
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,330
About what?
Reporting the company.

1202
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:15,660
Why do I have to fight?

1203
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,410
You said you needed to tell me something.

1204
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:19,210
Why can't I reach you?
Did something happen?

1205
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:22,840
Have you heard of an adult guardianship?

1206
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,010
I'll give you a bit of money
for the trouble, so please think about it.

1207
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,300
If you're going back

1208
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,800
because you got nowhere to stay,
then sleep here.

1209
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,220
May I take a look?
Your old hairstyle was pretty too.

1210
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,270
It looked pretty even when it was shorter.

1211
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:36,980
You look pretty.

1212
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,190
