OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,843
When Mi-ji's dream
was to own a stationery store,

3
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,804
mine was to become a tree.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,597
- Hello.
Hi.

5
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,267
The nurse is here.

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
- Time for her shot.
Okay.

7
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,647
She's getting the shot…

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,232
Yes.
…on her left arm, right?

9
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,277
If I were a tree, needles wouldn't hurt.

10
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,029
Why did I have to be sick…

11
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,699
Her veins…
…making everyone suffer…

12
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,077
Stop poking around and do it right.
…feel sad and get mad?

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,580
Mi-rae, are you okay? You did great.

14
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,082
You're okay, right?
That's when I started

15
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,125
pretending to be a tree…

16
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,294
Just a little pinch.
…quietly enduring everything.

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,630
I couldn't do anything about the pain,

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,843
but I could choose not to cry.

19
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,762
And with that,
we hereby present this award.

20
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,446
I may not have stood out,

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,365
but I knew how to endure.

22
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,165
Seriously? A blackout?

23
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you call home?

24
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,544
I already told Mom
I wouldn't be home tonight.

25
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,174
I wasn't planning to come here, though.

26
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,594
This is only going to fuel the rumors.

27
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,429
We're screwed.

28
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,473
Jeez.

29
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,686
Seriously, why did you come?

30
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,107
My friend said he could take me
anywhere I wanted,

31
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,610
but this was the only place
I could think of.

32
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,403
Why?

33
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,490
Because what's out there is fake,

34
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,034
and this place is real.

35
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,035
At least to me.

36
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,874
Then why do you hate the rumors so much?

37
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,461
There's no reason to like them.

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,007
I like them.

39
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,676
The rumors about us.

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,818
If you're hungry or cold, just say so.

41
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,653
Why don't you ever say anything?

42
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,322
How can you say nothing

43
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,658
until your stomach
is growling like thunder?

44
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,537
Noodles first?

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,955
Or the seasoning?

46
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,665
That is the question.

47
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,709
For the record, I'm team seasoning.

48
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,337
You have to put the toppings in first

49
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,089
so the veggie flavors really seep in.

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:38,176
They say you can put the noodles in
before the water boils.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,639
But dropping the noodles into cold water
just doesn't sit right with me.

52
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,767
Your name is Han Se-jin?

53
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,352
You didn't even know my name?

54
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,437
Wait!

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,690
I didn't collect those.
That was all my grandfather…

56
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,693
You're the Han Se-jin
from Ihan Asset Management?

57
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,319
How do you know me?

58
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,405
Are you into stocks?

59
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,409
There's even a novel based
on the public takeover bid for Hyudi Bio.

60
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,036
And Yeongmin Steel?
You persuaded the minority shareholders

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,664
and took over the company
with just a one percent margin.

62
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,168
If that happened in a TV show,
people would say it's too far-fetched…

63
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,755
What?

64
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,632
So you're not quiet.
You just chose not to talk.

65
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,634
How did you stay so quiet until now?

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,095
I like this version of you.

67
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,222
Don't stop now. Tell me more.

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,808
Never mind.

69
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,185
From the sound of it,

70
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,479
you're more interested
in activist funds than me.

71
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,440
"Interested" is an understatement.
My thesis was on shareholder activism--

72
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,650
High school seniors
write thesis papers these days?

73
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,235
No…

74
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,403
I read about it.

75
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,822
There were a lot of papers on that topic.

76
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,619
If you're reading academic papers,
this isn't just a casual interest.

77
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,331
But how can you know my whole background
and still not recognize my face?

78
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,543
I just never imagined
you'd be here running a farm.

79
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,670
Then what did you imagine?

80
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,299
What was the most popular theory? Russia?

81
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,384
That you were tied to the Russian Mafia.

82
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,806
That you had gambling debts in Macau,
or even that you embezzled 50 billion won.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,476
But I never believed any of it.
It all sounded like nonsense.

84
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,602
Impressive.

85
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,104
But you skipped the
"betrayed by a business partner" rumor.

86
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,564
Did you believe that one?

87
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,361
It's all just gossip.

88
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,238
Mr. Lee, the CEO, wasn't that bad.

89
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,073
Then again,

90
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,117
he wasn't exactly the type
to brave a typhoon for a partner.

91
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,994
Jeez.

92
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,000
Seriously though, why did you quit?

93
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,169
You disappeared overnight.

94
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,964
Do you want to know?

95
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,469
I'll tell you the day after tomorrow.

96
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,307
Gosh, why the day after tomorrow
and not tomorrow?

97
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,434
That just seems like the right time.

98
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,398
But now that we're talking,
I've got a question too.

99
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,360
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,322
For someone this quiet
to go on and on like that,

101
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,658
you must clearly love this stuff.

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,286
Ever considered working in finance?

103
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,912
I…
For now,

104
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,082
forget about your educational background
or qualifications.

105
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,750
I want to know how you really feel.

106
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,752
Well,

107
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,506
just because you like something
doesn't mean you can do it.

108
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,217
Why not?

109
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,261
Every family has its own issues,

110
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,347
and mine is no different.
I can't just think about myself.

111
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,558
Why not?
What do you mean?

112
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,685
My family has sacrificed so much for me.

113
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,313
How could I just do whatever I want?

114
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,693
Honestly, everything you're saying

115
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,737
is no different
from the Russian Mafia rumors.

116
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,281
What?

117
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,199
Those are not the real reasons.

118
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,661
I want to know the real one.

119
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:01,671
EPISODE 7
A CHILD UNDERNEATH IT ALL

120
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:13,350
KOREA FINANCE MANAGEMENT CORPORATION

121
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,396
You're on your way, right?
It's the same meeting room as before.

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,731
YU MI-RAE

123
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,274
I'm almost there.

124
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,736
You want me to decline, no matter what?

125
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,155
Next time you go to the office,

126
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,659
just tell them I'm not selling.

127
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,454
But we gained the upper hand
in the last meeting.

128
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,166
I can negotiate any terms you want.

129
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,877
I don't want anything.

130
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,548
Just wrap it up neatly
so nothing else comes up.

131
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,593
And so your friend gets in less trouble.

132
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,514
Come on in.

133
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,517
He's here.

134
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,613
I was wondering
which law firm you ended up at.

135
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,368
If I'd known you opened your own,
I would've at least sent flowers.

136
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,078
Let's just say you did.

137
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,791
You came all this way to see me
for such a minor case.

138
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,337
It's funny how people cross paths.

139
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,300
Just like unpaid bills,
some people are impossible to avoid.

140
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,388
I heard you were one
of Kim Ro-sa's scholarship students.

141
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,224
Did you take this case to repay her?

142
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,601
Or…

143
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,521
is it out of guilt for an old classmate?

144
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,981
WHISTLEBLOWER INVESTIGATION REPORT

145
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,819
She already knows everything.

146
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,697
But she doesn't know
you're the one who made me

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,407
the external investigator for the case.

148
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,577
Ms. Yu Mi-rae must be important to you

149
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,579
if you told her all that.

150
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,872
Let us get to the point.

151
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,586
My client is not interested
in selling the Rosa Restaurant.

152
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,006
I'm here today
to officially decline the offer.

153
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,469
You're turning it down flat,
without even negotiating. Why?

154
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,013
The landowner does not want to sell.

155
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,390
Do you need any other reason?

156
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,024
So you don't know either.

157
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,234
Excuse me?

158
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,987
There's always a reason
behind an unreasonable choice.

159
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,032
If you do not know what it is,

160
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,743
it means you either didn't care to ask,

161
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,455
or you're not trusted enough to be told.

162
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,041
It's one or the other.

163
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,129
Ho-su.

164
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,507
That's your problem.

165
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,719
You never cross the line,
all for your stubborn integrity.

166
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,679
You know what's going on
but remain silent.

167
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,140
That's not being considerate.

168
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,642
That's neglect.

169
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,437
You came here
just to say she's not selling?

170
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,817
That doesn't help Ms. Kim Ro-sa
or Ms. Yu one bit.

171
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,029
If anything, I'm the one helping them.

172
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,323
You are not helping. You are using them.

173
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,200
For your own benefit.

174
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,872
Do you even know
what Mi-rae's going through at work?

175
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,042
I do.

176
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,045
And I am trying to fix it.

177
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,672
Call it whatever you want,

178
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,758
but I am trying
to tip the scales in her favor.

179
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,927
You are the one

180
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,596
ruining that right now.

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,974
Sir.
So I'm telling you

182
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,350
to cross the line.

183
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,602
Don't just stand by.

184
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,063
Ask why and persuade her.

185
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,773
I'm giving you a chance.

186
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,985
Use it to help the people
who are important to you.

187
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,862
A chance?

188
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,572
She'll sell in the end.

189
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,615
You know me.

190
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,078
If I want something, I get it.

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,714
Hey, are you done already?

192
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,633
Figure out how you can help everyone.

193
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,968
Think hard.

194
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,437
Did he always look like this?

195
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,190
His lashes are pretty long.

196
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,234
Did he shape his brows?

197
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,322
And it looks like
he put something on his lips.

198
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,368
What?
Nothing.

199
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,622
Hey.

200
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,082
Are you busy next week?

201
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,876
Next week?

202
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,296
Why?

203
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,758
I was thinking
of getting you and Mi-ji together.

204
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,637
What?

205
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,263
It's just that…

206
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,266
she said she'd be in Seoul
sometime next week.

207
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,645
You said she's your first love.
You two should really talk.

208
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,022
She didn't go into details,

209
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,816
but apparently,
she has something to say to you.

210
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,195
Well…

211
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,822
Then just pick a time that works for her.

212
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,450
Cool.

213
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,913
Seriously,
what would you two do without me?

214
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,715
Hey…

215
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,385
You don't have to walk me out.

216
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,471
I'm going out for lunch.

217
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,932
Do you want to join me?

218
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,228
I have to meet someone today.

219
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,815
All right. Go ahead then.

220
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,113
Hey…

221
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,282
Let me know

222
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,450
when you

223
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,202
set something up with Mi-ji.

224
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,080
Sure.

225
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,749
See you.

226
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,350
PARK JI-YUN

227
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,602
Let's talk. We have things to discuss.

228
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,272
What does she need to talk about?

229
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,566
Is it about Ho-su?

230
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,705
Why are you still here?

231
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,836
I'm just waiting for someone.

232
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,797
Is this seat taken?

233
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,594
Now you're mocking me.

234
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,971
Right.

235
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,850
I guess you'd have to be that shameless
to keep showing up at work.

236
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,604
Excuse me. Who are you to--

237
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,356
That's disappointing.

238
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,192
I haven't gone a day
without thinking about you, Ms. Yu.

239
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,779
It's me.

240
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,531
Park Sang-yeong's wife.

241
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,621
Now you remember?

242
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,166
Don't you remember
what I told you, though?

243
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,085
If you had any decency,

244
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,587
you should've disappeared
before he came back.

245
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,256
Wasn't everything
humiliating enough for you?

246
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,467
What are you talking about--

247
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,593
Excuse me.

248
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,222
What the heck are you doing?
She's my friend.

249
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,015
Stay out of this.

250
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,644
This is between me and Ms. Yu Mi-rae.

251
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,647
Then go talk to Yu Mi-rae.

252
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,441
Why the hell are you taking it out
on the wrong person?

253
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,902
What?

254
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,073
She isn't Yu Mi-rae.

255
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,577
What… are you talking about…

256
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,039
If you've got the wrong person,
shouldn't you apologize first?

257
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,041
You're a new level of crazy.

258
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,293
Mi-ji, let's go.

259
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,212
What?

260
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,011
Why did you just sit there and take it?

261
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,721
Are you copying Mi-rae even on that?

262
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,642
Ji-yun, how did you…

263
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,270
Gosh, how do you think?

264
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,148
You always froze up
whenever I mentioned KFMC.

265
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,983
So I tested you.

266
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,653
Would you have applied there
if I hadn't pushed you to?

267
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,155
Honestly?

268
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,322
You're right.

269
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,287
Why would I encourage Mi-rae to apply
to the place I was dying to get into?

270
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,623
And she's not the kind to do something
just because I told her to.

271
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,585
That's what gave it away?

272
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,338
What really confirmed it

273
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,091
was what you said after.

274
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,051
What did I say?

275
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,970
That I sounded very mature

276
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,014
and you liked how honest I was.

277
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,683
That's the kind of thing you'd say, Mi-ji.

278
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,227
That's when I knew it was you.

279
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,899
At least,

280
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,568
I got to see you again.

281
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,946
I always wondered how you were doing.

282
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,825
But I didn't reach out
since you didn't like me.

283
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,661
Why would I not like you?

284
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,288
Don't play dumb.

285
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,499
You totally avoided me back then.

286
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,792
I just thought

287
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,754
you were disappointed in me.

288
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,839
Hey.

289
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,591
I am your number one fan.

290
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,260
Why would I ever be disappointed?

291
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,014
That doesn't even make sense.

292
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,105
So what was it
you wanted to talk about today?

293
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,941
Forget it.

294
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,445
I was pissed you stole Ho-su,
so I thought I'd make a scene.

295
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,658
But then I ended up arguing
with some random person instead.

296
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,786
Have you told Ho-su?

297
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,538
Does he know?

298
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,790
I don't know.

299
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,542
Maybe he does.

300
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,794
Maybe he doesn't.

301
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,338
So does he or doesn't he?

302
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,549
I'm not helping you with that.

303
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,300
Ask him yourself.

304
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,806
But seriously,
why didn't you say anything earlier?

305
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,977
I thought you'd at least
grab her hair or something.

306
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,478
You know her?

307
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,897
Do you know anything about her?

308
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,108
You really don't know?

309
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,904
Mi-rae didn't tell you about the rumors?

310
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,283
What rumors?

311
00:17:55,366 --> 00:18:00,121
There were rumors about
Mi-rae having an affair with her boss.

312
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,455
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

313
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,082
That woman was his wife.

314
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,794
She threw a fit at Mi-rae
in the company lobby,

315
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,920
so the rumors spread.

316
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,923
Hey, don't you know her?

317
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,634
She's a total stickler
when it comes to stuff like that.

318
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,721
An affair? With a married man?

319
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,640
Are you crazy?
She has no reason to stoop to that.

320
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,934
I didn't believe it at first, either.

321
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,687
But then people from KFMC
started commenting online,

322
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,189
and photos of her were spreading around.

323
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,274
I mean…

324
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,776
no one knows the full story.

325
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,361
She would never.

326
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,113
I can't believe you bought that.

327
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,117
Regardless of whether it's true or not,
it was a huge deal.

328
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,370
I saw the rumors
on the KFMC job prep forums.

329
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,789
Imagine what it was like at her office.

330
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,668
I'll send you the link. See for yourself.

331
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,212
Mi-rae, seriously…

332
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,090
Why didn't you tell me about any of this?

333
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,055
Were you home?

334
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,390
When did you get back? I didn't hear you.

335
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,184
I got back at the crack of dawn.

336
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,728
But why are you leaving for work now?

337
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,190
The school's temporarily closed.
They're doing typhoon recovery work.

338
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,859
It was chaos while you were in Seoul.

339
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,778
Power went out, bridges flooded…

340
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,738
Oh. Really?

341
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,492
Good thing Gyeong-gu got you to Seoul
before things got crazy.

342
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,827
It's been a while
since you went that far. Rest up.

343
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,913
I'm heading out.
Okay. Bye, Mom.

344
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,539
Okay, go get some rest.

345
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,624
All right.

346
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,004
Mi-ji.

347
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,673
Mi-ji!

348
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,049
What?

349
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,927
Here she comes. Come quickly!

350
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,056
Ho-su wants to talk to you.

351
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,975
I'm leaving. You two have a chat.

352
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,477
See you, Ho-su.

353
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,523
Do you want something to drink?

354
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,608
Sure.

355
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,324
What did you need to talk about
that made you come all this way?

356
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,159
We never got to

357
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,203
talk properly.

358
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,333
Didn't you say
everything you wanted to last time?

359
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,335
Not to you.

360
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,462
Mi-rae.

361
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,183
Oh my. Hello.

362
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,685
Oh dear.

363
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,062
What a disaster.
It's a total mess.

364
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,565
The school's a wreck.

365
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,692
Hey, should I join you?

366
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,653
Actually, could you head up
to the second floor?

367
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,572
We need to mop up there.

368
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,574
Sure thing.

369
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,203
By the way…
What?

370
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,456
Your son's here.

371
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,166
Ho-su?

372
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,959
He didn't say he was coming.

373
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,128
Are you sure?

374
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,380
He came to my house.

375
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,632
He had something to discuss with Mi-ji.

376
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,511
What would my Ho-su
need to discuss with Mi-ji?

377
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,766
How should I know?
He's the one who came by.

378
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,518
Whatever it was, he looked so serious

379
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,187
that it made Mi-ji flustered.

380
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,564
Maybe there's something
going on between them

381
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,815
and you just don't know.

382
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,777
You might end up as in-laws.

383
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,779
Come on, in-laws?

384
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,447
They're not like that.

385
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,574
What a thing to say.

386
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,203
Why so serious over a joke?

387
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,913
You're making things awkward.

388
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,290
Come on.

389
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,001
Ho-su and Mi-ji are barely acquaintances.

390
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,211
What she said was nonsense.

391
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,879
Jeez.

392
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,965
Are you suggesting
that my daughter isn't good enough?

393
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,926
Hey.

394
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,262
I don't want a son-in-law
who has to be waited on hand and foot.

395
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,820
What was that supposed to mean?

396
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,154
You startled me.

397
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,114
What are you talking about?

398
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,826
"A son-in-law who has to be
waited on hand and foot."

399
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,661
What about it?

400
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,455
It means your son is successful.
You didn't mean that.

401
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,291
You were clearly referring
to his physical issues.

402
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,086
Goodness, what the heck?

403
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,504
Don't you get metaphors?

404
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,131
Why use that kind of metaphor?

405
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,217
Do you think he's an invalid?

406
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,635
Or a patient?
What's with you?

407
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,886
He can't move?
Bun-hong.

408
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,138
Why would anyone need to wait on him?
For God's sake!

409
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,015
Did you just push me?

410
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,934
Apologize.

411
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,561
For what you said.

412
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,020
Goodness me.

413
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,231
I've got nothing to apologize for!

414
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,984
I didn't mean that.
Why are you making such a fuss?

415
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,361
Seriously. Move!

416
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,197
Do you have
a victim mentality or something?

417
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,700
Give me a break. Jeez.

418
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,917
Can we talk now?

419
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,545
Did Mi-ji tell you?

420
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,214
Are you two still meeting up?

421
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,426
If you're asking how I knew it was you,

422
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,178
I figured it out
after I saw you last time.

423
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,307
So you kept meeting up after all,

424
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,475
seeing how you didn't answer my question.

425
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,185
Does that…

426
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,146
matter to you?

427
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,189
Of course it does.

428
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,026
I told her to stop meeting you,

429
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,028
and Mi-ji promised she would.

430
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,197
So,

431
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,200
what did you want to talk about?

432
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,953
About Lead Specialist Park.

433
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,249
You filed a sexual harassment report
and then suddenly withdrew it.

434
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,626
Why?

435
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,461
That's over. What business is it of yours?

436
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,213
That's what I'm asking.
Did you do that because of me?

437
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,051
The day I came in
as an external investigator,

438
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,679
you disappeared as soon as you saw me,
and then you dropped the case.

439
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,891
I figured it was because of me,
but you ignored all my calls.

440
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,435
Now your twin is coming in
to work instead of you.

441
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,396
Is it really over?

442
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,900
Did you tell Mi-ji about this?

443
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,362
I thought she was you,
so I mentioned the case.

444
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,658
But Mi-ji seemed clueless,
and I didn't know much either.

445
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,700
So,

446
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,078
I came to ask you directly.

447
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,121
To see if I could help.

448
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:19,959
Help?

449
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,171
Who asked for your help?

450
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,131
It got complicated because of me.

451
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,801
Let me fix it.

452
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,434
What exactly happened
between you and Park Sang-yeong?

453
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,023
You're crossing a line.

454
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,819
I came to cross it.

455
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,455
MOM

456
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,669
MOM

457
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,881
SORRY I MADE YOU
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE

458
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,968
You accepted this project
knowing Mr. Park is in charge?

459
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,429
I made Mi-rae
look like a total psycho.

460
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,973
But why didn't she tell me anything?

461
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,059
She said she was standing up
for a senior who blew the whistle.

462
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,894
Then those jerks bullied you for a year

463
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,605
just because you said that
during the interview?

464
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,360
People don't need
a lot of reasons to hate someone.

465
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,653
Did you drop the case…

466
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,530
WHISTLEBLOWER INVESTIGATION REPORT

467
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,074
In cases like this,
when it's about sexual misconduct,

468
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,411
sometimes the victim drops the case

469
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,872
because they're worried
about rumors spreading.

470
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,794
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

471
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,422
If I tell you not to look,
just don't look.

472
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,759
We promised
not to interfere in each other's lives.

473
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,055
I'll hear it from her later.

474
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,391
MI-JI

475
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,857
Ms. Kim Ok-hui and Yeom Bun-hong.
That's us.

476
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,317
You both slipped on the stairs…

477
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,736
It was her. She pushed me.
…and showed signs of concussion.

478
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,072
She yanked my hair.
The stitches were done well.

479
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,825
The orthopedist will decide tomorrow
whether you need metal pins.

480
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,411
A semi-private room just opened up,

481
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,081
so we'll keep them for one night or two
and see how it goes.

482
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,167
Mi-ji, I can't share a room with her.

483
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,377
No way.
Mom, what happened?

484
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,463
How did you both fall down the stairs?

485
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,381
You know what? I shouldn't be here.

486
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,966
I should be at the police station.

487
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,302
Who grabs someone by the hair
on the stairs?

488
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,221
That's attempted murder!

489
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,514
Jeez.
Good God.

490
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,350
You're making a fuss over a few stitches?

491
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,811
I might get a pin put in here.
Whatever.

492
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,980
You can't blame me for your own fall.

493
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,524
It was self-defense for me!

494
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,860
I see. Should we sort it out legally?

495
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,903
"Sort it out legally"?

496
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,196
Ho-su.
Good. Tell us.

497
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,407
Let's ask your lawyer son
what the law says and settle this.

498
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,743
Please. Calm down, both of you.

499
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,286
Check the surveillance footage.

500
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,705
Your mom pushed me. You know how she is.

501
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,083
What?
What did you say?

502
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,961
You'll be punished for this, Bun-hong.

503
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,504
Mom, stop.
You little…

504
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,339
I'm gonna win. You just watch.
Mom.

505
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,134
Look at all the hair…
Close the curtain. She's embarrassing.

506
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,093
…you pulled out!

507
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,596
Look, there's still hair
coming out of my head!

508
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,017
Jeez.

509
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,065
Did you call Mi-ji here?

510
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,693
Yes. Why?

511
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,570
Mi-ji doesn't know that I know.

512
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,030
So?
I know it's a weird thing to ask,

513
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,116
but can we pretend
that I don't know anything?

514
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,826
Please?
Hey.

515
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,161
Mi-rae!

516
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,674
Why did you ask me to come all of sudden?

517
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,176
And why are we in the hospital?

518
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,179
Mom got into a fight with Bun-hong
and got a little hurt.

519
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,972
She'll have to stay for a day or two.

520
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,684
What? Is that why Ho-su came down too?

521
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,103
She's asking why you're here.

522
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,399
I… just had something to take care of.

523
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,483
I see.

524
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,361
You had something to take care of.

525
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,290
How did you…

526
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,000
I told you I'd be late today.

527
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,543
I heard your mother was hospitalized.

528
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,421
I always get concerned
about the health issues of elders.

529
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,007
Mom's fine, so you can…

530
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,467
What the…

531
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,054
Ms. Seoul?

532
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,139
You look exactly…

533
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,558
She looks exactly like you!

534
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:47,726
Who are you?

535
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,853
It's me, the strawberry farmer!

536
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,897
Wait. You didn't send the strawberries?

537
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,816
That 200,000-won gig?

538
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,028
So you've told her about me.

539
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,199
We've met before, right?
You were waiting outside the house.

540
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,575
Yes.

541
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,910
Hello.

542
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,746
You should go now.

543
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,040
Go where? I've got nowhere to be.

544
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,417
No one's eaten yet, right?

545
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,212
Since we've run into each other,
let's go eat together.

546
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,843
Why are you three exchanging glances?

547
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,388
I see. You're trying to leave me out.

548
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,349
Everyone's tired, so--
Come on.

549
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,434
You still need to eat.

550
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,520
I'll treat you to something really good.

551
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,773
No more exchanging glances!

552
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,234
You all eat intestines, right?

553
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,944
Excuse me.

554
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,279
Hi.
Hello.

555
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,740
Intestines hot pot for three
and one pork cutlet, please.

556
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:44,908
Sure.

557
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,371
I can't handle the intestines.
I've got a weak stomach.

558
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,039
But this place is famous.

559
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,423
Should I take the lead here?

560
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,052
Let's introduce ourselves first.
We'll go around in a circle.

561
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,139
I'm Han Se-jin. Next!

562
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,727
I'm Lee Ho-su.

563
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,275
I'm Yu Mi-rae.
Mi-rae?

564
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,402
I like that name.

565
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,904
I heard you've been living in Seoul.

566
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,158
Where do you work--
Is that too personal?

567
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,369
I work at KFMC.
Korea Finance Management Corporation.

568
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,330
Impressive.

569
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,042
Did you major in that field--
Is that too personal?

570
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,336
Well…

571
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,047
I majored in economics.

572
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,674
You should ask her then.

573
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,551
My business partner here
is passionate about it

574
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,428
and digs through academic papers.

575
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,140
Do sisters
always have such similar interests?

576
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,184
Fascinating.
Wow.

577
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,062
I didn't know that about her.

578
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,898
What about you, Ho-su?

579
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,108
Wait. Don't say it. Let me guess.

580
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,402
I'm really good at this, so watch out.

581
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
Law?

582
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,366
I smell law.

583
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,035
You're in law school!

584
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,207
I graduated.
Wait, what? Oh my God.

585
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,626
I got it right! Look at these goosebumps.

586
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,337
By the way,

587
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,215
where's your farm located?

588
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,217
I might know it.

589
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,303
You've been living in Seoul,
so you probably don't.

590
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,597
It's across the bridge.
It's called Changhwa Farm.

591
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,848
What?

592
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,518
Isn't that the place
an old gentleman used to run by himself?

593
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,353
His grandson studied abroad.

594
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,896
Did you know my grandfather?

595
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,066
Yes. He was super quiet.

596
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:46,154
The only time he spoke
was when he bragged about his grandson.

597
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,824
So you're that grandson.

598
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,992
My goodness…

599
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,495
Hearing about my grandfather
from someone else

600
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,746
is making me emotional.

601
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,875
He called you a kid,
so I thought you were younger.

602
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,421
But you're pretty grown-up for a kid.

603
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,464
Was that a joke?

604
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,801
I like you even more, Ms. Seoul.

605
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,636
Let's shake hands. We have to.

606
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,680
All of a sudden?
Yes, all of a sudden.

607
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,433
Nice to meet you.

608
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,518
Let me help you.

609
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,815
I'll go start the car.

610
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,942
Okay.
Hey.

611
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,235
Hey, you.

612
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,653
So what is it?

613
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,905
Why did you make me come?

614
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,657
To end it.

615
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,617
End what?

616
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,327
You stay here now.

617
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,705
I'm going back to Seoul.

618
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,333
Wait. Hold on.

619
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,461
Just like that?

620
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,838
Ho-su is here too, you know.

621
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,965
If we switch back now and get caught…

622
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,843
You dummy. Ho-su knows.

623
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,053
He came down knowing we switched.

624
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,514
What?

625
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,809
I told you not to meet him.

626
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,394
Why did you?

627
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,062
No, I…

628
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,899
Forget it. We'll talk at home.

629
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,025
I mean…

630
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,492
Ho-su knew everything?

631
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,244
I was thinking of getting you
and Mi-ji together.

632
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,537
You said she's your first love.

633
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,749
Apparently,
she has something to say to you.

634
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,919
Seriously,
what would you two do without me?

635
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,379
This is so embarrassing.

636
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,800
Where's Mi-ji?
What? Over there.

637
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,385
She's going to the farm.

638
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,099
You're going home, right?

639
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,186
Yes, home.

640
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,021
When are you going
to the hospital tomorrow?

641
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,731
I might go in the morning.

642
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,071
I'm not sure. I'll talk to her.

643
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,322
What?

644
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,538
I…

645
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:03,333
I'll talk to Mi-ji later and decide.

646
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,931
Crap. This is mortifying.

647
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,933
He knows everything. Why did I say Mi-ji?

648
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,936
I'm too embarrassed to see him again!

649
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:29,234
I want to crawl into a hole.

650
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,041
Guys, I saw Mi-ji earlier.

651
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,626
What?
Really?

652
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,931
Ho-su, there you are!

653
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,141
CONGRATULATIONS, GRADUATES!

654
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,559
Are you Mi-rae or Mi-ji?

655
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,978
I'm Mi-ji.
Good.

656
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,689
The two of you
should take a picture together.

657
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,024
Go stand next to her.

658
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,364
All right. One, two, three.

659
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,783
One more.

660
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,203
Congratulations.
Thank you.

661
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,204
Sure.

662
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,629
What do I have to do to see Mi-ji?

663
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,803
I haven't seen much of her lately either.

664
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,599
Ever since she got hurt,
she hardly leaves her room.

665
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,227
I guess she doesn't want to see anyone.

666
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,792
I said I'd give you a ride,
not put you to work.

667
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,337
I'm feeling generous.

668
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,048
You get a special bonus today.

669
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,676
It's fine.

670
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,971
I just wanted to help out
as a thank-you for everything.

671
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,058
You sound like you're saying goodbye.

672
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,310
What is it?

673
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,813
Are you finally leaving
to chase your dreams?

674
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,191
If anything, I'm waking up from them.

675
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,572
By the way, Ms. Seoul was really nice.

676
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,367
From what I'd heard,
I thought she'd be super uptight,

677
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,743
but she was easygoing.

678
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,662
That's rare for someone so bookish.

679
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,288
I like her.

680
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,249
Everyone does.

681
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,128
Especially that look she gave me,
like, "Don't hit on my sister."

682
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,713
I loved it.

683
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,841
You can't use your family
as an excuse anymore.

684
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,428
Ms. Seoul looked like

685
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,931
the type who'd keep a lookout
if her partner was robbing a store.

686
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,392
Your family isn't worried,
but you are for no reason.

687
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,144
Why not just do what you want?

688
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,312
Why do you keep saying that?

689
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,106
What do you mean?

690
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,275
Since yesterday,
you've been saying I'm making excuses.

691
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,027
You've never lived my life,
so why are you judging me?

692
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,031
Not everyone can live like you, Se-jin.

693
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,994
Family, debt…
They may sound like lame excuses to you,

694
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,080
but to me, they're real and unavoidable.

695
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,294
I know. I've said all those things before.

696
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,048
Back in high school,

697
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,635
I randomly started studying
for the civil service exam.

698
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,220
I didn't want to study abroad.

699
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,224
I would've failed anyway.
There were too many technical terms.

700
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,895
But one day, Grandfather came
to the exam-prep center

701
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,730
and asked what I was doing there.

702
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,106
I gave the usual script.

703
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,650
"You've sacrificed everything for me."

704
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,903
"How can I just think about myself?"

705
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,362
"We've got debts."

706
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,907
"And I'm the only family you have."

707
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,244
Then he yelled,
which was totally out of character.

708
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,040
He said those weren't the real reasons,

709
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,375
and that they were just excuses.

710
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,211
Then…

711
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,505
what was the real reason?

712
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,507
I was scared.

713
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,134
Everyone assumed I'd do well,

714
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,678

EXAM QUESTIONS

721
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,733
I was afraid of not meeting expectations…

722
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,153
and of disappointing myself.

723
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,698
The fact that nothing was certain
made me anxious.

724
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,785
And I was scared
I'd feel that way forever.

725
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,581
But those reasons are silly.

726
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,459
What fool doesn't scratch a lottery ticket
just because it might be a dud?

727
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,627
Hey…

728
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,673
are you that fool?

729
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,190
Think about it.

730
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,568
What's the real reason you're hesitating?

731
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,583
Hey, you.

732
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,129
It's been ages
since we last shared a room.

733
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,756
Close the door.

734
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,299
You're going to bed already?

735
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,385
You said we'd talk at home.

736
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:33,014
Do you really want to go
to Seoul tomorrow?

737
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,059
What are you going to do with your hair?

738
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,227
We'll talk tomorrow.

739
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,313
Tomorrow?

740
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,940
What about work?

741
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,568
I'll take a day off,
so let's talk tomorrow.

742
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,947
I'm going to sleep. Close the door.

743
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,595
Come on.

744
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,766
Can't you just go to the hospital?
I'll go to the Youth Association thing.

745
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:21,062
I, Mi-rae, came from Seoul
just to help with typhoon recovery work?

746
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,148
Then does Mi-rae have to go
to the hospital?

747
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,818
Didn't you say Mom's not even that hurt?

748
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,488
Mi-rae could just call Mom
and visit Grandma…

749
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,573
If I took a day off, came home,

750
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,659
and went back without even seeing Mom,

751
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,661
what does that make me?

752
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,248
Go. Don't make me a bad daughter.

753
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,804
You're not waiting for me, right?
Mi-ji will be out soon.

754
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,930
Mi-rae.

755
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,476
We didn't get to finish our chat.
Later.

756
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,396
I'll call you when I'm done with work.

757
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,689
One more thing.

758
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,775
Thank you.

759
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,987
For not telling Mi-ji yesterday.

760
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,406
You could've just told her.

761
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,533
I did tell her.

762
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,833
Oh my!

763
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,001
Gosh.

764
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,962
Shoot, I…

765
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,297
forgot something.

766
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,882
Oh, you did?
Yes.

767
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,968
You can go get it. I'll wait here.

768
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,929
No, it might take a while.

769
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,098
You go ahead.
Okay…

770
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,063
How did you know it was so dry in here?

771
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,066
How thoughtful of you
to bring a humidifier.

772
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,486
We'll be here for one night.
Isn't this a bit much?

773
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,406
What's "a bit much" is you
hanging wet towels all over the place.

774
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,160
Hi, Mi-rae.
Hello.

775
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,371
Oh my, Mi-rae. What brings you here?

776
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,414
Did you come alone?

777
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,501
Yes, Mi-ji went
to the Youth Association thing.

778
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,837
Mi-rae, how long has it been?

779
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,798
You've gotten even prettier.

780
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,883
It's been a while
since you saw Ho-su, right?

781
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:14,926
Yes.

782
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,054
Hi.
Hello.

783
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,557
You didn't have to come. I'm out tomorrow.

784
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,017
You must be busy with work.

785
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,727
And what's this?

786
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,978
Just a few things…
Oh dear.

787
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,772
…I thought you might need.

788
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,857
This might be a bit much, but…

789
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,027
What do you mean?

790
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,113
It was dry in here, so this is perfect.

791
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,825
It's like Mi-rae and Ho-su are in sync.

792
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,495
They say it takes brains
to be considerate.

793
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:46,541
That could be why
you're both so thoughtful.

794
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,254
Maybe it's because
I haven't seen you in a while,

795
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,631
but you and Mi-ji used to look identical.

796
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,551
Now that you're older,
I can finally tell who's who.

797
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,470
Really?
Yes.

798
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,557
Mi-rae looks like a real lady now.

799
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,309
Mi-ji still seems like a kid.

800
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,603
Mom.

801
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:16,863
Mi-rae just has this calm,
intelligent vibe, you know?

802
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,700
So she's more than
just an acquaintance, unlike Mi-ji?

803
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,827
Why bring that up in front of the kids?

804
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,122
What is it? Is your back itchy?

805
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,916
It's probably because I haven't showered.

806
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,002
Your skin must be dry.
I'll put some moisturizer on.

807
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,546
It's fine. I'll do it myself later.

808
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,464
You can't put it on your back yourself.

809
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,800
No, it's fine.
Let me.

810
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,469
I'll do it myself.
Just stay still.

811
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,722
Jeez.
Let me see.

812
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:46,058
It's all red already.

813
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,398
It's just a bit of a scratch.
There's no need for you to stay here.

814
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,150
Go back to Seoul.

815
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,277
I should at least see Grandma
since I'm here.

816
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,653
Mi-rae.

817
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,073
If you see Grandma,

818
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,201
don't mention that I got hurt.

819
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,661
Why? Because she'll worry?

820
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,206
Goodness. Worried?

821
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,292
Your grandma's not the type
to worry about me.

822
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,044
No, a bit higher.
Higher?

823
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,962
Here?
Yes, that's the spot.

824
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,634
She's only sweet to you kids, not to me.

825
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,637
If she hears I got hurt,
she'll nag at me for not acting my age.

826
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,473
Anyway, go back to Seoul.

827
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,851
It's just a minor scratch.
Besides, you're busy.

828
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,979
What are you talking about?
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

829
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,398
All done.

830
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,489
I'll go get some water for the humidifier.

831
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,115
I'll do it.
Let me.

832
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,700
I've got it.
I can do it.

833
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,873
She's being unusually sweet.

834
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,628
Of course she is. You got hurt,
and she hasn't seen you in ages.

835
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:59,966
Are you seriously complaining
about your daughter being sweet to you?

836
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,468
Who's complaining?

837
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,179
I was just saying
she's being unusually sweet, right?

838
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:10,142
Your mom really knows how
to get under people's skin with a smile.

839
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,324
You go first.

840
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:26,993
Okay.

841
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,206
Thanks.

842
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,095
Are you mad at me?

843
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,724
Why would I be mad at you?

844
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,475
Then why are you

845
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,185
avoiding my eyes?

846
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,023
Don't be absurd.

847
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,692
When did I…

848
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,906
Can you believe Mi-ji?

849
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,868
She's off to the Youth Association thing
when Mom is hurt.

850
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,287
She even made me take a day off.

851
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,831
No job, no worries, right?

852
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,250
You…

853
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,045
The tank is full. I'll head in first.

854
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,047
Wait, I…

855
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,178
She is avoiding me.

856
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,223
Okay, let's wrap things up.

857
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,725
Thanks for all your hard work.

858
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,934
DUSON-RI SENIOR CENTER

859
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,355
There's some boiled pork at the town hall.

860
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,232
If you want some, come on in.

861
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,818
If not, you can go home.

862
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,446
Do as you please, okay?

863
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,948
Are you telling us to come or not?

864
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,575
I'm telling you to leave.

865
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,455
Hey, Il-lam…
You're not going?

866
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,416
No, I'm not.

867
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,420
Now it really feels like the end.

868
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,882
All right, then.

869
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,184
Okay.
Goodbye.

870
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,394
Mi-rae.

871
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,483
Hey, wait.

872
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,447
Can you tell me now instead of tomorrow?

873
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,157
The real reason you quit?

874
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,412
There's still half a day left.

875
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,875
I guess we might not
see each other tomorrow.

876
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,674
Follow me.
We need a drink for this conversation.

877
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,228
Have you heard of Neo Trading Company?

878
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,105
Of course.

879
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,150
You replaced the management there
and then suddenly vanished.

880
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,777
So you know.

881
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,866
Actually, I forced my way into that deal.

882
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,870
There was this investor
who had two percent of the shares,

883
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,830
and everyone at my company went all in.

884
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:21,041
We were dead set on convincing him

885
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,669
and talked until our mouths went dry.

886
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,297
Yes, we've secured enough for attendance.

887
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,799
We just need two percent
of the voting rights.

888
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,304
All those chronic issues
you've complained about?

889
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,139
We could finally fix them for good.

890
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,603
Then my grandfather called.

891
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,354
He never used to call me.

892
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,356
So we think…
I didn't answer.

893
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,026
…replacing the management
is the only solution.

894
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,403
We have a solid list of candidates
for the board,

895
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,822
so if you could
really get behind us this time…

896
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,824
Excuse me.

897
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,494
Then he called again.
Hey.

898
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,120
What do I do?

899
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,456
This conference call
has life-or-death stakes.

900
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,541
Sorry. Excuse me.

901
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,463
Yes, we can address
your concerns at the root.

902
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,425
We plan to reduce low-profit businesses
handled by minor subsidiaries…

903
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,885
That's when he passed away.

904
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,888
From heatstroke,
in the middle of his farm.

905
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,976
The call
with life-or-death stakes was his.

906
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,522
After he died…

907
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,191
I felt like…

908
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,151
something inside me…

909
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,155
just collapsed and fell apart.

910
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:40,037
But not everyone reacts that way
to death, you know?

911
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,206
They go to work. They eat.

912
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,417
But I couldn't.

913
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,796
That's why I quit.

914
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,592
I didn't know what part of me was broken.

915
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,804
And I was scared I'd fall apart again.

916
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,015
It's not as dramatic as the rumors.

917
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,522
Don't the rumors bother you?

918
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,276
Everyone assumed they were true
since you disappeared so suddenly.

919
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,321
Should I have stuck it out a bit longer?

920
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,490
No.

921
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,660
There's no point proving
something that isn't true.

922
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,372
If the people by your side
know the truth, that's enough.

923
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,126
By the way,

924
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,212
why'd you say you'd tell me tomorrow?

925
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,171
Oh, that.

926
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,507
Tomorrow is his birthday.

927
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,552
Perfect timing
for a trip down memory lane.

928
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,557
He was always so gruff,
but he loved the stars.

929
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,892
At midnight on my birthday,

930
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:47,146
he'd pack seaweed soup in a thermos
and take me stargazing.

931
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,983
He said the sky was full of stars
the night I was born.

932
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,655
Now I celebrate his birthday alone
doing the same thing.

933
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,699
What a fool I am.

934
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,118
Cheers.

935
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,526
Grandma!

936
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,370
You're here.

937
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,166
Grandma!

938
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,628
How have you been?

939
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:58,217
Goodness me.

940
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,718
BONGDEOK HOSPITAL

941
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:04,014
Is it all over now?

942
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,017
I don't know. I can't tell if it is.

943
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,105
We said we'd end it once Mi-rae was okay,

944
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,607
but I'm not sure she is.

945
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,151
My mom saw me with this hair.

946
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,029
Did you tell your mom?

947
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,156
What, that we switched?

948
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,282
Yes.

949
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,576
What's the point in telling Mom?

950
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,454
She'd say I'm ruining Mi-rae's life
and scold me.

951
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,415
I came because she got hurt.

952
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,999
She's hurt?

953
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,044
It's nothing serious.

954
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:37,047
She was squabbling with Bun-hong
and got a little scraped up.

955
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:38,090
Where?

956
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:42,511
Tell your mom to come here now.

957
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,305
She can't. She's in the hospital.

958
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,809
It's not that serious.
She's just there for some tests.

959
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,312
Let's go to your mom.

960
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,772
To Mom?
Yes.

961
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,149
You can't go.

962
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,735
I'll take the wheelchair.

963
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:58,986
Come on.

964
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,530
Let's go see your mom.

965
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:05,743
Grandma, I'll tell Mom to come
as soon as she's discharged.

966
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,619
Don't worry, okay?

967
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,788
She'll be fine.

968
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,593
Here's the information
you requested on Kim Ro-sa.

969
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,849
It appears she grew up
in an orphanage and has no relatives

970
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,559
except for a son.

971
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,978
What about her husband?
There must be a father.

972
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,272
According to a contact
at the prosecutor's office,

973
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,858
he was murdered.
By someone Kim Ro-sa knew.

974
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,901
What?

975
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,028
Was it a crime of passion?

976
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,238
No, the defendant was a woman.

977
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,783
She was also from the same orphanage.

978
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,201
No prior criminal record.

979
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:51,246
Ms. Kim testified on her behalf,
so she got a reduced sentence.

980
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,623
She testified for her?

981
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,959
Can we contact her now?

982
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,045
It's been confirmed that she's deceased.

983
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,838
Deceased…

984
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,590
Look into her some more.

985
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,801
And keep tracking Kim Ro-sa.

986
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,137
What's her name?

987
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,764
Hyeon Sang-wol.

988
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,140
Hyeon…

989
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,308
"Hyeon Sang-wol."

990
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,684
FIRST TRIAL VERDICT

991
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,019
Hyeon…

992
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,187
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

993
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,064
…Sang-wol…

994
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,067
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
HYEON SANG-WOL

995
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,819
DATE OF BIRTH: FEB 14, 1955

996
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,614
No need to be sorry.

997
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,825
You went home
because your mother got hurt.

998
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,870
Still, I should have met you
in person and told you how it went.

999
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,122
There's nothing much to tell.

1000
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,333
You declined because I told you to.

1001
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,127
So is the whole thing over?

1002
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:41,797
Ms. Ro-sa.

1003
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,551
Can I ask you something?

1004
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,970
Sure. What is it?

1005
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,137
Before,

1006
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,641
I never got to ask
why you're not selling the building.

1007
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,851
I told you.

1008
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,895
I hate anything complicated,
money included.

1009
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,731
Is there…

1010
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,901
any other reason?

1011
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,820
What do you mean?

1012
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,364
Before,

1013
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:12,244
I figured it might be personal,
so I didn't dig any deeper.

1014
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:17,249
But if there's a specific reason
that's keeping you from selling,

1015
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,294
I'm pretty sure I can help.

1016
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,257
You're not making any sense.

1017
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,469
Isn't your job done now?

1018
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,347
I'm not asking
as your legal representative.

1019
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,641
This is a personal question.

1020
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,855
I offered to help,
but all I did was pass along messages.

1021
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,983
I feel like I haven't been of much help.

1022
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:47,154
If you're worried that the paperwork
or procedures are complicated,

1023
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,989
I can handle it for you.

1024
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,158
Or anything else, just say the word…

1025
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,327
There's nothing to help with.

1026
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,371
It's all over now, right?

1027
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,707
Yes.

1028
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,834
I've got customers.

1029
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,378
Come by for a meal sometime.

1030
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:08,342
Hello!

1031
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,635
Hi, ma'am.

1032
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,179
The chicken giblet stew here is amazing.

1033
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,053
Sorry I snapped yesterday.

1034
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,847
You came to help, after all.

1035
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,016
It's fine.

1036
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,102
I showed up out of the blue.

1037
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,773
The last time I saw you…

1038
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,068
You're right. I ran away.

1039
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,029
Seeing your face…

1040
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,157
made me think about my family.

1041
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:19,705
I didn't want them
to find out about my problems.

1042
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,041
It's something I have to fix myself.

1043
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,419
You don't have to do it alone.

1044
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,757
If you're uncomfortable with me,
I can refer you to another lawyer.

1045
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,511
Or we can find other ways
outside the legal route.

1046
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,471
Maybe--
I appreciate it.

1047
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:38,974
But honestly,

1048
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,520
I don't even know what kind of help
to ask for right now.

1049
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,773
I'll go back, see what I need,

1050
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:50,652
and let you know if I need any help.

1051
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,334
Man…

1052
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,087
Mi-rae!

1053
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,717
Hi.
Hey.

1054
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,017
Long time no see.

1055
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,311
I know.
Yeah.

1056
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,648
You must be busy. What brings you here?

1057
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,318
A family matter.

1058
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,070
I see.

1059
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,321
Yes.

1060
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,865
Where's Mi-ji?

1061
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,825
Mi-ji?

1062
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,285
She's at home.

1063
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,287
Home?
Yes.

1064
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,874
At home, my foot!

1065
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,667
You're seriously asking for it, Mi-ji.

1066
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,878
Hey! Why did you pretend you didn't know?

1067
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,339
You're one to talk!
Why didn't you call me?

1068
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,217
You're my only friend.
What about me? You're all I've got.

1069
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,928
I was losing my mind
not being able to reach out to you.

1070
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,930
Jeez… Hey.

1071
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,850
Look.
Hamcheol?

1072
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,604
I never got to show anyone.

1073
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,815
It's cute, right?
You got it there? Cute!

1074
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,775
GYEONG-GU MART

1075
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,984
At the wedding?

1076
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,197
Ho-su's always been that way.
Nothing can stop him when he's fired up.

1077
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,032
That's badass.

1078
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:23,245
But how did you run into him
in a huge city like Seoul?

1079
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,913
That's fate, if you ask me.

1080
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,415
Hey, Gyeong-gu.

1081
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,793
Did you know…

1082
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,629
that Ho-su--

1083
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,964
Liked you?

1084
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,551
I figured after my love confession stunt.

1085
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,555
But you didn't really say anything,
so I thought you turned him down.

1086
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,309
You've got a weird look on your face.

1087
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,147
Do you like Ho-su?

1088
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,314
I don't know.

1089
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,150
Oh my. That's crazy!

1090
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,943
That hurts.

1091
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,236
Since when?

1092
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,864
Did something happen in Seoul?
Or back in high school?

1093
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,074
Nothing happened.

1094
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,743
I only just found out
I was his first love.

1095
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,037
If you heard that, then it's settled.

1096
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,331
If a guy calls you his first love,

1097
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,250
you've basically won the game.

1098
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,710
Forget it.

1099
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,547
First love or not,
it was before I got injured.

1100
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,716
Why does that matter?

1101
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,218
Did he like you for your ankle?
Come on.

1102
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:26,308
We saw each other
the day before he left for Seoul.

1103
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,477
Back then, I was in a really bad place.

1104
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:32,147
I was blaming myself
and everyone around me.

1105
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,735
Mi-ji.

1106
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,032
Ho-su is going to Seoul tomorrow.

1107
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,870
I'm leaving something outside your room.

1108
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,853
Mi-ji, I'll be waiting
outside your house tonight.

1109
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,012
Are you…

1110
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,224
really Mi-ji?

1111
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,523
Does it matter?

1112
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,110
You can't tell us apart anyway.

1113
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,492
Why did you give this to me?

1114
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,288
We…

1115
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,874
talked about this.

1116
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,460
When we go to Seoul,

1117
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,963
we'd check out these places together.

1118
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,634
I'm leaving for Seoul first and--
Seriously,

1119
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,096
what's the point of giving this to me now?

1120
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,849
To mess with me?
No, I'm not trying to--

1121
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,310
Then do you feel sorry for me
or something?

1122
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,562
Hey.

1123
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,565
How can I go to Seoul?

1124
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,528
My ankle's wrecked, and my life's ruined.

1125
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,575
It's not ruined.

1126
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,996
You'll get better.

1127
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,249
Are you a doctor?

1128
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,003
How am I ever supposed to get better?

1129
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,014
Now I get why you acted out.

1130
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,309
Being pitied

1131
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,936
feels like crap.

1132
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,608
We're done here, right?

1133
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,569
Mi-ji.

1134
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,052
It's weird.
I said way worse things to him.

1135
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,262
But when he asked
if I was really Mi-ji,

1136
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,932
it just really stuck with me.

1137
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:59,896
I thought, "The Mi-ji he knew
was the bright, happy runner."

1138
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:04,776
"That version of me is gone now,
so he can't recognize me anymore."

1139
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,614
So his first love was that Mi-ji,

1140
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:10,907
not me.

1141
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,369
Gosh.

1142
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,746
Cut the "old me, new me" crap.

1143
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,206
So what now?

1144
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,750
What are you going to do?

1145
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,001
What do you mean?

1146
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,963
You said you like Ho-su.

1147
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,257
And he knows, right?

1148
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,716
Then man up and tell him.

1149
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,804
I can't even look him in the eye.
How can I tell him?

1150
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,097
Jeez.

1151
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,807
Why can't you look at him?

1152
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,226
Does the sight of him make you go crazy?

1153
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,770
It's not that. Listen.

1154
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,939
When I was pretending to be Mi-rae,
it was fine.

1155
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:45,942
But as me, I don't know
how to act around him.

1156
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,318
It's like I've taken off a mask.

1157
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:50,113
Everything feels too real all of a sudden.

1158
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:52,907
What am I going to do with you,
you hopeless little virgin?

1159
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,201
Good heavens.
Jeez.

1160
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:58,079
So what now? You won't tell him?

1161
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,622
I don't know. Maybe later.

1162
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,458
When exactly is "later"?

1163
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,960
We'll be 40 before you know it.

1164
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,796
Come on. Mi-rae's going through hell.

1165
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,299
Is this really the time
to be asking him out?

1166
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:13,678
Whatever. I don't know.

1167
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,309
Ho-su, will you pick me up
tomorrow when I get discharged?

1168
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,768
What's wrong with this?

1169
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,855
If you do, I'll be so happy.

1170
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,108
Getting injured has its perks!

1171
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,654
No.

1172
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,199
I just mean that I'm happy.

1173
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:36,784
Okay, sleep tight.

1174
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,878
What?
I'm just amazed.

1175
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,466
How can you say things like that
and not even cringe?

1176
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,344
If it pisses you off,
just close the curtain.

1177
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,641
Who said I'm pissed off?
I just said I was amazed.

1178
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,684
I can't say things like that, you know.

1179
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,853
Instead of saying you can't…

1180
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,273
why not try a little harder?

1181
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,067
What was that earlier?

1182
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,653
You hadn't seen Mi-rae in ages,
and you basically sent her away!

1183
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,738
It's not that I don't like her.

1184
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,282
Then you sent her away
because you love her?

1185
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,453
How is anyone supposed to know
what you mean when you talk like that?

1186
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,831
Even if I say things plainly,
people always take it the wrong way.

1187
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,876
You did it just now.

1188
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,504
When?
A moment ago.

1189
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,507
I said I was amazed,
and you assumed I was pissed off.

1190
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,009
Unbelievable. And what?

1191
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,929
You thought I was talking
about Ho-su's condition?

1192
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,222
Bun-hong.

1193
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,850
My child suffers from health problems too.
How could I ever say such a thing?

1194
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:46,229
What did you think of me all these years?

1195
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,397
Gosh.

1196
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,192
Then you should've
cleared things up right there…

1197
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,819
I did!

1198
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,531
I said it was a misunderstanding
over and over, but you didn't listen.

1199
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,199
Forget it.

1200
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:03,162
I can't blame you.
I was just born this way.

1201
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,918
Maybe I have a victim mentality,
like you said.

1202
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:16,759
Fine. I took your words
the wrong way. Happy?

1203
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,240
Are you asleep?

1204
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,619
Good night.

1205
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,291
Delivery!
What the heck?

1206
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,959
Jeez.

1207
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,545
I didn't order anything.

1208
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,464
Yes, I lied.

1209
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,592
Hey. Wow.

1210
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,886
It's been a while.

1211
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,933
So, I heard you stood up for me
at the wedding?

1212
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,354
I wouldn't say that exactly.

1213
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,731
Whatever. Thanks anyway.

1214
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:18,738
Since you stood up for me,
I figured I should ask.

1215
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,616
Are you stringing Mi-ji along?

1216
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,410
What?
She doesn't have a proper job,

1217
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,913
and she's not educated like you.
Is that it?

1218
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,374
Is she not good enough for you?
Don't be ridiculous.

1219
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,708
Good.

1220
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,211
You're getting defensive and upset.

1221
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,172
But why won't you tell her?

1222
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,633
You've liked her since way back.

1223
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,843
The timing wasn't right back then.

1224
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,721
Just when I finally made up my mind…

1225
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,309
she was in a really bad place.

1226
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,856
So you couldn't tell her?

1227
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:57,985
What about now?

1228
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,863
We missed our chance once.

1229
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,078
This time, I want to do it right,
when nothing's in our way.

1230
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,996
Are you plotting an assassination?

1231
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,915
Do you need to plan out

1232
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:14,001
the exact spot, the route,
and even the exit strategy?

1233
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,378
I'll do it later.

1234
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,005
She's uncomfortable around me now.

1235
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,716
When exactly is "later"?

1236
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:25,179
Fine. Just keep wasting time
and start dating when you're old and gray.

1237
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:28,683
You two are exactly the same.

1238
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,852
Ho-su.

1239
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,397
There's no such thing as perfect timing.

1240
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,233
Nothing in this world is perfect.

1241
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,669
"There's no such thing as perfect timing."

1242
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,591
You killed it.

1243
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,264
RESIGNATION LETTER

1244
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:10,808
KFMC PLANNING STRATEGY TEAM
YU MI-RAE

1245
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,229
Weren't you scared?

1246
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,691
You worked so hard to get there,

1247
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,985
but you just gave it all up and left.

1248
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,321
I was terrified.

1249
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:28,409
But if you don't let go,
you can't grab onto anything else.

1250
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:32,330
So let's grab onto
any happiness, goodness,

1251
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,957
or joy we can find.

1252
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,501
You too, Mi-rae.

1253
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,434
RESIGNATION LETTER

1254
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,651
FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE,

1255
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,278
I HEREBY SUBMIT MY RESIGNATION

1256
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,281
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE

1257
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,245
NEW HQ PROJECT

1258
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,038
What do I do with this?

1259
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,464
What are you doing?

1260
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:28,261
Just organizing things to tell you
before you go back to Seoul.

1261
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,391
Sorry, but…

1262
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,685
can we wait a few more days
before we switch back?

1263
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,354
It won't take long.

1264
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,232
I'll wrap things up here first
and go back right away.

1265
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,902
That's fine with me.

1266
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,822
But why? Is something going on?

1267
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,584
Remember what you said

1268
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,169
the first day we switched?

1269
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,966
You told me to write a resignation letter
when I was ready to come back.

1270
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,888
I said I would,

1271
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,766
but honestly,
I wasn't planning to write it.

1272
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,562
I never considered quitting.

1273
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,231
I was scared.

1274
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,400
Of what?

1275
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:29,155
I feel like KFMC
is way more than I deserve.

1276
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,408
Don't say that.
I mean it.

1277
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,744
I was just lucky to get in.

1278
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:40,541
You and Mom always talk like
I'm some big deal,

1279
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,252
but I'm just average.

1280
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:47,214
I'm just good at enduring tedious stuff.

1281
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,968
If you just compare
the results to my effort,

1282
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,763
I might even be below average.

1283
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,726
That's why I was scared to quit.

1284
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,979
Getting into KFMC

1285
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,690
was just a stroke of luck

1286
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,109
for someone as average as me.

1287
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:12,573
Come on. You could get a job
at a much better place.

1288
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,325
For me, this company is…

1289
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,828
like what running was to you.

1290
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:21,874
I could go somewhere else,

1291
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:26,128
but I don't think I could go
anywhere better than KFMC.

1292
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,049
So I was scared to let it go.

1293
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,763
If I leave, I have to start over.

1294
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,432
And I'm just tired…

1295
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,602
of being disappointed in myself.

1296
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,358
That's why it took me so long
to write a resignation letter

1297
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,069
that I might not even hand in.

1298
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,572
I must sound so pathetic.

1299
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,783
Hey.

1300
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,328
Either laugh or cry. Pick one.

1301
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,793
I spent days in silence,

1302
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:10,047
keeping to myself
so no one would see how vulnerable I was.

1303
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,269
Hello.

1304
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,273
Ok-hui.

1305
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,069
Are you hurt?

1306
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,157
Does it hurt a lot?

1307
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,492
Mom, is that you?

1308
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:43,497
I'm fine.

1309
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,128
I'm hanging up.

1310
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,182
Thank you.

1311
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,022
I'm sorry.

1312
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,114
KIM RO-SA

1313
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,412
Inside the layers of bark I've built up

1314
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:27,374
in my wish to become a tree…

1315
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,546
there are fragile feelings

1316
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,132
trapped within,

1317
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,343
unable to grow.

1318
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,412
Ho-su. I just saw your text.

1319
01:17:05,496 --> 01:17:07,456
What's up? It's late.

1320
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,000
Have you been waiting long?

1321
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,002
No.

1322
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,130
You're lying.

1323
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:16,090
Your face looks numb from the cold.

1324
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,175
Honestly, I've been waiting a long time.

1325
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:20,970
A very long time.

1326
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:25,850
Mi-ji.

1327
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,563
I've been thinking about that day…

1328
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:33,899
the whole time I was waiting.

1329
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,027
On the day before I left for Seoul,

1330
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,364
I was waiting for you here just like this.

1331
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,118
I had something I needed to say…

1332
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,747
but I couldn't say a word
when you came out.

1333
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:52,877
Back then, I was in a bad place,
and I took it out on you.

1334
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,964
When I was in a bad place,
you always reached out to me,

1335
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,175
even when I was mean.

1336
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:03,095
I wanted to be
that kind of person for you too.

1337
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,142
But seeing you struggle after your injury…

1338
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,520
I lost my courage.

1339
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,817
I don't have the strength
to help someone heal like you do.

1340
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,945
I thought I'd only end up
hurting you more.

1341
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,908
If I was never going to see you again,

1342
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:29,079
I thought I'd rather just say nothing
and keep things the way they were.

1343
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,625
It would have been enough
just to catch a glimpse of you

1344
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,585
on the day of the ancestral rite.

1345
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:35,961
Back then, at least.

1346
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,358
Mi-ji.

1347
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,487
I've been waiting to tell you this,

1348
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,281
waiting until your heart was lighter

1349
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,409
and I had become a better person.

1350
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:11,789
But I'll say it now.

1351
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,461
I've liked you…

1352
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,215
for a long time.

1353
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,885
More than you know.

1354
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,679
When are you going to Seoul?
If you're not leaving today,

1355
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,180
do you want to meet up tonight?

1356
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:11,515
Why at night?

1357
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,434
Because the stars are visible at night.

1358
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,769
Are you her son?
You're just as handsome as she said.

1359
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,814
What was the conception dream?
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

1360
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,567
Mom, just focus
on taking care of yourself.

1361
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,277
If you're not a customer, get out.

1362
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,030
Hyeon Sang-wol. You know her, right?
Who are you?

1363
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,323
Hello.

1364
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,491
Sang-yeong!
You're back!

1365
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:30,951
You're back already?

1366
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,162
How have you been?

1367
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,671
