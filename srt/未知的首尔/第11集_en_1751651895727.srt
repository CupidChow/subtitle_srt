OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,720
If writing a petition is too much trouble,
you can just sign the form and…

3
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,970
No, I'm not trying to force you.

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,100
Yes, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,810
Thank you for your…

6
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,150
I got rejected again.

7
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,820
Why is it that the more I try,
the worse I do?

8
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,410
Is it obvious that I've never worked
in the real world?

9
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,990
I can't even persuade people
over the phone…

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,240
Stop. Of course you can persuade people.

11
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,710
You even managed to convince Ms. Sang-wol.

12
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,710
That's already in the past.
Maybe I've lost my touch now.

13
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,040
Mi-ji, that's not something
that just anyone can do.

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,050
Everything you've accomplished
is still a part of you.

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,010
This was just a simple rejection.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,890
Don't doubt yourself.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,350
Yes, wise one.

18
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,940
Jeez…

19
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,400
I got an email.

20
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,400
Is there…

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,820
anything you want to do
after all this is over?

22
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,870
What? That's a random question.

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,950
We didn't even get to celebrate
your birthday properly.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,330
Should we go somewhere?
Or is there something you want?

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,250
If I had to pick something…

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,800
It does feel a bit empty here.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,090
Is it your bangs?

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,970
Jeez.

29
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,600
Forget it.

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,270
<i>A today that's a little better</i>
<i>than yesterday.</i>

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
<i>Those todays</i>
<i>build the promise of a tomorrow.</i>

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,700
<i>The promise</i>
<i>of being together tomorrow too…</i>

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,950
I'm here to buy rings
for my girlfriend and me.

34
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,540
This is her ring size.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,120
<i>…when things will be</i>
<i>even better than today.</i>

36
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,090

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,760
RING

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,260
Hello.

39
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,430
<i>It is arrogant…</i>

40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,050
Hello?

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,430
<i>…to promise a tomorrow together…</i>

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,640
<i>when I don't even know…</i>

43
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,190
<i>what will happen to me today.</i>

44
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,360
Hello?

EPISODE 11
AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE

46
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,160
ROSA RESTAURANT
SELF-LIT SIGN

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,370
ROSE
ACRYLIC BOX? NEON SIGN?

48
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,350
I didn't realize you meant
you would draw these by hand.

49
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,760
No.

50
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,590
I just wanted to give you a general idea
before we send it to the sign shop.

51
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,090
Which one is your favorite?

52
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,090
Let me think about it.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,930
Okay.

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,260
By the way, why are you here alone?
Where's Ho-su?

55
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,600
Someone he knew passed away. Remember?

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
He'll be back tomorrow after the funeral.

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,270
He's coming back tomorrow?
He's been gone for a while.

58
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,020
Was he very close to them?

59
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,190
I didn't get the chance
to ask him about it.

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
He seemed too distracted
to even talk on the phone.

61
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,530
Gosh…

62
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,030
I was going to give him
some marinated raw crabs.

63
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,990
What? Marinated raw crabs?

64
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,330
What about me?

65
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,990
I gave you your share yesterday.

66
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,790
But I've almost finished it.

67
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,370
Come on! I even drew
some sign designs for you.

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,420
I figured that Ho-su would end up
sharing them with you anyway,

69
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,710
so I made enough for two people.

70
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,060
This is heavy, though.
Should I wait until Ho-su comes back?

71
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,640
No, I can take it.

72
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,190
I'll drop it off at his place
on my way home.

73
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,600
Make sure you put it in the fridge.

74
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,150
Don't eat it all by yourself.

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,080
<i>- The person you're…</i>
- Why isn't he picking up?

77
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,790
What?

78
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,880
Ho-su.

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,890
When did you get back?
You said you were coming back tomorrow.

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,560
Things wrapped up earlier than planned.

81
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,020
Hey! You should've called me then!

82
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,270
I called you and you didn't even pick up.

83
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,520
Also, did you change your passcode?

84
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,490
What is it?

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,660
Is someone inside?

86
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,870
No, nobody's inside.

87
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,040
It's just that today is…

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,040
You're sick again, aren't you?

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,250
No, it's not that.

90
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't lie to me.

91
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,130
Your face is telling me a different story.

92
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,170
Who passed away?
It seems like you've worn yourself out.

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,380
Did you take any medication?

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,640
Let me see if you have a fever.

95
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,930
I'm just a bit tired.

96
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,810
Let's meet up tomorrow.

97
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,230
Okay.

98
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,640
All right, then…

99
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,020
But this…

100
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,530
What in the world?

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,570
Fine. I'm just going to eat this
all by myself.

102
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,340
I…

103
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,470
need to take this call real quick.

104
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,930
Okay.

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,560
Sir, please take me to HNU Hospital.

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,150
This taxi is Incheon-bound.

107
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,910
HNU Hospital, please.

108
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,530
I just told you
that this taxi is heading to Incheon.

109
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,540
I'm not headed in that direction.

110
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,290
Please just get out.

111
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,850
Heart.

112
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,270

INTRATYMPANIC STEROID INJECTION
HIGH-DOSE TREATMENT

115
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,320
Mr. Lee Ho-su.

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,070
EAR, NOSE, AND THROAT

117
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,990
Is there a Mr. Lee Ho-su here?

118
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,820
- Are you Mr. Lee Ho-su?
- Yes.

119
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,330
<i>You have</i>
<i>sudden sensorineural hearing loss.</i>

120
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,580
<i>For now, let's try injecting steroids</i>
<i>into the eardrum for the next few days.</i>

121
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,830
<i>If there's any improvement,</i>
<i>we can reassess.</i>

122
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,380
For sudden hearing loss, the prognosis
generally falls into three categories.

123
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,430
Your hearing might get better,
stay as it is, or be lost for good.

124
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,640
But as you can see here,

125
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,970
you're not doing too great.

126
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,600
Given the higher dose of the injection,

127
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,980
I was hoping at least 80%
of your hearing would've returned.

128
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,100
Then…

129
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,440
of the three possible outcomes…

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,940
It's hard to tell
if your hearing will remain the same

131
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,740
or get worse at this point.

132
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
There's a chance
it could improve miraculously,

133
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,370
but your hearing is down
across all frequencies.

134
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,910
So a full recovery is unlikely.

135
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,710
Then…

136
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,130
what should I do now?

137
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,750
Well,

138
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,840
you've regained at least some hearing,

139
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,590
so let's continue the outpatient visits
and monitor your progress for now.

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,600
You're telling me to do nothing

141
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,020
when we don't know the cause
or whether it'll get better or worse?

142
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,150
What if I completely lose hearing
in this ear as well?

143
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,480
Well, hearing aids or a cochlear implant
could be considered,

144
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,990
but that's only if things get a lot worse.

145
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,950
You mean there's nothing I can do…

146
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,700
until things get worse?

147
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,200
HIGH-DOSE STEROID INJECTION

148
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,710

<i>than medications or injections is…</i>

149
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,000
<i>remaining calm and mentally stable.</i>

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,540
<i>You need to brace yourself</i>
<i>and prepare for the worst-case scenario.</i>

151
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,430
Ho-su.

152
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,770
When did you get back?
You said you were coming back tomorrow.

153
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,310
Things wrapped up earlier than planned.

154
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,940
Hey! You should've called me then!

155
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,770
I called you and you didn't even pick up.

156
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,570
I'm just a bit tired.

157
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,400
Let's meet up tomorrow.

158
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,530
But this…

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
Tae-i, do you have
the documents I asked for?

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,690
- I really need them now.
- I'm doing them in order.

161
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,020
But…

162
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,480
What in the world?

163
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,740
Where is Mr. Shin Gyeong-min?

164
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,870
Over here. Who are you?

165
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,620
We're from the Fair Trade Commission.

166
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,210
We're investigating the Sihan Construction
case, so please cooperate.

167
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,330
Pardon?

168
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,920
Go this way, and get the computer too.

because you couldn't buy one restaurant.

175
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,020
What are you going to do now?
They've even released an article.

176
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,190
I'll contact the press
and have them correct--

177
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,190
What's the point? The damage is done!

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,450
This is why I specifically asked you
to handle this as quietly as possible!

179
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,080
I'm sorry, sir.

180
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,120
But it's just one article so far.

181
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,290
If we manage the press--

182
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,620
Last time,

183
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,790
you said it was just one anonymous post,
so you'd handle it.

184
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,880
How will you take responsibility for this?
Are you even capable of doing that?

185
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,590
My gosh.

186
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,100
Gosh, why weren't you picking up?

187
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,520
Have you seen the article?
It's on the main page.

188
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,230
I was in a meeting.

189
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,400
Yes, I read it on my way to work.

190
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,610
<i>Now that the article's out,</i>

191
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,820
<i>there's no way</i>
<i>they can just cover this up now.</i>

192
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,070
Thank you.

193
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,110
For what? I didn't write it.

194
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,910
You introduced me to the reporter
and gave me advice on everything.

195
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,580
I couldn't have done this by myself.

196
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,790
<i>You were doing just fine on your own too.</i>

197
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,460
I just sped things up

198
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,500
so my business partner
can come back here sooner.

199
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,630
I didn't do anything.

200
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,000
<i>That's not true. Thank you. I mean it.</i>

201
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,050
Enough of that.

202
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,510
Anyway, what about the FTC?
Shouldn't they start investigating soon?

203
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,100
It looks like they're here.

204
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,360
The FTC was your doing, right?

205
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,650
Yes.

206
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,570
Why did you go to HR earlier?

207
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,700
Did they summon you
because they know you reported them?

208
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,700
No.

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,740
I had a meeting regarding
workplace bullying.

210
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,410
I thought it'd be better
to do it before I quit.

211
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,580
You're leaving?

212
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,710
Why…

213
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,750
The hard part is almost done now, though.

214
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,420
Don't you feel like it'd be a waste
to quit now after everything?

215
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,300
You should stick around
to see them get punished.

216
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,430
I don't really see the point in that.

217
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,560
Honestly, I've just been hanging on
because I didn't want to lose.

218
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,190
I wanted to stand my ground
and prove to them I wasn't at fault.

219
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,150
I'm sure seeing them punished
would bring some relief.

220
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,570
But sticking around just to see that

221
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,320
doesn't feel like
it's in my best interest.

222
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,080
My heart still pounds anxiously
every time I come to work.

223
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,040
It's not exactly
a satisfying ending, is it?

224
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,170
But how you feel is what matters the most.

225
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,550
I pushed you into doing this with me,

226
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,560
but I ended up making you do it
all by yourself, just like you said.

227
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,520
That's not true.

228
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,640
I'm going to leave you
with the task I dreaded the most.

229
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,730
I want you to stay here for me
and keep an eye on things.

230
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,190
See how this all ends,

231
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,780
and then tell me everything later.

232
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,250
<i>Ho-su, are you busy these days?</i>

233
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,800
<i>The teachers at our school</i>
<i>must have read the articles about you.</i>

234
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,260
<i>They're asking if you could come</i>
<i>and be a guest lecturer for a day.</i>

235
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,470
<i>The person you're trying…</i>

236
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,600
SON

237
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,180
<i>I've got a lot of work right now,</i>
<i>so I can't come for a while.</i>

238
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,270
<i>Of course, work comes first.</i>

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,490
<i>No matter how busy you are,</i>
<i>make sure you take care of yourself.</i>

240
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,120
What brings you here?

241
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,750
You said you'd never come see me again.

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,800
Are you still upset with me?

243
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,800
Am I upset?

244
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,930
Why would I feel anything towards you?

245
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,680
Get to the point.

246
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
I'm a busy person.
Why did you want to see me?

247
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,310
I came to ask a favor.

248
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,230
We're not exactly on good enough terms
to be asking for favors, are we?

249
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,660
I'd like you to take on a case for me.

250
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,120
You know my classmate, Yu Mi-rae, right?

251
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,660
The sexual harassment case
that was dropped before.

252
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,000
She has officially filed
a report this time.

253
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,840
You're the one who caused this mess,
so you should be the one to fix it.

254
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,460
Why don't you handle it yourself?
Why are you asking me?

255
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,420
Didn't you leave because
you didn't want to be a lawyer like me?

256
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,140
I know…

257
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,520
you would've handled
the recent case the same way,

258
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,980
whether your opponent
was me or someone else.

259
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,850
You're someone who wins
by any means necessary.

260
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,650
Someone who will make the bully suffer
many times over.

261
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,070
I want her to have
a lawyer like that in my place.

262
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,410
And that's you.

263
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,490
I get why you're asking me.

264
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,870
But why do you think
I'd do this favor for you?

265
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,370
Because you like me.

266
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
What?

267
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,340
You never waste your time
on something you're not interested in.

268
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,380
You wouldn't meet just anyone
who came looking for you.

269
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,260
You're busy with big cases,

270
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,300
but you still took
the Rosa Restaurant case.

271
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,100
Wasn't that because you feel
a certain way towards me,

272
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,100
whether that's hating me
or something else?

273
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,940
Wouldn't most people see that as bullying?

274
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,190
You're not like most people, though.

275
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,240
Please, sir.

276
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,040
You still haven't told me
why you're not taking this case.

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,170
What's going on?

278
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,960
It's just…

279
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,340
a personal reason.

280
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,340
So it's none of my business?

281
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,010
You told me that my weakness
makes me stronger and more special.

282
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,230
And yet you seem to have no intention
of showing your weakness.

283
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Or…

284
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,610
maybe that's your weakness.

285
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,160
Thank you.

286
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,130
We're done with the guardian registration.

287
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,180
You won't have to worry about
your identity or inheritance anymore.

288
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,890
Is there anything else you need,
or do you have any questions?

289
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,360
Please take a look at this for me.

290
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,070
ROSA RESTAURANT

291
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,450
Mi-ji drew these.
Which one do you think looks best?

292
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,700
ROSA RESTAURANT
ONLY THE CHICKEN AND ROSA WILL BE LIT UP

293
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,500
This one looks most
like a real restaurant sign, doesn't it?

294
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
They all look great.

295
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,880
I can't believe I'm worrying
about such trivial matters now.

296
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,050
Ma'am.

297
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,930
If you need any help
with the adult adoption we discussed,

298
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,310
or if you need any legal assistance…

299
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,310
HWANG JI-SU

300
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,360
…you can contact this person
from now on.

301
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,690
I've already spoken to her,
so she'll gladly help you if you call.

302
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,660
I must have taken up a lot of your time,
considering how busy you are.

303
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,000
I asked you to help me with everything
because I can't do anything by myself.

304
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,790
No, it's not that.

305
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,420
It's just that I won't be able
to see you for a while.

306
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,420
Why? Did something happen?

307
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,800
It's just a personal…

308
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
To be honest…

309
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,810
I'm a little sick.

310
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,270
You're sick? Where? How?

311
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,980
It's not very serious. It's just…

312
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,400
What is it? Just tell me.

313
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,980
Are you very sick?

314
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,070
You…

315
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,410
don't have cancer, do you?

316
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,910
Why aren't you saying anything?
Is it cancer?

317
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,920
It's nothing serious.

318
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,010
I just have a problem with my ear.

319
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,510
Your ear?

320
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,680
You told me that your hearing
isn't great in one ear.

321
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,220
Has it gotten worse?

322
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,890
My hearing in the other ear
has become worse.

323
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,190
Phone calls are difficult
for me right now.

324
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,850
That's why I told you to contact her.

325
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,770
You haven't taken up my time at all.

326
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,780
Have you told Mi-ji?

327
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,990
No.

328
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,700
I haven't decided yet.

329
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,740
Decided what?

330
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,290
You haven't decided
whether to tell her or not?

331
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,960
I don't know…

332
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,790
what would be better for Mi-ji.

333
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,760
Regardless of what would be better,
you can't hide this from her.

334
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,470
It's not like you'll never see her again.

335
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,490
I haven't decided…

336
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,510
what to do about that either.

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,350
Is…

338
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,680
your condition that serious?

339
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,690
No, it's not.

340
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,310
Anyway, don't worry too much
if you can't get a hold of me.

341
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,360
And please…

342
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,900
don't tell Mi-ji.

343
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,950
If you were able to tell me,
why are you hiding it from her?

344
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,330
Mi-ji would never change her mind
about you just because you're sick.

345
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,700
That's exactly why.

346
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,750
As you already know…

347
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,130
it's not easy to be there
for someone who's sick.

348
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,920
Mi-ji is just starting
to spread her wings again.

349
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,260
I don't want to hold her back.

350
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,310
So this is about how you feel,

351
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,270
not how Mi-ji feels.

352
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,240
GWANGHWAMUN

353
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,330
<i>It's not like he's even healthy.</i>

354
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,920
At this rate, you'll be taking care
of him for the rest of his life.

355
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,170
Why take on that burden?

356
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,140
Are you still sick?

357
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,430
No.

358
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,140
Be honest while you still have the chance.
I don't want us fighting again.

359
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,270
I'm really okay.

360
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,230
You're okay?

361
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,520
Then you deserve a punch.

362
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,610
Do you know how upset I was yesterday?

363
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,990
You seemed mad that I went
to your place without telling you.

364
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,490
And then you didn't even
call me after that.

365
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,870
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,450
Jeez.

367
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,790
If we keep going straight like this
and then make a slight right turn…

368
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,500
It's…

369
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,010
I found another good restaurant nearby.

370
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,880
Let's go there.

371
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm okay. Let's just stick
to where we were going.

372
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,390
It's not that. I'm suddenly craving
something greasy.

373
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,600
I mean it.

374
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,390
Hold on. I'm going to go check
where we're going. I'll be right back.

375
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,350
It's…

376
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,960
I wonder if ghosts appear at night
at Gyeongbokgung Palace.

377
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,920
It was built a long time ago,

378
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,300
so tons of people
must've died there over the years.

379
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,550
Some were executed by poison.

380
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,640
No, wait.
Was the poison delivered to their homes?

381
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,640
Anyway, I'm so excited.

382
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,390
Ta-da.

383
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,650
Pardon me.

384
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,740
I don't think we ordered this.

385
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,530
We ran out of ingredients, so earlier,

386
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
you said it was okay
to switch to this dish.

387
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,660
You're right. Yes, that's right.

388
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,210
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

389
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,750
You weren't listening earlier, were you?

390
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,010
I was wondering why you ordered this
when you don't even like clams that much.

391
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,590
No, just eat what you ordered. It's okay.

392
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,300
No, I like this too.

393
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,470
Let's eat quickly and go,
so we're not late for the entry time.

394
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,930
This looks delicious.

395
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,880
Did you know that the palace
isn't always open at night?

396
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,380
Tickets were sold out
when I tried to book them,

397
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,180
so I kept checking all night

398
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,760
and I finally managed
to get some canceled tickets.

399
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,020
Hey.

400
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,350
Are you really okay?
You don't look too good.

401
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,440
Should we go another day?

402
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,270
No, really, I'm fine.

403
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,320
No, let's just cancel.
We can always go another day.

404
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,690
I told you, I'm fine.

405
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,900
We can just book tickets again.

406
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,120
I know how to book them now, so…

407
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,700
- Mi-ji.
- Yes?

408
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,960
Let's stop seeing each other.

409
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,420
Jeez.

410
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,960
What are you talking about?

411
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,300
Do you really mean what you just said?

412
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,390
I've been thinking about it for a while.

413
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,560
I feel like we're just too different.

414
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,100
You knew we were different.

415
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,940
Dating's about two different people
adjusting to each other…

416
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,860
You can only adjust so much, though.

417
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,320
The way we live and think
will keep changing more and more.

418
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,990
Before it gets too hard--

419
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,370
Do you really expect me
to believe you right now?

420
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,500
Did you really think I'd say,
"Gosh. Yes, we're too different"?

421
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,040
You told me to stop doubting myself.

422
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,750
Did you think I would fall for this
when you told me that over and over?

423
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,340
Tell me. What's going on?

424
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,130
You would never do something like this
out of the blue.

425
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
I…

426
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,310
I'm having issues with this ear too.

427
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,770
- What?
- They said I have sudden hearing loss.

428
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,650
I don't know if my hearing
will get better or worse.

429
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,860
When did it start?

430
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,200
Don't tell me it was that time
you said someone died…

431
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,990
It's been bad since then,
so I've been getting treated.

432
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,960
But even if it gets better,
my hearing won't be the same anymore.

433
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,170
If I'm unlucky…

434
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,420
I may lose my hearing completely.

435
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,010
So?

436
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,340
What does that have to do
with us breaking up right now?

437
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,510
You think I'll change
because you can't hear anymore?

438
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,800
I'll change.

439
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,930
I'll have trouble talking on the phone.

440
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,430
At some point, we may not even
be able to talk like we do now.

441
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,350
Then I can adjust to that.

442
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll do whatever I can.
I'll learn sign language if I have to.

443
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,780
I'll talk to you all day
just like we do now.

444
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,990
That's why I'm doing this.

445
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,990
You've been compromising
for me all this time.

446
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,250
I don't want you
to have to do that anymore.

447
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,290
Hey! I want to do that, though.

448
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm doing it because I want to.
Why do you care?

449
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,170
Mi-ji.

450
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,050
You know…

451
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,010
how I feel, though.

452
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,720
You went through it, so you know.

453
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,110
<i>Now I get why you acted out.</i>

454
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,400
Being pitied…

455
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,240
feels like crap.

456
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,080
I guess I haven't matured much
over the years.

457
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,590
I don't want you to see me getting worse.

458
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,130
I'm already overwhelmed,
so I don't think I'll be able to handle

459
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,680
seeing you have a hard time because of me.

460
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,760
I know it's stupid to think that,
but that's just how I feel.

461
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,260
Let's just end things here.

462
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,310
Ho-su.

463
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,980
Ho-su, your life isn't over
just because you can't hear anymore.

464
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,320
Just because you can't run anymore,
your life is over?

465
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,770
It's true, isn't it?

466
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,240
You never paid any attention to me
before I started running.

467
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,400
I can't run anymore.

468
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,410
My ankle's wrecked, and my life's ruined.

469
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
I know.

470
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,620
That's why I'm saying
that we should end things.

471
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,830
No, we don't know for sure yet.

472
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,880
Your hearing could get better.

473
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,170
Even the doctor said it's unlikely.
That's what he told me.

474
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,380
- You'll get better.
- Are you a doctor?

475
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,590
How am I ever supposed to get better?

476
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,140
I'm really glad…

477
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,600
that I got to know you, Mi-ji.

478
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Take care.

479
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,730
Where are you going?
I refuse to end things like this.

480
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,400
We can get through it together.
Ho-su, I'll help you.

481
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,320
We've been doing great together.
So we can keep--

482
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,030
So keep ignoring me.

483
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,870
I'm just sitting here, dead quiet.

484
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,870
So please leave me alone!

485
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,210
We're done here, right?

486
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,870
Wha…

487
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,340
You're back earlier than I expected.

488
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,260
Is everything okay with Ho-su?

489
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,430
He told me he'd introduce me
to another lawyer out of nowhere.

490
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,870
Did something happen?

491
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,540
We broke up.

492
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,540
What?

493
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,080
What? Why? Did Ho-su break up with you?

494
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,920
Are you okay?

495
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,720
I should've stopped him.

496
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,760
But I couldn't.

497
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,730
I get why he's doing this, but…

498
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,390
I really…

499
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,110
get why, but…

500
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,860
But I didn't know what to say
to change his mind.

501
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,990
So…

502
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,540
I couldn't stop him.

503
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,170
I let him go.

504
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,460
I couldn't stop him, and I let him go.

505
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,820
What am I going to do?

506
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,250
Damn it.

507
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,650
<i>Hey, Mi-rae.</i>

508
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,030
You still have time, right?
Eat something before you go.

509
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,450
Why are you up at this hour?

510
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,160
You're turning in your resignation today.

511
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,080
I figured you should have
a good breakfast.

512
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm sorry that I've been moping around
the past few days.

513
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,130
Why are you apologizing for that?

514
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,720
It's annoying to be around someone
who's all sad and depressed.

515
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,510
I know you already have
a lot to worry about.

516
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,770
It's way better than seeing you
pretend to be all cheerful.

517
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,850
Hey.

518
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,690
It's a rabbit.

519
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,940
Jeez.

520
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,120
Ho-su's not answering my calls.
Have you tried calling him?

521
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,370
No.

522
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,870
What do you plan on doing now?

523
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,460
I got this apartment with a company loan,
so I need to move out as soon as I quit.

524
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,630
If you're going to stay in Seoul,
you'll have to look for a place to stay.

525
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,800
Are you going to stay in Seoul?

526
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,600
I'll think about it.

527
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,140
After I clear out my desk, I'm going
to Duson-ri tomorrow. Do you want to come?

528
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,150
No, it's okay. Why would I go
when you're going to go talk to Mom?

529
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,820
When I go home,

530
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,450
do you want me to fix it?

531
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,780
Your doorknob.

532
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,410
It's okay. I'll take care of it later.

533
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,480
Who is it?

534
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,570
Hey! Gyeong-gu!

535
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,240
There's no time to explain.

536
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,120
Put on as many layers as you can
and then come out.

537
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,540
Go!

538
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,430
You should've told me
that you two switched back.

539
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,260
I had no idea, so I contacted Mi-rae.

540
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,480
Do you know how awkward it was?

541
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,100
There are even more people here now.

542
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,020
Are you happy?

543
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,780
Do you really want to stand in line
in this weather just to buy shoes?

544
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,530
They're not just sneakers.

545
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,900
They're limited edition.

546
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,660
When are we going in?

547
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,620
Want to know something shocking?

548
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,540
We're in line to get into
another line right now.

549
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,250
Unbelievable. I'm leaving.

550
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,710
No, you can't.

551
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,130
It's limited to one pair per person.
I have to get one in every color.

552
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,250
I knew it.

553
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,130
I thought it was strange that you'd come
all this way just to see me.

554
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,180
Jeez, I'm just killing
two birds with one stone.

555
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,890
Hey, what's Ho-su doing?
Tell him to come here if he's not busy.

556
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,640
Why do you want him to come?

557
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,310
Just multitasking, you know?

558
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,650
Call him so I can buy three pairs.
Come on!

559
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,150
Get lost.

560
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,020
Look at you,
being all protective of your boyfriend.

561
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,900
Hey, in a winter as cold as this,

562
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,240
you need to get out and face the cold.
It's better for your health.

563
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,280
Don't do it.

564
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,490
Let me see that handsome face of his.

565
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,830
I'll be the unhappy third wheel, not you.

566
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,540
I said, don't!

567
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Why are you yelling?

568
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,130
Did something happen between you two?

569
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,930
What is up with Ho-su?

570
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,640
Does he think he's that great?

571
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,850
Why did he mess around
with someone who's never dated before?

572
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,600
Come on.

573
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,900
I told you
that we both agreed to break up.

574
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,570
You agreed?

575
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,200
Are you sure about that?
Your eyes are full of longing right now.

576
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,450
You were obviously dumped.

577
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,490
What did he say?
Did he say you're too stupid for him

578
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,910
or you're pathetic
because you're unemployed?

579
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,710
He said you turned out
to be a bit annoying, right?

580
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,790
Hey, that's a bit harsh.

581
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,380
You went through all that drama,

582
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,170
but you didn't even last a year.
What was the point of dating, then?

583
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,590
Why did he come and stir things up
when you were doing fine on your own?

584
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,140
Yu Candy looks
totally messed up right now.

585
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,930
Hey, let's just ambush him tonight.

586
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,060
I'll lure Ho-su.
You attack him from the back.

587
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,310
So I'm the one who's supposed
to hit him, not you?

588
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,440
Jeez.

589
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,490
This is why first loves
should just be kept as memories.

590
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,200
You regret it too, don't you?
You wish you hadn't dated him, right?

591
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
No.

592
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,870
I don't regret it.

593
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,290
I'm glad I dated Ho-su.

594
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,190
"No, I don't regret it."

595
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,320
Can you repeat what you said,
starting from that line?

596
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
You showed great emotion just now.

597
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,950
Jeez! Do you seriously have a death wish?

598
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,410
- Just once.
- This is insured, right?

599
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,410
I'm breaking it.

600
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,540
Even cringey moments are a part
of your history. We need to document this.

601
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,080
I can't believe
I waited with you in the cold.

602
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,330
- Jeez.
- Hey, watch the shoes!

603
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,050
My shoes!

604
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,050
Hello?

605
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,680
<i>I'm calling from the hospital.</i>

606
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,390
<i>Are you Ms. Kang Wol-sun's daughter?</i>

607
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,850
Yes. Is there a problem?

608
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,270
I'm sorry. Hold on. Be careful. Sorry!

609
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,070
Gosh, Ms. Kim.
Don't run in front of the children…

610
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,570
Where are you going?

611
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,440
- Honey!
- It's okay, ma'am.

612
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,200
- Ma'am, it's okay.
- Stop! Honey!

613
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,570
- Honey!
- It's okay.

614
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,620
Mom!

615
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,410
Honey…

616
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,750
What's wrong with my mom?

617
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,540
She's had diarrhea for the past few days.

618
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,960
I think she's delirious
from sodium deficiency.

619
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,040
Fortunately, it's not an infection.

620
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,300
It's because she hasn't been eating
as much lately.

621
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,680
So she'll get a little better
once she gets a sodium infusion.

622
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,550
She's blabbering nonsense, though.
Do you think an IV will be enough?

623
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,640
For delirium, the most important thing
is to keep the patient calm and stable.

624
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,100
You should hold her hand
and keep talking to her.

625
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,360
Mom.

626
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
- Mom.
- Why would you hit her?

627
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,070
Hit me! Why would you hit our kid?

628
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,780
Why are you hitting Ok-hui?

629
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,080
Mom, I'm here. It's me.

630
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,040
I'm Ok-hui. I'm here, Mom.

631
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,630
You shouldn't do that either, Mother.

632
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,460
Our child did nothing wrong. My poor baby.

633
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,260
My baby.

634
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,620
HIDDEN TRUTHS ABOUT HEARING LOSS

635
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,580
HOW TO RESET TINNITUS
AND HEARING LOSS

636
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,490
<i>I wonder if this is the moment</i>
<i>Dad was talking about.</i>

637
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,790
Ho-su.

638
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,330
Doesn't your neck hurt?

639
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,090
I guess this attitude
is typical of an eighth grader.

640
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,470
You're not even responding.
I'm going to tell your mom later.

641
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,430
Which mom?

642
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,850
Ho-su.

643
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,150
Someday, you're going
to make someone miserable too.

644
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,190
There will definitely be a moment

645
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,780
when you force the person
by your side to lose.

646
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,200
But you know, Ho-su…

647
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,660
Love isn't about winning or losing.
It's about--

648
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,620
<i>I wonder what Dad</i>
<i>was going to say after that.</i>

649
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,170
<i>His ominous prediction came true.</i>

650
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,050
<i>He never got to finish his sentence.</i>

651
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,590
<i>I'll never know…</i>

652
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,100
<i>the end of that sentence…</i>

653
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,890
<i>or love itself.</i>

654
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,490
Wow!

655
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,240
It's beautiful.

656
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,620
Okay, selfie time.

657
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,790
What?

658
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,050
Is this your first time
seeing the Hangang River or something?

659
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,220
Nothing beats chicken and beer
by the Hangang River, right?

660
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,100
You always want to do
what everyone else is doing.

661
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,480
Do you really want to eat
chicken and beer outside in this weather?

662
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,400
The colder it is, the better it tastes.
You act as if you're not gonna have some.

663
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,860
I'm not eating.

664
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,780
Fine, don't eat.

665
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,240
A broken heart is great for dieting.

666
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,410
Hey.

667
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,160
Stop moping around.

668
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,540
Eat this and come back home with me.

669
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,540
No, thanks.

670
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,130
What do you mean?

671
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,250
You said that
you can't even live with Mi-rae.

672
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,840
In Seoul, just breathing costs money.

673
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,550
Don't waste money
and just come back with me.

674
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,430
Go back by yourself.
I'm going to stay here.

675
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,810
You've always liked Seoul
since we were in high school. Why is that?

676
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,060
If you're gonna mope around,
do it back home.

677
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,890
You'll at least have your family and me.

678
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,810
If you mope around here,
you'll shut yourself away again…

679
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,700
Damn it.

680
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,160
Who's going to
pull you back out if you do?

681
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,920
I refuse to stand by
and watch you die alone in Seoul.

682
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,840
Why are you making that face?

683
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,890
I've been thinking about something
the past few days.

684
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,480
If I could go back in time,

685
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,440
what would I have to say

686
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,440
to convince myself to leave the room?

687
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,780
But I don't know what I would say.

688
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,700
I thought about it,

689
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,540
and I realized
that I didn't leave of my own accord.

690
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,670
I stayed in that room,

691
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,500
thinking I was the only one
going through a hard time.

692
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,880
I never thought about
what it must've been like

693
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,710
for those watching me from outside.

694
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,850
I wonder what was going through
my mom's mind when she broke my doorknob.

695
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,520
Just how much do you have to love someone
to say it's all okay

696
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,940
despite everything, like my grandma did?

697
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,490
Mi-rae couldn't even talk
about her own struggles.

698
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,860
She must've been so lonely.

699
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,700
And what is Gyeong-gu thinking

700
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,830
as he sits and eats chicken
here at this hour

701
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,880
while facing this strong wind?

702
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,210
Jeez.

703
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,220
I managed to leave my room,
thanks to all of you who cared about me.

704
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,890
So I can't possibly go back in there.

705
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,480
No matter how small I feel
or how hard things get,

706
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,480
I'll do whatever I can here.

707
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,020
I want to do all I can.…

708
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,990
to become the kind of person
who's always there for others too.

709
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,670
Well, dating a lawyer has certainly
improved your way with words.

710
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,720
You just low-key wiped
your hand here, didn't you?

711
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,810
Of course not.

712
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,520
You did!

713
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,890
- I didn't.
- Jeez.

714
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,690
Why did you wipe it on me?

715
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,770
You're supposed to eat chicken
with your hands.

716
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,900
You're so annoying.

717
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,330
She's finally leaving.

718
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,750
Look at her just walking away by herself
after throwing a grenade.

719
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,130
Tell them to get rid of that desk.

720
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,290
There's no one here to sit there anymore.

721
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,560
<i>Please give this to Su-yeon.</i>

722
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,510
It was you, wasn't it?

723
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,720
You're the only one
who'd do something like this.

724
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,220
Do you really think I'm the only one?

725
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,930
You think it'll all go your way?

726
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,980
You dragged the FTC into this.
How are you going to handle the fallout?

727
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,980
I'm not the one who has to deal
with the fallout.

728
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,690
Do you think it'll all be over
if you leave like this?

729
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,950
I'll make sure that you never
step foot in this field again.

730
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,870
You'll probably join some lame company
and cause the same kind of issues there.

731
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,120
You'll always be the same wherever you go.

732
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,090
I guess that's what scares you the most.

733
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,840
What?

734
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,170
Goodbye.

735
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,180
Good luck with the investigation.

736
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,150
Ms. Yu.

737
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:01,820
Ms. Yu!

738
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,990
Mi-rae!

739
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,290
I think you left this behind…

740
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,540
Thank you.

741
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,460
I…

742
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,920
I'm sorry that I just sat back
and did nothing all this time.

743
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,550
In today's meeting,
I'm going to tell them everything.

744
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,040
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

745
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,630
Is your mother doing better?

746
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,510
Yes, it got bad last night.

747
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,130
But she's blabbering less than before.

748
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,930
We didn't force her to eat
to avoid upsetting her stomach,

749
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,760
but it actually made things worse.

750
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,470
<i>You didn't do it on purpose.</i>

751
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,930
Are you okay?

752
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,810
I heard delirium is tougher
on the loved ones than the patient.

753
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,360
She keeps talking about the past.

754
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,570
Thanks to her, I'm reliving the past too.

755
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,200
Anyway, I don't think I'll be able to work
until my mom gets better.

756
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,070
<i>Work is not important right now.</i>

757
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,450
I'll take care of it,
so just focus on her for now.

758
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,500
Okay, talk to you later.

759
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,380
HNU ENT

760
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,420
Hello?

761
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,640
Doctor, I wasn't expecting
a call from you.

762
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,350
Ho-su's phone is turned off?

763
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,190
He probably had his regular checkup
over the summer, though.

764
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,650
What are you talking about?

765
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,570
Please explain so I can understand.

766
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,210
Mom.

767
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,580
Who am I?

768
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,000
Ok-hui.

769
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,770
Why are you so skinny?

770
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,770
Don't you know old folks die
if they stop eating?

771
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,440
Were you seriously trying to die?

772
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,940
Don't you even feel bad for the girls?

773
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,160
Mom.

774
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
Who am I?

775
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,700
I asked you who I am.

776
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,660
Stop asking me.

777
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,620
Jeez…

778
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,460
I guess you're finally back.

779
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,140
Did Dad hit me?

780
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,560
You were saying that all night.

781
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,680
Is that why you left the house?

782
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,150
Then why did you say Dad mistreated you?

783
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,900
You said you were kicked out
for having a girl.

784
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,450
I was afraid…

785
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,410
that you'd go back to that house.

786
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,960
Then why were you so mean to me?

787
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,630
I thought you got kicked out
because of me,

788
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,300
so I thought that you resented me for it.

789
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,680
My whole life, I…

790
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,970
I was afraid that you'd live like me.

791
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,940
I wanted you to live a good life
on your own.

792
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,480
How was I supposed to do that by myself?

793
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,070
I've spent all this time
thinking I destroyed your life.

794
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,900
So how was I supposed to live a good life?

795
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,280
If you left for my sake,
then you should've told me.

796
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:18,830
Was it really that hard
for you to tell me?

797
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,750
Why keep it a secret for so long?

798
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,710
Look at us now.

799
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,880
It's too late now.

800
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,140
Ok-hui.

801
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,390
I'm sorry.

802
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:46,270
Why are you apologizing?

803
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,650
Are you gonna leave us
now that you're at peace?

804
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:51,650
Don't even think about it.

805
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,030
I haven't forgiven you yet.

806
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,410
I'm… sorry.

807
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:04,630
I told you not to apologize.

808
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,710
I told you to stop.
Why do you keep apologizing?

809
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,510
What's going on?

810
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,390
So you were inside.

811
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,430
He's your son, right?

812
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,400
I was asleep
and I didn't know my phone was off.

813
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:18,280
You didn't have to call the police.

814
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,630
How long have you been like this?

815
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,800
I've been too busy to clean,
so it's a mess.

816
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,510
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

817
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,380
I already know everything.

818
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,180
Get dressed. We're going to the hospital.

819
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,930
I'll go on my own later.

820
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,270
You'll manage on your own?
Is that what you've been doing?

821
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,350
Mom.

822
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,140
You don't have a terminal disease.

823
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,150
It's sudden hearing loss.

824
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,070
This is urgent.
Why aren't you doing anything?

825
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,070
Do you think anything will change
if you hide away by yourself?

826
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,820
You shouldn't avoid the problem.
You should take care of it.

827
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,070
Avoid it?

828
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,240
Me?

829
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,370
Mom, I can't avoid it.

830
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,710
I'm here like this
because I can't avoid it.

831
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,830
I already went to the hospital.

832
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,380
They said there's nothing they can do.

833
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,380
They said all I can do is wait.

834
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,090
I'm not avoiding anything.

835
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,800
If there's a way to avoid it,

836
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,640
I would love to know it too, Mom.

837
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,560
Why did you let it get this bad
without telling me?

838
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,310
You should've told me, of all people.

839
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,230
You should've asked for my help.

840
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,820
What are we?

841
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,320
What?

842
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,870
You've already done more than enough
by raising me all this time.

843
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,790
You should stop worrying about me,
and you should live your own life now.

844
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,790
What? I did more than enough?

845
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,000
So you're telling me to get lost
now that you don't need me anymore?

846
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,420
You've gone beyond proving
that you loved Dad.

847
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,640
I'm not even your blood.
You can stop carrying this burden now.

848
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,180
You mean brat.

849
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,770
How could you say that to me?

850
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,940
"What are we?"
Are you seriously asking me that?

851
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:17,650
You brat.

852
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,480
You mean brat.

853
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,030
What do you know? Do you know how I feel?

854
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,530
You can't say those things
when you don't even know how I feel!

855
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,160
I know you resent me too!

856
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,710
I know you secretly resent me
for being the reason Dad died.

857
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:36,500
And you've had to raise this mean brat
as your own for Dad's sake.

858
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,300
You can't even admit

859
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,010
that you've resented me all this time
even though you do.

860
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:45,680
You're right.

861
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,760
I did resent you.

862
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,390
You, for being stubborn,
and your dad, for leaving us like he did.

863
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,560
I resented the guy who got drunk
and died before he was even punished.

864
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,360
You think that's all?

865
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,280
I even resented your mom
for dying that day of all days.

866
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,860
I also resented myself
for letting you two go that day.

867
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,160
I resented everything in the world.

868
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,160
I didn't even want to go on living.

869
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
But…

870
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,250
you saved me that day.

871
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,270
Mom.

872
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,570
Ho-su!

873
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,820
Mom.

874
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,740
My gosh. Ho-su.

875
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,830
Ho-su.

876
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,380
You were on the brink of death,

877
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,960
but you opened your eyes.

878
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,470
And you called me "Mom."

879
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,640
That's why you've been stuck
with me all this time.

880
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,060
No, you held on to me.

881
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,100
You held on to me
and made sure I didn't wash away.

882
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,610
I'm alive

883
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,610
because you held on to me.

884
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:31,370
Your dad brought us together
so that we could hold on to each other.

885
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:35,910
Ho-su.

886
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,920
My love for your dad is a memory,

887
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,840
but my love for you is my reason to live.

888
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,920
You're the one keeping me alive.
If that's not family, then what is?

889
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,050
What are we?

890
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,680
You're my son, and I'm your mom.

891
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,230
If you let go of my hand,
then how am I supposed to go on?

892
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,690
So Ho-su, don't let go.

893
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,270
Hold on to everything you can, okay?

894
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,010
- Mom, how's Grandma?
- Gosh.

895
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,840
- She just fell asleep.
- What?

896
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,590
- What is this? Give it to me.
- No, no.

897
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,220
Give it to me.
Let's sit for a bit and then go.

898
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,720
Gosh, what's all this?

899
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,690
Why didn't you let us know
that Grandma's not doing well?

900
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:44,520
Why would I tell you two
when it's not even good news?

901
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,730
She's okay now.

902
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,190
It's a weekday. Why'd you come here?

903
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,900
What about work?

904
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,530
About that…

905
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,910
What? Did something happen?

906
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,080
Today…

907
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,420
I quit my job.

908
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,250
What?

909
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:15,300
Is it because of what happened
when you and Mi-ji switched?

910
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,140
No, it's not because of that.

911
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,640
Then what is it?

912
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,480
Why did you suddenly quit
when you were doing so well?

913
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,810
The thing is…

914
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,190
I wasn't doing so well.

915
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:30,570
I was struggling a little.

916
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,740
That's why Mi-ji switched places with me.

917
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,910
I'm glad you quit, then.

918
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,080
There are plenty of other companies.

919
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,670
I'm sorry.

920
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,040
For what?

921
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,130
I feel like I keep disappointing you.

922
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,840
You believed in me and supported me.

923
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,090
I gave up on the exam too.

924
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,100
I haven't seen anything
through to the end.

925
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,730
I stayed by your grandma's side all night,

926
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,490
but the only thing I could do

927
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:16,070
was hold her hand and pray.

928
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,950
That reminded me of the past.

929
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,700
When you were hospitalized as a baby,

930
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:26,250
you were so young, but you were hooked up
to so many needles and machines.

931
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,670
I prayed,
"Please just let her live one more day."

932
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,840
The next time you were hospitalized,

933
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,590
I prayed,
"Please just get better this time."

934
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,930
Those prayers kept getting answered,

935
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,140
so I guess I got greedy.

936
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,900
You're exactly…

937
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,360
what I prayed you would be,

938
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,030
so don't say that you disappointed me.

939
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,660
Just do whatever you want to do.

940
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,550
CLOTHES

941
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,180
Gosh.

942
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,240
INVESTMENT WORLD'S RISING STAR
HAN SE-JIN

943
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,870
You're not tired of looking at that?

944
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,540
Are you packing up that house too?

945
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,460
I'm just organizing
my grandfather's things for now.

946
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,090
If I find a replacement,
then they may want to live there.

947
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,050
Did you decide on a replacement?

948
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,220
It seems like no one is up for
the challenge of farming new varieties.

949
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,690
More importantly, you're here now.

950
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,810
So that means you quit.

951
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,270
And if you quit,

952
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,780
that must mean you're ready
to respond to my offer.

953
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,200
Am I right?

954
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,410
To be honest, your offer
was a dream come true for me.

955
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,620
You even offered me
a place to stay in the States.

956
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,710
Honestly, the offer is more than generous.

957
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:34,040
Gosh, it's not more than generous.

958
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,840
You'll just be an intern.
The rest is up to how you do.

959
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,710
Okay, let's cut to the chase.

960
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,760
What have you decided to do, Mi-rae?

961
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,140
I decline.

962
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,770
Why? No, I won't accept that.

963
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,360
You should come with me.

964
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,860
Is it because it's an internship?
But it's your dream.

965
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,650
This is a really great offer.

966
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,740
I know. That's why I'm declining.

967
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,490
I don't think I'm ready yet.

968
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,530
You don't need any preparation.

969
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,410
I'm not hiring you for personal reasons.

970
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,460
I've watched you here all this time.

971
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,460
I made that offer because I have faith
that you'd do really well.

972
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,920
It's because I'm still not sure
about myself.

973
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,420
If I go feeling like this, then,
no matter what I accomplish,

974
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,920
I'll think that it's all thanks
to you, Se-jin.

975
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,720
You're such a straight arrow.

976
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,800
You really are just like my grandfather.

977
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,390
So what are you going to do now?

978
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,440
I want to see things through
to the very end here.

979
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,270
See what through?

980
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,070
Please let me take care of the farm.

981
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,730
I'll be your replacement.

982
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,530
You're choosing strawberries
over my offer?

983
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,080
When I take a test,

984
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,200
there's nothing worse than picking

985
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:53,040
what seems like the right answer
over what I actually felt was right

986
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,250
and then getting the question wrong.

987
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,710
It makes me think that I got it wrong
because I didn't trust myself.

988
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:02,170
I think the right answer
is to go to the States,

989
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,470
but for some strange reason,
staying here feels more right to me.

990
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:11,850
Will you be okay? Aren't you scared?

991
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,640
Of course I am.

992
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:17,310
But for once in my life,
I want to do what my heart tells me to do.

993
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,610
Even if it's wrong.

994
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,950
Let's go, so I can hand things over.

995
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,790
PROPOSED SIGN DESIGN
ROSA RESTAURANT

996
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:36,870
Oh, is this what it would look like?

997
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:40,590
What do you mean?
It looks just like what I drew.

998
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:41,960
My gosh!

999
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,220
Anyway, they said the sign
will take a few days.

1000
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,840
Let me go through the mail
in the meantime.

1001
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,100
That's just an ad.

1002
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:56,230
This is a notice about hygiene training.

1003
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:59,940
It says you can do it online,

1004
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,530
so I'll explain this later.

1005
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,450
This is from the court.

1006
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,490
What?

1007
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,800
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT FAMILY COURT

1008
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,760
APPLICANT'S REPRESENTATIVE
ATTORNEY LEE HO-SU

1009
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,470
It's a court decision letter.

1010
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:38,060
The correction request we…

1011
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,400
The correction request for the registry…

1012
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,230
It's the request… we made last time.

1013
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,360
It's been approved.

1014
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,650
Are you okay?

1015
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,410
Why are you suddenly emotional?

1016
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,290
It's just that,
all of a sudden, my throat…

1017
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:59,460
Is there some bad news written there?

1018
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,960
No.

1019
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,420
It's just that…

1020
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,760
seeing Ho-su's name here made me a little…

1021
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,300
Gosh, what's wrong with me?
I'm so sorry.

1022
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,890
Did you two break up?

1023
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,480
What? How did you even know
we were dating when we never told you?

1024
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:24,610
Gosh, you really are sharper
than you look, Ms. Sang-wol.

1025
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,150
Why did he break up with you?

1026
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,110
It just happened.

1027
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:33,030
He's busy right now,
and I also have a lot to do.

1028
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,540
Talk to Ho-su again.

1029
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,290
It's not my place to tell you,

1030
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,920
but he has a bit of a situation.

1031
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,210
He's trying…

1032
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,880
not to burden you…

1033
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,300
I know, ma'am.

1034
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,680
I know everything.

1035
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:57,430
You do?

1036
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:00,980
You know everything,
but you still broke up with him?

1037
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,390
Yes.

1038
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,400
Why?

1039
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,400
It seems like you still like him.

1040
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:07,780
Even when I threw salt at you,

1041
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,490
you kept knocking on my door
until I opened it.

1042
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:13,700
Given your personality, I thought
you'd be protesting outside his apartment.

1043
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,700
Why aren't you?

1044
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,830
Because I know how he feels.

1045
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,790
I was like that too.

1046
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,500
I was so miserable being me…

1047
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,880
that I couldn't even step
outside of my room for a few years.

1048
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,420
Well…

1049
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,300
Then you should know better
since you overcame that yourself.

1050
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,260
I never did…

1051
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,930
overcome it.

1052
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,190
I only left my room
because my grandma collapsed.

1053
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,650
It's not like I made it out on my own.

1054
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:50,400
You made it out, so you overcame it.

1055
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:53,360
I may be here physically,

1056
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,490
but I'm still holed up.

1057
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,660
You know…

1058
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,000
I still can't close my bedroom door
when I'm alone.

1059
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,290
I'm afraid that I won't be able
to make it out like I did before.

1060
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,630
It's ridiculous, right?
Why can't I just close the door?

1061
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,510
I don't know why I'm so scared.

1062
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:18,140
After all of that drama,

1063
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,600
you'd think that I would've gotten
become a little stronger.

1064
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,100
But I couldn't even do that.

1065
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:28,730
I felt so pathetic and stupid
for being like that…

1066
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,900
so I pretended I was okay,
afraid someone might see through it.

1067
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:39,830
What can I possibly say to Ho-su
when I'm like this?

1068
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,620
What can I…

1069
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,170
possibly do for Ho-su…

1070
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,080
when I'm like this?

1071
01:10:55,670 --> 01:11:00,640
Can you only be there for him
if you can do something major?

1072
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:05,680
Can't you just stay by his side

1073
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,350
and do what you can for him?

1074
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,060
Mi-ji.

1075
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,650
Do what you're good at.

1076
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,490
Knocking on people's hearts.

1077
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:19,780
"I'm here."

1078
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,370
"If you open the door,
I'll be right outside."

1079
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:27,460
You can keep knocking
and telling him that.

1080
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,420
Do you remember what you told me before?

1081
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,590
You held onto my hands like this,

1082
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:43,890
and you said that
you never know what might happen.

1083
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,430
You didn't know anything back then either.

1084
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,650
You didn't know the answer,

1085
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,650
but you still stayed by my side.

1086
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:15,090
SEOUL
DUSON

1087
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,960
CT SCAN APPOINTMENT SLIP
EEG APPOINTMENT SLIP

1088
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,090
Next time,

1089
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,540
when you go for your CT and your EEG,

1090
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,540
tell them,
"I did the hearing test last time."

1091
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,890
Don't forget your appointment date.
They'll text you the day before.

1092
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,480
If I'm not busy, I'll come to Seoul too.

1093
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:37,650
Why are you smiling?

1094
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,950
It just feels like before.

1095
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:43,370
I thought I was done causing you trouble,

1096
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,410
but I'm back to square one.

1097
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,660
That's ridiculous.

1098
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,290
You can't compare back then to now.

1099
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,170
Do you know how much paperwork
I go through every day?

1100
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,250
This is no trouble at all.

1101
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,550
Why did you go through that alone?

1102
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,220
Were you that scared
that you'd never hear again?

1103
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,060
If I'm alone,

1104
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,150
I would just be scared,
and that would be it.

1105
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,860
But if I have someone by my side,

1106
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,570
I feel like I'd make them miserable too.

1107
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,160
You're just like your dad.

1108
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,580
Like father, like son.
You speak just like him.

1109
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,830
My dad?

1110
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,840
Before we got married,

1111
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,890
your dad broke up with me once.

1112
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,890
He kept saying
that he was making me miserable.

1113
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:55,650
He said that if I stayed with him,
I'd end up losing.

1114
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,570
He said that with the exact expression
you're making right now.

1115
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,440
I got so angry that I told him…

1116
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,740
that people can't win all the time.

1117
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:13,870
I said, "Someday, there will be a day
when you will have to lose for me too."

1118
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,630
<i>Ho-su.</i>

1119
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,800
<i>Someday, you're going</i>
<i>to make someone miserable too.</i>

1120
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,630
There will definitely be a moment

1121
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,840
when you force the person
by your side to lose.

1122
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,350
But you know, Ho-su…

1123
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,100
- Love isn't about…
<i>- "Love isn't about…"</i>

1124
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,430
- …winning or losing. It's about…
<i>- "…winning or losing. It's about…</i>

1125
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,980
remaining on the same team

1126
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,440
until the very end even if you lose."

1127
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,570
Love is about staying together…

1128
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,700
even if you lose a hundred
or a thousand times.

1129
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,160
<i>Ho-su.</i>

1130
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:53,950
<i>Love isn't about…</i>

1131
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,120
Hi.

1132
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,330
<i>…winning or losing.</i>

1133
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,500
<i>It's about remaining on the same team</i>
<i>until the very end even if you lose.</i>

1134
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:03,090
We should still do everything we can--

1135
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,340
You don't have to pretend
we're family when nobody is around.

1136
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,890
<i>Love is about staying together</i>

1137
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:14,060
<i>even if you lose a hundred</i>
<i>or a thousand times.</i>

1138
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,580
<i>I…</i>

1139
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:42,170
I still can't close my bedroom door
when I'm alone.

1140
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:46,970
I'm afraid that I won't be able
to make it out like I did before.

1141
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,050
What can I…

1142
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,430
possibly do for Ho-su…

1143
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,390
when I'm like this?

1144
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,400
<i>Can't you just stay by his side</i>

1145
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:07,280
and do what you can for him?

1146
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:13,490
Do what you're good at.
Knocking on people's hearts.

1147
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,370
<i>"I'm here."</i>

1148
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,090
"If you open the door,
I'll be right outside."

1149
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:27,920
You can keep knocking
and telling him that.

1150
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,100
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>what you told me before?</i>

1151
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,020
<i>You said that you never know</i>
<i>what might happen.</i>

1152
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,820
<i>You didn't know the answer,</i>

1153
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,740
<i>but you still stayed by my side.</i>

1154
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,580
I'm going to make it out
for real this time.

1155
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,050
Everyone…

1156
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,260
is waiting outside.

1157
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,370
If you open the door,
I'll be right outside.

1158
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,210
So you can just…

1159
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,000
open the door at any time.

1160
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:09,900
Mi-ji.

1161
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,490
Open the door. Mi-ji!

1162
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,410
Mi-ji, Grandma's coming in.

1163
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:17,450
<i>It's okay, my dear.</i>

1164
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,910
<i>Let's brush it off and get back up.</i>

1165
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,830
I just need to open the door.

1166
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:09,630
Just open the door…

1167
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,970
Ho-su!

1168
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,510
What are you doing here?

1169
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,470
I was just about to come to you…

1170
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:24,430
I'm sorry, Mi-ji.

1171
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:29,980
I was an idiot.
I shouldn't have done that to you.

1172
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,610
No.

1173
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:35,150
I wanted to go to you earlier, but…

1174
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:39,740
Please stay by my side, Mi-ji.

1175
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,870
Please stay with me.

1176
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:09,770
<i>The promise of a tomorrow</i>

1177
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,060
<i>is not born from hope, but from resolve.</i>

1178
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,140
<i>Looking back,</i>
<i>the path I've walked is full of regrets.</i>

1179
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,640
<i>And the road ahead is veiled in fear.</i>

1180
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,310
Ms. Yu left the company today.

1181
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,850
She asked me to give this to you.

1182
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:13,580
<i>Even when you weren't by my side,</i>
<i>you were always with me in spirit.</i>

1183
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:17,050
<i>So please be gentle</i>
<i>and forgiving with yourself.</i>

1184
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,460
<i>Be kind to yourself</i>

1185
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:21,670
<i>as you were to me.</i>

1186
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,170
<i>We found the resolve</i>
<i>to walk this uncertain path together.</i>

1187
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,000
<i>without knowing what lies ahead.</i>

1188
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,970
<i>Even if all that awaits us</i>
<i>is a pitiful ending,</i>

1189
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,840
<i>we will walk this path together</i>

1190
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,050
<i>until the very end.</i>

1191
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,080
YU MI-JI

1192
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,210
If you use these, it won't be organic.

1193
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,710
I'm not doing organic farming.

1194
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:39,380
<i>How about this? I invest</i>
<i>the initial capital and take eight.</i>

1195
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,050
<i>She's not interested in dating.</i>

1196
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,800
<i>What's going on between you two?</i>

1197
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,590
<i>Do you know Ho-su isn't well?</i>

1198
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,350
<i>I want to try everything I can.</i>
<i>Meds, treatments, anything.</i>

1199
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:52,270
Have you ever thought
about working with me?

1200
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,980
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>
<i>What's wrong with Grandma?</i>

1201
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:55,980
Mi-ji.

1202
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:57,810
<i>Let's go.</i>

1203
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,190
<i>Let's go home, Grandma.</i>
