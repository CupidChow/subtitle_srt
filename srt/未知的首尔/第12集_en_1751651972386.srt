MATH
PART ONE

3
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,390
Just when you start
to get the hang of things,

4
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,940
the chapter you know ends
and an unfamiliar one begins.

5
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,940
Some people rush ahead
to read the final page,

6
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,360
but I was the type
to run away from the ending.

7
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,080
The type who can't let go
of the main character

8
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,120
and leaves the final volume unread,

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,830
and the type who never beats
the final boss so the game won't end.

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,130
Maybe it's because
I already knew that deep down,

11
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,470
no matter how tightly I held on,

12
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,800
I couldn't stop the ending from coming.

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,810
FINAL EPISODE
THE END IS A NEW BEGINNING

14
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,730
I guess the smart ones
handle despair differently.

15
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,450
If it were me, I'd just fall apart.
I'd spend my days crying and sleeping.

16
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,240
Even in the midst of such despair,
you kept looking for solutions.

17
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,490
I'm no different. I'm just flailing here.

18
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,960
I know there's no way out of this.

19
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,710
What did the doctor say?

20
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,340
Luckily, it hasn't gotten any worse,

21
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,130
but I don't think it'll get better.

22
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,300
Still, I want to try everything I can.

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,970
Meds, treatments, anything.

24
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,060
Take the meds now.

25
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,190
Gosh, there are so many pills…

26
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,940
I already took them.
What?

27
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,030
You weren't talking about your meds
when you said you left something at home?

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,450
Before we get to that…

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,110
there's something I want to say.

30
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,290
What now?

31
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,330
I want to apologize properly.

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,580
I didn't want you to get hurt,

33
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,540
but I ended up hurting you even more.

34
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,170
I thought being on my own
would make me less of a burden,

35
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,590
but I didn't realize how selfish that was.

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,550
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,520
How can you…

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,310
be like this?

39
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,400
It took me ten years to figure that out,

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,270
and I still had no idea what to do.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,610
So I just wanted to be with you.

42
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,780
If you had said no,

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,400
I was ready to camp out
in front of your place.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,910
I never thought you'd come to me first.

45
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,830
You're not like me.

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,950
You really are…

47
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,160
a better person than I am.

48
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,290
Honestly, nothing has changed.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,800
My ears are the same,
and I don't know what will happen next.

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,220
And surely, being by my side will be hard.

51
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,180
Even so…

52
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,430
I want to be with you.

53
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,600
Even if it's hard,

54
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,810
I want to stick it out together.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,820
Hey.

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,530
Why do you keep saying
what I should be saying?

57
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,200
Now I've got nothing to say.

58
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,490
Jeez.

59
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,870
Hey…

60
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,290
Here.

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,430
Ho-su, when did you…

62
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,640
Put it on.

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,520
How does it fit so perfectly?

64
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,570
Hey, when did you put that ring on?

65
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,320
Do you like it?

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,950
Ho-su.

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,330
Thank you.

68
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,790
This is so pretty.

69
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,380
By the way,

70
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,470
can you actually catch any fish here?

71
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,510
We're fishing for time.

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,680
FARM OPERATION PLAN

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,350
Do we really need these contracts
and business license stuff?

74
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,140
It seems like a hassle.
It'd be easier to just run it as is.

75
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,890
I think it's better to get things sorted

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,650
so we can apply for young farmer
support funds or subsidies later on.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,230
You already have a lot to worry about,

78
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,740
and it wouldn't feel right to keep asking
someone in the States for help.

79
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,280
I like that idea. I'm okay with it.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,780
I'm not, though.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,870
I just want to try running a business
under my own name.

82
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,370
I thought you were all by the book.
Turns out you're quite ambitious.

83
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,710
But do you have money?
Running a business requires money.

84
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,670
I have my severance pay,

85
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,170
so I'll use that
to build a stock portfolio.

86
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,510
And I'm thinking of starting a blog too.

87
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,850
A blog? About farming?

88
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,140
No, an investment blog.

89
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,190
Like the one you used to run,
"Se-jinvestor."

90
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,690
How do you know Se-jinvestor?

91
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,070
You somehow know everything about me.

92
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,200
I got a lot of tips from that blog.

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,700
So I figured I'd go ahead and share
my investment ideas like that too.

94
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,370
Maybe you could take a look sometime.

95
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,460
I charge for consulting, you know.

96
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,210
Okay, it's free for a business partner.

97
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,550
By the way, about that house.

98
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,890
Would it be okay if I lived there?

99
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,600
Sure, I don't mind.

100
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,310
But wouldn't staying at your mom's
be better for you?

101
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,980
It'd save time on commuting,
and I'm more comfortable living alone.

102
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,690
Is it okay if I make some changes
while I'm living there?

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,900
You got super upset that time
I threw out the chair.

104
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,610
That was ages ago.

105
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,570
Sorry about that again.

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,370
Even if you tear the place down
and pitch a tent,

107
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,330
I won't say a word. Promise.

108
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,330
Jeez.

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,130
Thank you.

110
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,260
How about this?

111
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,340
I invest the initial capital
and take eight.

112
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,970
That's not very fair.

113
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,140
Ninety-two to eight.

114
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,180
That's not fair either.

115
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,310
We don't even know
how profitable it will be.

116
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,060
That's how investing works.

117
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,110
If you don't like it, stick to savings.

118
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,820
It's like fishing.

119
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,950
If you catch something, great.

120
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,490
If you don't,
at least you got some meditation in.

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,780
Look, it moved.
What? Why?

122
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,830
How?
Just now.

123
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,450
I'm scared of fish. You do it, quick!

124
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,790
Why are you fishing, then?
Get the scoop net!

125
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,290
Shouldn't we pull it up first?
Then pull it up.

126
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,540
What do I…
No!

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,090
Didn't we decide
to do this part like this?

128
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,050
Yes.
But look over there!

129
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,970
The left side is way too low!

130
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,310
She might go up there herself soon.
Lower the right side.

131
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,600
She really might.

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,810
Yes. Now that's too low.

133
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,310
You never laughed
when she wasn't around, did you?

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,850
Right there. Try leveling it…

135
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,610
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

136
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,150
We're way past apologizing
for things like that.

137
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,530
Gently to the right.

138
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,660
No matter how hard your day is,

139
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,950
one second of laughter
can get you through it.

140
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,410
Be careful.

141
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,420
So don't ever let go of the person
who makes you laugh.

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,750
Come on. We're putting up the sign.

143
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,010
Hurry up.

144
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,260
Thank you.
Sure.

145
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,350
Call if you need anything.
Okay. Take care!

146
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,600
ROSA RESTAURANT
SERVING CHICKEN GIBLET STEW FOR 35 YEARS

147
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,350
Ho-su, shouldn't you be heading
to the hospital for your appointment?

148
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,100
I'll be fine if I leave now.

149
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,270
Ms. Sang-wol, I'll get going.

150
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,610
Okay.

151
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,820
I'll call you.

152
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,990
If you have time, how about some coffee?

153
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,200
What's this?

154
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,030
Such a classic pickup line.

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,410
Let's go.

156
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,710
Let me open the door for you.

157
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,220
Thank you.
Sure.

158
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,400
I never thought I'd see the day
when this place would feel peaceful.

159
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,650
Now that the sign's up,

160
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,870
doesn't it feel like
more sunlight is coming in?

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,370
We only changed the sign.
Everything else is the same.

162
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,370
The shop's name hasn't changed,

163
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,880
and I'm still selling chicken giblet stew.

164
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,930
But now that my name's changed,
it feels different.

165
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,100
It's like all these locked doors

166
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,680
unlocked at the same time,

167
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,900
and now I don't know
which one to open first.

168
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,030
I heard you decided
to start treatment for dyslexia.

169
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,200
I kept saying there was no point
in learning anything,

170
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,450
but Ho-su said
it's something to improve on,

171
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,580
not something to learn,
and insisted that I give it a shot.

172
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,540
He went out of his way
to look into it for me.

173
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,340
I should at least give it a try,
even if it's pointless.

174
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,420
You're amazing.

175
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
What?

176
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,680
Are you teasing?

177
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,350
No. I mean it.

178
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,230
When I think I can't do
something very well,

179
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,190
I just make excuses
and pretend not to care.

180
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,400
But you aren't running away
from it like I would.

181
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,030
You're going to try
even if it's pointless.

182
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,450
That's impressive.

183
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,950
Gosh.

184
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,700
If you think I'm amazing,
you should try something pointless too.

185
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,790
That's what I've been thinking about.

186
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,290
Which pointless thing should I try?

187
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,300
I still have to make a living, though.

188
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,170
Gosh.

189
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,090
Speaking of making a living,

190
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,220
have you ever thought
about working with me?

191
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,390
What?

192
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,390
You can learn from me,

193
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,900
and when I'm too old,

194
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,980
you can take over this place.

195
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,440
Then…

196
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,700
you'd at least make a living.

197
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,030
I'm so grateful.

198
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,040
But you're not interested in my offer?

199
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,370
It's not that.

200
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,630
It's such a generous offer,
and I'll definitely think about it.

201
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,420
So you already have
something else in mind?

202
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,510
I kind of do.

203
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,510
But I might end up begging you
to let me work here later.

204
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,100
You'll still accept me then, right?

205
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,020
Just let me know
if you're ever interested,

206
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,980
even if it's just part-time.

207
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,530
Aren't you going to tell me
what you've been thinking about?

208
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,240
It's too early to say.

209
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,870
What is it that's got you all shy?

210
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,830
I'll tell you later.

211
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,870
Gosh.

212
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,790
So what you're saying
is that you're taking over the farm

213
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,000
instead of going back to Seoul?

214
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes.

215
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,970
God. It's too fishy.

216
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,680
You've only worked in an office.
How can you handle farming?

217
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,390
I've been doing it all along.

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,600
And why live alone out there

219
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,310
when you have
a perfectly good house to live in?

220
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,520
I've been living alone all this time.

221
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,110
But that was in Seoul.

222
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,070
You're the one who said
Seoul was more dangerous.

223
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,530
I'll come visit often.

224
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,700
No, I mean…

225
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,910
After all the work you've done,

226
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,540
now you're talking about farming?
That's more than a waste.

227
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,960
You're wasting your talent.

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,500
I'm not saying I'll do it forever.

229
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,460
While running the farm,

230
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,380
I'll keep working on
what I really want to do.

231
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,680
I just want to see if I can do it alone
through my own will and effort,

232
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,340
instead of doing what I'm told.

233
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,600
Gosh.

234
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,020
Didn't you say I should do what I want?

235
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,600
Fine. Do it.

236
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,270
I'm not stopping you.

237
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,310
Go ahead.

238
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,400
What?

239
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,860
Are you Mi-ji?

240
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,110
No.

241
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,830
Really? Mom said, "Go ahead"?

242
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,040
I wish I had been there,
just to see her face.

243
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,670
Anyway, if you still haven't decided
what to do next,

244
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,050
do you want to work with me?

245
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,420
You mean farm work?

246
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,050
I think it'll be tough
to manage on my own at first.

247
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
And if you don't want to move back here,

248
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,260
how about once or twice a week?

249
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,640
I'll pay you.

250
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,060
I'll think about it.

251
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,730
Why?

252
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,190
Do you have something else in mind?

253
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,270
No…

254
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,280
Hey, if you're there,
let's do a video call.

255
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,990
I want to see Grandma's face.

256
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,860
Grandma!

257
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,120
Why do you look so tired?

258
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,580
Have you lost weight?

259
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm on a diet.

260
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,460
Mi-ji, see if you can convince
Grandma to eat.

261
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,210
What's wrong?
Grandma, have you lost your appetite?

262
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,090
Are you not well?

263
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,140
You know what? I'd better get over there.

264
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,050
And fatten you up.

265
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,970
Don't come.

266
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,520
Why? I miss you.

267
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,980
Should I come today?

268
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,520
No. Don't come.

269
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,690
You don't need to. I'll be with her today.

270
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,860
Why not? I can just drop by.

271
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,530
Don't bother. You're busy.

272
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,530
You've got to get ready
for the move. Don't come.

273
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,120
Did you two plan this?

274
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Why do you keep telling me not to come?

275
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,160
Gosh.
I'm hanging up.

276
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,580
Hey!

277
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,710
Jeez. What the heck?

278
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,340
Do I stink or something?

279
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,630
Neither of them wants me to come.

280
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,590
They probably think
it's an important time for you.

281
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,720
What is it?

282
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,970
It's just…

283
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,640
I did say I'd stay in Seoul,

284
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,720
but it feels like they're telling me
not to come until I've made it.

285
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,480
Like they're pushing me to start
before I'm ready.

286
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,480
You spent a long time
by your grandma's side.

287
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,320
They probably think you need
some time for yourself now.

288
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,070
Exactly.

289
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,900
Just because I have time for myself

290
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,620
doesn't mean I'll suddenly
become this amazing person.

291
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,370
It's a lot of pressure.

292
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,370
Mi-ji, no one's expecting
anything like that.

293
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,460
When you put it that way,
it does kind of sting.

294
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,090
They'll have reasonable expectations.

295
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,670
But is Grandma really okay?

296
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,550
She seemed really run-down.

297
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,600
Once you're done moving,

298
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,310
let's visit Duson-ri together.

299
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,060
Okay.

300
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,390
You didn't have to bring this.
I know you're busy as it is.

301
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
How did you find time to come?

302
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,020
Mi-rae said she'd stay
with Grandma at the hospital today.

303
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,900
Mi-rae did?
Yes.

304
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,610
Even with her crazy schedule,
she still has time for her grandma.

305
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,530
She's been here for a few days.

306
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,910
She's not so busy anymore.

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,460
What do you mean?

308
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,500
She quit her job.

309
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,670
She didn't say much,

310
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,590
but I guess it was tough for her.

311
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,510
I see.

312
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,720
Mi-rae will find another good job soon.

313
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,310
She wants to farm.
Over at the strawberry farm.

314
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,100
Who does?

315
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,400
Mi-rae, not Mi-ji?

316
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,860
Yeah. The funny thing is,
Mi-ji's staying in Seoul.

317
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,030
Good God.

318
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,570
They say you never stop worrying
about your kids.

319
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,160
They really are twins,
both worrying me at the same time.

320
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
Hey.

321
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,120
You're lucky to have a son like Ho-su.

322
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,090
I need to go to Seoul soon
because of Ho-su.

323
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
What for?

324
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,420
His hearing has gotten worse.

325
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,130
I want to be there
during his hospital stay.

326
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,430
Hospital?

327
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,510
Is it that bad?

328
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,470
Well, we'll see how his treatment goes.

329
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,100
Still, thinking back to when he was a kid,
I'm grateful things are not worse.

330
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,110
At least now, it's not life-threatening.

331
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,570
That's true.

332
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,780
We worry about things like this
because they're alive and well.

333
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,780
Is the owner of that strawberry farm

334
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,740
the same one Mi-ji had a thing with?

335
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,120
I told you the rumors are not true!

336
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,080
Bun-hong, Mi-ji is still a kid.

337
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,960
She's not interested in dating.

338
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,130
I used an elite lawyer to help me move.

339
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,800
How should I repay you?

340
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,890
Do I get to choose?

341
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,770
You have two options. Cheek or lips.

342
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,190
Can I choose both?

343
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,980
Mi-ji?

344
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,610
Mom.

345
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,910
How did you…

346
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,580
Is that you, Ho-su?
Yes.

347
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,210
Hello.

348
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,170
She's moving,
so I came to help her pack.

349
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,800
What's going on between you two?

350
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,760
It just happened. We're a thing now.

351
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,850
Oh dear.

352
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,430
Let me get that.
Yes.

353
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
No, it's fine.

354
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
Why should you have to do that?
Jeez.

355
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,150
Okay. Have you had dinner?

356
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,110
Yes, what time do you think it is?

357
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,030
It's late. You should go.

358
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,690
Mom.
Okay.

359
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,400
I'll leave then.

360
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,660
Yes, go.
Bye.

361
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,620
Go. Hurry.
All right. Bye.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,290
Don't.

363
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,460
Good God.

364
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,340
Go already!

365
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,970
Why did you leave all the lights on?

366
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,940
Money doesn't grow on trees.

367
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,110
You said you'd come tomorrow with Mi-rae.
Why did you show up without calling me?

368
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,900
What would've happened
if we'd missed each other?

369
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,990
Seriously,
what would have happened?

370
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,570
I never would've guessed.

371
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,740
Jeez.

372
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,120
Good Lord.

373
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't believe I saw my daughter
kissing a guy in the street.

374
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,250
I'm hungry.

375
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,580
Is there anything to eat?

376
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,170
Didn't you say you ate already?

377
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,710
That was just to get him to leave quickly.

378
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,010
I'm starving.

379
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,970
Order something for me.

380
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,350
We could've just eaten with Ho-su.

381
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,010
What's wrong with you?

382
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,140
You made things so awkward
by cutting him off and sending him away.

383
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,480
You even lied to send him away.

384
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,520
Do you know Ho-su isn't well?

385
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,730
What?

386
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,240
Come and sit down.

387
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,160
His mom told me.

388
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,290
His hearing is getting worse,
so he needs to be hospitalized.

389
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,080
Why are you bringing that up?

390
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,620
Was that the reason you acted that way?

391
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,750
What does his condition have to do
with us seeing each other?

392
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,420
You knew? And you made him
pack boxes this late?

393
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,800
He's about to be hospitalized.

394
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,100
If his mom found out, she'd faint!

395
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,560
I didn't really make him do much.

396
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,850
Do you think it's easy
being with someone who's unwell?

397
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,900
You need to become much more mature
and tougher than you are now.

398
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,860
If you're not ready for that,
don't even start this.

399
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,110
Don't hurt a good kid just because
things get hard later on. Got it?

400
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,910
I won't.

401
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,160
I mean it.

402
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,330
God, what was I thinking?

403
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,580
I can't believe I said
you weren't interested in dating.

404
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,210
Jeez Louise, my head hurts.

405
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,170
Just order some food.

406
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,820
Wow. American chocolate.

407
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,410
Wow, fancy whiskey. It's 30 years old.

408
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,700
Wow…

409
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you sharpening?
It's kind of scary.

410
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,380
Just say it.

411
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,710
Say what?
Anything.

412
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,710
All I have after studying abroad
is a high school diploma.

413
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Just yell at me already.

414
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,880
Why would I yell at you for that?

415
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,760
Because I didn't see it through
to the end.

416
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,310
You worked so hard to support me.

417
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,610
Is graduation "the end"?

418
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,240
People get a college diploma
to help them start working.

419
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,030
You said you're starting work now.

420
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,450
So, you saw it through to the end.

421
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Still…

422
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,420
You don't stay on the bus
until the last stop.

423
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,000
You get off when it's your stop.

424
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,090
And…

425
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,670
why is the end so important?

426
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,430
The beginning is what matters.

427
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,060
Wow, you're quite talkative today.

428
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,730
Should we open
the 30-year-old whiskey today?

429
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,830
I told him not to save it for too long.
He never even drank it.

430
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,010
It's nice.

431
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,600
Mi-rae said she's meeting someone
and will be here around lunchtime.

432
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,350
I'm going to the real estate office.

433
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,900
Hey, Mi-ji.

434
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,480
Wait for me. Let's go together.

435
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,320
Together?
Yes.

436
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,780
Didn't you come to help Mi-rae move?

437
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,490
There's barely anything to help with.

438
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,620
I came because you said
you were signing a lease.

439
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,410
Let's go.

440
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,170
Look who's being nice.

441
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,380
What do you mean?

442
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
Let's go.

443
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,510
Move, hurry.

444
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,390
How did you manage to find time
during lunch?

445
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,140
I'm quitting soon, so it doesn't matter.

446
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,770
So, what happened to everyone?

447
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,110
Maybe it's because of the media coverage,
but it wrapped up sooner than expected.

448
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,910
Mr. Shin was the first
to be fired as a scapegoat.

449
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,660
And Director Choi,

450
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,410
who is a department head now…

451
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,870
PLACE OF ASSIGNMENT: CHILDAL BRANCH

452
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,080
…got transferred to the Childal branch.

453
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,790
He was rumored to be moving
to Sihan Construction.

454
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,380
But I guess things didn't work out,
so he's just going to Childal.

455
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,180
And my sister…

456
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,430
came out of her room.

457
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,390
She still has trouble going out,

458
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,350
but she's started therapy too.

459
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,650
It's all thanks to you.

460
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,570
What about you, Tae-i?

461
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,030
Now that things with your sister
are settled,

462
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,370
are you going back to school?

463
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,370
I thought about it,

464
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,290
but I've decided to spend time
with my sister

465
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,660
and start looking for a job.

466
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,960
Turns out, office life suits me
more than I expected.

467
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,090
What? Why do you think that?

468
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,050
Working in an office
is easier than grad school.

469
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,510
What?
I get off work on time,

470
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,760
and there are no professors.

471
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,100
So what will you do?

472
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,640
Farming.

473
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,890
What?

474
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,520
Can you give me some context?

475
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,320
The water seems to be running fine.

476
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,160
Is this a storage space?
I've checked everything.

477
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,700
I looked at more than ten places
before choosing this place!

478
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,660
Okay. Stay out of this.

479
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,700
Your mom is really thorough.

480
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,580
But honestly,
there's no better place than this one.

481
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,880
Today alone,
five people came by to see it.

482
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,670
Why didn't any of them sign the lease?

483
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,510
Because your daughter reserved it first.
I see.

484
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,680
Everyone's waiting for this
to be available again.

485
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,010
Mom.
Goodness.

486
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
I told you to stay out of this.

487
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,020
It's not bad, but it's a bit too small.

488
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,230
I heard there's a unit
with a living room too.

489
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,730
How much is the rent?

490
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,650
The ones with living rooms
are a bit pricier.

491
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,120
Everyone starts out in a studio.

492
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,830
If you start out in a big place,

493
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,370
you won't be able to keep up
with the costs later.

494
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Lastly, please check

495
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,670
the real estate registry record.
Okay.

496
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,840
If it looks good,
we can proceed with the contract.

497
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
All right.

498
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,470
Well…

499
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,470
I don't see a problem.

500
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,220
Excuse me, but…

501
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,980
If I put down a bit more for the deposit,
can we lower the monthly rent

502
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,440
by about 50,000 won?

503
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,400
I'll ask the landlord.

504
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,860
Mom, I can't put down any more
for the deposit.

505
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,740
Who said you had to?

506
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,580
I'm using the money
from my matured savings.

507
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,490
Just pay me back when you move out.

508
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,500
Okay.

509
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,080
The landlord agreed.
Really?

510
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,210
Thank you.

511
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,550
Now write your name under "Tenant,"
and sign here. On both forms.

512
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,760
All right.

513
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,930
What are you doing? Sign here.

514
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,560
Me?

515
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,060
Of course. It's your place.
Who else would sign?

516
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,310
Right.

517
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,400
Here.

518
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,070
I said sign!

519
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,450
What's with your handwriting?
Are you in elementary school?

520
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,410
It's my first time signing something.

521
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,410
Let's get a stamp made for you later.

522
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,830
TENANT: YU MI-JI

523
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,580
There.

524
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,720
Hello, this is the teachers' office
at Duson Elementary School.

525
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,510
Yes, this is she. Did you say flowers?

526
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,720
Who are they from?

527
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,640
Hello?

528
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,820
Mom.

529
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,490
Oh my, what's gotten into you?

530
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,490
Goodness me.

531
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,530
Gosh. You could've called me.

532
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,280
This is my son.

533
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,870
So you're the lawyer son
we've heard so much about?

534
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,460
Hello.
Right.

535
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,790
Hello.

536
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,000
What is all this? My goodness!

537
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,250
What's this for?

538
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,050
I didn't want to come empty-handed.
Gosh.

539
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,670
He really is handsome.

540
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,260
I know he is.

541
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,140
You didn't have to come.
There's nothing special to see.

542
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,600
My plans got canceled,
so I wanted to visit you at work.

543
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,230
Anything new with you lately?

544
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,360
Nothing special.

545
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,650
Did you know Mi-rae
quit her job and moved here?

546
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,320
She's going to run a strawberry farm now.

547
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,280
And the owner of that farm…

548
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,580
was the same one Mi-ji had a thing with

549
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,290
What?

550
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,370
You know.

551
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,080
Mi-ji and the farm owner…

552
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,500
liked each other.

553
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,260
I don't think that's true.

554
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,630
It is!

555
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,510
Lots of people saw them.

556
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,470
People said Gyeong-gu and the farm owner

557
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,020
got into a fight over Mi-ji
and ended up rolling on the ground.

558
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,730
Actually, we're seeing each other.

559
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,440
Who?

560
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,690
The farm owner?

561
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,450
No, not him. Mi-ji.

562
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,040
I'm dating Mi-ji.

563
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,750
Mi-ji? But you two
have hardly spent any time together.

564
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,170
Is that why Mi-ji went to Seoul?

565
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,960
No, it's not that.

566
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,090
I've liked her for a long time.

567
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,970
Since high school.

568
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,100
All this time I thought it was Mi-rae.

569
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,810
It was Mi-ji?

570
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,520
You know how I was
when we first moved here.

571
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,730
I was on edge and prickly.

572
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,690
Thanks to Mi-ji, I've changed a lot.

573
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,780
When I'm with her, I laugh a lot more.

574
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,710
Honestly, Mi-ji's the best there is.

575
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,290
I would know because I've worked with her.

576
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,920
But you said that, unlike Mi-rae,
Mi-ji still seems like a kid.

577
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,920
I was saying she's pure-hearted.
And bubbly.

578
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,220
She's just pure.

579
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,470
I'm happy for you, Ho-su. Congratulations.

580
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,440
My son is dating now.

581
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,270
You've never had pho before?
Not even once?

582
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,110
I've had it in school lunches.

583
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,700
But that was more like beef bone soup.

584
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,950
This one smells and tastes
totally different. It's pretty good.

585
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,620
You should go out
and eat good food sometimes.

586
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,500
And didn't your old classmates
go to Vietnam or somewhere?

587
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,420
You should join them on trips like that.

588
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,420
You should be the one
going out and having fun.

589
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,630
Go abroad like everyone else.

590
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,180
Isn't there anywhere you want to go?

591
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,550
Not really.

592
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,720
You're the same, Mom.

593
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,930
Hey, I wanted to travel the world
at your age.

594
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,400
That's why I married your dad.

595
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,020
He said if I went with him to France
for his expat posting, I could study art.

596
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,400
That darn Louvre
and the Musée d'Orsay had me fooled.

597
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,070
But then you two came along
and the IMF crisis hit,

598
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,620
and I never even got a stamp
in my passport.

599
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,620
You wanted to study art?

600
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,660
Didn't I tell you?

601
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,830
I was going to go to art school,

602
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,130
but your grandma was against it,
so I moved to Seoul.

603
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,050
I told her I'd pay for my tuition.

604
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,220
I still remember going around

605
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,010
looking for a place to live
when I first came to Seoul.

606
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,140
Because I was a young girl on my own,
people looked down on me

607
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,310
and only showed me unlivable places.

608
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,440
Those awful people.

609
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,360
Did you come because you were worried
I'd go through the same thing?

610
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,400
Did you think I came to see the sights?

611
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,030
Gosh.

612
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,950
It's nice to be back in Seoul
after so long.

613
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,040
It's nice to eat this too.

614
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,880
Couldn't you still do it?

615
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,170
Do what?

616
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,170
What you always wanted.

617
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,800
You can still paint, right?

618
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,260
Come on, it's too late for me…

619
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,640
You should do what you want,
now that you're in Seoul.

620
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,850
It's too late for me.

621
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,390
We're not the same…

622
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,940
Fine, I'll paint.

623
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,110
So you should do what you want too.

624
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,410
As long as it's not a crime,
I won't stop you.

625
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,410
Right, you even let Mi-rae farm.

626
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,830
Jeez.

627
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,250
I won't stop you. Really.

628
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,090
I would've been fine on my own.
You didn't have to come.

629
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,380
What time is it?

630
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,680
I'll get going.
Okay.

631
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,640
Go straight home.
Got it.

632
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,550
All right.
Call me when you get home.

633
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,720
Go already.
Okay.

634
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,100
Mom.

635
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,730
Thank you.

636
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,110
For what?

637
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,860
Everything.

638
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,610
Jeez.

639
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,570
What's with you? You're being all mushy.

640
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,040
Just go already. Go!

641
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Go, hurry!

642
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,040
Okay. You go first.

643
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,670
Go.

644
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,840
Jeez. Go.
I will.

645
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,430
Seriously, go!

646
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,260
I am going!

647
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,890
I'll call you.
All right.

648
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,770
Hey! Yu Mi-rae!

649
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,820
Do you have to go this far?

650
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,440
Do we really need
to take this to civil court?

651
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,400
Isn't it enough that I quit?

652
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,700
You quit because
you were afraid you'd get fired.

653
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,290
I got a suspended sentence.
What more do you want?

654
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,000
I've already paid the price.

655
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,790
That was just your share
of the consequences.

656
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,880
Breaking a window and owning up to it
doesn't magically replace the glass.

657
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,800
You still have to compensate
for the damage you caused.

658
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,140
How much more do I have to suffer
before you're satisfied?

659
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,640
Well, you should pay the interest too.

660
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,530
Should I file for a restraining order too?

661
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,400
I'm pretty sure
he'd like to file one against me.

662
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,160
I heard you were busy,
but you always come in person.

663
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,950
Thank you.

664
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,830
I should fix the mess I started.

665
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,960
Would you like me to drop you off
somewhere on the way?

666
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,710
No, I have somewhere to go. Bye.

667
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,810
Why do I feel lonely?

668
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,440
No one's coming anyway.

669
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,480
Let's just hit up the duty-free shops.

670
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,540
Where are you right now?

671
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,830
I'm at the airport.

672
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,840
The airport?

673
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,460
I'm already inside.

674
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,010
Already?

675
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,220
You should've told me you were coming.

676
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,760
I asked you more than five times,
and you said no.

677
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,520
I wasn't sure when I'd be done.

678
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,020
Then you could've told me when you left.

679
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,520
Is it that hard to send a text
saying you're coming?

680
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,190
No wonder I didn't want
to go inside.

681
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,740
I…

682
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,240
I wanted to tell you in person.

683
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,370
Thank you…

684
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,540
for everything, really.

685
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,960
Have a safe trip--

686
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,210
Ms. Yu Mi-rae!

687
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,090
You said you had gone in already…

688
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,510
The check-in area. For first class.

689
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,850
I was checking in when you called.

690
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,810
You could've said that
instead of running over.

691
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,020
I was worried you'd leave.

692
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,110
You're impatient.
I figured you'd disappear again.

693
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,910
So what now?

694
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,700
It's not too late.
Should I get you a ticket?

695
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,660
Please…

696
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,080
ask me again another time.

697
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,550
Don't forget you said you'd send letters.

698
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,970
I said farm updates, not letters…

699
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,050
Whatever.

700
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,220
Newsletters, spam…

701
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,180
Just send anything.

702
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,890
Promise?

703
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,700
By the way, we can hug, right?

704
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,240
Sure. Why not?

705
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,300
If you come back to Korea,

706
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,510
you're always welcome at home.

707
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,090
I'll be back.

708
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,310
Darn it.

709
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,900
It must be tough to stay
in the hospital for a whole week.

710
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,530
I wish I could do this for you.

711
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,780
Should I pretend to be you?

712
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,540
I got my blood drawn once,
pretending I was Mi-rae.

713
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,620
I can't really talk on the phone,
but I can still text.

714
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,840
Feel free to text me anytime.
I'll be so bored here.

715
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,420
You're going to regret saying that.

716
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,340
I'll show you how loud I can be over text.

717
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
Hi, Mi-ji!

718
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
Gosh, ma'am!

719
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,430
I happened to be at the hospital…

720
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,440
Wow, what a coincidence!

721
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,810
So what's wrong, exactly?

722
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,730
She knows.

723
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
What?
Yes. I know.

724
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,990
Stay a little longer.

725
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,660
Don't leave because of me.
Should I just go?

726
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,750
No, don't.

727
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,500
I was just planning to stay
until he got checked in.

728
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,500
You two used to bicker all the time,
and now you've grown up and…

729
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,180
This might seem sudden,

730
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,930
but honestly,
I always felt closer to you, Mi-ji.

731
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,680
I mean it.

732
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,980
Especially on the day
we made strawberry jam together.

733
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,440
I felt it in my gut that day.

734
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,980
Oh, the strawberry jam?

735
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,080
Thank you for being there for Ho-su.

736
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,870
I hope you two make each other happy
for a long, long time.

737
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,790
Okay.
Good.

738
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,300
I'll get going now.
All right.

739
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,050
Bye.
Okay.

740
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,630
Bye.
Bye.

741
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,510
Bye.
Go.

742
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,850
Take care.
All right.

743
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,490
Hi, Mom.

744
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,740
Why do you sound like that?

745
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,250
What's wrong with Grandma?

746
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,750
What?

747
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,670
VACANT

748
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,300
Sir, please go to Seoul Station.

749
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
BONGDEOK HOSPITAL

750
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,730
Mom, where's Grandma?

751
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,350
You're here. She's inside.

752
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,270
Mi-rae's on her way. Sit.

753
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,900
What happened?

754
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,820
A heart attack?

755
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,490
Is she okay now?

756
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,660
Then why did you bring her back
to the nursing home?

757
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,120
She should've stayed in the ER.

758
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,170
They said there's nothing more
they can do for her here either.

759
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,840
She's old and very weak,

760
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,050
so she might not make it
through treatment.

761
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,720
What?

762
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,680
So we just leave her like this?

763
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,600
Mom, let's try another hospital.

764
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,440
We're taking her home.
What?

765
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,820
She's been saying
she wants to go home for days.

766
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,780
We'll bring her home.

767
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,320
You said she might not make it
past a few days.

768
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,530
We have to do everything we can.
Why are we giving up?

769
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,580
Mom.

770
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,620
Let's go.

771
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,410
Let's try one more hospital.

772
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,660
Do you think I want this?

773
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,210
She wants to go home.

774
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,800
That's all we can do for her now.

775
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,820
I should've come yesterday.

776
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,320
Or the day before.

777
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,790
Why did I listen
when she said not to come?

778
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,540
Grandma.

779
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,800
Are you with me? It's me, Mi-ji.

780
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,800
Mi-ji.

781
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,550
Yes.

782
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,010
Let's go.

783
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,390
What? What was that?

784
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,560
Home.

785
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,940
I want to go home.

786
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,610
Okay.

787
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,370
Let's go home now.

788
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,290
Grandma, we'll go home.

789
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,540
Let's go.

790
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,840
Let's go home, Grandma.

791
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,270
Mom's completely out.

792
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,230
She probably hasn't slept in days.

793
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,900
This reminds me of the old days.

794
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,320
Grandma never fell asleep before we did.

795
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,820
You should get some sleep too.

796
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,240
You haven't slept
since you got here yesterday.

797
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,120
I'm good.

798
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,670
Hey.

799
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,090
How are things at the farm?

800
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,180
Things are fine for now, but who knows.

801
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,680
Are you sure you don't want
to work with me?

802
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,930
I'll pay you.

803
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,940
How much?
Will you pay me 200,000 won a day?

804
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,650
The best part of having a sister
is cheap labor.

805
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,020
Goodness.

806
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,820
Look how shameless you've become.

807
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,150
It's too much for me
to handle alone right now.

808
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,320
Can't you help a few days a week?

809
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,740
I could probably help out
for a day here and there.

810
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,620
Why? Did you already get a job?

811
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,500
What is it? Why can't you tell me?

812
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,420
Wait, are you getting married?

813
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,550
Hey, are you crazy?

814
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,590
How could I get married?

815
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,800
If you're not getting married,
what are you trying to hide?

816
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,010
Stop dragging it out and just tell me.

817
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,770
What is it?

818
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,560
It's just…

819
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,650
I was thinking of… going to college.

820
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,570
What?

821
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,070
Cabbage? What do you mean?

822
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,900
I said "college."

823
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,410
College!

824
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,320
The one you take the CSAT for!

825
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,120
You?

826
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,700
I mean, there's no need…

827
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:11,040
I've been to college,
and honestly, you don't need it.

828
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,090
You might be better off

829
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,800
doing something else
instead of studying for the CSAT.

830
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
I know.

831
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,840
Having a degree
doesn't guarantee anything.

832
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,600
And I know wanting to go
doesn't mean I can.

833
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,470
But…

834
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,060
I'm embarrassed.

835
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,060
About what?

836
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,390
Ever since I was little,

837
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,480
I knew I could never catch up to you,
no matter how hard I tried.

838
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,440
So I gave up on studying early.

839
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:39,030
I figured it was less embarrassing
to not try than to fail.

840
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:41,990
But…

841
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,200
now I'm not sure
if that's really less embarrassing.

842
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,920
When I filled in for you at KFMC,

843
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,380
I was terrified at first.

844
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,670
I couldn't follow what anyone was saying,

845
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,970
and everyone was so smart
that I was scared to even talk to them.

846
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,890
But I had to report to the boss,
so I studied a bit

847
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,470
and started to understand things.

848
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,060
It all sounded complicated,
but there was nothing to be nervous about.

849
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,560
After that, I wasn't scared anymore.

850
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,770
Maybe college is like that too.

851
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,730
The thing I'm most scared
and embarrassed of.

852
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,570
I want to try it.

853
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,530
You're right.

854
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,160
Things might seem scary,

855
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,540
but once you dive in,
they're not all that.

856
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,630
College might disappoint you too. But…

857
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,960
it's better to try and be disappointed.

858
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:39,460
I'm all for it.

859
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,510
Man.
But…

860
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,220
if you want to go to college,

861
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,470
you'll have to study like hell.

862
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,480
Even if Ho-su tutors you…

863
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,310
Anyways,

864
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,690
you'll have to work your butt off.

865
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,530
Hey, why are you scaring me already?

866
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,780
Have you picked your major? Never mind.

867
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,160
Just go wherever your grades take you.

868
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,990
Grandma, did you hear her?

869
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,540
She's looking down on me
just because she's smart.

870
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,330
I'm not looking down on you.

871
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,370
You'll have to work really hard.

872
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,710
Don't you dare look down on me.
I'll bust my butt.

873
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,460
Should I take the exam for you?

874
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,380
Really? Should we switch again?

875
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,090
See, that's your problem right there.

876
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,970
Gosh, are you messing with me?

877
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,550
Even with my eyes wide open…

878
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,180
"Even with my eyes

879
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,310
wide open…"

880
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,930
…the dream stays the same.

881
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,850
"…the dream

882
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,520
stays the same."

883
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,610
"The dream stays the same."

884
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,120
Is there something you'd like
to read once your dyslexia improves?

885
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,410
There is one thing I want to read.

886
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,460
But I don't know what it says.

887
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,500
Should I read it for you?

888
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,130
No.

889
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,340
What if it says something bad about me?

890
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:26,070
KIM RO-SA

891
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,590
"My world…

892
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,670
began to sing…"

893
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,340
"Sangwol."
"My world…"

894
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,760
"A term for frost and the moon."

895
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,310
"…began to sing after meeting you.

896
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,270
Just as the wind carries the bird,

897
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,440
you led me to poetry.

898
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,610
My song,

899
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,240
my wind…"

900
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,700
"My…

901
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,960
Sang… wol."

902
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,420
MY SONG, MY WIND
MY SANG-WOL

903
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,970
"Dawn Rain."

904
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,770
INTERPRETATION OF SLEEP

905
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,410
Grandma.

906
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:06,880
Grandma.

907
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,300
Grandma!

908
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,390
You startled me.

909
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:16,310
Why are you up already?
You should sleep some more.

910
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,310
What happened? Are you all better now?

911
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,390
Of course.

912
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,440
Lying down all day was exhausting.

913
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,770
Thank goodness.

914
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,980
I was worried something serious
might happen to you.

915
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,780
What are you doing?

916
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
Packing.

917
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,910
All of a sudden? Are you going somewhere?

918
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,410
I've been lying in bed for ten years.

919
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,450
It's time I got out and about.

920
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,160
When the flowers bloom,
I'll go to Jeju Island.

921
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,540
When the snow melts,
I'll hike Mount Seorak.

922
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,460
Maybe I'll even travel abroad for once.

923
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:48,920
I want to come too.

924
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,920
You need to go to college.

925
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,510
Didn't you hear what Mi-rae said?
You have to study hard to get in.

926
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,060
Then I won't go to college.

927
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,100
I'll just travel and have fun with you!

928
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,850
Have fun later.

929
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,440
You've got so much to do,
and all you think about is having fun.

930
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,530
Why are you going that way?

931
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,610
Have you been gone so long
that you forgot where the door is?

932
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,700
It doesn't matter.

933
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,330
It's not like I'll be walking.

934
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,510
Grandma.

935
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,810
Don't go.

936
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,060
Stay with me.

937
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,480
Why are you acting like a baby again?

938
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,570
I know you won't come back if you leave.

939
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,450
No, I'm not letting you go.

940
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,830
I'll always come back.

941
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,250
On your hard days,

942
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,170
I'll come to you as a cloud

943
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,840
or as a bird.

944
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,140
What if I don't recognize you?

945
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,350
I won't know if it's you.

946
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,270
Of course you'll know.

947
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,600
If you see a funny-shaped cloud

948
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,690
or a bird staring right at you,

949
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,860
you'll know it's me.

950
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
You'll know right away, Mi-ji.

951
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,910
It's nothing to be sad about.

952
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,830
You don't need to come to the hospital.
I'll always be with you.

953
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,750
I want to see your place in Seoul,
since I couldn't when I was bedridden.

954
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,720
I also want to see
the college you'll get into.

955
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,930
Grandma, was it hard for you?

956
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,850
Were you in pain and frustrated?

957
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,270
Mi-ji.

958
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,400
If you can't stop crying,

959
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,780
and if you feel so sad and lost
that you can't do anything,

960
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,370
then I'll stay a little longer.

961
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,080
Grandma…

962
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,580
can hold on as long as you need me to.

963
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,220
You can go.

964
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,520
I won't cry too much.
I'll live my life as best as I can.

965
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,440
So don't worry about me.

966
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,440
See the things you wanted to see,

967
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,320
and go to all the places
you wanted to visit.

968
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,540
And every once in a while,

969
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,450
come…

970
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,040
visit me too.

971
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,810
Goodbye, Grandma.

972
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,840
I love you.

973
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,700
Mi-ji.

974
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,670
Mi-ji.

975
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,510
Grandma's gone.

976
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,150
Grandma.

977
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,930
Grandma.

CSAT SPECIAL LECTURE
MATHEMATICS 1

979
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,910
A chapter I loved came to an end.

YU MI-JI

981
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,920
And new days kept coming.

982
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,300
Hello.

983
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,170
Nice to meet you.

984
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,630
In Korean Sign Language,
this is how we clap.

985
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,560
Now, instead of "sign,"

986
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,850
we'll use the term "Korean Sign Language."

987
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,770
Just like Japanese, Chinese, or English…

988
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:18,350
As always…

989
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,440

…the days are unfamiliar, new,
and full of uncertainty.

992
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,780
If you use these, it won't be organic.

993
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,530
I'm not doing organic farming.

994
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,780
Really?

995
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,710
Here's today's farm update.

996
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:45,550
We completed the second round
of fertilizer application.

997
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,380
With the adjusted amount of irrigation,
the leaves are regaining their vitality.

998
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:54,220
The annual yield forecast
is currently being revised upward.

999
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,020
P.S.

1000
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,770
Everyone came to see the first harvest
of the new strawberry variety.

1001
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:02,480
They were disappointed
and said it was just the same.

1002
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,700
Despite everything,
we still managed to find joy.

You're doing great, okay?

1013
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,700
Is it sour?
Yes.

1014
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,370
Jeez, you just watered them wrong.

1015
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,330
Watered them wrong?

1016
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,000

Yes, that's right.

I told you. Stocks are your thing.

Why make life harder by doing farm work?

Only something even more bitter
can take away the bitterness of farming.

1026

I hid a potion for you.

1027

What did you bring?

1033

1037
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,980
Did you take classes?

1038
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,400
Oh please. Not at all.

1039
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,440
Mi-ji! Come out here.
Let's check the results together.

It's your third time anyway.
Sit.

What's there to hide? Show us.

1042
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:20,240
No! I want to see it by myself.

1043
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,660

01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,510

01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,720

ONE YEAR LATER

1047
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,640
Did you harvest the strawberries?

1048
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,980
Yes.
Gosh.

1049
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:49,610
Hey, Yu Smarty.
Aren't you going to get your cooling vest?

1050
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,190
Can you grab one for me?
I have a meeting with the distributor.

1051
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,240
Wow, a distributor meeting.

1052
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,450
That sounds so fancy.
You're next in line for president.

1053
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,030
Gosh, why does the current president
appoint the next president?

1054
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,540
Shouldn't there be an election first?

1055
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,000
Wait, you've already
harvested your strawberries?

1056
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,000
It's our second harvest.
What? Already?

1057
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,710
What's the Brix value?

1058
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,710
Thirteen.

1059
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,550
No way. You're kidding.

1060
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,260
Maybe I should plant these too.

1061
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,180
Jeez. Anyway, get a cooling vest for me.

1062
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:26,890
I'm heading out now.

1063
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,980
Oh my. These are sweet.

1064
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,520
No settlement today either.

1065
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,770
What if we can't reach
a settlement again next time?

1066
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:36,780
Then we go to trial. Don't worry.

1067
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,150
Okay.

1068
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,160
The mediation date is in two weeks.

1069
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,410
It's in two weeks.

1070
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,250
In two weeks?

1071
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:50,120
What was "Great job" again?

1072
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,080
Like this.

1073
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,850
Let's go. Shall we?

1074
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,400
Do you know him?

1075
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,520
He was a junior colleague.

1076
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,190
He's good.

1077
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,490
Excuse me, Senior.

1078
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:24,740
Do you know when you'll be able
to send the materials you promised?

1079
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,740
I said I'd send them when I'm done.

1080
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,790
If you're in such a hurry, do it yourself.

1081
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:34,090
But this is a team project,
and I've been doing it all alone…

1082
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,880
Yesterday, you said
you'd send them by the end of the day.

1083
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,300
So I…
I told you several times.

1084
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,550
I had Reserve Forces training yesterday.

1085
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,890
Reserve Forces training?

1086
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,550
What the heck?
I saw you drinking in the afternoon

1087
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,220
at Grandma's Bar yesterday.

1088
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,520
Why are you butting in?

1089
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,810
I've kept my mouth shut long enough.

1090
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,560
If you have time to lie, copy something
off the Internet and send it.

1091
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:56,270
You're a senior. Act like one.

1092
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,820
Hey, Junior!

1093
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,320
Just because you're older,

1094
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,200
you think you can talk down
to your seniors?

1095
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,240
Didn't you tell me to drop the honorifics?

1096
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,740
This guy is a nutcase.

1097
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,030
A nutcase?
Yes, you psycho.

1098
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,330
Send the file already.

1099
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,200
You little…
Don't you dare raise your hand.

1100
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,500
Who do you think you are?
I swear I'm going to…

1101
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,920
No, stop fighting!

1102
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Why are you so strong?
Please stop!

1103
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:18,750
I'm sorry, Mi-ji.
Stay still!

1104
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,720
I'm sorry I dragged you into that.
It was all because of me.

1105
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,010
Didn't I tell you to stop saying sorry?

1106
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,890
That guy deserved
to get grabbed by the collar,

1107
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,850
but you kept saying "sorry,"

1108
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,020
which made him raise his voice even more.

1109
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,060
Sorry.

1110
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,280
God, what's wrong with me?

1111
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,610
I keep trying to change,

1112
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,660
but it feels like
I always go back to how I was.

1113
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,660
Not at all.

1114
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,620
At the orientation,
you apologized nonstop.

1115
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,200
Did I?
Jeez.

1116
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,130
I've got ten more years on you,
so trust me.

1117
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,090
People only move forward.

1118
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:02,170
You might stumble and fall
or pause for a bit,

1119
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,130
but you never go backward.

1120
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:07,470
Even if you can't feel it,
you're always moving forward.

1121
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:09,010
So don't worry.

1122
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,430
Mi-ji.
Yes.

1123
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,230
You sounded really old just now.

1124
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:15,730
Hey.

1125
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,770
"Back to how I was," my foot.

1126
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,650
Come on.
Stop bugging your friend.

1127
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,070
Ho-su!

1128
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,780
College kids don't like it
when you talk their ears off.

1129
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,870
I can't help it. My mouth won't stop.

1130
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,790
I can't look the other way
when I see something wrong happening.

1131
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,920
PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH METHODS

1132
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,250
Why are you the only one
who sees when someone's struggling?

1133
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,800
It's like how you can see
every single strand of hair,

1134
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,420
when I can never see any.
Same thing, I guess.

1135
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,510
I know I should just let it go, but…

1136
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,180
If I have a sense of what's on their mind,

1137
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,140
I just can't let it go.

1138
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,140
Good thing you chose psychology.

1139
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:00,020
What matters most in psychology
is understanding people's minds,

1140
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:01,320
which you already do.

1141
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:05,780
No, statistics and brain structure
matter the most.

1142
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,490
That's…

1143
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,700
You'll do better
when you retake the course.

1144
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:12,240
Minds matter the most.

1145
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:13,370
Jeez.

1146
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,370
Let's see.

1147
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,120
What's on your mind…

1148
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,050
You're kind of freaking out
because you think we'll be late.

1149
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,380
You read that?
Yes.

1150
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,590
Then let's hurry.

1151
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,970
We're cutting it close with the flowers.

1152
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,010
Right, the flowers!

1153
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,100
Hurry up!

1154
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,680
KIM RO-SA'S POSTHUMOUS POETRY READING

1155
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,640
"What Makes a Person Human."

1156
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,890
By Kim Ro-sa.

1157
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,560
MY SONG, MY WIND

1158
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,520
What makes a person human

1159
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:46,860
Is love, pressed down just a little

1160
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,110
Pressed a little

1161
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,660
From above, below, and the sides

1162
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,620
Like freshly packed rice in a bowl

1163
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:03,460
Like an eraser worn down
From choosing kind words

1164
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,380
So that the warmth shared
Between two embraced bodies

1165
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:10,050
Won't escape

1166
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,720
Won't disappear

1167
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,680
And will become human

1168
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,320
You did great today.

1169
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,740
You did even better than in rehearsal.

1170
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:37,370
I saw you both come in.
Why are you always late?

1171
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,750
No, we weren't.

1172
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:40,830
We got here right on time.

1173
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,790
We were both late.
Why do I always get blamed?

1174
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,340
It's obvious.

1175
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,470
You're always late to the restaurant.
What?

1176
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:52,590
It was just five minutes,
and that was only yesterday.

1177
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,310
It's exam season.
Can't you cut your part-timer some slack?

1178
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:59,730
Ma'am.

1179
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,190
Are they your family?

1180
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:04,230
Yes, she's my great-niece.
I see.

1181
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,270
Let me take a photo of you three.

1182
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,190
Stand over there.
Okay.

1183
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:13,070
All right. One, two, three.

1184
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,700
Smile.

1185
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,280
One, two, three.

1186
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:19,950
This is the summer version

1187
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,540
of our popular product line,
"Tropical in Winter."

1188
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,880
We're using Rubysseom strawberries
as the main fruit

1189
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,290
with a jewel theme,

1190
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:29,050
and we'll arrange
the other fruits to match.

1191
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,130
Strawberries tend to get bruised easily.

1192
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,680
Should we add ice packs
or cushioning for shipping?

1193
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,430
The Rubysseom variety isn't that soft,

1194
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,680
so a single-layer packaging
should be fine.

1195
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,100
Okay.

1196
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,520
Thank you for your time
in the meeting, Ms. Yu.

1197
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:52,190
Thanks for your hard work, Ms. Giselle.

1198
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:55,570
That name fits you so well.
It really suits you.

1199
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,660
You must have had a lot of offers.

1200
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,250
I owe you one. Thanks, friend.

1201
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:04,540
No. I should thank you.

1202
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,670
How's business?
Is it better than your old corporate job?

1203
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:11,340
Do you mean KFMC?
Are you still interested?

1204
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,050
That's how it is
for someone who fell short.

1205
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,640
No matter how much I like my current job,

1206
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,850
I get hung up on what I missed.

1207
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,180
This job suits you really well.

1208
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,520
I know.

1209
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:29,190
Want to grab a bite since you're here?
I'm off soon.

1210
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,900
Let's do it next time.

1211
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,650
I have to stop by somewhere today.

1212
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,200
Mi-rae!

1213
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,920
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I got slammed with work.

1214
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,260
You didn't have to rush.

1215
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,510
Here.
Oh my.

1216
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,470
Share it with your coworkers.

1217
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,640
They're sweet this year, so don't worry.

1218
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,350
You should've called ahead.
We can't even sit down for tea.

1219
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,350
Just seeing you is enough.

1220
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,020
You must be busy. Head back in.

1221
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:09,810
Thank you.

1222
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,110
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

1223
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,780
You too.

1224
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,200
Go on. Hurry.

1225
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,660
Okay. I'll visit the farm again soon.

1226
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,910
Bye.

1227
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,210
Thank you.

1228
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,790
Found you.

1229
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,000
Se-jin.

1230
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,510
How did you…

1231
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,510
See? I recognized you, Mi-rae.

1232
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,390
I'm back.

1233
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:52,460
Next time I go to Duson-ri,
I should bring back an extra photo album.

1234
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,590
What the heck?

1235
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:00,050
Mi-rae says she's heading back now.
I thought she was staying over tonight.

1236
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,800
Yes, but she met someone
and is heading home right now.

1237
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:07,350
Since I got stood up,

1238
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,310
I guess I'll just sleep here tonight.

1239
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,810
Tend to my needs.

1240
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:15,020
Have my pajamas been washed and ironed?

1241
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,320
They're in the drawer.

1242
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:27,410
My pajamas…

1243
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:31,910
What is this?

1244
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,210
What?

1245
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,060
Hey.

1246
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,390
Did you know that
a primary caregiver's view on marriage

1247
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,770
has a huge influence
on their child's view on marriage?

1248
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,020
Really?

1249
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:02,690
My mom says the best decision
she ever made was getting married.

1250
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,570
Well, my mom always said

1251
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,160
you should only get married

1252
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,160
when you can live on your own.

1253
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,500
She drilled that into my head so hard.
Total gaslighting.

1254
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:17,130
Honestly, marriage is
just a stamp on a document.

1255
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,380
What's the big deal, really?

1256
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:23,670
But still, it's the beginning
of a new chapter in life,

1257
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,590
so I want to start it
at the right time, with a clear mind.

1258
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,430
You know, it'll be…

1259
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:32,390
You…

1260
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,350
finally figured out what you want to be?

1261
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:37,850
Yes.

1262
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,400
A therapist.

1263
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,110
That's perfect for you.

1264
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:46,360
I knew you'd figure it out.
Congratulations.

1265
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:51,410
But apparently,
you need a master's degree for that.

1266
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,870
Then go to grad school.

1267
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:57,750
I feel bad, though.
For making you wait so long.

1268
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:02,630
Is this about getting your first paycheck
before getting married?

1269
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,630
A few years' delay doesn't matter.

1270
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,470
You've found what you want to do.

1271
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:12,640
Hey, aren't you a bit disappointed?

1272
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,730
I mean, who knows
how long you'll have to wait.

1273
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,560
You know,

1274
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:20,360
the one who loves more
is supposed to wait.

1275
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,270
And I'm good at waiting.

1276
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:32,080
Don't run off after saying all this.

1277
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:34,450
I won't.

1278
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,760
Gosh.

1279
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,100
Hey.
What?

1280
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,680
I swear, there's something in here.

1281
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,640
Every time I try to do something, I mean…

1282
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,650
Hello.

1283
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,030
I wasn't doing anything. Why?

1284
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,570
You want me to come home?

1285
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:13,620
With Ho-su?

1286
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:15,920
COUNTRY HOUSE IN SAEUL-DONG

1287
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,190
There.

1288
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,960
Remodeling? At the same time?

1289
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,670
No, one after the other.

1290
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:25,880
We'll stay at each other's places
while our houses are being remodeled.

1291
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,170
So you two need to take some stuff
and toss what you don't need.

1292
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,260
But my place is small.
Can't I leave things here?

1293
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,850
Take something.

1294
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:37,020
Isn't Ho-su moving into a bigger place?

1295
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,640
Keep some stuff there.

1296
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:40,600
Excuse me.

1297
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:42,520
Ho-su's place is not a storage unit.

1298
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,230
Why dump junk at a new home?

1299
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,650
Gosh, who said anything
about a storage unit?

1300
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:52,200
I never said to store junk, did I?

1301
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,530
Actually, I've been
meaning to tell you this.

1302
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,660
When I move…

1303
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,250
It'll be nice.

1304
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,040
It must be.
You're that happy?

1305
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,300
Yes.

1306
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,340
We agreed not to talk about that yet.

1307
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,790
We have to tell them eventually…

1308
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,520
We can't tell them.

1309
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,600
"Living together" isn't
in our primary caregivers' vocabulary.

1310
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:25,310
But you said you'd take
the spare room once your lease is up--

1311
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,320
I will, but why tell them now?

1312
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,070
Even if we don't,
they'll find out the second they visit.

1313
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,900
There's a way to keep it under the radar.

1314
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:34,740
Don't you know
my college friends live alone?

1315
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,080
Are you planning something shady again?

1316
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,700
Don't you want to live with me?

1317
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:41,500
I didn't mean it like that.

1318
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,290
I just think we should be honest.

1319
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,840
I'm not saying we should never tell them.

1320
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,260
I'll let them know when the time is right.

1321
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,220
Ho-su, I need you for a sec.

1322
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,840
All right.

1323
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,680
We'll tell them someday, okay?

1324
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:00,640
Grab another box for me.

1325
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,810
Sure.

1326
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,230
DECEMBER 3, 1995
THE DAY MI-RAE AND MI-JI WERE BORN

1327
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,570
85 DAYS IN THE WORLD

1328
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:53,780
92 DAYS IN THE WORLD

1329
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,400
MI-RAE, MI-JI
I LOVE YOU FOREVER

1330
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,710
I realized after going through
a few chapters

1331
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,500
that life isn't a book with an ending.

1332
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:15,260
It's a notebook I have to fill in myself.

1333
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:22,350
Even if I'm confronted by a blank page,
it's not the end, but a beginning.

1334
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:30,560
It's the unwritten first page of my story.

1335
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:37,280
There will surely be
unexpected twists and turns along the way…

1336
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,660
MI-JI, SEOUL!

1337
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:42,740
…but I'll keep searching
for a line of happiness

1338
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,830
and keep writing

1339
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:49,120
until I've filled every page.

1340
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,020
Mi-ji!

1341
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,650
Yes?

1342
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,690
MY SEOUL

1343
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,020
