OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,383
Gosh, the Hangang River is amazing.

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,302
Aren't you hungry?
Want to get some <i>ramyeon?</i>

4
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,388
Wait, what time's the fountain show?

5
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,806
Should we eat after watching it?

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,766
No, maybe we should wait until sunset…

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,767
Mi-ji.

8
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:11,989
You're Mi-ji, aren't you?

9
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,374
No, I'm not.

10
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,420
You're not?

11
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,466
You think I'm Mi-ji?
What makes you say that?

12
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,510
Why do you think I'm her?

13
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,848
The way you were talking
and acting was just like Mi-ji.

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,183
You seemed just like her.

15
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,810
I see.

16
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,478
So you're saying

17
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,356
I'm not allowed to be cheerful
when I'm happy or excited?

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,526
- No, that's not what I meant--
- That's exactly what you meant.

19
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,945
Mi-ji is allowed to get excited,
but I'm not?

20
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,697
No, I'm just saying

21
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,825
that you seem a bit different
from your usual self--

22
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,327
My "usual self"?

23
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,288
Do you even know me that well?

24
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,083
We've hardly seen each other.
How dare you act like you know me!

25
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,838
I'm sorry if I upset you.

26
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,715
I didn't mean anything bad.

27
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,426
This is why I said you're self-absorbed.

28
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,888
You always act like you know everything,
as if you have all the answers.

29
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,223
Why can't you think of Mi-ji and me
as two separate people?

30
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,310
How could you ask me if I'm Mi-ji?

31
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,145
Did you really mean that?

32
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,655
No, I was joking.

33
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,536
<i>It closed.</i>

34
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,207
Don't make jokes like that anymore.

35
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,543
If you have nothing else to say,
let's get going.

36
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,223
<i>A person's heart is like a door.</i>

37
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,432
{\an8}RAINBOW FOUNTAIN SHUT DOWN

38
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,727
{\an8}<i>And I'm an expert at knowing</i>
<i>exactly when that door is closing.</i>

39
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,815
Mom! Look at me!

40
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,235
Mom!

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,195
Come down. It's dangerous.
You're going to fall.

42
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,614
- Mom, come on. Look at me.
- Yes, she's very active.

43
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,074
- Mom!
<i>- Since I was young,</i>

44
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,827
<i>I had a hard time getting people</i>
<i>to open their hearts to me.</i>

45
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,953
Mom!

46
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,081
Here they come. Mi-rae!

47
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,125
Your sister's coming. Come on!

48
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,668
Mi-rae!

49
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,586
Mom!

50
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,756
<i>I even struggled with my mom…</i>

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,883
- Eat this on the way.
<i>- …who was supposed to be easy.</i>

52
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,510
Please look at me.

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,559
<i>And then I met Ho-su.</i>

54
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,165
Why--

55
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,375
What? What's wrong?

56
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,130
I understand why it's like that.

57
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,214
What do you mean?

58
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,092
Why the graph goes like this.

59
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,512
This? You already get it?

60
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,139
Do the rest of you get it too?

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,933
- No, sir.
- We don't.

62
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,521
Ho-su is a bit fast. You guys are normal.

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,487
<i>A laugh shared by just the two of us.</i>

64
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,449
Hey.

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,618
<i>And tears shed in secret.</i>

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,378
<i>Ho-su's heart seemed like a door</i>
<i>that would never crack open.</i>

67
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,432
<i>And when I caught a glimpse of him</i>
<i>through that crack, my heart raced…</i>

68
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>like it did when I was running.</i>

69
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,564
- I'm so full.
- Me too.

70
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,694
- Hey, it's Ho-su.
- What?

71
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,946
Hey, Ho-su…

72
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,949
<i>The joy of knowing that even I had</i>
<i>a door I could open was short-lived.</i>

73
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,867
I heard Mi-rae and Ho-su are dating.

74
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,285
What?

75
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,371
Who told you that?

76
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,705
Everyone's saying it.

77
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,291
They're the top two students
in the school,

78
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,252
so the teachers are letting it slide.

79
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,547
There's no way Mi-rae would date Ho-su.

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>I grew anxious.</i>

81
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,804
<i>I was worried that someone else might open</i>
<i>the only door that I was able to open.</i>

82
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,139
Hey, Mi-ji!

83
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,725
{\an8}Take it easy and don't scare the others.

84
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,310
{\an8}- Where's Ho-su?
- Ho-su?

85
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,273
{\an8}He said he was coming with Mi-rae,
but they're still not here.

86
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,899
I can do it!

87
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,613
- Go!
- Run!

88
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,993
Go, Mi-ji!

89
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,744
{\an8}Go! One, two! Yes!

90
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>But even that door slammed shut</i>
<i>right before my eyes.</i>

91
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,274
<i>That's how I became an expert.</i>

92
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,902
<i>I'm all too familiar…</i>

93
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,863
- My leg. It hurts.
<i>- …with the moment a door shuts before me.</i>

94
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,199
<i>It hurts.</i>

95
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:56,249
EPISODE 3
KNOCK, KNOCK! PLEASE OPEN YOUR HEART

96
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,298
{\an8}Hello.

97
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,472
{\an8}Did you read the proposal inside the--

98
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,932
{\an8}I decline.

99
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,977
{\an8}Pardon? But when you called me yesterday…

100
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,021
{\an8}I said I'd treat you with respect

101
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,774
{\an8}since we're both just trying
to make a living.

102
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,320
All right.

103
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,406
I respectfully decline the offer.

104
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,785
I have no intention
of selling the building.

105
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,288
But why…

106
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,373
I…

107
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,086
<i>So…</i>

108
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,296
she refused your offer?

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,715
If you were just going to ask
the landowner for her opinion,

110
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,717
then you should've just texted her.

111
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,636
You should've just created a poll

112
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,764
so she could vote
on whether to sell it or not.

113
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,684
She doesn't have a smartphone.

114
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,895
Well…

115
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,440
I don't care if she uses
a walkie-talkie or a string telephone.

116
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,402
I didn't tell you to find out
what she was thinking.

117
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,697
If she doesn't want to sell,
then convince her to. That's your job.

118
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,574
Whether you use words or actions,

119
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,661
persuade her
with that brilliant brain of yours.

120
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,414
What am I supposed to do
when she doesn't want to sell?

121
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,749
You're the pro. Why are you asking me?

122
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,794
Aren't you an expert at luring people?

123
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,339
What? Me?

124
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,386
Just do what you always do.

125
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,305
Try working your charm
on that landowner too.

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,978
Who did you say he's bringing?

127
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,523
Mr. Kim, Chairman Choi's victim,
is bringing his lawyer today.

128
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,735
{\an8}Why did he hire a lawyer
when he's coming to settle?

129
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,695
I don't think he will be settling.

130
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,781
He said he'll be reviewing
the entire settlement proposal again.

131
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,700
SETTLEMENT

132
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,869
THE VICTIM, KIM SEUNG-YONG

133
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,082
- Why, this little…
- Pardon?

134
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,336
Which cases is Mr. Lee handling right now?

135
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,213
It states
that in any of those cases,

136
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,924
Party A shall bear the burden
of paying for the test.

137
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,178
But there's an unfair clause
in the standard business agreement

138
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,181
that YH Group has signed
with its partner companies.

139
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,932
It's Article 5, Paragraph 4.

140
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,601
- But Paragraph 3--
- Excuse me…

141
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,396
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,108
Was there a meeting today?
I didn't hear anything about it.

143
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,359
Ho-su.

144
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,529
Would you mind leaving if it's not urgent?
We're in a meeting.

145
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,073
Continue.

146
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,783
Yes, sir.

147
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,870
But if the quality inspection
and component analysis conducted

148
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,248
under Paragraph 3 reveal that
the supplied products fail to meet legal…

149
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,337
<i>Ma'am,</i>
<i>I reviewed your business proposal.</i>

150
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,090
<i>Thank you for specifically writing</i>
<i>the seedling section in bold text.</i>

151
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,133
<i>I feel like it was seared into my eyes.</i>

152
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,137
<i>Fine, let's work together.</i>
<i>We'll go look at seedlings first.</i>

153
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,765
Hey!

154
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,185
Why are you getting your boots
when you're going to the hospital?

155
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,145
I told you. I'm working at the farm again.

156
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,271
What?

157
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,525
Then who's going to go see Grandma?
I need to go to work.

158
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,401
I need to go to work too.

159
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,528
I told you yesterday.

160
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,571
Tell them you can't go!

161
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,157
There are plenty of other people
who can work on that farm!

162
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,368
The caregiver is coming next week,
so until then, you--

163
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,703
I can't do that
when I already promised to go.

164
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,330
You tell your boss you can't work today.

165
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,999
Hey, my work is not like yours!

166
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,460
Why not? They're both jobs.

167
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,340
What I mean is that you're the one
who always goes to Grandma.

168
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,552
- So I assumed that you'd go--
- You just assumed that.

169
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,053
But I told you that I can't.

170
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,848
From now on, tell me ahead of time.
Don't assume things on your own.

171
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,100
You go to the hospital today.
I'll go tomorrow.

172
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,228
My gosh.

173
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,523
Did she practice that last night?

174
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,608
The words just flowed out of her mouth.

175
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,651
Jeez.

176
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,125
Get in.

177
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,503
What is it?

178
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,381
You told me to get in
because you had something to show me.

179
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,803
Gosh, you're so impatient.

180
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,767
Okay.

181
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,736
Well…

182
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,697
The thing is…

183
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,365
I…

184
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,076
I just couldn't wait any longer.

185
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,038
Take a look, okay?

186
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,332
Oh my gosh! You're crazy!

187
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,210
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

188
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,377
No, wait.

189
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,545
Stop! Don't do it!

190
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,005
- What…
- No, Mi-ji. Wait.

191
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,256
I told you to stop!

192
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,467
Wait! Hold on!

193
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,802
- Give me a second. Take a look.
- I told you to stop!

194
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,012
I said, stop! Hey!

195
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,305
- Jeez!
- Hey.

196
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,975
Come on, just look!
You told me to just do it.

197
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,060
What?

198
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,278
What is up with that rat?

199
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,572
"That rat"?

200
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,951
My Hamcheol would feel hurt
hearing you say that.

201
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,162
Hamcheol.

202
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,082
How is he doing?

203
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,086
What are you talking about?

204
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,089
You know Hamcheol crossed
the rainbow bridge last year.

205
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,258
This is a memorial tattoo, remember?

206
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,094
Of course, he's fine.

207
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,681
I was just saying
that he's happy in heaven.

208
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,975
Was that so hard to understand?

209
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,977
Hey, put your sweater back on.

210
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,729
I misunderstood you?

211
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,774
Come on. Just take a look.
Just one time, please?

212
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,069
- Okay, put your sweater back on.
- Look at this. I can make it fat.

213
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,696
It's plump Hamcheol.

214
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,115
- Tell me if it looks pretty.
- Yes, it does.

215
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,825
It's plump Hamcheol. He's…

216
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,541
Thanks for the ride.

217
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,584
Hey, Mi-ji.

218
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,629
What time should I pick you up later?

219
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,885
You're coming to pick me up?
All the way here?

220
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,305
You're the one who thinks of me
as your personal chauffeur.

221
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,472
"All the way here"?

222
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,017
{\an8}I'll give you the full package today.

223
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,935
{\an8}In exchange, massage my back tonight.
My back…

224
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,521
I think I sprained it
while moving the water bottles.

225
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,024
I'll just go home on my own.

226
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,942
On your own?

227
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,237
You don't even have a bike.
You're going to walk? Let me pick you up.

228
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,449
Don't end up running away from a boar
in the mountains like last time.

229
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,409
I told you that it's fine.

230
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,578
Just let me give you a ride.

231
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,705
Why are you playing so hard to get?

232
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,081
That's enough.

233
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,499
GYEONG-GU MART
QUICK DELIVERY

234
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,669
Why do you think her refusal
is a sign of playing hard to get?

235
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,129
She said it's fine.

236
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,010
Why are you butting in?

237
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,054
This is my friend…

238
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,097
Wait. Hold on.

239
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,896
You must not be from around here.

240
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,275
Anyone living in Duson-ri
knows about our relationship.

241
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,569
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

242
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,368
So what?
Then you're practically a stranger.

243
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,953
Actually, doesn't it mean
you're more dangerous than a stranger?

244
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,705
I get why you would think that, but…

245
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,665
Hey, am I dangerous?

246
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,959
I'll take you home
when we're done with work.

247
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,420
You're done here now, right?

248
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,756
Seriously, who are you?

249
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,008
I'm Mi-ju's business partner.

250
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,345
Gosh, it's cold.

251
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,183
I told you that it's Mi-ji. Yu Mi-ji.

252
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,812
Hey, Mi-ji… That guy seems weird.

253
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,400
So,

254
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,903
what brings you all the way here
when you're just farming as a hobby?

255
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,739
Somebody put this phrase
in bold and even underlined it.

256
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,910
"In strawberry farming, choosing
the right seedling is half the battle."

257
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,790
I feel like last year's harvest was a flop
because I planted whatever seedlings

258
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,250
were given to me.

259
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,501
What?

260
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,713
Now you're blaming me out of all people?

261
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,424
Fine. Go ahead.

262
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,803
I brought all the new varieties
you mentioned. They're all here.

263
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,472
You two can look around
and choose the ones you want.

264
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,766
Let's just see how good
your harvest turns out this year.

265
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,725
Sure.

266
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,281
That's the kind you need to weed out.
Even at a glance, it looks weak.

267
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,287
The runner is thin,
and the crown is narrow.

268
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,582
Most importantly,
there aren't enough roots.

269
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,007
My harvest failed last year because
you gave me stuff like this. Am I right?

270
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,092
- Whatever you say.
- Jeez.

271
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,721
My gosh…

272
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,065
You win every battle
if you know yourself and your enemy.

273
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,650
NO FAMILY OR FRIENDS

274
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,529
I'm losing every battle
because I don't know anything about her.

275
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,743
She only goes to her house
or the restaurant.

276
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,620
So I can't learn anything about…

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,460
She's leaving?

278
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,757
I don't think I've ever seen her
close the restaurant at this hour.

279
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,842
Where is she going?

280
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,511
She's leaving.

281
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,721
Oh, no!

282
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,567
NO TO FORCED EVICTIONS
WITHOUT PROPER MEASURES

283
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,819
POETRY READING WEDNESDAY
EVERY WEDNESDAY AT 4 PM

284
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,280
{\an8}AESIM-DONG REDEVELOPMENT
PROMOTION COMMITTEE MEETING

285
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,914
NOVEMBER 13, 2024, WED, 4 PM
AESIM-DONG CULTURAL CENTER

286
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:33,594
THIS WAY TO POETRY READING

287
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,846
It feels like yesterday

288
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,643
when the cool night air hinted
that fall was just around the corner.

289
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,438
But there's already
a scent of winter in the wind.

290
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,816
- When it's cold like this…
- You can have a seat.

291
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,609
It's okay. I'm not part of the class.

292
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,612
It's okay if you didn't register.
You're welcome to listen.

293
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,282
- No, I should get going…
- Come on, join us.

294
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,659
- Okay, then.
- "What Makes a Person…"

295
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,327
You've all heard of that poem, right?

296
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,664
We'll begin with "The Sea of Sang-wol."

297
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,166
It's a poem that portrays
the loneliness of this season.

298
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,212
I'll recite the poem,
and we'll discuss it afterwards.

299
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,215
"The Sea of Sang-wol."

300
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>Where did those captivated</i>
<i>By the sparkle go?</i>

301
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,725
<i>Summer fireworks that spat out</i>
<i>Flashes of light</i>

302
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,853
{\an8}<i>All cooled down in the sand</i>
<i>Before we realized it</i>

303
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,563
{\an8}"THE SEA OF SANG-WOL"

304
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,482
{\an8}<i>Where did all those people go?</i>

305
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>Where did all those people go?</i>

306
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,207
<i>A stretch of cold sand where</i>
<i>Even the footprints have disappeared</i>

307
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,837
<i>With nowhere to go, I stand by myself</i>

308
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>Like a child who lost a shoe</i>

309
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,391
<i>I wander all by myself</i>

310
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,270
<i>Now barefoot</i>

311
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,857
{\an8}<i>I have nowhere else to return to</i>

312
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,277
{\an8}ADMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION AS TOP OF THE CLASS

313
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,905
<i>When I hold the conch to my ear</i>

314
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,701
<i>I can still vividly hear the fireworks</i>
<i>Mingling with the sound of waves</i>

315
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>I go into the shell to hear a little more</i>

316
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,338
<i>I go into the shell</i>

317
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,008
<i>And before I realize it</i>
<i>I am trapped inside a cave</i>

318
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,764
<i>At the sound of waves made of tears</i>
<i>Only the frosty moon knocks on the door</i>

319
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,018
<i>Now please come on out</i>

320
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,272
<i>The sky is filled with stars</i>
<i>Where the fireworks have faded</i>

321
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,300
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my gosh!

322
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,513
Oh no! I'm so sorry.

323
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,523
My gosh. What a coincidence
running into you here, ma'am.

324
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,608
Did you follow me?

325
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,570
Did I follow you? Of course not.

326
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,447
I came to attend this…

327
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,616
OVERCOME IT!
MALE MENOPAUSE HEALTH SEMINAR

328
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,326
Ma'am?

329
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,957
Ma'am!

330
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,501
Ma'am, please wait! Ma'am!

331
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,395
MIN YE-RIN
ADDITIONAL MATERIALS FOR J CARD

332
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,339
My gosh.

333
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,049
Are you leaving the firm?

334
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,804
I'm just going to organize these documents

335
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,848
and sort these books by author.

336
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:52,186
You might as well dust the top
of the bookshelf while you're at it.

337
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh, that's a good idea.

338
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,107
Gosh.

339
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,112
You're becoming a mess
because you have nothing to do.

340
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,867
Why did you choose to join
Mr. Lee's team in the first place?

341
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:10,037
Isn't he way too different from you
to be your role model?

342
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,459
You don't make someone your role model
just because they're like you.

343
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,420
I wonder what drew you in.

344
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,675
While you're cleaning, you should also
consider changing your role model.

345
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,636
Pick another one based on
alphabetical order or something.

346
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,025
We will invite our distinguished
alumnus, Mr. Lee Chung-gu, on stage now.

347
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,778
Please welcome him
with a big round of applause.

348

2021 DISTINGUISHED ALUMNUS TALK
HNU LAW SCHOOL SEMINAR HALL

349
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,137
Even the shine is different.

350
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,724
They're custom-made shoes
crafted by an Italian artisan.

351
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:17,354
They're shoes that
poor law students can't afford.

352
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,316
But today…

353
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,362
I'll teach you how to become an attorney
who can afford two pairs of these.

354
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,122
When you started law school,

355
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,876
I'm sure you all had a vision of the type
of lawyer you aspired to become.

356
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,669
Some may dream of becoming

357
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,089
a warrior fighting for justice,
standing on the side of the weak.

358
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,469
And I'm sure some dream of standing
on the side of the powerful

359
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,596
to climb up the social ladder.

360
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,225
It's not my job to decide
which side is good or evil. The key is…

361
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,645
no matter whose side you take…

362
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,940
you must win.

363
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,486
That is our only righteous path…

364
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,238
and the essence of our work.

365
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,123
{\an8}With these grades,
you must've had many job offers.

366
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,126
But you chose our law firm

367
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,046
just because you wanted to work
with Mr. Lee Chung-gu?

368
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,382
Yes, I--

369
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,468
You must be into
"human triumph" and all that stuff.

370
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,054
I am somewhat of an icon for that.

371
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,182
Enough of that.

372
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,603
Who do you hate?

373
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,316
Who do you hate the most in the world?

374
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,320
Myself.

375
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:15,055
MR. LEE CHUNG-GU

376
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,098
YU MI-RAE

377
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,814
Hello?

378
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,484
So?

379
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,279
What legal concerns
do you have about that?

380
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,366
Is following her like that a crime?

381
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,578
If she reports me, will I have
to stand trial and be punished?

382
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,665
Did you track her location or wiretap her?

383
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,043
Are you insane? Why would I do that?

384
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,586
Firstly,

385
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:50,841
it's not illegal to just follow her
in open areas or commonly used pathways.

386
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,845
She could accuse you of stalking
if you were continuously following her.

387
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,639
But following her just once
doesn't qualify as a crime.

388
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:05,147
In cases like this, the best solution…

389
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,234
is something legal advisors
would never recommend doing.

390
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,029
Say sorry before things get out of hand.

391
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,366
I've seen many people go to court
because they couldn't do that.

392
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,830
What?

393
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,417
You sounded like a real lawyer just now.

394
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,213
I am a real lawyer.
Did you think I was some phony?

395
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,507
Do you have a lawyer mode?

396
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,176
You should keep talking like that.

397
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,886
It's cool.

398
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,436
Wait, there's one more thing.
Give me that.

399
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,273
What are the basics of an investigation?

400
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,734
It's online research.

401
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:55,531
Gather information on her
before you start following her.

402
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,534
She's just an old lady who runs
a restaurant. I wouldn't find her online.

403
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,868
I know this lady.

404
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,037
What?

405
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,331
Kim Ro-sa. She runs a restaurant, right?

406
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,415
RO-SA, A POET WHO COOKS

407
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,708
She went to my school.

408
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,502
I think she was a sociology major.

409
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,754
She graduated from your school?

410
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,133
Wow, she was a total elite.

411
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,218
You don't know the poet Kim Ro-sa?

412
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,928
"What Makes a Person Human"?

413
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,973
That was our CSAT handwriting
confirmation phrase, remember?

414
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,227
Handwriting…

415
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,271
Hey.

416
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,774
You have a good memory.
The CSAT was ages ago.

417
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,111
THIS MONTH'S POEM
"THE SEA OF SANG-WOL" BY KIM RO-SA

418
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,738
<i>That poem was hers?</i>

419
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,283
<i>She cried like that</i>
<i>after hearing her own poem?</i>

420
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,662
She's also famous for
the Kim Ro-sa Scholarship at our school.

421
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,915
It's a scholarship given to new students

422
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,209
raised by single parents
to cover the admission fees.

423
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,669
I received it too.

424
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,629
- You did?
- Yes.

425
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,425
I totally forgot about it.

426
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,511
Gosh…

427
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,395
Come on, Ho-su!

428
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,064
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

429
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,026
You said you would help me
with whatever I needed. Remember?

430
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,653
When did I say that?
I said I'd help with whatever I can.

431
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,947
You can go say hello, though.

432
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,700
You said you never thanked her
after receiving the scholarship.

433
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,287
Don't you think it's only right
to thank her personally at least once?

434
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,498
You're not doing this
because it's the right thing to do.

435
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,543
It's because of your work. Did you forget
your company is a client of ours?

436
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,753
If we're not careful--

437
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,796
Anyway, I can't.
It's a conflict of interest.

438
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,133
You're just going to say hello.
How is that a conflict of interest?

439
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,053
How would it even help if I went?

440
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,389
She won't even remember me.
She probably doesn't even know me.

441
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,060
Even if she doesn't remember you,
you'd be better than me right now.

442
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,854
Let me use your school connections.

443
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,731
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Hey, watch out!

444
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,068
Isn't that illegal? He must be crazy.

445
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,404
Hey, Ho-su. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

446
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,281
No, I'm okay.

447
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,326
You were in serious danger just now.

448
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,119
I just saved your life.

449
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,498
You saved my life?
You put me in greater danger.

450
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,501
Please just help me out this once.

451
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,503
Two heads are better than one.

452
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,589
Mi-rae, you and I are terrible
when it comes to people.

453
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,509
If we both go,
it would just make things worse.

454
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,719
If anything,
you should take Mi-ji instead.

455
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,181
What are you talking about?
Why are you bringing her up?

456
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,393
Mi-ji is good at getting people
to open up their hearts to her.

457
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,898
<i>I'm good at getting people</i>
<i>to open up their hearts?</i>

458
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,401
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

459
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,322
- She got gold.
<i>- Maybe the Mi-ji Ho-su remembers</i>

460
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,407
<i>was like that.</i>

461
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,242
- Mi-ji.
- Mi-ji.

462
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,370
<i>Even back then, I wasn't the one</i>
<i>who opened up people's hearts.</i>

463
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,621
- Yu Mi-ji!
- No way.

464
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,249
<i>- People were just drawn to my sparkle…</i>
- Mi-ji!

465
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,750
<i>…so I didn't have to do anything.</i>

466
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,544
- Wanna eat lunch together?
- Sure.

467
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,797
- Okay.
<i>- Once that sparkle disappeared…</i>

468
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,716
I'm supposed to go
to the bookstore with Mi-rae.

469
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,093
I know you don't need any textbooks.

470
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,637
Mi-rae.

471
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,516
Let's eat lunch together.

472
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,102
<i>…the only thing remaining</i>
<i>was a burnt-out firework,</i>

473
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,147
<i>useless and dull…</i>

474
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,482
<i>just like me.</i>

475
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,251
What could someone like me do?

476
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,924
Hey…

477
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,510
Why don't we wrap things up
and finish tomorrow?

478
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,887
You haven't even eaten yet.

479
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,139
I'm almost done.

480
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,060
You're very stubborn.

481
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,688
You remind me of someone.

482
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,277
I'll get going now.

483
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,737
Where are you going?

484
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,405
I've been waiting to give you a ride.

485
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,282
I can just walk home--

486
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,535
Making sure my business partner
gets home safely is part of my job.

487
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,620
Let's go.

488
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,205
Hey, I'm leaving.

489
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,059
Why is this not moving?

490
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,190
What the heck?

491
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,818
Are we on a hill? Is this an incline?

492
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,946
Instead of releasing
the clutch all the way--

493
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,240
I know. I got my Class A license recently,

494
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,283
so I… Wait. What's happening?

495
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,660
Hold on! What's going on?

496
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,746
Wait, hold on! Stop it, please!
Come on, hurry up!

497
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,081
Stop it!

498
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,961
- Get out.
- Yes, ma'am.

499
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,350
How are you so good at driving
when you can't even ride a bike?

500
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,019
You use your body
to learn how to ride a bike.

501
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,855
But you need to pass a test to drive.

502
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,773
So you're good at tests.

503
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,817
Maybe that's why?

504
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,486
You sounded just like
a driving test examiner earlier.

505
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,489
The brake, and then, "Get out."
I was totally traumatized.

506
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,659
But why do you insist on driving a manual?

507
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,327
There are automatic trucks.

508
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,706
Because it looks cool.
It also reminds me of <i>Mad Max.</i>

509
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,523
Are you sure you can drive back?

510
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,734
I'm going to call a driver.

511
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,943
I see.

512
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,280
What time should we meet tomorrow?

513
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,742
I need to go to
my grandmother's hospital tomorrow.

514
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,120
I see. Then I'll do
the remaining work by myself.

515
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,457
I think I can work the day
after tomorrow. Let's do it together.

516
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,459
No, don't push yourself. I can do it.

517
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,046
We agreed to work on it together,
so I'm responsible too.

518
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,422
See you in two days.

519
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,132
Now, I remember.

520
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,301
Pardon?

521
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,720
I thought you reminded me of someone.

522
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,097
I'll tell you later.

523
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,141
Anyway, see you the day after tomorrow.

524
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,435
Yes, goodbye.

525
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,608
Excuse me, Mi-hye.

526
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,376
You forgot your pay for today.

527
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,466
Thank you.

528
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,636
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

529
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,348
Get home safe.

530
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,308
Goodbye.

531
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,856
Jeez…

532
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,027
Where am I?

533
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,988
Can a driver come at this hour?

534
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,991
Are there people who ask for one
even when they're not drunk?

535
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,998
Excuse me…

536
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,166
This is for you.

537
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,793
What is that?

538
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,963
In yesterday's poem,

539
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,342
I liked the line about
the sound of waves, so I brought this.

540
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,388
I don't know much about poems.

541
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,725
But I felt like the poem was speaking
on your behalf.

542
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,604
So is that a bribe?

543
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,023
No, it's not a bribe.

544
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,234
It's an apology.

545
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,404
I'm sorry I was
following you around yesterday.

546
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,239
Well…

547
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:21,411
I heard you wrote that poem.

548
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:25,457
I had no idea
that you were such a famous poet.

549
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,084
I also heard that you majored
in sociology at HNU.

550
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,713
And that you've been sponsoring
scholarships for a while. You're amazing--

551
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,049
First you follow me,
and now you do a background check?

552
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,425
No, ma'am.

553
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,219
I wasn't doing that. Someone just told me.

554
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,223
I found out that my friend
was a recipient of your scholarship.

555
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,351
Although it was a long time ago.

556
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,352
Your friend?

557
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,812
Yes, my friend.

558
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,565
He's the same age as me,
but he graduated from HNU.

559
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,361
He's now an attorney
for a very famous law firm.

560
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,363
He told me that it's all thanks to you.

561
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,240
Admission fees don't even cost that much.

562
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,117
He got there on his own.

563
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,411
No, he said he feels
really grateful to you.

564
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,664
He wants to come thank you in person…

565
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,832
He wants to come and say hello? Here?

566
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,671
Well… Right now…

567
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,590
He has a lot going on,
so he can't come right away.

568
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,927
But he said he really wanted to come.
But his company is--

569
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,011
Forget it.

570
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,141
No one ever came and thanked me anyway.

571
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,062
That must've made you sad.

572
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,648
Why would I feel sad over that?

573
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,359
I'm just repaying the school.

574
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,613
Even so, it's sad when people
don't reciprocate how you feel.

575
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,490
Donating is not easy either.

576
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,866
It's better this way.

577
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,246
Only people who still need something
come with things like that.

578
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,957
No, this isn't because I need something.

579
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,167
That poem really touched me.

580
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,754
Should I throw it away?

581
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,594
My goodness…

582
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,065
Hello?

583
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,402
It took you long enough.
I called you ages ago.

584
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,822
You swore that you were going
to send someone today.

585
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,367
If you keep this up, I'll have no choice
but to change cleaning companies.

586
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,748
I get that you're busy,
but I can't stand it any longer.

587
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,167
At this rate,
I'm going to pay more in hospital bills

588
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,627
from having to go up
and down the stairs to clean.

589
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,588
Ma'am.

590
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,839
May I use the restroom?

591
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,426
So when are you going to send someone?

592
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,611
This is my field of expertise.

593
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,074
{\an8}So you're saying you can't make it
to work tomorrow, right?

594
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,161
Why were you beating around the bush?

595
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,704
It's your mother.

596
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,956
My absence from work yesterday
was also unexpected.

597
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,042
I feel bad that I keep skipping work.

598
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,756
This is all because of Mi-ji.

599
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,425
She used to drop everything
to go see her grandma,

600
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,677
but something's gotten into her lately.

601
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:28,473
- As if her so-called job is important.
- You shouldn't say things like that.

602
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,227
Hey, Mi-ji is her granddaughter.

603
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,812
Look at other families.

604
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,023
Some kids get credit just for visiting
their grandparents during holidays.

605
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,193
No other granddaughter
takes care of her sick grandmother.

606
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,237
{\an8}You've had it easy until now
thanks to Mi-ji.

607
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,823
{\an8}Are you really complaining
because she's not doing that now?

608
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,616
You're right.

609
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,661
But she's always been so close
to her grandma.

610
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,788
She can't be as close to her
as her own daughter.

611
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,164
Be good to your mom.

612
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,499
Work should not come first.

613
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,676
That's why I said I can't work tomorrow.
I'll be taking care of her.

614
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,221
There you go again, twisting my words.

615
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,809
Just think of it as a chance to repay her
for all the love she's given you.

616
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,562
- Jeez.
- You should repay everything.

617
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,313
Or you're going to regret it.

618
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,481
Hey.

619
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,650
What would you know?

620
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,111
Not everyone is like you and your mom.

621
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,698
My mom was cast aside
for giving birth to a daughter,

622
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,242
while your mom bought you
new clothes every year.

623
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,120
Why don't you repay your mom for all
she's done while she's still alive?

624
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,748
I wasn't that cherished compared to you,
so I don't owe her that much.

625
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,210
I'm coming to work tomorrow.
And that's final.

626
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,475
What do you mean
you want me to hand over J Card?

627
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,853
Ma'am, this really isn't right.

628
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,980
I've been in charge of it
from the beginning.

629
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,984
- More than anyone else, I--
- It was Mr. Lee's order.

630
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,668
When are we leaving for the meeting?
Their headquarters is in Gangnam, right?

631
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,420
No, it's Jonggak.
We should leave soon if--

632
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,630
I want to go too.

633
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,423
What?

634
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,634
I said I'm going
to the J Card meeting too.

635
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:32,096
You two just got the documents.
You haven't even had time to read them.

636
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,557
I know them better than anyone. Let me go.

637
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,392
- Even so, this is out of the blue--
- Stop.

638
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,019
Are you that desperate, Ho-su?

639
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,521
Desperate enough to insist on joining us?

640
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,564
Yes.

641
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,901
Then get ready to go.
We're leaving right away.

642
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,037
Is the toilet clogged again?

643
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,427
What are you doing?

644
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,472
I'm almost done.
I just need to get to the bottom and--

645
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,224
I asked you a question!

646
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,435
Pardon? I'm cleaning.

647
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,229
Did I tell you to do that?

648
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,650
I overheard you talking earlier,

649
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,319
and it seemed like you needed a hand.

650
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,655
I'm sorry if I upset you.

651
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,533
Did your company tell you
to do things like this?

652
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,119
No, not really.

653
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:40,164
So why are you doing something
your company and I never told you to do?

654
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,333
I…

655
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,673
Because I don't know what to do…

656
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,633
What?

657
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:54,220
I want to get on your good side,

658
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,347
but I don't know how.

659
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,684
But this is something I can do…

660
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,437
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,331
How is it that even after decades

662
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,961
they're still trying to use a kid
to do their dirty work?

663
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,507
Don't ever come back here.

664
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,678
I detest that company,
so I have no intention of selling my land.

665
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,055
But ma'am--

666
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,723
If you come back again,

667
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,310
I will take it up with your company.

668
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,064
I…

669
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,567
<i>It closed.</i>

670
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,627
Mom!

671
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,545
Mom, look at me!

672
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,049
Mom, look at this!

673
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,134
Hey, Ho-su.

674
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,720
You better come and cheer me on tomorrow.

675
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,931
I need to tell you something if I win.

676
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,849
<i>Mom, look at me.</i>

677
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,726
Mi-ji, wait. Hear me out.

678
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,479
- I couldn't go yesterday because--
- You came, though.

679
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,690
You came and left with Mi-rae. Am I wrong?

680
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,071
You're right.

681
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,576
<i>It closed.</i>

682
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,504
I like you, Mi-ji.

683
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,674
Go out with me.

684
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,303
Fine.

685
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,472
What?

686
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,352
Hey, Mi-ji! Wait for me!

687
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,062
<i>Mom! I asked you to look at me.</i>

688
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,667
Hey, Mi-ji.
Why did you take off your cast already?

689
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,836
{\an8}- I'm all better.
- You idiot.

690
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,047
{\an8}Resting is part of training too.

691
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,968
- Proper rehabilitation is--
- I need to get into college this year.

692
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,428
I need to be in the fall meet.

693
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:48,936
My goodness.

694
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,358
I'm afraid she can't continue
as an athlete.

695
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,777
- Oh dear.
- My gosh.

696
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,905
That idiot.

697
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,282
I knew this would happen
when she wouldn't listen.

698
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,868
- How is she going to make a living now?
- Quiet down!

699
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,953
- Let's go already!
- Hold on!

700
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,206
- He just said she can't run!
<i>- It closed.</i>

701
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:12,126
Mom, I can do it hands-free.
Mom, I'm going to let go!

702
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,006
Mi-ji, I told you to stay still.

703
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,300
Your sister's tired.
Let's hurry up and go.

704
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:36,567
I should've just stayed still.

705
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,285
I'm sorry
that we suddenly added another person.

706
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,246
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

707
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,998
We're grateful that you came
to a place near our office.

708
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,335
By the way, is he usually that quiet?

709
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,711
Was he forced to come?

710
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:59,257
Don't let him fool you. He's just
pretending to be the silent, cool guy.

711
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,800
It's just for show.

712
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,261
Where's the other lady?

713
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,013
I guess she's wrapping up work
and running late.

714
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,225
We had to urgently get someone
who hadn't left work yet.

715
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,060
I'm leaving.

716
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,312
Hey, where are you going?

717
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,982
We barely managed
to get an even number of people.

718
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,400
We'll talk tomorrow.

719
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,951
Ho-su?

720
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:44,719
What is it?

721
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,637
I'm on the bus.

722
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,391
No, I'm on my way home.

723
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,520
Right now?

724
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,985
Well, I am in the area.

725
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,209
Wow, it's so big.

726
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,426
Over here, Mi-rae.

727
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,892
Hey, Mi-rae. It's been a while.
How have you been?

728
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,394
Hey, Ji-yun.

729
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,146
<i>Mi-ji!</i>

730
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,066
Want to eat lunch together?

731
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,026
Mi-rae!

732
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,118
Why did you call me
when you were with her?

733
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,287
You two are close.

734
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,416
It's been a while since she last saw you,
so she wanted to meet up.

735
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,960
She said it's been a while
since she saw me?

736
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,128
Yes.

737
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,092
What were you two talking about?

738
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,718
Nothing.

739
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,389
How did you two run into each other?

740
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,100
- It was nothing. Just earlier--
- Don't even get me started.

741
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,018
I thought we were in a sitcom.

742
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:20,481
Ho-su showed up to a triple blind date
thinking it was a business meeting.

743
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,526
How can a lawyer be so naive?

744
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,613
He's always been like that.
That's why he's just so interesting.

745
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,699
Don't you agree, Mi-rae?

746
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,119
<i>You mean you find it</i>
<i>interesting that he's a lawyer.</i>

747
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:36,705
Oh, right. Are you still working
at that public corporation, Mi-rae?

748
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,624
Yes. What about you, Ji-yun?

749
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,959
Didn't I tell you?

750
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,711
My office is near here. It's J Card.

751
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,547
Have you heard of <i>Gourmet Guide?</i>

752
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,091
- Gour… what?
- You don't know it?

753
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:51,262
Famous restaurants usually have it
on a sign out front. You've never seen it?

754
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:54,598
We select popular restaurants
and create content.

755
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,185
Basically, we help discover
popular restaurants.

756
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,898
By the way, Ho-su,
you said you work for Wongeun Law firm.

757
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,150
Then do you know Beauer?

758
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,819
It's one of the candidate restaurants
for this season.

759
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,487
Yes, I've been there a few times.

760
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,614
My gosh. How did you get a reservation?

761
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,450
The owner is a client of ours.

762
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,786
Does that mean I can make
a reservation through you?

763
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,165
Sure. I'll give them a call tomorrow.

764
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,332
Really?

765
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,550
Ho-su and I are headed the same way.

766
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,218
You're going home too, right?

767
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,636
What?

768
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,056
I'm going to stop by Aesim-dong.

769
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,975
Aesim-dong? Now?

770
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,604
Yes, something just came up.

771
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,191
If you're going there,
then we can take the subway together.

772
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,151
Ho-su, I can drop you off on my way home.

773
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,569
I brought my car.

774
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,196
You drank, though.

775
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,947
It was non-alcoholic.

776
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,701
I see. You know, Aesim-dong
is in the same direction.

777
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,620
Can you drop me off too?

778
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,623
Aesim-dong is a bit too far.

779
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,083
I think I'll hit traffic on my way back.

780
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,252
I see.

781
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,214
We wouldn't want that.

782
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:11,634
Ho-su, don't be a burden
and just ride the subway with me.

783
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,428
I don't mind, though.

784
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,600
Ho-su, it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

785
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,608
<i>Come with me. Me!</i>

786
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,365
I heard some people find
public corporations too conservative.

787
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,992
But I guess you're fine with it.

788
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,913
No one works at a company
because it suits them.

789
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,332
We all just work to make a living.

790
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,795
That's true. You weren't even thinking
of working there in the first place.

791
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,380
You really lowered your standards

792
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,966
for someone who studied
for the civil service exam.

793
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,719
How is J Card?

794
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,764
Were you always interested in that field?

795
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,144
How's Mi-ji?

796
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,731
Seeing you like this makes me
want to see Mi-ji. I miss her.

797
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,235
What's the point?
It would just be awkward.

798
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,446
Why? You know
I was Mi-ji's number one fan.

799
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,575
She did keep her distance from me, though.

800
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,287
When did she ever do that?

801
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,746
You must've done that first.

802
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,164
What?

803
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,042
Don't you remember?

804
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:31,130
In the past, I used to ask you
what Mi-ji thought of me.

805
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,967
I don't know what I did to upset her.

806
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,886
Why did she suddenly
distance herself from me?

807
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,683
My gosh.

808
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,310
You haven't changed.

809
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,479
You never listen to me, do you?
Not then, and not now.

810
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,696
{\an8}CHICKEN GIBLET STEW

811
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,909
Oh, is it this restaurant?
But why'd you come here at this hour?

812
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,164
I accidentally took something
earlier today, so I came to return it.

813
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,041
Why did you come here during the day?

814
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,001
You don't usually work outside the office.

815
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,127
Well…

816
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,213
I took half a day off to help someone.

817
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,925
You barely have enough time
to even meet like this.

818
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,470
I can't believe you took time off.
Who was it?

819
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,513
A relative.

820
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,058
My great-aunt asked me
to look after her place for a while.

821
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,144
But I accidentally took
the restroom key with me.

822
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,813
This is your great-aunt's restaurant?

823
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,440
I think I've heard of this place before.

824
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,567
Thanks so much for the ride.

825
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,570
Take care. See you.

826
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,738
Bye.

827
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,539
AESIM-DONG REDEVELOPMENT
PROMOTION COMMITTEE

828
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,751
Jeez, that felt like an interrogation.

829
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,422
Why did I pretend that
she's my great-aunt of all things?

830
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,425
Whatever. I won't see her again anyway.

831
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,229
Why was she looking at me like that?
I keep thinking about her.

832
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,570
I just feel guilty. That's all.

833
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:22,950
I'm just feeling guilty
about that whistleblowing case.

834
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,465
Why are you by yourself?
Did Mi-ji run away already?

835
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,510
- Take that back and hurry up.
- Fine.

836
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,387
Words have power.

837
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,140
It's fine. Just hurry up
and go clean the storage room.

838
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,475
I'm going to leave
after I help you move this.

839
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,060
Move aside.

840
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,155
What's this?

841
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:11,248
What the heck?
When did you organize all this?

842
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,376
I know, right?

843
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,338
Have you finally
pulled yourself together, Se-jin?

844
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,722
I didn't mean cleaning, you know?

845
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,265
You're dodging the issue.

846
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,227
<i>But you just leave me hanging</i>
<i>and judge me however you like.</i>

847
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,812
<i>It's like playing with a bug,</i>

848
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,398
<i>pulling off its legs</i>
<i>just to see how long it lasts.</i>

849
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,817
<i>You really find that fun?</i>
<i>Why are you so cruel?</i>

850
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,861
<i>How could you treat someone like that?</i>

851
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,004
I'm sorry for the surprise call.

852
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,048
I want to introduce someone to you.

853
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,925
Introduce someone?

854
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,010
Here he comes. Over here.

855
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,932
You've seen him on TV, right?

856
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,560
Meet Mr. Yoon Ji-sang,
Wongeun's one and only humanist lawyer.

857
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,645
Oh, come on.

858
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,356
I've heard a lot about you.
My name is Yoon Ji-sang.

859
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,857
Hello.

860
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,818
My name is Lee Ho-su.

861
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,528
I heard that you're good at your job.

862
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,404
But since you're a junior
Chung-gu cares about,

863
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,698
I thought you weren't interested
in public interest cases.

864
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:29,576
You know how much he hates those cases.

865
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,375
So, how long have you been
interested in our team?

866
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,477
What is it?

867
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,608
Why are you doing this to me, sir?

868
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,821
Why are you suddenly telling me
to go to another team?

869
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,908
It may feel out of the blue,
but Mr. Yoon is a really great guy.

870
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,953
It's hard to stay true to your principles
and still be good at your job.

871
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,080
And in terms of that field, he's way--

872
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,206
Mr. Lee.

873
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:24,172
Whenever you see someone
weak, powerless, or pitiful…

874
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,926
you can never turn a blind eye.

875
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,972
Given your tendency to prioritize
protecting the weak over your team,

876
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,683
isn't the Corporate Social
Responsibility Team a better fit for you?

877
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,518
I don't want to go to another team.

878
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,478
Why not?

879
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,774
Because other people don't have
a disability like I do?

880
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,278
Pardon?

881
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,159
You know…

882
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,120
I thought you wanted to become stronger.

883
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,331
And I thought that
was what made you like me,

884
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,001
not the disability
or your workaholic tendency.

885
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,047
But after what happened recently,
I realized something.

886
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,009
I wanted to keep you by my side
because of your strengths,

887
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:14,681
but you were by my side
because of my weakness.

888
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:20,187
However, I absolutely hate that.

889
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,284
Is that…

890
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,871
so terrible?

891
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,170
I think what you perceive
as your weakness…

892
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,884
is what makes you stronger and special.

893
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,097
I'm drawn to you
because I see your vulnerability,

894
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:59,851
and I admire you even more
because of that weakness.

895
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,022
Is that so terrible?

896
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,280
Chairman Choi's victim…

897
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,201
You helped him, didn't you?
Why did you do that?

898
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:19,162
I didn't help him.
I just told him the rules.

899
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,208
It's unfair to throw someone into the ring

900
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,129
when they don't even know
how to put on gloves or a mouthguard.

901
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,257
I believed we could win
without going to such lengths.

902
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,010
But you can't just blindside me
without saying a word.

903
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,263
Is that your definition of a professional?

904
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,643
No matter what excuse you give
to justify your actions,

905
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,854
it's still a breach of trust
to the company

906
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,772
and a betrayal to me.

907
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,734
I'm sorry.

908
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,032
I regret acting alone
without discussing it with you.

909
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,756
Make a decision now.

910
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,261
Are you certain that you want
to continue working with me?

911
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:18,680
Yes, sir.

912
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,686
I'm supposed to have a drink
with Chairman Choi later.

913
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,022
What do you say?

914
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,775
Would you like to join this time?

915
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,575
{\an8}LAND ACQUISITION BUSINESS PROPOSAL

916
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:55,050
You look tired. How's work going?

917
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,386
I'm trying my best, sir.

918
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,097
Don't push yourself too hard.

919
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:04,392
By the way, how about a meeting
with the landowner next week?

920
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:05,894
Pardon?

921
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,313
- Next week?
- Yes.

922
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,483
Find out which day works best for her
and bring her next week.

923
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,821
I know you've been working hard,
so that wouldn't be a hard ask, right?

924
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,784
Still, next week is a bit--

925
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,787
I told them
that the schedule is too tight,

926
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,957
but the General Affairs Team keep
hounding me about the site issue.

927
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,292
They're concerned
about their performance too.

928
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,420
This performance review
is really important.

929
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,924
I trust that
you'll bring her in next week.

930
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,343
Pardon? But…

931
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,636
Sir…

932
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:56,987
How am I supposed
to bring her to the office

933
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:01,408
when she told me
not to even come to her restaurant?

934
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,955
I wonder if they'd take pity on me
if a bus grazes me.

935
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,960
Maybe they'd at least postpone
the meeting until I'm discharged.

936
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,255
Excuse me.

937
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,135
Are you okay?

938
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,057
Who? Me?

939
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,351
Yes.

940
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,395
I guess so.

941
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,737
What was that about?
Did he hear what I said?

942
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,324
Did I look that miserable?

943
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,917
Why is she calling?

944
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,210
PARK JI-YUN

945
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,091
Are you for real?

946
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,514
- Hello?
<i>- Are you busy, Mi-rae?</i>

947
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:10,227
<i>- Can you talk right now?</i>
- I'm in the middle of work. What is it?

948
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,353
What's going on?

949
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,938
You didn't see my text?

950
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,273
I'm on my way
to your great-aunt's restaurant.

951
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,901
What? Why are you going there?

952
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,654
Our next season's theme is retro.

953
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,782
<i>And last time I saw it, her restaurant</i>
<i>looked like the perfect fit.</i>

954
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,533
You can't go there!

955
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,494
She hates her restaurant
getting loud and busy.

956
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,079
She really hates it.

957
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,414
We're not like a foodie program, though.

958
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,667
<i>If things go well,</i>
<i>we might even partner with her…</i>

959
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,586
No, please don't.
She might throw salt at you.

960
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,714
She literally throws salt
when a stranger visits her.

961
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:43,218
What? Do you think she'd still do that
when I'm your friend?

962
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,178
It's okay. I'll try talking to her.

963
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:49,432
Hold on.
I'll ask her about this later, so--

964
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,850
<i>I'm already on my way.</i>

965
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,394
What?

966
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,020
I'm getting an incoming call.

967
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,563
- Wait, Ji-yun.
- I'll call you later.

968
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,315
Hello? Ji-yun! Hey!

969
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,192
What? Oh no!

970
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,318
Taxi!

971
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,452
There's traffic.

972
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,131
{\an8}I ACCIDENTALLY TOOK THE RESTROOM KEY

973
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,091
{\an8}I LEFT IT AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE
I'M VERY SORRY

974
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,942
Ok-hui!

975
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,778
Mi-ji must take after you.

976
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,113
Why do you walk so fast?

977
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,866
What is it? I need to hurry up and go.

978
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,660
- What?
- Your mother eats porridge, right?

979
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,162
I made abalone rice porridge.

980
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,456
There should be enough
for you and Mi-ji too.

981
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,374
Hey!

982
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,544
I don't need it.
Go give it to your mother.

983
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,213
Hey, my mother passed away.

984
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,800
I said those things
because I have my own regrets.

985
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,219
I couldn't be there for her final moments.

986
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,766
Hey…

987
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,185
You know, I…

988
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,394
You didn't know.

989
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,689
I said things without knowing
your situation either, so we're even.

990
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,028
You brat…

991
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,324
How did I not know
that your mother had passed away

992
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,160
when we've been neighbors for ten years?

993
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,163
I know, right? We never speak
about things like that.

994
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,209
You should've told me
that something like that had happened.

995
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,419
You always make me feel like the bad guy.

996
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:45,048
Jeez, just take this.
We always fight if we talk for too long.

997
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,133
You took that, so we're even.

998
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,552
Hey!

999
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,651
Oh dear.

1000
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,741
What took you so long?

1001
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,701
I told you
that I need to go before dinner.

1002
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,620
Okay, I got it.

1003
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,956
Since when are you so punctual?

1004
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,667
You're already late, so eat some
abalone rice porridge before you go.

1005
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,294
I told you that I'm late.
Grandma, I'll see you later.

1006
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,588
Hey, Mi-ji! Eat this before you go!

1007
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,469
What's up with her?

1008
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:33,680
Jeez.

1009
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,435
Isn't she acting a bit strange these days?

1010
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,150
Oh no!

1011
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,110
I'll just get out here, sir.

1012
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,201
Damn it!

1013
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,038
Damn it!

1014
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,333
Ji-yun!

1015
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,420
I can't believe this!

1016
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,177
What in the world?

1017
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,845
Wait! Stop!

1018
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,098
Wait a second.
You and I should go over there…

1019
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,601
What are you doing here?
Weren't you working?

1020
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,020
Hold on. I…

1021
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,564
Wait. First…

1022
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,816
Talk with me first.

1023
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,277
- Okay, let's go in first and then--
- No!

1024
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,112
Let's go over there

1025
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,364
- and talk first…
- What's wrong with you?

1026
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,867
What are you two doing
in front of my restaurant?

1027
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,037
- Are you the owner, ma'am?
- Ji-yun.

1028
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,289
- I am.
- Hello, ma'am.

1029
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,458
I've been wanting to meet you for a while.

1030
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:47,921
Mi-rae told me that you're her great-aunt,
so I came here to meet you. I apologize.

1031
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,674
My name is Park Ji-yun.
I'm a friend of Mi-rae.

1032
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:06,022
I guess I should've contacted you
before coming here.

1033
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:10,151
Mi-rae told me that her great-aunt
doesn't like unexpected visitors.

1034
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,570
But I wanted to talk to you in person.

1035
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,824
She said that?

1036
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:23,039
That her great-aunt doesn't like
people just dropping by?

1037
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,764
Where did you hide the money?

1038
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,599
Where's the money? Where is it?

1039
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,060
You take responsibility
and put that money back, okay?

1040
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,729
If you can't, call the police right now.

1041
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,481
What do you think you're doing?

1042
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:49,816
Who are you?

1043
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,192
Get up.

1044
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,111
What the hell?

1045
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,071
I'm sorry I came too late.

1046
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,159
It's okay.

1047
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,218
You're right about one thing…

1048
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,054
and wrong about another.

1049
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,893
I am her great-aunt.

1050
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,063
But I don't hate people dropping by.

1051
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:34,068
Since you're my great-niece's friend,
come back another time.

1052
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,361
Really?

1053
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,822
Thank you.

1054
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,849
Ma'am…

1055
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,354
Why did you do that?

1056
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,565
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

1057
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,364
I'm sorry.

1058
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,158
I didn't mean to lie--

1059
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,409
It's fine.

1060
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,788
I lied for my sake too.

1061
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:31,042
Whenever a lie comes to light,

1062
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,419
everyone feels awful,

1063
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,422
regardless of whose lie it is.

1064
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:42,053
Just think of it as payment
for that cleaning you did.

1065
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,939
I doubt that you came here
to introduce your friend to me.

1066
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,358
What did your company
tell you to do this time?

1067
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,652
Well…

1068
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,655
They told me to ask you something.

1069
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,741
But I really had no intention
of coming back here.

1070
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:08,329
I was just going to kill some time outside
and then go, but my friend--

1071
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,455
So?

1072
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,166
What did they want you to ask?

1073
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,963
The company wants to meet with you,

1074
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,258
so they told me to ask you
when you're available.

1075
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:25,012
I'll make sure to tell them
that you refused,

1076
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,681
so don't worry about it--

1077
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,725
Tell them next Friday afternoon.

1078
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:31,811
Pardon?

1079
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,147
I say that I hate the company
for hiding behind a kid

1080
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,911
when I feel like I'm doing the same thing.

1081
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,911
If I turned you away,
what good would that do?

1082
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,029
It's better that
I tell the company myself.

1083
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,364
Ma'am.

1084
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,785
I'm not going there to sell my land.
I'm going to lodge a complaint.

1085
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,996
That's more than enough for me.

1086
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,040
Thank you so much. Thank you, ma'am.

1087
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:00,214
<i>Why? She refused to open up</i>
<i>when I was trying to get on her good side,</i>

1088
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,050
<i>so why has she opened up now?</i>

1089
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,719
Why are you just standing there?

1090
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,721
Hurry up and put the restroom key back.

1091
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,639
The restroom key?

1092
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,600
I…

1093
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:14,061
I put a note on your door.
You didn't see it?

1094
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,606
A note?

1095
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,399
What note?

1096
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:21,944
I wrote that I left it
at the convenience store…

1097
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,530
I'll go get it right away.

1098
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,025
You came just in time for dinner.

1099
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,736
You haven't eaten yet, right?

1100
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,863
I…

1101
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,949
I ate.

1102
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,537
So you were late because you were eating.

1103
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,498
It's okay. I get it.

1104
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,629
You should go eat. I'll tidy up here.

1105
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,964
You know…

1106
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:27,927
About that chair…

1107
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,140
It belonged to my late grandfather.

1108
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,897
Even after I bought him an expensive one,
he kept patching up the old one

1109
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,483
and he'd only rest in that chair.

1110
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,987
I had no idea, so last time…

1111
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,364
I didn't know either until it was gone.

1112
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,243
The chair, the manual truck…

1113
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,080
Even this godforsaken strawberry farm…

1114
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,876
When my grandfather was alive,
I insisted that he throw it all away.

1115
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:02,378
But I regret that now,
and I can't throw it away.

1116
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,547
I tend to do that.

1117
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,634
I'm the type to make hasty judgments,
only to regret them later.

1118
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:11,971
So…

1119
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,725
I'm sorry for what I said
so thoughtlessly last time.

1120
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,440
And thank you for coming back.

1121
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:26,611
If I hadn't said this to you,
I'd have regretted it.

1122
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,448
I was going to tell you this last time.

1123
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,868
I just didn't know where to begin…

1124
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,345
I haven't eaten yet.

1125
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,681
What a coincidence!

1126
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,476
I made enough for two people by accident.

1127
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,816
<i>When someone shows themselves</i>
<i>being weak, pathetic, and clumsy,</i>

1128
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,362
<i>people should get disappointed</i>
<i>and turn away from them.</i>

1129
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,656
<i>So why don't I?</i>

1130
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,577
What took you so long?

1131
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,709
I don't serve solo diners.

1132
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:25,878
I'm sorry.

1133
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,755
I…

1134
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,258
I'm sorry it took me so long to visit you.

1135
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,224
I'm late.

1136
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,565
- I'm sorry that this is all I have.
- My goodness. Thank you.

1137
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:50,069
Ma'am, this isn't much, but…

1138
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,571
My goodness. You didn't have to.

1139
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,615
I'm just happy that you came.

1140
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:57,702
I can't accept this.
By the way, have you eaten dinner?

1141
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:58,911
It's okay.

1142
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,913
No, I'll cook something
for you right away.

1143
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,708
- Just wait a little, okay? My gosh.
- Yes, ma'am.

1144
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:13,426
I've never seen that side of her.

1145
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:19,598
<i>I guess in life,</i>
<i>there are just moments like this.</i>

1146
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,979
<i>Moments where doors to people's hearts</i>
<i>just open without reason.</i>

1147
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:30,693
What are you doing here?

1148
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,989
Did you cut a new set of keys
or something?

1149
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,538
Just wait a little.
I'll go make a single serving right away.

1150
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:43,664
Yes, ma'am.

1151
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,126
A single serving.

1152
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,803
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you'd never come.

1153
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:00,222
You were going on
about a conflict of interest.

1154
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,017
There's no conflict of interest now.

1155
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:06,020
I quit my job.

1156
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:08,147
What?

1157
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,941
I can do anything I want now.

1158
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,278
That's why I'm going to help you.

1159
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,115
I'll help you.

1160
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,565
You take longer and longer every day.

1161
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:34,608
I waited ages for you.

1162
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,302
YU MI-JI

1163
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,179
{\an8}<i>Why do you seem so down now?</i>

1164
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:07,433
{\an8}I think the firm I quit
was the best I could ever achieve.

1165
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,269
{\an8}<i>That won't do. Let's go.</i>
<i>There has to be something you enjoy.</i>

1166
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,438
{\an8}<i>Why are you being so nice to me?</i>

1167
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,648
{\an8}<i>Have you had a chance</i>
<i>to check this month's payment?</i>

1168
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,150
{\an8}<i>Is something going on with Mi-rae?</i>

1169
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,110
{\an8}Is it okay to use Mi-rae's money, then?

1170
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,154
{\an8}<i>So work comes before Grandma now?</i>

1171
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,864
{\an8}Is it as easy as you thought?

1172
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,699
{\an8}<i>Is the reunion you mentioned</i>
<i>this weekend?</i>

1173
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,326
{\an8}<i>I didn't tell her on purpose.</i>

1174
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:28,495
{\an8}<i>I'll be there too. If I don't go,</i>
<i>they'll say whatever they want.</i>

1175
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,080
{\an8}<i>"Mi-rae this" and "Mi-rae that."</i>

1176
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,165
{\an8}<i>See you there.</i>

1177
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,673
