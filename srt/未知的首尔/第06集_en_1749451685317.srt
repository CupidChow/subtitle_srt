OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,590
I…

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,390
I liked you too.

4
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,150
Ho-su.

5
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,280
I liked you too!

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
You're drunk.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,030
Let's pretend you didn't say any of that.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,160
Hey, Ho-su.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,620
Why are you always so difficult?

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,960
What's going on?

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,710
Just say it.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,090
Who do you like right now?

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,130
I also…

14
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,640
EPISODE 6
THE SILENT, EVER-PRESENT FOOL

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,900
What the…

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,940
Why am I here?

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,780
<i>Mi-rae.</i>

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,120
I liked you too! Darn it. Yes, you!

19
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
Holy crap!

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,910
Duson-- The person you like…
Hey, just say it.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,870
I also…

22
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,460
Oh, darn it.

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,630
Why did I say those things as Mi-rae?

24
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,090
But wait.

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,090
"Also"?

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,550
Did he mean, "I also like you"?

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,010
Jeez. What happened after that?

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,680
Come on, think!

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,480
You're up.

30
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,650
Yes.

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,200
How did I end up sleeping here last night?

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,700
You should've sent me home if I was drunk.

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,330
Do you really think I didn't try to?

34
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,290
Anyway, sorry for the trouble.

35
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,790
My bad.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,250
Here, take this.

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,430
I never thought I'd buy a hangover cure
first thing in the morning.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,350
<i>Why is he being low-key nice?</i>

39
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>Is it because I said I liked him?</i>

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,220
- What?
- Hey.

41
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,230
Let me ask you something.

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,270
Did I do anything stupid last night?

43
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,360
Like what?

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,980
When I get drunk,

45
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,940
I say things I don't mean,
but I sound like I do.

46
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,240
It's gotten me into trouble before.

47
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,070
So I just wanted to check.

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,950
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

49
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,910
You said a lot last night.

50
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,880
You know, things like outrageous lies

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,710
or maybe a love confession.

52
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,000
If I said I liked you or whatever,

53
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,680
please don't take it the wrong way
and make things awkward between us.

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,260
So you remember up to that part.

55
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,140
Even if I said more after that,

56
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,770
I didn't mean any of it.

57
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,600
I don't see you that way at all.

58
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,150
You're just another person to me.
Maybe an old classmate at best.

59
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,150
That's it.

60
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,320
Looks like
you don't remember much after that.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,650
Don't worry.

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,820
What?

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,280
I've already sorted things out,
so you don't need to worry.

64
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,250
Well, then… Okay.

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,750
<i>Wait. Sorted what out exactly?</i>

66
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,250
<i>What else happened after that?</i>

67
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,380
What now?

68
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,300
I think we need to clear up some things.

69
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,970
Even if it's a little embarrassing,
we should both know what happened.

70
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,680
That way, if there's anything to explain,
we can talk it out.

71
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,230
- Mi-rae.
- What?

72
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,980
Shouldn't you go to work?

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,280
My phone.

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,900
Hey, what time is it?
Don't you have a clock?

75
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,610
Holy crap!

76
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,830
EASY MORNING
HANGOVER CURE

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,630
Yu Mi-rae isn't here yet?

78
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,130
She went to the restroom.

79
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,090
She's never around when you need her.

80
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,300
I need some copies made.

81
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,680
I can do it.

82
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,680
The copying, I mean.

83
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,230
Oh, sure.

84
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,570
I don't have my phone and wallet.

85
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,490
- Where are they?
- I got them. Here.

86
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,070
Thank you.

87
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,200
Oh! My bag.

88
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
- I'll drop it off for you later.
- What?

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,200
- Or else they'll know you're late.
- Really?

90
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,200
- Okay, then.
- I called a cab. It's waiting downstairs.

91
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,580
What? Thanks. I'll get going.

92
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,480
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Mr. Shin.

93
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,730
Making your bathroom break public?

94
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,900
- Mind your manners.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,990
Mr. Shin.

96
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,150
Sorry you had to do
someone else's work.

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,030
- If you're ready, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,990
Where are you going?

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,540
You're coming too.

100
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,950
Me? Where…

101
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,080
Me?

102
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,340
We've secured
about 62% of the land so far.

103
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,090
The key challenge
is still the Aesim Shopping Center,

104
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,630
so we're in talks
with the merchants' association…

105
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,930
Yes?

106
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,640
What about the buildings next to it?
How many have we secured?

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,640
Well, as of now…

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,110
So far we've secured…

109
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,400
It's 79%.

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,570
It's 79%.

111
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,110
I think securing the sites next to it
will be even more challenging.

112
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,870
What kind of residential units
are in the other buildings?

113
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,740
The residential units…

114
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,660
The area is 83.6% general residential,
all with less than seven floors…

115
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,830
I'm not asking for percentages.

116
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,750
What kind of housing are they?

117
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,460
Right.

118
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,880
- Well…
- There are two single-family homes,

119
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,720
and the rest are multi-unit buildings.

120
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,510
That's what I thought.

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,350
I figured there'd be multi-unit buildings.

122
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,600
I see.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,140
Multiple owners means more conflict
and more chances of a holdout.

124
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,520
Will everyone be moved out
before construction?

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,520
We're preparing a meeting with
the residents to keep things on schedule.

126
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,070
If a meeting were enough,
I wouldn't be worried.

127
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,950
Do you really think it's possible?

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,990
If it's the multi-unit buildings
you're worried about,

129
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,870
I already checked.
They're in the process of moving out.

130
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,790
You went there just to check?

131
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,670
Not really.

132
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm in charge of a restaurant nearby,

133
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,130
so I just happened to notice.

134
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,630
A restaurant?

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,760
Wait, are you in charge
of Rosa Restaurant?

136
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,350
Yes.

137
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,640
What's your name?

138
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,060
Oh, I'm…

139
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,350
I'm Yu Mi-rae, a Senior Specialist.

140
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,820
NEW HQ PROJECT REPORT

141
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,870
<i>So all that work</i>
<i>wasn't for nothing after all.</i>

142
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,590
Jeez…

143
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,560
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE
BUT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU - SY

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,690
Ta-da.

145
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,440
Is this from overseas?

146
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,980
"Sang-yeong Park."

147
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,030
Mr. Park sent it as a gift
before returning home.

148
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,530
- Wow.
- He must be coming back soon.

149
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,290
I bet he'll be back next month.

150
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,450
Look, they have our initials.

151
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,410
TO MI-JEONG, FROM SY

152
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,830
Oh my.

153
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,420
He really knows how to pick the best gift.

154
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,550
- Goodness.
- Wow.

155
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,960
Sang-yeong?

156
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,800
<i>Mr. Park, why are you doing this?</i>

157
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,380
<i>If you do this,</i>

158
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,090
<i>I'll look like the problem.</i>

159
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,560
<i>- If this is about before…</i>
<i>- Ms. Yu.</i>

160
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,560
<i>People are watching.</i>
<i>We should keep some boundaries.</i>

161
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,600
<i>And we shouldn't meet in private anymore.</i>

162
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,350
Why is she keeping
the door closed?

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,020
Mi-ji, why are you still in bed?
What about the farm?

164
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,360
I quit.

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
What?

166
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,740
Hey, did you quit
because of what I said before?

167
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,620
I just quit.

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,870
Let me sleep a bit longer.

169
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,880
Gyeong-gu's here with the delivery.
Aren't you coming out?

170
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
Later.

171
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,670
Ms. Kim, this <i>ramyeon </i>is on me.

172
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,720
- Hey, Gyeong-gu.
- Yes?

173
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,810
Is something up with her?

174
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,520
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

175
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,480
It's just that she's been down all day.
She even quit the farm.

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,020
- She quit the strawberry farm?
- Yes.

177
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,650
Wow, Mi-ji.

178
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,490
You really<i> are </i>loyal.

179
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,110
The strawberry farm guy and the jam?

180
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,950
I knew it all meant nothing.

181
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,200
You can be our assistant deputy manager.

182
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,290
Mi-ji!

183
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,870
What's with her?

184
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,630
Why don't you take her out
for some fresh air or something?

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,630
All right, I guess.

186
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,840
Just let her be for a while.

187
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,140
Man.

188
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,970
What are you doing,

189
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,140
stacking all this out here?

190
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,180
- Well…
- Yes?

191
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,810
It's annoying going back and forth
to the storage area.

192
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,690
You know that fine dining places
manage tasks down to the second, right?

193
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,400
You really find
creative ways to waste time.

194
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,820
Hurry and put them inside.

195
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,410
What if the typhoon floods the whole farm?

196
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,870
It's freezing. What typhoon?

197
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,450
What kind of farmer
doesn't check the weather?

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,870
A big typhoon is hitting
the central region this weekend.

199
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,670
You should check
if the embankment is okay,

200
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,790
otherwise this whole road
might end up underwater.

201
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
If it floods, it floods.

202
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,550
Don't talk nonsense.

203
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,510
Do it while I'm here.

204
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,550
We've got sand right here.

205
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,680
Just tell Mi-ji
to bring some extra sacks on her way.

206
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,020
She quit.

207
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,480
Quit… Mi-ji quit? Why?

208
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,480
Knowing you, I wondered
how she lasted that long.

209
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,030
Then go get the sacks yourself

210
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,280
- before I change my mind.
- It's fine.

211
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,110
We're the only farm on this side
of the river, so it doesn't matter.

212
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,070
Will you swim out of here when it floods?

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
If the bridge breaks,
you're stranded here, genius.

214
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,790
So what? Did the bridge
kill my grandfather?

215
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,880
So you're not fixing
the embankment today?

216
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,180
SOBER UP!
SPARKLING GRAPEFRUIT

217
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,890
<i>Just say it.</i>

218
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,850
Who do you like right now?

219
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,810
I also…

220
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,980
Yes?

221
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,900
I also want to say it.

222
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,400
But not now. Not when you're like this.

223
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,450
- What?
- Wait.

224
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,830
Let's talk when you sober up.

225
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,950
What?

226
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,940
Why did I close my eyes?

227
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
PARK JI-YUN

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,420
Hey, Ji-yun.

229
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,010
What? Slow down.

230
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,310
Didn't you say
it was urgent and important?

231
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,390
It is urgent and important.

232
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
I can't take photos
and do everything myself.

233
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,770
- You could've come with someone else.
- Hey.

234
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,110
Focus. You might break the heart.

235
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,360
You're right.

236
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,070
It didn't have to be you.

237
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,580
But I told you last time

238
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,740
that I'd make sure
you have a good time.

239
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,670
This shot came out great.
Do you want to see it?

240
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,800
I guess you really like this job.

241
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Me?

242
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,300
That was random. Why?

243
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,260
It just seems like you enjoy it.

244
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,060
Well, I do like
new and interesting things.

245
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,480
The job itself isn't bad.

246
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,270
But it feels like
it's just about chasing trends.

247
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,900
I'm thinking about moving somewhere
with more long-term potential.

248
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,820
- Are you free tomorrow?
- I have plans in the afternoon.

249
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,830
Then let's grab lunch before that.

250
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,120
Sorry.

251
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,500
I just realized I have something
in the morning too.

252
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,080
Come on. Have lunch with me.

253
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,710
The place I want to go to
only takes reservations for two or more.

254
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,510
Go with your coworkers.

255
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,970
I don't even know much about food.

256
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,640
It's awkward with people from work.

257
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,720
Please?

258
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,770
Just lunch, then.

259
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,650
I really do have plans in the afternoon.

260
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,940
Hey, Ho-su.

261
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,570
What?

262
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,530
You're surprisingly easy to convince.

263
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,610
- That's not--
- Whatever. No take-backs.

264
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,660
We're meeting tomorrow, okay?

265
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,090
<i>I've got your bag.</i>
<i>I'll come by your office.</i>

266
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,380
Just say it.

267
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,550
I also…

268
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,930
I've already sorted things out,
so you don't need to worry.

269
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,600
What on earth could've happened
for him to say it's all sorted?

270
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,190
What did I do last night?

271
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,400
Come on, brain. Give me something!

272
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Mi-rae!

273
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,370
How come you two came together?

274
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,120
We were nearby--

275
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,250
We had dinner together,
and I tagged along to see you.

276
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,790
Here's your bag.

277
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,880
Right.

278
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,750
Being here brings back memories.

279
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,430
You don't need to borrow
my shoes today, right?

280
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,510
What shoes?

281
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,510
Interview day, remember?

282
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,220
Don't act like you don't know.

283
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,730
The shoes. Right.

284
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,360
Why is there always a line at that place?

285
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,820
AEWOL CROQUETTE

286
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,570
That place was only on Jeju.
I guess they opened one here.

287
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,820
Want to check it out?

288
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Now?

289
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,860
Weren't you going back to work?

290
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,870
It'll just be a quick stop.

291
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,950
Mi-rae, we'll get going.

292
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,450
- Okay.
- Let's go.

293
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,750
You're coming
to the hospital tomorrow, right?

294
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,250
Yes.

295
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,960
See you there.

296
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,300
All right. Bye.

297
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,260
What the heck, Ho-su?

298
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,350
Did you sort things out because of her?

299
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,100
HIGH-QUALITY STRAWBERRY
GROWING GUIDE DRAFT

300
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,570
DAILY FARM LOG

301
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,400
EMPTY TRASH

302
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,040
No. I can't let you go like this.

303
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,120
I should at least know why.

304
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,290
Don't dodge it with something vague
like "it's my problem."

305
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,880
Let me know what's wrong!

306
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,550
There are rumors.

307
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,970
People are getting
the wrong idea about us.

308
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,800
That's ridiculous…

309
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,470
Are you seriously quitting
because of that?

310
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,230
Because of stupid rumors
people are spreading for fun?

311
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,440
You can just deny it.

312
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,820
Wouldn't it look weirder
to quit over some rumors?

313
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,950
I'm getting rid of the reason
for the gossip.

314
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,740
People who get swayed by gossip

315
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,450
don't care about the truth anyway.

316
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,200
You're the one getting swayed
the most right now.

317
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,290
Those rumors are fake.

318
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,790
But those strawberries are real.

319
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,210
You're saying something fake
is more important than something real.

320
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Fine.

321
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,390
Thank you for everything.

322
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,550
Take care.

323
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,650
- Hey.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

324
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,490
Nothing much. Everything okay?

325
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,870
Just the usual.

326
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,830
Same old stuff at work.

327
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,040
How have you been, Mi-rae?

328
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,630
You know, I realized

329
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,420
I always talk about myself,
but I never ask how you're doing.

330
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,760
<i>What do you do besides visiting Grandma?</i>

331
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
I just…

332
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,930
worked at the strawberry farm.

333
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,220
That 200,000-won-a-day job?

334
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,140
No way. <i>You</i> worked on a farm?

335
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,390
<i>How was it?</i>

336
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,190
It's helped me to eat and sleep better.

337
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,820
And it stopped me from overthinking.

338
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,110
<i>That's good.</i>

339
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,820
Getting your body moving
helps clear your mind.

340
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,530
Hang in there until I come down.

341
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,200
<i>I'll take over when I get back.</i>

342
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,500
- I quit.
<i>- Why?</i>

343
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,460
I just started wondering what I was doing.

344
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,750
You're over there
dealing with my problems,

345
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,210
and I'm here running away from reality.

346
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,510
<i>So what if you are?</i>

347
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,300
It's not like I have it that bad.

348
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,600
The impact is different for you and me.

349
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,810
I'm fine.

350
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,430
I've been feeling anxious.

351
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,020
The fact that I'm worrying again
might mean I'm getting back to normal.

352
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,270
As for me,

353
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm only here until you're okay.

354
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,280
We can switch back anytime.

355
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,950
<i>But if you're only saying this</i>

356
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,910
because you're worried about me,

357
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,580
I can manage a bit longer.

358
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,160
But are you really okay?

359
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,210
It's just,

360
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,290
I don't think it matters where I am.

361
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm still the same.

362
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,840
You've been saying "just" a lot.
Something's fishy.

363
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,890
Are you sure you're okay to come back?
What about the resignation letter?

364
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,140
I'll write it.

365
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,520
Actually, let's end this next week.

366
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,150
What? Next week?

367
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,900
You want to switch next week?

368
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,200
Yes. I was thinking of going back
around then anyway.

369
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,780
We can switch sooner if you want.

370
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,160
No, it's fine. Let's do it next week.

371
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,080
Okay. Get some rest.

372
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,630
Next week?

373
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,010
There's nothing I can do as Mi-rae.

374
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,220
As for Ho-su,

375
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,970
I'll settle things for real
once I'm back to myself next week.

376
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,430
Whatever happens, happens.

377
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,520
First, I need to clean up the mess I made
before Mi-rae comes back.

378
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,810
DELETE TEXTS, HAIR APPOINTMENT
TALK TO TAE-I

379
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,900
What do I do with this one?

380
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,030
NEW HQ PROJECT

381
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,280
She'll be so mad at me
for not staying put.

382
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,790
What are you looking at?

383
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,670
Oh, it's nothing.

384
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,960
Wait.

385
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,170
How come you're not eating
at the cafeteria today?

386
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,880
No way.

387
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,180
You didn't follow me here, did you?

388
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,320
Hey, Tae-i.

389
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,490
The other day, you asked

390
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,200
if I knew Mr. Park was in charge
of the new HQ project when I took it on.

391
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
Why did you ask?

392
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,620
I didn't mean to accuse you or anything.

393
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,210
I was just worried.

394
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,040
About what?

395
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,880
I'm just curious what others think.

396
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,210
I figured working with Mr. Park

397
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,050
might be uncomfortable for you.

398
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,680
But if you're okay with it,
then that's all that matters.

399
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,470
No need to avoid him
just because it's awkward.

400
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,060
So don't mind what I said.

401
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,560
Okay.

402
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,700
Who are you texting
that's making you smile?

403
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,000
Wait, are you seeing someone?

404
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,370
It's not like that.

405
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,800
It's the old classmate
from the triple blind date.

406
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,840
The lawyer from Wongeun?
The silent, cool guy?

407
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,470
What should we eat?

408
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,810
Is it true they're not renewing
Ji-yun's contract?

409
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,640
The team leader said
they're doing open recruitment.

410
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,900
That's kind of harsh.

411
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,570
Still, thanks to us,
she landed a lawyer boyfriend.

412
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,650
Maybe that's a silver lining.

413
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,490
Is she really seeing a lawyer? Wow.

414
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,410
Does he know she's on contract?

415
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,200
He does, actually.

416
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,240
We told him at the blind date,
before she arrived.

417
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,830
The elevator's here.

418
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,550
Aren't you going to take a photo?

419
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,970
Why did you come today?

420
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,010
Because I asked you to?

421
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,890
You said you felt awkward
coming with your coworkers.

422
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,390
So was it out of pity?

423
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,440
I thought I was teasing you,
but it was the other way around.

424
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,440
- What do you mean?
- You knew.

425
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,320
That I was on contract.

426
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,030
I bet you were laughing on the inside.

427
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,450
I didn't know you knew,

428
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,790
and I was out here
acting like I was some big shot.

429
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,460
Does that matter?

430
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,750
I knew you'd say that.

431
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,010
It probably doesn't seem important to you.

432
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,970
You don't care what other people think,
because you don't have to.

433
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,760
Maybe it's because
I'm not as successful as you,

434
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,520
but I can't ignore what others think.

435
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,230
Since no one really sees me for who I am,

436
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,560
I just go along
with what people want to see.

437
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,940
That's why I didn't mention it.

438
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,860
If anyone knew I was on contract,
would they even care to look at me?

439
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,700
You're unbelievable, though.

440
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,410
If you knew, you should've just told me.

441
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,120
Now I'm too embarrassed about lying
to ask you to meet up again.

442
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,750
I even boasted about
making sure you'd have a good time.

443
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,340
But at least you had fun
watching me, right?

444
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,430
Look.

445
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,060
I get what you're saying, but…

446
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,390
I never thought you lied.

447
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,610
I don't see why anyone
has to mention being on contract.

448
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,690
You love your job and work hard.

449
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,820
That's not a lie.

450
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,820
And I don't ignore what others think.

451
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
I'm just awkward.

452
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,080
It's not a choice.
I can't do things like you do.

453
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,590
That's why I didn't realize
how you would feel.

454
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,010
I didn't think you'd feel deceived
just because I didn't say anything.

455
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,930
If I hurt your feelings,

456
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,510
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,390
What are you, a fool?

458
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,020
Why are<i> you</i> apologizing?

459
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,150
The more I get to know you,
the stranger you seem.

460
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,070
Hey.

461
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,820
Photo first!

462
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,660
Did Mi-ji say anything to you?

463
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,370
What?

464
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,040
About what?

465
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Anything.

466
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,670
She's been acting strange lately.

467
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,260
What if she stays holed up
in her room again?

468
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,020
Ask her to come and see you.
Say you miss her.

469
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,770
She won't say no to you.

470
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,980
Mi-ji…

471
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,190
wouldn't do that.

472
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,190
Gosh.

473
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,780
How do you know?

474
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,740
What if giving her space
only makes her worse?

475
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,870
She promised me.

476
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,330
Mi-ji won't do that anymore.

477
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,960
- She won't.
- Gosh.

478
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,760
We can never see eye to eye.

479
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,470
The owner of Rosa Restaurant
is hospitalized,

480
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,350
so we're waiting for her to recover
before scheduling another meeting.

481
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,890
If possible, I'd like to
speak with the owner alone.

482
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,850
That might be difficult.

483
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,770
She barely agreed to have a meeting.

484
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,110
Who's in charge of Rosa Restaurant?

485
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,780
That'd be me.

486
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,070
Come on.

487
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,900
You didn't convince her.

488
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,660
Who's doing the work?

489
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,200
She'll be off the project soon.

490
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,370
Why?

491
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,500
The previous person in charge
is coming back from overseas training.

492
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,000
And those two are not on good terms.

493
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,050
I'd like to meet the employee privately.

494
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,840
Right now.

495
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,230
How did you know
the whistleblower was my classmate?

496
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,910
Sorry to bother you.

497
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm Lee Chung-gu, the attorney
helping with the Rosa Restaurant case.

498
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,910
Hello, I'm Yu Mi-rae
from the Planning Strategy Team.

499
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,630
You must have met
Ms. Kim Ro-sa several times.

500
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,130
Have you gotten close?

501
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,630
I've seen her a lot, so yes,
compared to when I first met her.

502
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,220
How about Mr. Lee Ho-su?

503
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,680
Since he's her representative,
I'd imagine you'd see him even more.

504
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,560
If you're asking if we've gotten close,

505
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,560
we already knew each other
from high school.

506
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,350
Really? Was it a coincidence?

507
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,860
- Or did you introduce them?
- No.

508
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,150
Why would I go out of my way
to make things complicated?

509
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,820
They had their own ties.

510
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,990
I see.

511
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,320
You seem honest.
I feel like I can trust you.

512
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,250
About the new HQ project,
I heard you might step down

513
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,710
over some tension with someone.

514
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,790
If I took him out of the picture,
would you take the lead?

515
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,880
What do you mean?

516
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,420
Relax. Speak your mind.

517
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,090
I don't really know anything
about the office politics here.

518
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,970
All I need is to acquire the restaurant,

519
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,930
and I think you're
the perfect fit for this job.

520
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,440
CONFIDENTIAL

521
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,650
NEW HQ AND LRT LINE INTEGRATION PROJECT

522
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,240
They're building an LRT station
at the new HQ site?

523
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,250
Yes, you'll see the details there.

524
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,460
The location of Rosa Restaurant
is crucial.

525
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,250
Very few people know about this.

526
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,090
If this information gets out,
things could get messy.

527
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,590
Then why are you telling me…

528
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,260
Because you're in charge.

529
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,720
You should know the gravity of your work.

530
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,430
Obviously, this is confidential.

531
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,180
You can't tell anyone.
Not the owner, not your team,

532
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,810
and not your family.

533
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,690
And not your old classmate
you ran into by chance.

SEOUL SAEWON MEDICAL CENTER

536
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,120
He's not here yet?

537
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,660
Tell him we'll go on our own.

538
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,000
He said he already left.

539
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,000
Why is Ho-su taking so long?

540
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,720
I was only in the hospital
for a few days, and look at all this.

541
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,840
- Let me carry one.
- No way.

542
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,970
Come on. Stop fussing over me.

543
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,760
Seriously, no.

544
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,680
You still need to be careful.

545
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,930
Gosh.

546
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,980
And…

547
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,780
things have been hectic lately,

548
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,780
so I didn't get a chance to say this.

549
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,110
Thank you.

550
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,070
Pardon?

551
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,830
I said, "Thank you."

552
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,080
When I threw out my back that day,

553
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,710
I figured I'd have the worst luck,

554
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,880
and starve to death lying there.

555
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,260
No one was going to check on me,

556
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,090
so I thought about
biting my tongue to end it.

557
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,510
Then you showed up.

558
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,600
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have been so mean to you.

559
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,940
But how could I have known?

560
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,190
Anyway, you saved me.

561
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,240
Thank you.

562
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,370
There's no need to thank me.

563
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,790
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,290
Sorry for what?

565
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,540
Well…

566
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,880
I mean… Actually…

567
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,470
Sorry we're late.

568
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,510
Ms. Ro-sa, please get in.

569
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,220
Hello, ma'am.

570
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,270
Hey, Mi-rae.

571
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,480
Hey.

572
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,480
Why did you bring Ji-yun? It's awkward.

573
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,320
She offered to give
your great-aunt a ride. I couldn't say no.

574
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,990
How did you even…

575
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,030
Quiet.

576
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,740
What are you two whispering about?

577
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,200
We were talking

578
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,830
about where to put this
so it's easy to read.

579
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,920
Should I leave it here?
No, it's better to stick it up here.

580
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,460
POST-CHOLECYSTECTOMY PRECAUTIONS

581
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,840
Is this you when you were young?

582
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,760
You still look like your old self.

583
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,850
Of course I do.
I may have aged, but I'm still me.

584
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,190
"Ro-sa and Sang-wol."

585
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,320
So the "Sang-wol" in "The Sea of Sang-wol"
was a person?

586
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,860
Wait. Is she Sang-wol?

587
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,990
Is it okay to leave your friend alone?

588
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,120
- Shouldn't you go downstairs?
- I'll go check on her.

589
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,540
No, don't.

590
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,250
Let me. I'll go.

591
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,960
You can put this up.

592
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,880
I don't mind going.

593
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,010
Why are you taking so many pictures?

594
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,260
Because I love it here.

595
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,480
I've only seen retro-themed places,
but this place is real.

596
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,730
Where's Ho-su?

597
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,850
Upstairs. He'll be down soon.

598
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,650
You've been seeing him a lot.

599
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,190
What? Does it bother you?

600
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
No, I'm just saying you see him a lot.

601
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,950
What do you think of Ho-su?

602
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,130
Ho-su is just Ho-su. What do you mean?

603
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,880
Are you interested in him?

604
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,800
I want to give it a shot with him.

605
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,340
I wanted to check with you.

606
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,680
Do whatever you want.
Why do you care what I think?

607
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,180
You know,
we always wanted the same things.

608
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,690
College, jobs…

609
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,230
You always got

610
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,570
everything I desperately wished for.

611
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,700
I tried everything to get into KFMC,

612
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,240
but you got in half-heartedly
after quitting the civil service exam.

613
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,660
Would you have applied there
if I hadn't pushed you to?

614
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,370
Honestly?

615
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,170
You're right.

616
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,630
Anyway, you're doing well now,
so it all worked out.

617
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,340
I'm on contract.

618
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,510
It's about to end,
so I'll be unemployed soon.

619
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,890
And for some reason,

620
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,270
I just didn't want to tell you, Mi-rae.

621
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,480
I wanted to pretend
I was doing just as well.

622
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,730
It's all just insecurity, I guess.

623
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,150
So this time, I'm calling dibs.

624
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,780
I don't want to lose Ho-su too.

625
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,620
Why do you like Ho-su?

626
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,580
At first, he got my attention
because he's a lawyer.

627
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,170
But I don't know…

628
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,000
He seems so cold and indifferent,

629
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,840
but he's actually gentle,
tender-hearted, awkward,

630
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,970
and surprisingly…

631
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,890
kind of…

632
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,180
Foolish, right?

633
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,190
Yes, he is.

634
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,520
He's way too soft.

635
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,730
He's so mysterious.

636
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,570
That makes me want
to get to know him better.

637
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,780
And see what's going on inside him.

638
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,660
What?

639
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,620
Do I sound childish?

640
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,210
No. It sounds very mature.

641
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,540
What? Are you teasing me?

642
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,130
No.

643
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,510
I mean it.

644
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,550
I like how honest you are.

645
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,520
<i>That being said…</i>

646
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,730
You two go ahead.

647
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,230
I have to stop by somewhere.

648
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,030
Okay, Mi-rae.

649
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,280
Stay on the main roads.

650
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,240
Ho-su.

651
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,450
Okay.

652
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,090
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

653
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,550
<i>It's like I've lost</i>
<i>before the fight began.</i>

654
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,220
<i>We spent ten years out of sync.</i>

655
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,310
<i>Is our timing off again?</i>

656
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,480
<i>I just need one more week.</i>

657
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,610
<i>I never really</i>
<i>got to talk to him as myself.</i>

658
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,860
<i>But even if I go back to being me,</i>

659
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,650
<i>do I have a chance?</i>

660
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,700
<i>First loves belong in the past,</i>

661
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,750
<i>and I have nothing to be proud of.</i>

662
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,210
<i>It's just sad.</i>

663
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,800
<i>My feelings always go to waste</i>

664
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,300
<i>before they're ever heard.</i>

665
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,400
What do you mean
you want me to counsel Mi-ji?

666
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,900
That's nonsense.

667
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,020
Why not?

668
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,570
Don't you have a counseling certificate?

669
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,700
That's for kids. Mi-ji is…

670
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,700
Besides, young people these days
don't like people interfering.

671
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,200
Mi-ji is still a child inside.

672
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,540
Just think of her as a fifth grader
and talk to her, will you?

673
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,420
If you're so worried,
talk to her yourself.

674
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,420
I'm asking because I can't!

675
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,460
Why not?

676
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,050
You're her mom.

677
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,800
Some moms aren't as good as others.

678
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,470
What kind of mom
can't tell her own kids apart?

679
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,600
Come on.

680
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,270
Mi-ji and Mi-rae look exactly alike.

681
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,230
Anyone would be confused.

682
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,440
But I'm their mom.

683
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,780
I spent all their childhood working,
barely paying attention to them.

684
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,070
Trying to act like a mom now won't work.

685
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,490
After their dad died
and their grandma collapsed…

686
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,250
Mi-ji doesn't have anyone
she can really open up to.

687
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,590
Just let her know how much you care.

688
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,720
- Then it should be fine.
- I don't know.

689
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,590
I just can't do that with Mi-ji.

690
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,810
She reminds me so much of myself,
and I always say the wrong thing.

691
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,360
How long has Mi-ji been in her room for?

692
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,900
Three days.

693
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,530
Are you kidding me?

694
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,780
Ok-hui!

695
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,530
I don't leave my room
for five days during the break.

696
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,910
You're so dramatic
for someone who doesn't care.

697
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,290
- Bun-hong.
- Get out of the way.

698
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,670
I'm not being dramatic.
I'm seriously worried!

699
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,130
Talk to me again
if she stays in there for a month.

700
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,510
And stop humble-bragging
about having daughters.

701
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,260
I'm swamped as it is…

702
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,100
Are we done?

703
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
No!

704
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,840
<i>Please throw this junk away.</i>

705
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,170
I bought you that expensive chair
so you could get rid of this junk.

706
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,550
And those clothes!

707
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,350
So you ditched the Gore-Tex vest
and went back to that rag again?

708
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,550
Toss it already.

709
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,470
It doesn't have any holes.
How is it a rag?

710
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,020
Why don't you throw out
those worn-out sneakers?

711
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,770
These are intentionally distressed.

712
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,070
Man, it's so shabby
that I can't bear to look at it.

713
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,610
If you don't want to see it,
just go back to Seoul.

714
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,490
Why do you keep coming down here?

715
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,030
Just to throw away perfectly good stuff?

716
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,450
You didn't know?

717
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,960
My goal is to clear out everything you own
and replace it all with new stuff.

718
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,090
Or you can move to Seoul with me.
Let's see who wins.

719
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,760
Wow. This place is bigger than I thought.

720
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,520
Your grandfather ran all this by himself?

721
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,480
If it's too much to handle…

722
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,610
Did you lose something?

723
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,690
The LRT…

724
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,450
I think I left something on the LRT.

725
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,240
You can go.

726
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,040
Where could it be? It's not at home.

727
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,170
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

728
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,260
Hey, Seung-hyeon.

729
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,850
What?

730
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,720
The wedding?

731
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,270
- Is that this weekend?
<i>- Yes.</i>

732
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,600
If you're going, let's go together.
I'll pick you up.

733
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,020
<i>I can just take the bus.</i>

734
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,190
You haven't seen where it is, have you?

735
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,110
The venue's up on a hill,
so you'll need a car to get there.

736
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,290
Wait. Do you already have
someone to go with?

737
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,250
I just thought you might be going alone

738
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,420
<i>since Ji-yun is going with Ho-su.</i>

739
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,710
Ho-su is going with Ji-yun?

740
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,050
<i>Yes, didn't he tell you?</i>

741
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,970
No. I didn't even know he was going.

742
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,130
Really?

743
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,180
Maybe they wanted
some alone time.

744
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,350
<i>If you're okay with it, I can pick you up.</i>
<i>I'm heading that way anyway.</i>

745
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,220
It's so itchy.

746
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,810
Why is this…

747
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,930
It's too tight…

748
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,060
Can you…

749
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,850
JI-YUN

750
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,190
Jeez.

751
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,530
Hey, what's up?

752
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,030
<i>Didn't you lose something?</i>

753
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,070
What do you mean?

754
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,250
Do you have that LRT file?

755
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:20,500
Anything else?

756
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,470
Why don't you just give me
your door code while you're at it?

757
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,680
Door code? 36936--

758
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,100
No.

759
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,470
Why are you telling me
something you're not supposed to?

760
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,770
Have you told anyone else besides me?

761
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,640
No, just you.

762
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,730
If this gets out,
the lawyer said I could get sued.

763
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,900
Not "could." You 100% would.

764
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,190
If someone else heard this,
you'd be in serious trouble.

765
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,160
I know.

766
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,950
Shouldn't we tell Ms. Ro-sa about this?

767
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,540
I can't ask her to sell the building
while hiding something so important.

768
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,000
It's just wrong.

769
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,880
You work for KFMC, not her.

770
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,380
That's your job.

771
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,550
I didn't know about it before,
but now I do.

772
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,720
If I go through with it anyway,
it'd feel like I'm deceiving her.

773
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,760
What if she sells
and then regrets it later?

774
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,520
I get how you feel.
But you need to drop it.

775
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,360
You didn't say anything today,

776
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,990
and I didn't hear a thing.

777
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,490
But that doesn't make it go away…

778
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,490
Fine, then let's put it this way.

779
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,370
You told me, but I chose not to tell her.

780
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,330
But from this moment on, officially,

781
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,830
you have said nothing. Got it?

782
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,920
Nothing.

783
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,300
Fine.

784
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,020
YU MI-RAE
SENIOR SPECIALIST

785
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,650
About the LRT station.

786
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:05,860
Have you told anyone?

787
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,530
Me? Not at all.

788
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,700
Then why are you so nervous?

789
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:13,780
We're on the same team.

790
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,040
We are, right?

791
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,160
Of course.

792
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,960
On the same team.

793
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,420
So, I think we should start negotiating.

794
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,720
Can you set up a meeting next week
with Rosa Restaurant's representative?

795
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,890
Sure. Next week it is.

796
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:35,970
And there's something I wanted to ask you.

797
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,350
It's hard to match faces
since it's an old photo.

798
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,520
From what I've heard…

799
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,820
this is poet Kim Ro-sa. Is that right?

800
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,660
Is this you when you were young?

801
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,790
Wait. Is she Sang-wol?

802
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,920
SEPTEMBER 3, 1975

803
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,500
What? That's not her?

804
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,210
Jeez.

805
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,920
The photo is too old. I can't tell.

806
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,550
If that's Kim Ro-sa, the sociology major,
then it must be her.

807
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,760
I was just checking.

808
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,100
She looks so different
from her recent photos.

809
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:23,940
Well…

810
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,790
<i>That woman. I swear that was Sang-wol.</i>

811
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,830
<i>Did they have the same major?</i>

812
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,000
<i>But he said she was Kim Ro-sa, the poet…</i>

813
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,380
Ho-su is running a bit late.

814
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,220
- Have you finished writing?
- Yes, I'll put this up.

815
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,300
This is yours, right?

816
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,560
Did you take a look?

817
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,140
I did. I was wondering what it was.

818
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,100
I mean…

819
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,650
It's confidential.

820
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,740
Because of company policy…

821
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,200
How can you be so careless
with something like that?

822
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,320
Here.

823
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,280
What?

824
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,330
Is that…

825
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,500
all?

826
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,410
Aren't you going to say anything else?

827
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,870
Take better care of your stuff.

828
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,590
Did you write that we're closed
on weekends for now?

829
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,220
What? Yes.

830
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,260
CLOSED ON WEEKENDS
FOR THE TIME BEING

831
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,320
<i>I did. I was wondering what it was.</i>

832
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,360
Did you write that we're closed
on weekends for now?

833
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,070
I put a note on your door.

834
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,620
- You didn't see it?
- What note?

835
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,120
This is poet Kim Ro-sa. Is that right?

836
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,750
Wait. Is she Sang-wol?

837
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,420
What are you doing standing there?

838
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:14,760
Ho-su.

839
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,090
Yes, I know.

840
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,550
You know?

841
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,350
So she can't read?

842
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,310
It's not that she can't read at all.

843
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,350
I think she has dyslexia.

844
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,940
She can read and write
simple words, like names.

845
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,360
How did you…

846
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,650
When did you figure it out?

847
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,690
I just noticed over time.

848
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,490
That's probably why
she made me her representative.

849
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,240
Why?

850
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,160
Is it even possible
to go to HNU if you can't read?

851
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,670
There was someone like that
in my department too.

852
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,670
Dyslexia isn't an illness.
It's a condition.

853
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,710
It can definitely be improved.

854
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,960
Maybe some people do get better,

855
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,260
but she still can't read.

856
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,390
So what are you trying to say?

857
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,430
You think she faked her degree?

858
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,770
How are you so calm?

859
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,850
Doesn't this seem weird to you?

860
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,150
It does.

861
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,440
But so what? Are we supposed to dig up
her student records from 50 years ago?

862
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,610
For what?

863
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,530
It's not just about her degree.

864
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,950
She's a poet.

865
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,290
If she's hiding something…

866
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,000
People always have a reason
for hiding things.

867
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,130
And you need a reason to dig it up too.

868
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,790
So we just pretend we don't know?

869
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,340
Isn't it kind of shady to act that way?

870
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,760
We don't know everything, do we?

871
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,470
And if you don't know the full story,

872
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,520
it's better to keep quiet sometimes.

873
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:54,100
Are you telling me
to keep my mouth shut?

874
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:57,400
We all have that one question
we don't want to be asked.

875
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,860
Does choosing not to ask it
count as being deceitful?

876
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,910
But still…

877
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,450
Whatever. Let's just say
I'm the shady one.

878
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,950
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

879
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,330
- Bye.
- Hey, Ho-su.

880
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,670
When did he figure all that out?

881
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,180
He's impossible to read.

882
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,270
What are you doing?

883
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,280
Why weren't you answering your phone?

884
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,820
I had to make a scene just to see you!

885
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,110
Get in.

886
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,490
Where are we going?

887
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,160
Well,

888
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,120
it's urgent, so just get in.
I'll explain on the way.

889
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,420
We don't have time, okay? Hurry up.

890
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,090
Fine, I'm coming.

891
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,220
I'm coming.

892
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,480
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WEDDING

893
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,810
Traffic's pretty bad.

894
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,860
It's nice to spend
more time with you, though.

895
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,070
Dang, you really went all out today.

896
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,650
Trying to outshine the bride?

897
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,570
Oh, please.

898
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,120
Anyway, thanks for the ride.

899
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,460
No problem.

900
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,420
By the way,

901
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,840
I heard there will be
some familiar faces today.

902
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,250
Did you get a heads-up?

903
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,050
No. Who?

904
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,550
I guess they're dropping by unannounced.

905
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,270
A couple will make a surprise appearance.

906
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,240
How are you?

907
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,070
- Good.
- It's been a while.

908
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,070
- You're here!
- Hey.

909
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,210
So that's why you wanted me
to save two seats.

910
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,710
You were coming with Mi-rae.

911
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,750
Man, the traffic was insane. Right?

912
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,340
Ho-su, you made it.

913
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,970
Yes.

914
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,560
Ho-su, isn't that hilarious?

915
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,930
Look at that.

916
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,140
What? Oh.

917
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,980
Over there.

918
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,940
Yes, it is.

919
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,230
Where are we even going?

920
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,400
You'll see when we get there.

921
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,410
Jeez, stop rushing me.

922
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,160
We're almost there.

923
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,330
You dragged me all the way
to Seoul while saying that.

924
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,040
Why are you getting so worked up?

925
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,960
Just take a look at the thing back there.

926
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,640
Seriously, where are we going?
And what's with this outfit?

927
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,390
It's pretty, isn't it?

928
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,060
What you're wearing is not appropriate.

929
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,190
We're going to a wedding!

930
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,480
Whose wedding?

931
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,110
You know them.

932
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,570
Their kid just turned one,
and they're finally holding the ceremony.

933
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:29,740
Min-jae and Eun-su?

934
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,570
You got an invitation too?

935
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,910
Man, those two.

936
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:37,490
If they invited you as well,

937
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,210
they must be trying to cash in
on wedding gifts.

938
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,080
Anyway, the wedding is just an excuse.

939
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,250
Let's just have a cozy little date,
just you and me.

940
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,210
- A date?
- Yes.

941
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,760
You've been holed up lately,
digging around in your own world.

942
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,810
Mi-ji, I know you were
shutting yourself in

943
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,850
just to get some attention.

944
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,060
This guy got you out for some fresh air,

945
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,860
rented a car and booked a hotel.

946
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,610
What? A hotel?

947
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,940
We just got here.
We should stay overnight.

948
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,700
Don't worry. I told your mom

949
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,990
we're going to the wedding.
We've got a solid alibi.

950
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,410
Have you heard
of the Sauron Tower in Jamsil?

951
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,040
It's amazing.

952
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,120
I even paid extra for a river view--

953
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,290
Pull over.

954
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,500
Why? We're almost there.

955
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,630
I said pull over right now!

956
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,810
Hey, Mi-ji!

957
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,140
Hey!

958
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,020
What's with you all of a sudden?

959
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,690
No, what's with <i>you?</i>

960
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,570
This is way out of line!

961
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,030
What is?

962
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,740
You basically kidnapped me in your car.

963
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,820
And what? You booked a room?

964
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:58,370
You know the kidnapping thing
was just an act.

965
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,080
- That's our thing.
- What thing?

966
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,500
Just because you're my ex,
I'm supposed to go along with whatever?

967
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,670
Mi-ji, you…

968
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,250
I tried to overlook it,
but I can't anymore.

969
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:11,630
There are boundaries
between men and women.

970
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,180
You really shouldn't cross the line
just because we're close!

971
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,850
What's going on?

972
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,430
What?

973
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,240
You're not Mi-ji, are you?

974
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,780
Hey, guys!

975
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,700
It feels like his birthday party,
not a wedding.

976
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,740
I can't think straight
because of this kid.

977
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,410
What are you talking about?
He's the star of the wedding, right?

978
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,670
Thanks for coming, everyone.

979
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,170
Let's all get together

980
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,460
- for an after-party soon, okay?
- Sounds good.

981
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,630
Enjoy your food.

982
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,050
The food here is great.

983
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,720
Isn't this venue nice?

984
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,260
Yes, it is.

985
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,890
<i>Are you two here to check out the venue?</i>

986
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,070
Mi-rae, you're going hard today.

987
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,490
Ho-su, do you want some too?

988
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,250
What's with you?
You're making him feel awkward.

989
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,040
Don't mind him.

990
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:41,390
He said he'd come, no matter how late,
but it looks like he's not coming.

991
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,890
Why? Is someone coming?

992
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,720
Yes, surprise guests.

993
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:46,680
Gyeong-gu.

994
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,190
Song Gyeong-gu?

995
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,520
Remember the couple I told you about?

996
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,940
Gyeong-gu was supposed
to bring Mi-ji today.

997
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,110
Mi-ji?

998
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,740
This could've actually been fun for once.
What a shame.

999
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,370
Why would that be fun?

1000
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,330
I haven't seen them in so long.

1001
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,120
What's so fun about
seeing those two after so long?

1002
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,670
Don't be a buzzkill. I was just…

1003
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,010
Aren't you a bit old
to still find that crap fun?

1004
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,010
No.

1005
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,430
It's more fun now that I'm older.

1006
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,430
You've always been like this…

1007
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,640
What, you jerk?

1008
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,310
- You think I don't know?
- About what?

1009
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,020
Ho-su, what's your problem?

1010
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,770
- Stop, Ho-su.
- Knock it off.

1011
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,280
- A lawyer throwing punches?
- What's wrong?

1012
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,400
Come on.

1013
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,490
Ho-su, wait up.

1014
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,030
We'll get going.

1015
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,040
Jeez.

1016
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,910
What's with him?

1017
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,920
I've never seen Ho-su
act like that before.

1018
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,330
He's always been weird around me.

1019
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,630
Does he have anger issues or something?

1020
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,050
Did something happen between you two?

1021
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,390
Back in the day…

1022
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,850
It's embarrassing to even talk about.

1023
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,980
Remember Gyeong-gu's
big love confession in senior year?

1024
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,270
<i>I like you.</i>

1025
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,780
What do you think?

1026
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,120
Do you think she'll fall for me?

1027
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,540
What the heck?

1028
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,580
What do you think? I was rehearsing.

1029
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,830
To ask her out.

1030
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,840
Were you messing with me?
I almost punched you.

1031
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,710
Look at these goosebumps.

1032
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,380
You actually bought it?

1033
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,130
- I'm not crazy, dude.
- You scared me.

1034
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,930
So who do you like?

1035
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,900
- What?
- Who are you rehearsing for?

1036
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,230
Wait. Don't tell me.

1037
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,700
It's Mi-ji, right?

1038
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,120
- Yes.
- I knew it.

1039
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,620
You two always hang out together.
It was obvious.

1040
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,200
I guess.

1041
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,620
But seriously, you can't do it like that.

1042
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,290
- What?
- If you're going to do it,

1043
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:18,040
you've got to go big and bold.

1044
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,210
Right.

1045
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,010
I'll coach you.

1046
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:23,550
Try again and do it right.

1047
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,180
- Okay.
- All right. Let's do this.

1048
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,550
- Should we do it here?
- Here?

1049
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,760
Where else? Say, "Mi-ji, I like you."

1050
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,680
- In broad daylight?
- Just do it!

1051
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,390
Mi-ji, I like you.

1052
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,110
Gyeong-gu.

1053
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,440
Holy cow!

1054
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:45,700
What is it?

1055
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,410
Do you really like Mi-ji?

1056
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,990
- What?
- As more than a friend?

1057
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,040
Do you like her?

1058
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,540
Yes.

1059
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,090
Why do you ask?

1060
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,540
Then don't do it.

1061
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,010
Don't tell her.

1062
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,630
Just don't.

1063
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,470
Gyeong-gu, what are you doing?

1064
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,140
Let's get ready for the big moment.

1065
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,600
Hurry!

1066
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,060
Okay, coming.

1067
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,570
Mi-ji, I like you. Go out with me.

1068
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,240
Don't wimp out! Man up and say it.

1069
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,120
Bring out more emotion.

1070
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,330
Try again.

1071
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,290
Mi-ji, I like you. Go out with me.

1072
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:41,130
- You mean like that?
- Hey.

1073
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,380
- Mi-ji's here.
- Shoot.

1074
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,630
- What? I mean…
- Hurry, quick!

1075
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:45,920
Now's your chance!

1076
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,130
Screw it!

1077
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,390
Mi-ji.

1078
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,900
I like you.

1079
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,610
Go out with me.

1080
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,860
<i>Fine.</i>

1081
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,070
Look at her face.
Let's see that again.

1082
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,370
Gosh.

1083
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,200
This is hilarious.

1084
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,750
He actually did it.

1085
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,370
So Mi-ji has no idea about him?

1086
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,460
She'll figure it out eventually.

1087
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,750
Who knows.
They might stay together for a long time.

1088
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,920
Mi-ji kind of has a boyish vibe.

1089
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,420
Oh man…

1090
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,150
There's a fight!

1091
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,450
Stop it, you two!

1092
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,700
- Shouldn't we break it up?
- What?

1093
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,000
- Cut it out!
- That's enough.

1094
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,830
- Knock it off!
- Calm down.

1095
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,790
- You're way too worked up.
- Enough.

1096
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,000
Stop it.

1097
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,060
Gosh.

1098
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,440
I had no idea.

1099
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,860
I just thought you were her ex.

1100
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,990
Wait, does Mi-ji…

1101
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,530
Of course she knows.

1102
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,950
That's why I could tell it was you.

1103
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:40,750
I told Mi-ji the truth
right after we started dating.

1104
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,750
I was going to tell her anyway,

1105
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,580
but Ho-su just kept giving me
death stares.

1106
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,670
It was just like today.

1107
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,760
He suddenly charged over and asked
if I thought it was funny.

1108
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,890
So Ho-su knew everything?

1109
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:59,600
He never said anything to you?

1110
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,390
Then that bastard was acting
clueless the whole time.

1111
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,190
He's always been creepy like that.

1112
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,060
And he's been fooling you for ten years!

1113
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,070
I'm glad you finally found out, Mi-rae.

1114
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,780
But you knew the whole time too.

1115
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,990
I mean…

1116
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,200
It's not really about who knew what.

1117
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,830
The whole thing is Gyeong-gu's fault.

1118
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:21,410
Can't you see?

1119
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:24,410
He's still pretending to be with Mi-ji
after all these years.

1120
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,000
He says they've been together
for ten years now.

1121
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:33,840
Wait, don't tell me
Mi-ji still doesn't know.

1122
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,510
Isn't that kind of a scam--

1123
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,590
Hey!

1124
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,470
I mean…

1125
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:46,270
The 28th student council president
of Duson High, Choi Seung-hyeon.

1126
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,480
I get that it's your biggest
achievement in life,

1127
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,570
but maybe it's time to graduate.

1128
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,820
How are you still
in your high school phase?

1129
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,910
- Mi-rae, you--
- I swear, I'll punch you!

1130
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,320
You should be thankful that I'm Mi-rae.

1131
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:02,490
If I were you, I'd stay away from Mi-ji
starting next week.

1132
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,620
- Wait…
- Get out of my face!

1133
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,580
Shoot…

1134
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,580
Hello.

1135
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,790
Ho-su, where are you?

1136
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,130
I'm in the parking lot.

1137
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,420
Then just stay there for a sec.

1138
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,720
I need to talk to you.

1139
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,590
- About what?
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>

1140
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,010
What? What's going on?

1141
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,230
Mi-rae wants to see me for a minute.

1142
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,650
- You can go.
- No, it's fine.

1143
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,610
You can talk to her. I'll wait.

1144
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,480
No, don't wait for me. You can go.

1145
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,080
Who are you going to go see?

1146
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,370
She's not Mi-rae.

1147
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
It's Mi-ji.

1148
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,420
I know.

1149
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,130
What?

1150
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,340
I know

1151
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,430
that it's Mi-ji.

1152
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,520
Sorry.

1153
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:51,980
I have to go.

1154
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,390
Ho-su.

1155
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:35,100
I don't want to lie to you.

1156
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,730
The truth is,

1157
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,200
I'm Mi…

1158
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,160
No, stop.

1159
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,780
Don't say it. No.

1160
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,530
Don't.

1161
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,410
But I feel uneasy.

1162
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,790
Uneasy.

1163
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,840
Good night.

1164
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,760
Mi-ji.

1165
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,100
Okay.

1166
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,190
Mi-ji.

1167
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,490
Yes?

1168
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,120
Mi-ji.

1169
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:16,500
Why do you keep calling me?

1170
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,760
<i>People always have a reason</i>
<i>for hiding things.</i>

1171
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,180
What shoes?

1172
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,020
Don't act like you don't know.

1173
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,730
The shoes. Right.

1174
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:40,230
Why is there always a line at that place?

1175
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,310
What?

1176
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,070
That place was only on Jeju.
I guess they opened one here.

1177
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,620
<i>We all have that one question</i>
<i>we don't want to be asked.</i>

1178
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:03,460
<i>Does choosing not to ask it</i>
<i>count as being deceitful?</i>

1179
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,520
Ho-su.

1180
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,540
You two got guts. I'll give you that.

1181
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,210
Is everything okay with Mi-ji?

1182
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,090
Let's hope so.

1183
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:53,260
Are you going to tell anyone?

1184
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,970
Who would I tell?

1185
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,850
Should I go tattle to your mom?

1186
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,730
Things like this
are just meant to stay secret.

1187
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,350
So stop talking nonsense.

1188
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,480
If you're going to do it, do it right.

1189
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,650
Your mom thinks you're Mi-ji,
and she's really worried sick.

1190
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,450
You should go out more.

1191
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:13,990
Why did you suddenly quit
the strawberry farm?

1192
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,740
Did he…

1193
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,740
hire someone new?

1194
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:20,870
How would I know?

1195
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,370
He didn't say anything.

1196
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:26,340
Why? Do you regret it now?
Hard to let go of that daily pay?

1197
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,840
Maybe.

1198
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,390
Where do you want to go?

1199
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,850
Do you want to go home,

1200
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:38,470
or check out some other place
since we're in Seoul?

1201
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,400
I don't really have anywhere to go.

1202
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,910
Why are you limping? Did you get hurt?

1203
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,790
I ran and twisted my ankle earlier.

1204
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,000
It's fine.

1205
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,040
Get on my back.

1206
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,250
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

1207
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,800
- It's okay. Let me.
- Seriously, I'm fine.

1208
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,800
What? Are you afraid?
That I'll break my leg carrying you?

1209
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:18,600
No, it's not that…

1210
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,810
I've been in physical therapy
for 15 years. I can handle it.

1211
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,520
My leg is in better shape
than your ankle right now.

1212
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:27,860
Hop on.

1213
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,150
Come on.

1214
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,710
Why did you act like you didn't know?

1215
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:48,790
About what?

1216
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,000
Gyeong-gu.

1217
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,260
You knew all along, right?

1218
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,890
If you knew Mi-ji and Gyeong-gu
weren't a thing, why haven't you…

1219
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:00,220
I'm a bit shady, you know.

1220
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,720
Come on, don't say that.

1221
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,890
It's not like I know everything.

1222
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,600
Just because
I found out something by chance

1223
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:10,900
doesn't mean I know
what's between those two.

1224
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,820
Don't you ever feel it's unfair?

1225
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,610
You keep secrets that aren't even yours,

1226
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,870
and in return, you miss out,
lose out, and get misunderstood.

1227
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,330
You do so much for others,

1228
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,870
and all you get in return
is being called "shady."

1229
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,460
I don't do it for others.

1230
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,840
I can't comfort people
or fix their problems.

1231
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,090
But…

1232
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,340
I can keep a secret.

1233
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,890
You're such a fool.

1234
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:46,060
Anyway, what was it
you wanted to tell me earlier?

1235
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,640
Oh, that…

1236
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:54,480
I was actually planning
to tell you next week,

1237
01:14:55,530 --> 01:15:00,110
but it's not just about me,
so it's a bit tricky.

1238
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,580
Still, I thought I should tell you…

1239
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,120
Just tell me later.

1240
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,040
What?

1241
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,620
Whatever it is,

1242
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,840
tell me when you feel comfortable talking.

1243
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,220
<i>Just like the moon that follows me</i>

1244
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,430
<i>without ever being noticed,</i>

1245
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,850
<i>this fool has been silently waiting,</i>

1246
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,020
<i>for who knows how long.</i>

1247
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,320
<i>I liked Ho-su</i>
<i>and this foolish side of him…</i>

1248
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,320
<i>and I still do.</i>

1249
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,350
Gosh, please!

1250
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,910
Fuck, stop already!

1251
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,530
There's nothing left now!

1252
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,000
What are you doing here?

1253
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:50,850
Grandpa?

1254
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,070
Get up.

1255
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,700
How did you…

1256
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,370
We can talk later.

1257
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,830
Get up now.

1258
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:15,420
CHANGHWA FARM

1259
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:26,010
You showed up like a superhero,
so I figured you'd know what to do.

1260
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,890
But you're just as lost.

1261
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,390
Jeez. I came to help, you know.

1262
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:32,770
Sorry.

1263
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,890
I'm thankful, really.

1264
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,770
But now what?
The roads are flooded. You can't go home.

1265
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,820
I'll sleep over here tonight, so you can…

1266
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,370
That was scary.

1267
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,380
Seriously? A blackout?

1268
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,880
Did you call home?

1269
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,390
I already told Mom
I wouldn't be home tonight.

1270
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:15,940
I wasn't planning to come here, though.

1271
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,310
This is only going to fuel the rumors.

1272
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,320
We're screwed.

1273
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:28,450
Seriously, why did you come?

1274
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,200
My friend said he could take me
anywhere I wanted,

1275
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,500
but this was the only place
I could think of.

1276
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,040
Why?

1277
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,500
Because what's out there is fake,

1278
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,920
and this place is real.

1279
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,090
At least to me.

1280
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,470
Then why do you hate the rumors so much?

1281
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,060
There's no reason to like them.

1282
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,520
I like them.

1283
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,440
The rumors about us.

1284
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,480
YU MI-JI

1285
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,270
Do you even know
what Mi-rae's going through at work?

1286
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,570
<i>Use it to help the people</i>
<i>who are important to you.</i>

1287
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:49,110
There's even a novel based
on the public takeover bid for Hyudi Bio.

1288
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:51,530
<i>So you're not quiet.</i>
<i>You just chose not to talk.</i>

1289
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:54,030
- Ever considered working in finance?
- What?

1290
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,990
- Ms. Seoul?
- That 200,000 won-a-day job?

1291
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,540
Since we've run into each other,
let's go eat together.

1292
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,910
<i>Mi-rae didn't tell you about the rumors?</i>

1293
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,170
<i>She threw a fit at Mi-rae</i>
<i>in the company lobby.</i>

1294
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,750
Why are you still here?

1295
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,920
That's disappointing.

1296
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,050
I haven't gone a day
without thinking about you, Ms. Yu.

1297
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,640
