1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
With you I am starting over, we're learning to walk again

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From the first page, we were together

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My heart is beating so fast

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a twin

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
While the twin's pregnant mother fell in love with him

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Her father decided to name us by looking at two stars

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Miji and Mire

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mire was originally going to name the first one Miji and the second one Mire

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mire was more likely to be the future

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mire was the mother's birthplace

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's going on with us?

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's just me, I'm just doing what I have to do

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We were both like a couple

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My mother was also like a mother, so she said everything

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There were two people who recognized us at once

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Miji, I'll give you a break

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My father who passed away

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's hard to see his face because of work

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Like a mother, since when and always

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We were together all day

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's why we were the closest friends

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We were always together

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We were always together

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We were all quite excited

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Another one, my grandmother who I love the most in the world

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We were both elementary school students

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We were still the same, but our age changed

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Mire had four pills a day when she was in her fourth year of school

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was healthy even after I got black

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I became a fourth year's student and became a couple

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mire didn't want to study, and I didn't want to study

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Miji is good at studying, and Mire is good at studying

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's how our secret promise began

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We gave each other something hard to do when we put our fingers together

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why didn't I think about it?

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We, who were addicted to this perfect cheat,

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We broke the 단소� instead of the word

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We also delivered the iron ball instead

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We really put our fingers together every day

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sometimes there were things we couldn't do

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mire

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In the end, Mire got caught

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Our secret promise ended

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought we'd be back like before if we had long hair

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But we started to change without being able to catch the other

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mire won first place as if she was eating

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Mire, you're cool!

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll stop here for the class

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll have a good meal

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was just a kid who ate on the first floor of the school

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
One day when I went to eat on the first floor,

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My life changed

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I only heard the sound of not running for the rest of my life

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But suddenly, I thought I had to run

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I ran

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But I got the award I didn't get even the comedian award

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I got a lot

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One time, I first left the school

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Who's been addicted to music

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It was Hawk

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
양

63
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,000
am

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
но

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
runs

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Only it

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,660
That moment, where the future crunched to his nose

68
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,680
Yeah baby Yeah no way

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:06:05,960
That fancy

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
I am in charge of the winning field.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,380
What exactly does this mean?

72
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,800
The concept of the team of the Sóngmán game with the team.

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,620
is an older player.

74
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,200
They actually played players

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,980
with three As你想.

76
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
They had ред to me famously.

77
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
I was produce.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,940
You.

79
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,580
Did not stomach the utilization.

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,500
No, it was paining.

81
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,600
Because you called.

82
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Wake up.

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I don't know how old you are, but I don't know how to wake up.

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I just don't know how to wake up.

86
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm sure you woke up.

88
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Let's go.

89
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,600
It's over yesterday and tomorrow is far away, and I don't know today.

90
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Let's go.

91

How have you been?

It's me.

376
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,600
That's why I'm asking you to come.

377
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
What?

378
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:02,600
No, you've been asking me to come from yesterday.

379
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:08,600
I was in a bad mood last time.

380
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,600
I was a little tired.

381
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,600
Do you know what happened?

382
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,600
I'm so busy.

383
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,600
I'm tired and tired of working at the duty free.

384
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,600
Why do you ask me if you're worried?

385
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,600
He ran away as soon as I saw him.

386
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
He ran away?

387
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,600
Did he go to the duty free?

388
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,600
I'm jealous of him being weak.

389
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,600
Call me if you want.

390
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,600
I called him today.

391
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,600
But he's my partner.

392
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,600
You saw him, right?

393
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,600
I've been looking at you for over a year.

394
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:04,600
We're not as good as we used to be.

395
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:14,600
There's a story about your grandmother.

396
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:22,600
When you were young, your family went back to the hospital.

397
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:28,600
I heard that you've been waiting for you the most.

398
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Me?

399
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Why?

400
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,600
I guess it's comfortable.

401
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:42,600
Because I can see you weak in front of you.

402
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,600
Miri, are you sick again?

403
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:54,600
I don't know what to say.

404
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,600
I don't know.

405
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,600
I don't know.

406
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:12,600
I don't know.

407
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,600
I'm going to let you go.

408
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:28,600
You let me go, too.

409
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:52,600
We're the closest friends, even if we're high and low.

410
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:22,600
I'm going to kill you.

411
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Miri, the meeting is over.

412
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,600
Where are you?

413
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,600
You're going home soon, right?

414
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Did you eat? Let's go out first.

415
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,600
It's okay, right?

416
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,600
You can go to the waiting room at 1 o'clock on weekends.

417
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
Have you tried the splat can cake?

418
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
It's famous here.

419
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,600
Do you want something more?

420
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Calm down. I can't eat money.

421
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Then eat it and leave it. I'll order it myself.

422
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:24,600
I met you last time and you looked tired.

423
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,600
Hey, isn't this seat too long?

424
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,600
It's not because of me.

425
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,600
It's over without you today.

426
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:40,600
I'm sorry.

427
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,600
What should I do with the gift?

428
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Do you want to come out first?

429
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
I'm sorry.

430
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,600
It's good to be home.

431
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Hey, what do you bring when you're sick?

432
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,600
Why? All the employees are jealous?

433
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,600
Everyone imagines.

434
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,600
I'm not going to work because I'm a little drunk on the bus or to the company.

435
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Hey, why are you thinking about that?

436
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,600
And what's the problem with the bus?

437
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,600
I can't just put on a mask.

438
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,600
So I thought about it.

439
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,600
I think it's best to fall off at the right height.

440
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,600
There's no big difference in life and the other person doesn't have a mask.

441
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,600
But I think it's a little lower.

442
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,600
I think it's about three floors.

443
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,600
If you put a cushion on your mouth in advance,

444
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,600
It's better to put it on your mouth and then fall off.

445
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,600
Hey, is that a psycho test?

446
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,600
The calculation is really perfect.

447
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,600
Hey, what should I do with this?

448
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
I'm on vacation.

449
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Don't think about running.

450
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,600
Not on vacation.

451
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,600
How about just playing around?

452
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,600
Good. Just hit it.

453
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,600
Let's just have a good time together.

454
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
Let's have a good time together.

455
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:04,600
Hey, are you serious?

456
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,600
Hey, how did you get in there?

457
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,600
What's wrong with you?

458
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,600
You can just move to a better place.

459
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Where's a better place?

460
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,600
Through the high-end of the cotton swab.

461
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,600
No way.

462
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:26,600
In the 90s again?

463
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,600
No, it's too thick.

464
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,600
Hey, then why don't you take a break?

465
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,600
Is that meaningful?

466
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
It's the same when you come back anyway.

467
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,600
But if you take a break, your heart changes.

468
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,600
What are the workers doing these days?

469
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
I'm coming every one of them.

470
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
First of all, take a break.

471
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,600
You'll be okay if you take a break.

472
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,600
If you're not okay, do you live because you're okay?

473
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,600
You just have to endure even if you're not okay.

474
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,600
Hey, just think about your mom and go.

475
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,600
I put your clothes in the closet when you quit.

476
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,600
If you quit this job, you're going to be a loser.

477
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,600
Hey, can I just leave you alone?

478
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,600
I want to live like you.

479
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,600
There's no sound from the water.

480
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:36,600
I'm serious.

481
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:46,600
It doesn't look like it's hard to look weird.

482
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,600
Boss, where did you go before you sat here?

483
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,600
I went to the bank first.

484
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,600
What?

485
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,600
What are you talking about?

486
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,600
Are you kidding me?

487
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,600
I don't know. I'll live with you.

488
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Are you kidding me?

489
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,600
Yes.

490
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,600
You didn't go to work today.

491
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,600
What? No, I was working until before.

492
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,600
Is this the plan?

493
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,600
Yes.

494
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
You said you didn't come out today.

495
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
It's a paid job.

496
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:56,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

497
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,600
I thought about it, but I think it's best to drop it at the right height.

498
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,600
There's no big difference in the side view, and no one's wearing a mask.

499
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,600
I think the second floor is a bit low, and the third floor is a bit low.

500
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:32,600
If you put a blanket in the cushion, it's good to put it in the right place.

501
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,600
I'm going to come here one by one.

502
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,600
I'll be fine if I rest a bit.

503
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
If you don't mind.

504
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

505
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

506
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:10,600
Hey, Yui!

507
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Yui, stop!

508
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:42,600
Yui!

509
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,600
Yui, are you okay?

510
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,600
Yui!

511
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,600
Are you crazy?

512
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,600
Did you really want to die?

513
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,600
I'm so stupid.

514
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,600
Who's going to die?

515
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,600
I calculated everything, so why are you so scared?

516
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Calculation?

517
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,600
Hey, are you going to pay for this?

518
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Why are you calculating later?

519
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,600
Hey, you're so scared at the height.

520
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Why are you thinking about running away?

521
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,600
I said, hold it in.

522
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,600
I said you're going to hold it in.

523
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,600
I'm trying to hold it in.

524
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Hey, don't you think I'm saying that I'm going to die?

525
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,600
I almost died.

526
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,600
I almost died.

527
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
I almost died.

528
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,600
You're stupid.

529
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
You should have your hands off if you knew that.

530
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Why are you falling off together?

531
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,600
How can I do that?

532
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,600
How can I do that?

533
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,600
I'm dying.

534
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,600
I'm dying.

535
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:22,600
What do I do with my life?

536
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
What do I do with my life?

537
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:31,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

538
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Oh, over there.

539
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,600
Oh, I took it early.

540
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,600
Oh, here.

541
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,600
I ordered a desk here.

542
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,600
Oh, it's done.

543
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:15,600
This is also the first delivery service, but I can't even enter the desk.

544
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,600
I'm Kim Soohyun.

545
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:23,600
The future senior is a lot different from the future.

546
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,600
When everyone can't see it, there's no way to just pass it.

547
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,600
What did you buy today?

548
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,600
A trash bag full of trash.

549
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:02,600
You're talking trash about me.

550
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,600
There's a lot left.

551
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,600
I'll help you with this.

552
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
No, go home first.

553
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
There's a senior who says he'll come when I'm like this.

554
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
You have to do this when you get a chance later in the future.

555
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,600
A good person who is warm and warm.

556
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:21,600
I thought the future was the first thing that came to this company because of that senior.

557
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,600
And how much...

558
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,600
Did you write it down as a evaluation?

559
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,600
Do you think it's too much?

560
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,600
I don't know the principle.

561
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,600
Who doesn't know the principle because it's a back-up?

562
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,600
Again.

563
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:56,600
The senior who was the most difficult to pretend he didn't know and pretend he didn't see was a burden of pain because he couldn't just pass the negative emotions of the situation that everyone was thinking about.

564
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,600
I'm sorry.

565
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,600
I'm sorry.

566
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,600
I'm sorry.

567
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,600
I'm sorry.

568
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,600
I'm sorry.

569
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,600
I'm sorry.

570
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
I'm sorry.

571
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,600
I'm sorry.

572
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,600
I'm sorry.

573
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
Let's go eat lunch.

574
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,600
Let's go eat.

575
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,600
Yes.

576
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,600
Miri.

577
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,600
What are you doing?

578
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
Let's go.

579
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,600
The more I went, the more painful and painful it was.

580
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,600
The senior became the transparent person of the department.

581
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:43,600
The future that I was not brave enough to endure couldn't let go of my hand.

582
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:53,600
How can you do that?

583
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
I'm sorry.

584
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
I'm sorry.

585
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,600
I thought I'd make an accident.

586
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:07,600
The senior finally heard the news that he had a secret of the accident.

587
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,600
Miri said that her pocket was in her hands.

588
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,600
I didn't know how to just pass it, so I always had a pocket full of trash.

589
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:26,600
I kept thinking about that small and shallow pocket, and Miri threw a trash can for the first time in my life.

590
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:41,600
It's all true.

591
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:56,600
I thought we'd fight together, but the senior quit before the end of the high-end.

592
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,600
The senior left, and he became the future teacher.

593
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Thank you.

594
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,600
Yes.

595
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,600
You're not going to give me a pocket?

596
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,600
I'm sorry.

597
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,600
How about the senior?

598
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
I'm sorry.

599
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
I'm sorry.

600
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,600
I'm sorry.

601
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,600
I'm sorry.

602
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,600
I'm sorry.

603
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I'm sorry.

604
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,600
I'm sorry.

605
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,600
I'm sorry.

606
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,600
I'm sorry.

607
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,600
I'm sorry.

608
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
I'm sorry.

609
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,600
Why haven't you said anything?

610
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,600
I don't know why it's not a problem.

611
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Actually, I woke up in the morning, but I couldn't go to the company today.

612
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:14,600
So I was burdened, and I was lying down all day and running to the company with your phone.

613
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:21,600
But a while ago, there were people at the cafe in the bathroom.

614
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,600
I don't even remember how far I went.

615
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,600
I ran away as soon as I saw my face.

616
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:39,600
But when I came home, I remember my death tomorrow.

617
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,600
That's why it's like that.

618
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,600
It's not because of the flower.

619
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:52,600
So did you get into a relationship because you said that word to the company?

620
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,600
I hate people, but there's no reason.

621
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,600
Have you talked to the company?

622
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,600
You said there are a lot of people who get into trouble these days.

623
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,600
It's so strange.

624
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,600
There's no way to prove it.

625
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,600
There's no one to trust.

626
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,600
You're going to get into trouble right away.

627
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,600
If you don't use it, I'm going to give you a chance.

628
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,600
It's not that simple.

629
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,600
I got a loan from the company.

630
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,600
If you lose money, you have to do this.

631
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
Tell your mom.

632
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,600
And why did you come to my house in the first place?

633
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,600
It's the first place I've been sick.

634
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,600
Anyway, it's a big move.

635
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,600
Why do you hold it back?

636
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,600
It's a mess in the same hell as holding it back.

637
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,600
Hey, move.

638
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,600
You have a lot of time to go.

639
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,600
It's hard to move the public business.

640
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
It's not easy to get a profit.

641
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,600
I have to start over from the preparation for the company.

642
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,600
You can start over.

643
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,600
I'll help you until you get a job.

644
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,600
You're going to go out and start over?

645
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,600
I think that's more hell.

646
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,600
Then what are you going to do?

647
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,600
I can't do this job, I can't even get a job.

648
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,600
But you can't hold it back.

649
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Hey, you don't have to do it.

650
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Just think about yourself.

651
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,600
What do you want to do?

652
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,600
I don't know.

653
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,600
What?

654
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,600
I don't know.

655
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Me too.

656
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,600
I don't know.

657
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:42,600
I don't know either.

658
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Hey.

659
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:02,600
Are you really okay?

660
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,600
I'm okay.

661
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,600
I'm the only one strong.

662
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,600
Then you're really okay alone.

663
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,600
I'm the only one who's holding it back.

664
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Hey, it's a joke.

665
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,600
It's okay to talk to you.

666
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,600
I'll be fine when I decide.

667
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:36,600
I'm just going.

668
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,600
I'm comfortable being alone.

669
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:45,600
I'm on the bus.

670
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Call me when you get home.

671
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Okay.

672
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:08,600
That's why people are important names.

673
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,600
If you don't know this guy, my life will be in trouble.

674
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:23,600
Hey, pass, pass.

675
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:33,600
Hey, I'm sorry, but why are you so mean?

676
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:43,600
Hey.

677
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:53,600
Look, even that back side is interpreted.

678
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
He's good at interpretation.

679
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
He's better than me.

680
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,600
You're making a mistake.

681
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
What are you doing?

682
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,600
How do you make a mistake?

683
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,600
Oh, my hands are fast.

684
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,600
If you go there, I'll be in trouble.

685
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:38,600
That's why this is all because of my name.

686
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Don't touch me and hold me.

687
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,600
You?

688
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,600
I'll give you a replacement.

689
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,600
Go to sleep.

690
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,600
What?

691
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,600
I'll live with you.

692
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:09,600
You live with me.

693
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,600
Hey, baby.

694
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,600
We're on the train.

695
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,600
The pain that hurt today.

696
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:39,600
The broken-up steps.

697
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,600
When do you want to go?

698
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,600
I'm going to disappear.

699
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,600
Remember, we look in the same room.

700
01:18:50,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Don't use your hands to hide your tired shoulders.

701
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,600
Don't let go of my hand.

702
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,600
Come to the strawberry mart until 2 o'clock.

703
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,600
Hello.

704
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
Did you get a ticket to the crazy man's store?

705
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,600
What?

706
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,600
Keep your promise.

707
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Don't be me and just fill the seat.

708
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Isn't that just me today?

709
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,600
I'm a college student who gets a scholarship for competition.

710
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,600
What's your decision?

711
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
Lee Ho-soo?

712
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,600
Don't lie.

713
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,600
What if I tell you I met you?

714
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
Why?

715
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,600
It's a dream.

716
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Why don't you take the phone?

717
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

718
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

719
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

720
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

721
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

722
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

723
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

724
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

725
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

726
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

727
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

728
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

729
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,600
I'm going to the supermarket.

730
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,600
I'm going to the supermarket.
