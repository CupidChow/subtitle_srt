OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,840
When Mi-ji's dream
was to own a stationery store,

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,800
mine was to become a tree.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,600
- Hello.
Hi.

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,270
The nurse is here.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,060
- Time for her shot.
Okay.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,650
She's getting the shot…

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,230
Yes.
…on her left arm, right?

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
If I were a tree, needles wouldn't hurt.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,030
Why did I have to be sick…

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,700
Her veins…
…making everyone suffer…

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,080
Stop poking around and do it right.
…feel sad and get mad?

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,580
Mi-rae, are you okay? You did great.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,080
You're okay, right?
That's when I started

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,130
pretending to be a tree…

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,290
Just a little pinch.
…quietly enduring everything.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,630
I couldn't do anything about the pain,

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,840
but I could choose not to cry.

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,760
And with that,
we hereby present this award.

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,450
I may not have stood out,

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,370
but I knew how to endure.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,170
Seriously? A blackout?

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,000
Did you call home?

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,540
I already told Mom
I wouldn't be home tonight.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,170
I wasn't planning to come here, though.

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,590
This is only going to fuel the rumors.

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,430
We're screwed.

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,470
Jeez.

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,690
Seriously, why did you come?

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,110
My friend said he could take me
anywhere I wanted,

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,610
but this was the only place
I could think of.

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,400
Why?

33
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,490
Because what's out there is fake,

34
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,030
and this place is real.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,040
At least to me.

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,870
Then why do you hate the rumors so much?

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,460
There's no reason to like them.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,010
I like them.

39
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,680
The rumors about us.

40
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,820
If you're hungry or cold, just say so.

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,650
Why don't you ever say anything?

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,320
How can you say nothing

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,660
until your stomach
is growling like thunder?

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,540
Noodles first?

45
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,960
Or the seasoning?

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,670
That is the question.

47
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,710
For the record, I'm team seasoning.

48
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,340
You have to put the toppings in first

49
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,090
so the veggie flavors really seep in.

50
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,180
They say you can put the noodles in
before the water boils.

51
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,640
But dropping the noodles into cold water
just doesn't sit right with me.

52
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,770
Your name is Han Se-jin?

53
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,350
You didn't even know my name?

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Wait!

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,690
I didn't collect those.
That was all my grandfather…

56
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,690
You're the Han Se-jin
from Ihan Asset Management?

57
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,320
How do you know me?

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,410
Are you into stocks?

59
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,410
There's even a novel based
on the public takeover bid for Hyudi Bio.

60
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,040
And Yeongmin Steel?
You persuaded the minority shareholders

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,660
and took over the company
with just a one percent margin.

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,170
If that happened in a TV show,
people would say it's too far-fetched…

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,760
What?

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,630
So you're not quiet.
You just chose not to talk.

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,630
How did you stay so quiet until now?

66
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,100
I like this version of you.

67
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,220
Don't stop now. Tell me more.

68
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,810
Never mind.

69
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,190
From the sound of it,

70
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,480
you're more interested
in activist funds than me.

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,440
"Interested" is an understatement.
My thesis was on shareholder activism--

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,650
High school seniors
write thesis papers these days?

73
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,240
No…

74
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,400
I read about it.

75
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,820
There were a lot of papers on that topic.

76
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,620
If you're reading academic papers,
this isn't just a casual interest.

77
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,330
But how can you know my whole background
and still not recognize my face?

78
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,540
I just never imagined
you'd be here running a farm.

79
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,670
Then what did you imagine?

80
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,300
What was the most popular theory? Russia?

81
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,380
That you were tied to the Russian Mafia.

82
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,810
That you had gambling debts in Macau,
or even that you embezzled 50 billion won.

83
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,480
But I never believed any of it.
It all sounded like nonsense.

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
Impressive.

85
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,100
But you skipped the
"betrayed by a business partner" rumor.

86
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,560
Did you believe that one?

87
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,360
It's all just gossip.

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,240
Mr. Lee, the CEO, wasn't that bad.

89
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,070
Then again,

90
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
he wasn't exactly the type
to brave a typhoon for a partner.

91
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,990
Jeez.

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Seriously though, why did you quit?

93
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,170
You disappeared overnight.

94
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,960
Do you want to know?

95
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,470
I'll tell you the day after tomorrow.

96
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,310
Gosh, why the day after tomorrow
and not tomorrow?

97
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,430
That just seems like the right time.

98
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,400
But now that we're talking,
I've got a question too.

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,360
What are you doing here?

100
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,320
For someone this quiet
to go on and on like that,

101
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,660
you must clearly love this stuff.

102
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,290
Ever considered working in finance?

103
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,910
I…
For now,

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,080
forget about your educational background
or qualifications.

105
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,750
I want to know how you really feel.

106
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,750
Well,

107
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,510
just because you like something
doesn't mean you can do it.

108
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,220
Why not?

109
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,260
Every family has its own issues,

110
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,350
and mine is no different.
I can't just think about myself.

111
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,560
Why not?
What do you mean?

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,690
My family has sacrificed so much for me.

113
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,310
How could I just do whatever I want?

114
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,690
Honestly, everything you're saying

115
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,740
is no different
from the Russian Mafia rumors.

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
What?

117
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,200
Those are not the real reasons.

118
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,660
I want to know the real one.

119
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,670
EPISODE 7
A CHILD UNDERNEATH IT ALL

120
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,350
KOREA FINANCE MANAGEMENT CORPORATION

121
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,400
You're on your way, right?
It's the same meeting room as before.

122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,730
YU MI-RAE

123
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,270
I'm almost there.

124
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,740
You want me to decline, no matter what?

125
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,160
Next time you go to the office,

126
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,660
just tell them I'm not selling.

127
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,450
But we gained the upper hand
in the last meeting.

128
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,170
I can negotiate any terms you want.

129
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,880
I don't want anything.

130
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,550
Just wrap it up neatly
so nothing else comes up.

131
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,590
And so your friend gets in less trouble.

132
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,510
Come on in.

133
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,520
He's here.

134
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,610
I was wondering
which law firm you ended up at.

135
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,370
If I'd known you opened your own,
I would've at least sent flowers.

136
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,080
Let's just say you did.

137
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,790
You came all this way to see me
for such a minor case.

138
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,340
It's funny how people cross paths.

139
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:54,300
Just like unpaid bills,
some people are impossible to avoid.

140
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,390
I heard you were one
of Kim Ro-sa's scholarship students.

141
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,220
Did you take this case to repay her?

142
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Or…

143
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,520
is it out of guilt for an old classmate?

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,980
WHISTLEBLOWER INVESTIGATION REPORT

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,820
She already knows everything.

146
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,700
But she doesn't know
you're the one who made me

147
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,410
the external investigator for the case.

148
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,580
Ms. Yu Mi-rae must be important to you

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,580
if you told her all that.

150
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,870
Let us get to the point.

151
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,590
My client is not interested
in selling the Rosa Restaurant.

152
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,010
I'm here today
to officially decline the offer.

153
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,470
You're turning it down flat,
without even negotiating. Why?

154
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,010
The landowner does not want to sell.

155
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,390
Do you need any other reason?

156
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,020
So you don't know either.

157
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,230
Excuse me?

158
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,990
There's always a reason
behind an unreasonable choice.

159
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,030
If you do not know what it is,

160
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,740
it means you either didn't care to ask,

161
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,460
or you're not trusted enough to be told.

162
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,040
It's one or the other.

163
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,130
Ho-su.

164
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,510
That's your problem.

165
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,720
You never cross the line,
all for your stubborn integrity.

166
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
You know what's going on
but remain silent.

167
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,140
That's not being considerate.

168
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,640
That's neglect.

169
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,440
You came here
just to say she's not selling?

170
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,820
That doesn't help Ms. Kim Ro-sa
or Ms. Yu one bit.

171
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,030
If anything, I'm the one helping them.

172
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,320
You are not helping. You are using them.

173
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
For your own benefit.

174
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,870
Do you even know
what Mi-rae's going through at work?

175
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,040
I do.

176
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,050
And I am trying to fix it.

177
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,670
Call it whatever you want,

178
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,760
but I am trying
to tip the scales in her favor.

179
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,930
You are the one

180
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,600
ruining that right now.

181
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,970
Sir.
So I'm telling you

182
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,350
to cross the line.

183
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,600
Don't just stand by.

184
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,060
Ask why and persuade her.

185
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,770
I'm giving you a chance.

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,990
Use it to help the people
who are important to you.

187
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
A chance?

188
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,570
She'll sell in the end.

189
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,620
You know me.

190
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,080
If I want something, I get it.

191
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,710
Hey, are you done already?

192
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,630
Figure out how you can help everyone.

193
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,970
Think hard.

194
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,440
Did he always look like this?

195
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,190
His lashes are pretty long.

196
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,230
Did he shape his brows?

197
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,320
And it looks like
he put something on his lips.

198
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,370
What?
Nothing.

199
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,620
Hey.

200
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,080
Are you busy next week?

201
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,880
Next week?

202
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Why?

203
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,760
I was thinking
of getting you and Mi-ji together.

204
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,640
What?

205
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,260
It's just that…

206
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,270
she said she'd be in Seoul
sometime next week.

207
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,650
You said she's your first love.
You two should really talk.

208
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,020
She didn't go into details,

209
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,820
but apparently,
she has something to say to you.

210
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,200
Well…

211
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,820
Then just pick a time that works for her.

212
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,450
Cool.

213
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,910
Seriously,
what would you two do without me?

214
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,720
Hey…

215
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,390
You don't have to walk me out.

216
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,470
I'm going out for lunch.

217
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,930
Do you want to join me?

218
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,230
I have to meet someone today.

219
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,820
All right. Go ahead then.

220
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,110
Hey…

221
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,280
Let me know

222
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,450
when you

223
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,200
set something up with Mi-ji.

224
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,080
Sure.

225
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,750
See you.

226
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,350
PARK JI-YUN

227
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,600
Let's talk. We have things to discuss.

228
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,270
What does she need to talk about?

229
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,570
Is it about Ho-su?

230
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,710
Why are you still here?

231
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,840
I'm just waiting for someone.

232
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,800
Is this seat taken?

233
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,590
Now you're mocking me.

234
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,970
Right.

235
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,850
I guess you'd have to be that shameless
to keep showing up at work.

236
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,600
Excuse me. Who are you to--

237
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,360
That's disappointing.

238
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,190
I haven't gone a day
without thinking about you, Ms. Yu.

239
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,780
It's me.

240
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,530
Park Sang-yeong's wife.

241
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,620
Now you remember?

242
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,170
Don't you remember
what I told you, though?

243
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,090
If you had any decency,

244
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,590
you should've disappeared
before he came back.

245
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,260
Wasn't everything
humiliating enough for you?

246
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,470
What are you talking about--

247
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,590
Excuse me.

248
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,220
What the heck are you doing?
She's my friend.

249
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,020
Stay out of this.

250
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,640
This is between me and Ms. Yu Mi-rae.

251
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,650
Then go talk to Yu Mi-rae.

252
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,440
Why the hell are you taking it out
on the wrong person?

253
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,900
What?

254
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,070
She isn't Yu Mi-rae.

255
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,580
What… are you talking about…

256
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,040
If you've got the wrong person,
shouldn't you apologize first?

257
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,040
You're a new level of crazy.

258
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,290
Mi-ji, let's go.

259
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,210
What?

260
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,010
Why did you just sit there and take it?

261
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,720
Are you copying Mi-rae even on that?

262
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,640
Ji-yun, how did you…

263
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,270
Gosh, how do you think?

264
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,150
You always froze up
whenever I mentioned KFMC.

265
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,980
So I tested you.

266
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,650
Would you have applied there
if I hadn't pushed you to?

267
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,160
Honestly?

268
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,320
You're right.

269
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,290
Why would I encourage Mi-rae to apply
to the place I was dying to get into?

270
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,620
And she's not the kind to do something
just because I told her to.

271
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,590
That's what gave it away?

272
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,340
What really confirmed it

273
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,090
was what you said after.

274
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,050
What did I say?

275
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,970
That I sounded very mature

276
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,010
and you liked how honest I was.

277
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,680
That's the kind of thing you'd say, Mi-ji.

278
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,230
That's when I knew it was you.

279
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,900
At least,

280
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,570
I got to see you again.

281
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,950
I always wondered how you were doing.

282
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,830
But I didn't reach out
since you didn't like me.

283
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,660
Why would I not like you?

284
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,290
Don't play dumb.

285
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,500
You totally avoided me back then.

286
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,790
I just thought

287
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,750
you were disappointed in me.

288
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,840
Hey.

289
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,590
I am your number one fan.

290
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,260
Why would I ever be disappointed?

291
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,010
That doesn't even make sense.

292
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,110
So what was it
you wanted to talk about today?

293
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,940
Forget it.

294
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,450
I was pissed you stole Ho-su,
so I thought I'd make a scene.

295
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,660
But then I ended up arguing
with some random person instead.

296
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,790
Have you told Ho-su?

297
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,540
Does he know?

298
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,790
I don't know.

299
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,540
Maybe he does.

300
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,790
Maybe he doesn't.

301
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,340
So does he or doesn't he?

302
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,550
I'm not helping you with that.

303
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,300
Ask him yourself.

304
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,810
But seriously,
why didn't you say anything earlier?

305
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,980
I thought you'd at least
grab her hair or something.

306
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,480
You know her?

307
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,900
Do you know anything about her?

308
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,110
You really don't know?

309
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,900
Mi-rae didn't tell you about the rumors?

310
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,280
What rumors?

311
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,120
There were rumors about
Mi-rae having an affair with her boss.

312
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,460
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

313
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,080
That woman was his wife.

314
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,790
She threw a fit at Mi-rae
in the company lobby,

315
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,920
so the rumors spread.

316
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,920
Hey, don't you know her?

317
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,630
She's a total stickler
when it comes to stuff like that.

318
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
An affair? With a married man?

319
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,640
Are you crazy?
She has no reason to stoop to that.

320
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,930
I didn't believe it at first, either.

321
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,690
But then people from KFMC
started commenting online,

322
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,190
and photos of her were spreading around.

323
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,270
I mean…

324
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,780
no one knows the full story.

325
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,360
She would never.

326
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,110
I can't believe you bought that.

327
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,120
Regardless of whether it's true or not,
it was a huge deal.

328
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,370
I saw the rumors
on the KFMC job prep forums.

329
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,790
Imagine what it was like at her office.

330
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,670
I'll send you the link. See for yourself.

331
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,210
Mi-rae, seriously…

332
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,090
Why didn't you tell me about any of this?

333
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,060
Were you home?

334
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,390
When did you get back? I didn't hear you.

335
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,180
I got back at the crack of dawn.

336
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,730
But why are you leaving for work now?

337
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,190
The school's temporarily closed.
They're doing typhoon recovery work.

338
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,860
It was chaos while you were in Seoul.

339
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,780
Power went out, bridges flooded…

340
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,740
Oh. Really?

341
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,490
Good thing Gyeong-gu got you to Seoul
before things got crazy.

342
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,830
It's been a while
since you went that far. Rest up.

343
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,910
I'm heading out.
Okay. Bye, Mom.

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,540
Okay, go get some rest.

345
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
All right.

346
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,000
Mi-ji.

347
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,670
Mi-ji!

348
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,050
What?

349
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,930
Here she comes. Come quickly!

350
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,060
Ho-su wants to talk to you.

351
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm leaving. You two have a chat.

352
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,480
See you, Ho-su.

353
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,520
Do you want something to drink?

354
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,610
Sure.

355
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,320
What did you need to talk about
that made you come all this way?

356
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,160
We never got to

357
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
talk properly.

358
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,330
Didn't you say
everything you wanted to last time?

359
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,340
Not to you.

360
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,460
Mi-rae.

361
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,180
Oh my. Hello.

362
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,690
Oh dear.

363
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,060
What a disaster.
It's a total mess.

364
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,570
The school's a wreck.

365
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,690
Hey, should I join you?

366
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,650
Actually, could you head up
to the second floor?

367
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,570
We need to mop up there.

368
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,570
Sure thing.

369
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,200
By the way…
What?

370
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,460
Your son's here.

371
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,170
Ho-su?

372
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,960
He didn't say he was coming.

373
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,130
Are you sure?

374
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,380
He came to my house.

375
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,630
He had something to discuss with Mi-ji.

376
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,510
What would my Ho-su
need to discuss with Mi-ji?

377
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,770
How should I know?
He's the one who came by.

378
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,520
Whatever it was, he looked so serious

379
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,190
that it made Mi-ji flustered.

380
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,560
Maybe there's something
going on between them

381
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,820
and you just don't know.

382
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,780
You might end up as in-laws.

383
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,780
Come on, in-laws?

384
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,450
They're not like that.

385
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,570
What a thing to say.

386
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,200
Why so serious over a joke?

387
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,910
You're making things awkward.

388
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,290
Come on.

389
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,000
Ho-su and Mi-ji are barely acquaintances.

390
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,210
What she said was nonsense.

391
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,880
Jeez.

392
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,970
Are you suggesting
that my daughter isn't good enough?

393
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,930
Hey.

394
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,260
I don't want a son-in-law
who has to be waited on hand and foot.

395
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,820
What was that supposed to mean?

396
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,150
You startled me.

397
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,110
What are you talking about?

398
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,830
"A son-in-law who has to be
waited on hand and foot."

399
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,660
What about it?

400
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,460
It means your son is successful.
You didn't mean that.

401
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,290
You were clearly referring
to his physical issues.

402
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,090
Goodness, what the heck?

403
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,500
Don't you get metaphors?

404
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,130
Why use that kind of metaphor?

405
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Do you think he's an invalid?

406
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,640
Or a patient?
What's with you?

407
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,890
He can't move?
Bun-hong.

408
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,140
Why would anyone need to wait on him?
For God's sake!

409
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,020
Did you just push me?

410
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,930
Apologize.

411
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,560
For what you said.

412
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,020
Goodness me.

413
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,230
I've got nothing to apologize for!

414
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,980
I didn't mean that.
Why are you making such a fuss?

415
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,360
Seriously. Move!

416
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,200
Do you have
a victim mentality or something?

417
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,700
Give me a break. Jeez.

418
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,920
Can we talk now?

419
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,550
Did Mi-ji tell you?

420
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,210
Are you two still meeting up?

421
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,430
If you're asking how I knew it was you,

422
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,180
I figured it out
after I saw you last time.

423
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,310
So you kept meeting up after all,

424
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,480
seeing how you didn't answer my question.

425
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,190
Does that…

426
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,150
matter to you?

427
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,190
Of course it does.

428
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,030
I told her to stop meeting you,

429
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,030
and Mi-ji promised she would.

430
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,200
So,

431
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,200
what did you want to talk about?

432
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,950
About Lead Specialist Park.

433
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,250
You filed a sexual harassment report
and then suddenly withdrew it.

434
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,630
Why?

435
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,460
That's over. What business is it of yours?

436
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,210
That's what I'm asking.
Did you do that because of me?

437
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,050
The day I came in
as an external investigator,

438
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,680
you disappeared as soon as you saw me,
and then you dropped the case.

439
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,890
I figured it was because of me,
but you ignored all my calls.

440
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,440
Now your twin is coming in
to work instead of you.

441
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,400
Is it really over?

442
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,900
Did you tell Mi-ji about this?

443
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,360
I thought she was you,
so I mentioned the case.

444
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,660
But Mi-ji seemed clueless,
and I didn't know much either.

445
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,700
So,

446
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,080
I came to ask you directly.

447
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,120
To see if I could help.

448
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,960
Help?

449
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,170
Who asked for your help?

450
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,130
It got complicated because of me.

451
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,800
Let me fix it.

452
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,430
What exactly happened
between you and Park Sang-yeong?

453
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,020
You're crossing a line.

454
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,820
I came to cross it.

455
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,460
MOM

456
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,670
MOM

457
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,880
SORRY I MADE YOU
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE

458
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,970
You accepted this project
knowing Mr. Park is in charge?

459
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,430
I made Mi-rae
look like a total psycho.

460
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,970
But why didn't she tell me anything?

461
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,060
She said she was standing up
for a senior who blew the whistle.

462
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,890
Then those jerks bullied you for a year

463
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,610
just because you said that
during the interview?

464
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,360
People don't need
a lot of reasons to hate someone.

465
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,650
Did you drop the case…

466
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,530
WHISTLEBLOWER INVESTIGATION REPORT

467
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,070
In cases like this,
when it's about sexual misconduct,

468
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,410
sometimes the victim drops the case

469
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,870
because they're worried
about rumors spreading.

470
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,790
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

471
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,420
If I tell you not to look,
just don't look.

472
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,760
We promised
not to interfere in each other's lives.

473
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,060
I'll hear it from her later.

474
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,390
MI-JI

475
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,860
Ms. Kim Ok-hui and Yeom Bun-hong.
That's us.

476
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,320
You both slipped on the stairs…

477
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,740
It was her. She pushed me.
…and showed signs of concussion.

478
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,070
She yanked my hair.
The stitches were done well.

479
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,830
The orthopedist will decide tomorrow
whether you need metal pins.

480
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,410
A semi-private room just opened up,

481
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,080
so we'll keep them for one night or two
and see how it goes.

482
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,170
Mi-ji, I can't share a room with her.

483
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,380
No way.
Mom, what happened?

484
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
How did you both fall down the stairs?

485
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,380
You know what? I shouldn't be here.

486
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,970
I should be at the police station.

487
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,300
Who grabs someone by the hair
on the stairs?

488
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,220
That's attempted murder!

489
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,510
Jeez.
Good God.

490
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,350
You're making a fuss over a few stitches?

491
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,810
I might get a pin put in here.
Whatever.

492
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,980
You can't blame me for your own fall.

493
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,520
It was self-defense for me!

494
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,860
I see. Should we sort it out legally?

495
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,900
"Sort it out legally"?

496
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,200
Ho-su.
Good. Tell us.

497
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,410
Let's ask your lawyer son
what the law says and settle this.

498
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,740
Please. Calm down, both of you.

499
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,290
Check the surveillance footage.

500
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,710
Your mom pushed me. You know how she is.

501
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,080
What?
What did you say?

502
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,960
You'll be punished for this, Bun-hong.

503
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,500
Mom, stop.
You little…

504
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm gonna win. You just watch.
Mom.

505
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,130
Look at all the hair…
Close the curtain. She's embarrassing.

506
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,090
…you pulled out!

507
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,600
Look, there's still hair
coming out of my head!

508
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,020
Jeez.

509
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,070
Did you call Mi-ji here?

510
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,690
Yes. Why?

511
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,570
Mi-ji doesn't know that I know.

512
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,030
So?
I know it's a weird thing to ask,

513
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,120
but can we pretend
that I don't know anything?

514
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,830
Please?
Hey.

515
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,160
Mi-rae!

516
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,670
Why did you ask me to come all of sudden?

517
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,180
And why are we in the hospital?

518
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,180
Mom got into a fight with Bun-hong
and got a little hurt.

519
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,970
She'll have to stay for a day or two.

520
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,680
What? Is that why Ho-su came down too?

521
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,100
She's asking why you're here.

522
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,400
I… just had something to take care of.

523
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I see.

524
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,360
You had something to take care of.

525
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,290
How did you…

526
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,000
I told you I'd be late today.

527
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,540
I heard your mother was hospitalized.

528
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,420
I always get concerned
about the health issues of elders.

529
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,010
Mom's fine, so you can…

530
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,470
What the…

531
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,050
Ms. Seoul?

532
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,140
You look exactly…

533
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,560
She looks exactly like you!

534
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,730
Who are you?

535
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,850
It's me, the strawberry farmer!

536
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,900
Wait. You didn't send the strawberries?

537
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,820
That 200,000-won gig?

538
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,030
So you've told her about me.

539
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,200
We've met before, right?
You were waiting outside the house.

540
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,580
Yes.

541
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,910
Hello.

542
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,750
You should go now.

543
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,040
Go where? I've got nowhere to be.

544
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,420
No one's eaten yet, right?

545
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,210
Since we've run into each other,
let's go eat together.

546
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,840
Why are you three exchanging glances?

547
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,390
I see. You're trying to leave me out.

548
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,350
Everyone's tired, so--
Come on.

549
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,430
You still need to eat.

550
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
I'll treat you to something really good.

551
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,770
No more exchanging glances!

552
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,230
You all eat intestines, right?

553
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,940
Excuse me.

554
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,280
Hi.
Hello.

555
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,740
Intestines hot pot for three
and one pork cutlet, please.

556
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,910
Sure.

557
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,370
I can't handle the intestines.
I've got a weak stomach.

558
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,040
But this place is famous.

559
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,420
Should I take the lead here?

560
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,050
Let's introduce ourselves first.
We'll go around in a circle.

561
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,140
I'm Han Se-jin. Next!

562
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,730
I'm Lee Ho-su.

563
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm Yu Mi-rae.
Mi-rae?

564
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,400
I like that name.

565
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,900
I heard you've been living in Seoul.

566
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,160
Where do you work--
Is that too personal?

567
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,370
I work at KFMC.
Korea Finance Management Corporation.

568
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,330
Impressive.

569
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,040
Did you major in that field--
Is that too personal?

570
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,340
Well…

571
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,050
I majored in economics.

572
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,670
You should ask her then.

573
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,550
My business partner here
is passionate about it

574
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,430
and digs through academic papers.

575
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,140
Do sisters
always have such similar interests?

576
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,180
Fascinating.
Wow.

577
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,060
I didn't know that about her.

578
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,900
What about you, Ho-su?

579
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,110
Wait. Don't say it. Let me guess.

580
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm really good at this, so watch out.

581
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,950
Law?

582
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,370
I smell law.

583
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,040
You're in law school!

584
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,210
I graduated.
Wait, what? Oh my God.

585
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,630
I got it right! Look at these goosebumps.

586
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,340
By the way,

587
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,220
where's your farm located?

588
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,220
I might know it.

589
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,300
You've been living in Seoul,
so you probably don't.

590
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,600
It's across the bridge.
It's called Changhwa Farm.

591
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,850
What?

592
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,520
Isn't that the place
an old gentleman used to run by himself?

593
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,350
His grandson studied abroad.

594
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,900
Did you know my grandfather?

595
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,070
Yes. He was super quiet.

596
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,150
The only time he spoke
was when he bragged about his grandson.

597
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,820
So you're that grandson.

598
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,990
My goodness…

599
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,500
Hearing about my grandfather
from someone else

600
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,750
is making me emotional.

601
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,880
He called you a kid,
so I thought you were younger.

602
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,420
But you're pretty grown-up for a kid.

603
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,460
Was that a joke?

604
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,800
I like you even more, Ms. Seoul.

605
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
Let's shake hands. We have to.

606
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,680
All of a sudden?
Yes, all of a sudden.

607
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,430
Nice to meet you.

608
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,520
Let me help you.

609
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,820
I'll go start the car.

610
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,940
Okay.
Hey.

611
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,240
Hey, you.

612
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,650
So what is it?

613
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,910
Why did you make me come?

614
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,660
To end it.

615
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,620
End what?

616
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,330
You stay here now.

617
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,710
I'm going back to Seoul.

618
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,330
Wait. Hold on.

619
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,460
Just like that?

620
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,840
Ho-su is here too, you know.

621
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,970
If we switch back now and get caught…

622
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,840
You dummy. Ho-su knows.

623
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,050
He came down knowing we switched.

624
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,510
What?

625
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,810
I told you not to meet him.

626
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,390
Why did you?

627
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,060
No, I…

628
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,900
Forget it. We'll talk at home.

629
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,030
I mean…

630
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,490
Ho-su knew everything?

631
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,240
I was thinking of getting you
and Mi-ji together.

632
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,540
You said she's your first love.

633
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,750
Apparently,
she has something to say to you.

634
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,920
Seriously,
what would you two do without me?

635
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,380
This is so embarrassing.

636
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,800
Where's Mi-ji?
What? Over there.

637
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,390
She's going to the farm.

638
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,100
You're going home, right?

639
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,190
Yes, home.

640
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,020
When are you going
to the hospital tomorrow?

641
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,730
I might go in the morning.

642
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,070
I'm not sure. I'll talk to her.

643
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,320
What?

644
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,540
I…

645
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,330
I'll talk to Mi-ji later and decide.

646
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,930
Crap. This is mortifying.

647
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,930
He knows everything. Why did I say Mi-ji?

648
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,940
I'm too embarrassed to see him again!

649
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,230
I want to crawl into a hole.

650
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,040
Guys, I saw Mi-ji earlier.

651
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,630
What?
Really?

652
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,930
Ho-su, there you are!

653
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,140
CONGRATULATIONS, GRADUATES!

654
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,560
Are you Mi-rae or Mi-ji?

655
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,980
I'm Mi-ji.
Good.

656
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,690
The two of you
should take a picture together.

657
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,020
Go stand next to her.

658
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,360
All right. One, two, three.

659
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,780
One more.

660
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,200
Congratulations.
Thank you.

661
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,200
Sure.

662
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,630
What do I have to do to see Mi-ji?

663
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,800
I haven't seen much of her lately either.

664
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,600
Ever since she got hurt,
she hardly leaves her room.

665
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,230
I guess she doesn't want to see anyone.

666
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,790
I said I'd give you a ride,
not put you to work.

667
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,340
I'm feeling generous.

668
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,050
You get a special bonus today.

669
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,680
It's fine.

670
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,970
I just wanted to help out
as a thank-you for everything.

671
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,060
You sound like you're saying goodbye.

672
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,310
What is it?

673
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,810
Are you finally leaving
to chase your dreams?

674
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,190
If anything, I'm waking up from them.

675
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,570
By the way, Ms. Seoul was really nice.

676
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,370
From what I'd heard,
I thought she'd be super uptight,

677
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,740
but she was easygoing.

678
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,660
That's rare for someone so bookish.

679
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,290
I like her.

680
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,250
Everyone does.

681
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:18,130
Especially that look she gave me,
like, "Don't hit on my sister."

682
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,710
I loved it.

683
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,840
You can't use your family
as an excuse anymore.

684
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,430
Ms. Seoul looked like

685
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,930
the type who'd keep a lookout
if her partner was robbing a store.

686
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,390
Your family isn't worried,
but you are for no reason.

687
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,140
Why not just do what you want?

688
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,310
Why do you keep saying that?

689
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,110
What do you mean?

690
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,280
Since yesterday,
you've been saying I'm making excuses.

691
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,030
You've never lived my life,
so why are you judging me?

692
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,030
Not everyone can live like you, Se-jin.

693
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,990
Family, debt…
They may sound like lame excuses to you,

694
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,080
but to me, they're real and unavoidable.

695
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,290
I know. I've said all those things before.

696
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,050
Back in high school,

697
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,640
I randomly started studying
for the civil service exam.

698
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,220
I didn't want to study abroad.

699
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,220
I would've failed anyway.
There were too many technical terms.

700
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,900
But one day, Grandfather came
to the exam-prep center

701
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,730
and asked what I was doing there.

702
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,110
I gave the usual script.

703
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,650
"You've sacrificed everything for me."

704
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,900
"How can I just think about myself?"

705
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,360
"We've got debts."

706
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,910
"And I'm the only family you have."

707
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,240
Then he yelled,
which was totally out of character.

708
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,040
He said those weren't the real reasons,

709
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,380
and that they were just excuses.

710
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,210
Then…

711
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,510
what was the real reason?

712
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,510
I was scared.

713
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,130
Everyone assumed I'd do well,

714
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,680

EXAM QUESTIONS

721
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,730
I was afraid of not meeting expectations…

722
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,150
and of disappointing myself.

723
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,700
The fact that nothing was certain
made me anxious.

724
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,790
And I was scared
I'd feel that way forever.

725
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,580
But those reasons are silly.

726
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,460
What fool doesn't scratch a lottery ticket
just because it might be a dud?

727
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,630
Hey…

728
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,670
are you that fool?

729
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,190
Think about it.

730
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,570
What's the real reason you're hesitating?

731
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,580
Hey, you.

732
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,130
It's been ages
since we last shared a room.

733
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,760
Close the door.

734
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,300
You're going to bed already?

735
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,390
You said we'd talk at home.

736
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,010
Do you really want to go
to Seoul tomorrow?

737
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,060
What are you going to do with your hair?

738
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,230
We'll talk tomorrow.

739
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,310
Tomorrow?

740
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,940
What about work?

741
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,570
I'll take a day off,
so let's talk tomorrow.

742
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,950
I'm going to sleep. Close the door.

743
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,600
Come on.

744
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,770
Can't you just go to the hospital?
I'll go to the Youth Association thing.

745
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,060
I, Mi-rae, came from Seoul
just to help with typhoon recovery work?

746
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,150
Then does Mi-rae have to go
to the hospital?

747
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,820
Didn't you say Mom's not even that hurt?

748
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,490
Mi-rae could just call Mom
and visit Grandma…

749
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,570
If I took a day off, came home,

750
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
and went back without even seeing Mom,

751
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,660
what does that make me?

752
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,250
Go. Don't make me a bad daughter.

753
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,800
You're not waiting for me, right?
Mi-ji will be out soon.

754
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:20,930
Mi-rae.

755
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,480
We didn't get to finish our chat.
Later.

756
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,400
I'll call you when I'm done with work.

757
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,690
One more thing.

758
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,780
Thank you.

759
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,990
For not telling Mi-ji yesterday.

760
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,410
You could've just told her.

761
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,530
I did tell her.

762
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,830
Oh my!

763
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,000
Gosh.

764
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,960
Shoot, I…

765
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,300
forgot something.

766
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,880
Oh, you did?
Yes.

767
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,970
You can go get it. I'll wait here.

768
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,930
No, it might take a while.

769
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,100
You go ahead.
Okay…

770
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,060
How did you know it was so dry in here?

771
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,070
How thoughtful of you
to bring a humidifier.

772
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,490
We'll be here for one night.
Isn't this a bit much?

773
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,410
What's "a bit much" is you
hanging wet towels all over the place.

774
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,160
Hi, Mi-rae.
Hello.

775
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,370
Oh my, Mi-rae. What brings you here?

776
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,410
Did you come alone?

777
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Yes, Mi-ji went
to the Youth Association thing.

778
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,840
Mi-rae, how long has it been?

779
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,800
You've gotten even prettier.

780
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
It's been a while
since you saw Ho-su, right?

781
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,930
Yes.

782
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,050
Hi.
Hello.

783
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,560
You didn't have to come. I'm out tomorrow.

784
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,020
You must be busy with work.

785
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,730
And what's this?

786
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,980
Just a few things…
Oh dear.

787
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,770
…I thought you might need.

788
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
This might be a bit much, but…

789
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,030
What do you mean?

790
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,110
It was dry in here, so this is perfect.

791
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,830
It's like Mi-rae and Ho-su are in sync.

792
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,500
They say it takes brains
to be considerate.

793
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,540
That could be why
you're both so thoughtful.

794
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,250
Maybe it's because
I haven't seen you in a while,

795
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,630
but you and Mi-ji used to look identical.

796
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,550
Now that you're older,
I can finally tell who's who.

797
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,470
Really?
Yes.

798
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,560
Mi-rae looks like a real lady now.

799
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,310
Mi-ji still seems like a kid.

800
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,600
Mom.

801
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:41,860
Mi-rae just has this calm,
intelligent vibe, you know?

802
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,700
So she's more than
just an acquaintance, unlike Mi-ji?

803
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,830
Why bring that up in front of the kids?

804
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
What is it? Is your back itchy?

805
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,920
It's probably because I haven't showered.

806
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Your skin must be dry.
I'll put some moisturizer on.

807
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,550
It's fine. I'll do it myself later.

808
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,460
You can't put it on your back yourself.

809
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,800
No, it's fine.
Let me.

810
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,470
I'll do it myself.
Just stay still.

811
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,720
Jeez.
Let me see.

812
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,060
It's all red already.

813
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,400
It's just a bit of a scratch.
There's no need for you to stay here.

814
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,150
Go back to Seoul.

815
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,280
I should at least see Grandma
since I'm here.

816
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,650
Mi-rae.

817
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,070
If you see Grandma,

818
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,200
don't mention that I got hurt.

819
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,660
Why? Because she'll worry?

820
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,210
Goodness. Worried?

821
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,290
Your grandma's not the type
to worry about me.

822
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,040
No, a bit higher.
Higher?

823
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,960
Here?
Yes, that's the spot.

824
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,630
She's only sweet to you kids, not to me.

825
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,640
If she hears I got hurt,
she'll nag at me for not acting my age.

826
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,470
Anyway, go back to Seoul.

827
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,850
It's just a minor scratch.
Besides, you're busy.

828
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,980
What are you talking about?
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

829
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,400
All done.

830
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,490
I'll go get some water for the humidifier.

831
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,120
I'll do it.
Let me.

832
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,700
I've got it.
I can do it.

833
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,870
She's being unusually sweet.

834
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,630
Of course she is. You got hurt,
and she hasn't seen you in ages.

835
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,970
Are you seriously complaining
about your daughter being sweet to you?

836
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,470
Who's complaining?

837
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,180
I was just saying
she's being unusually sweet, right?

838
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:35,140
Your mom really knows how
to get under people's skin with a smile.

839
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
You go first.

840
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,990
Okay.

841
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,210
Thanks.

842
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,100
Are you mad at me?

843
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,720
Why would I be mad at you?

844
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,480
Then why are you

845
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,190
avoiding my eyes?

846
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,020
Don't be absurd.

847
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,690
When did I…

848
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,910
Can you believe Mi-ji?

849
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,870
She's off to the Youth Association thing
when Mom is hurt.

850
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,290
She even made me take a day off.

851
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,830
No job, no worries, right?

852
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,250
You…

853
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,050
The tank is full. I'll head in first.

854
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,050
Wait, I…

855
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,180
She is avoiding me.

856
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,220
Okay, let's wrap things up.

857
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,730
Thanks for all your hard work.

858
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:58,930
DUSON-RI SENIOR CENTER

859
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,360
There's some boiled pork at the town hall.

860
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,230
If you want some, come on in.

861
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,820
If not, you can go home.

862
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,450
Do as you please, okay?

863
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,950
Are you telling us to come or not?

864
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,580
I'm telling you to leave.

865
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,460
Hey, Il-lam…
You're not going?

866
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,420
No, I'm not.

867
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,420
Now it really feels like the end.

868
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,880
All right, then.

869
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,180
Okay.
Goodbye.

870
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,390
Mi-rae.

871
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,480
Hey, wait.

872
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,450
Can you tell me now instead of tomorrow?

873
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,160
The real reason you quit?

874
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,410
There's still half a day left.

875
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,880
I guess we might not
see each other tomorrow.

876
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,670
Follow me.
We need a drink for this conversation.

877
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,230
Have you heard of Neo Trading Company?

878
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,110
Of course.

879
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,150
You replaced the management there
and then suddenly vanished.

880
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,780
So you know.

881
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,870
Actually, I forced my way into that deal.

882
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,870
There was this investor
who had two percent of the shares,

883
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,830
and everyone at my company went all in.

884
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,040
We were dead set on convincing him

885
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,670
and talked until our mouths went dry.

886
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,300
Yes, we've secured enough for attendance.

887
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,800
We just need two percent
of the voting rights.

888
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,300
All those chronic issues
you've complained about?

889
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,140
We could finally fix them for good.

890
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,600
Then my grandfather called.

891
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,350
He never used to call me.

892
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,360
So we think…
I didn't answer.

893
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,030
…replacing the management
is the only solution.

894
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,400
We have a solid list of candidates
for the board,

895
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,820
so if you could
really get behind us this time…

896
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,820
Excuse me.

897
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,490
Then he called again.
Hey.

898
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,120
What do I do?

899
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,460
This conference call
has life-or-death stakes.

900
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,540
Sorry. Excuse me.

901
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,460
Yes, we can address
your concerns at the root.

902
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,430
We plan to reduce low-profit businesses
handled by minor subsidiaries…

903
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,890
That's when he passed away.

904
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,890
From heatstroke,
in the middle of his farm.

905
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,980
The call
with life-or-death stakes was his.

906
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,520
After he died…

907
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,190
I felt like…

908
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,150
something inside me…

909
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,160
just collapsed and fell apart.

910
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,040
But not everyone reacts that way
to death, you know?

911
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,210
They go to work. They eat.

912
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,420
But I couldn't.

913
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,800
That's why I quit.

914
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,590
I didn't know what part of me was broken.

915
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,800
And I was scared I'd fall apart again.

916
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,020
It's not as dramatic as the rumors.

917
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,520
Don't the rumors bother you?

918
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,280
Everyone assumed they were true
since you disappeared so suddenly.

919
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,320
Should I have stuck it out a bit longer?

920
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,490
No.

921
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,660
There's no point proving
something that isn't true.

922
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,370
If the people by your side
know the truth, that's enough.

923
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,130
By the way,

924
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,210
why'd you say you'd tell me tomorrow?

925
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,170
Oh, that.

926
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,510
Tomorrow is his birthday.

927
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,550
Perfect timing
for a trip down memory lane.

928
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,560
He was always so gruff,
but he loved the stars.

929
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,890
At midnight on my birthday,

930
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,150
he'd pack seaweed soup in a thermos
and take me stargazing.

931
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,980
He said the sky was full of stars
the night I was born.

932
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,660
Now I celebrate his birthday alone
doing the same thing.

933
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,700
What a fool I am.

934
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,120
Cheers.

935
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,530
Grandma!

936
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,370
You're here.

937
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,170
Grandma!

938
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,630
How have you been?

939
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,220
Goodness me.

940
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,720
BONGDEOK HOSPITAL

941
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,010
Is it all over now?

942
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,020
I don't know. I can't tell if it is.

943
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,110
We said we'd end it once Mi-rae was okay,

944
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,610
but I'm not sure she is.

945
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,150
My mom saw me with this hair.

946
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,030
Did you tell your mom?

947
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:46,160
What, that we switched?

948
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,280
Yes.

949
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,580
What's the point in telling Mom?

950
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,450
She'd say I'm ruining Mi-rae's life
and scold me.

951
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,420
I came because she got hurt.

952
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,000
She's hurt?

953
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,040
It's nothing serious.

954
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,050
She was squabbling with Bun-hong
and got a little scraped up.

955
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,090
Where?

956
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,510
Tell your mom to come here now.

957
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,310
She can't. She's in the hospital.

958
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,810
It's not that serious.
She's just there for some tests.

959
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,310
Let's go to your mom.

960
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,770
To Mom?
Yes.

961
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,150
You can't go.

962
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,740
I'll take the wheelchair.

963
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,990
Come on.

964
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,530
Let's go see your mom.

965
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,740
Grandma, I'll tell Mom to come
as soon as she's discharged.

966
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,620
Don't worry, okay?

967
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,790
She'll be fine.

968
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,590
Here's the information
you requested on Kim Ro-sa.

969
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,850
It appears she grew up
in an orphanage and has no relatives

970
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,560
except for a son.

971
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,980
What about her husband?
There must be a father.

972
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,270
According to a contact
at the prosecutor's office,

973
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,860
he was murdered.
By someone Kim Ro-sa knew.

974
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,900
What?

975
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,030
Was it a crime of passion?

976
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,240
No, the defendant was a woman.

977
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,780
She was also from the same orphanage.

978
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,200
No prior criminal record.

979
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,250
Ms. Kim testified on her behalf,
so she got a reduced sentence.

980
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,620
She testified for her?

981
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,960
Can we contact her now?

982
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,050
It's been confirmed that she's deceased.

983
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,840
Deceased…

984
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,590
Look into her some more.

985
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,800
And keep tracking Kim Ro-sa.

986
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,140
What's her name?

987
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,760
Hyeon Sang-wol.

988
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,140
Hyeon…

989
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,310
"Hyeon Sang-wol."

990
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,680
FIRST TRIAL VERDICT

991
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,020
Hyeon…

992
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,190
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

993
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,060
…Sang-wol…

994
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,070
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
HYEON SANG-WOL

995
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,820
DATE OF BIRTH: FEB 14, 1955

996
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,610
No need to be sorry.

997
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,830
You went home
because your mother got hurt.

998
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,870
Still, I should have met you
in person and told you how it went.

999
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,120
There's nothing much to tell.

1000
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,330
You declined because I told you to.

1001
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,130
So is the whole thing over?

1002
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,800
Ms. Ro-sa.

1003
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,550
Can I ask you something?

1004
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,970
Sure. What is it?

1005
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,140
Before,

1006
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,640
I never got to ask
why you're not selling the building.

1007
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,850
I told you.

1008
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,900
I hate anything complicated,
money included.

1009
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,730
Is there…

1010
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,900
any other reason?

1011
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,820
What do you mean?

1012
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,360
Before,

1013
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:37,240
I figured it might be personal,
so I didn't dig any deeper.

1014
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,250
But if there's a specific reason
that's keeping you from selling,

1015
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,290
I'm pretty sure I can help.

1016
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:50,260
You're not making any sense.

1017
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:54,470
Isn't your job done now?

1018
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,350
I'm not asking
as your legal representative.

1019
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,640
This is a personal question.

1020
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,860
I offered to help,
but all I did was pass along messages.

1021
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,980
I feel like I haven't been of much help.

1022
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:12,150
If you're worried that the paperwork
or procedures are complicated,

1023
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,990
I can handle it for you.

1024
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,160
Or anything else, just say the word…

1025
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,330
There's nothing to help with.

1026
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,370
It's all over now, right?

1027
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,710
Yes.

1028
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,830
I've got customers.

1029
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,380
Come by for a meal sometime.

1030
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,340
Hello!

1031
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,640
Hi, ma'am.

1032
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,180
The chicken giblet stew here is amazing.

1033
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,050
Sorry I snapped yesterday.

1034
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,850
You came to help, after all.

1035
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,020
It's fine.

1036
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,100
I showed up out of the blue.

1037
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,770
The last time I saw you…

1038
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,070
You're right. I ran away.

1039
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,030
Seeing your face…

1040
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,160
made me think about my family.

1041
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,710
I didn't want them
to find out about my problems.

1042
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,040
It's something I have to fix myself.

1043
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,420
You don't have to do it alone.

1044
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,760
If you're uncomfortable with me,
I can refer you to another lawyer.

1045
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,510
Or we can find other ways
outside the legal route.

1046
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,470
Maybe--
I appreciate it.

1047
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,970
But honestly,

1048
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,520
I don't even know what kind of help
to ask for right now.

1049
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,770
I'll go back, see what I need,

1050
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,650
and let you know if I need any help.

1051
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:31,330
Man…

1052
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,090
Mi-rae!

1053
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,720
Hi.
Hey.

1054
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,020
Long time no see.

1055
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:49,310
I know.
Yeah.

1056
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,650
You must be busy. What brings you here?

1057
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,320
A family matter.

1058
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,070
I see.

1059
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:59,320
Yes.

1060
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,870
Where's Mi-ji?

1061
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:03,830
Mi-ji?

1062
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,290
She's at home.

1063
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,290
Home?
Yes.

1064
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,870
At home, my foot!

1065
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,670
You're seriously asking for it, Mi-ji.

1066
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,880
Hey! Why did you pretend you didn't know?

1067
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,340
You're one to talk!
Why didn't you call me?

1068
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,220
You're my only friend.
What about me? You're all I've got.

1069
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,930
I was losing my mind
not being able to reach out to you.

1070
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,930
Jeez… Hey.

1071
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,850
Look.
Hamcheol?

1072
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,600
I never got to show anyone.

1073
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,820
It's cute, right?
You got it there? Cute!

1074
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,780
GYEONG-GU MART

1075
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,980
At the wedding?

1076
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,200
Ho-su's always been that way.
Nothing can stop him when he's fired up.

1077
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,030
That's badass.

1078
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,250
But how did you run into him
in a huge city like Seoul?

1079
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,910
That's fate, if you ask me.

1080
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,420
Hey, Gyeong-gu.

1081
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,790
Did you know…

1082
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,630
that Ho-su--

1083
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,960
Liked you?

1084
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,550
I figured after my love confession stunt.

1085
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,560
But you didn't really say anything,
so I thought you turned him down.

1086
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,310
You've got a weird look on your face.

1087
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,150
Do you like Ho-su?

1088
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,310
I don't know.

1089
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,150
Oh my. That's crazy!

1090
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,940
That hurts.

1091
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,240
Since when?

1092
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,860
Did something happen in Seoul?
Or back in high school?

1093
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,070
Nothing happened.

1094
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,740
I only just found out
I was his first love.

1095
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,040
If you heard that, then it's settled.

1096
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,330
If a guy calls you his first love,

1097
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,250
you've basically won the game.

1098
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,710
Forget it.

1099
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:40,550
First love or not,
it was before I got injured.

1100
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,720
Why does that matter?

1101
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,220
Did he like you for your ankle?
Come on.

1102
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:51,310
We saw each other
the day before he left for Seoul.

1103
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,480
Back then, I was in a really bad place.

1104
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,150
I was blaming myself
and everyone around me.

1105
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,740
Mi-ji.

1106
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:07,030
Ho-su is going to Seoul tomorrow.

1107
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,870
I'm leaving something outside your room.

1108
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,850
Mi-ji, I'll be waiting
outside your house tonight.

1109
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,010
Are you…

1110
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,220
really Mi-ji?

1111
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,520
Does it matter?

1112
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,110
You can't tell us apart anyway.

1113
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,490
Why did you give this to me?

1114
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,290
We…

1115
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,870
talked about this.

1116
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,460
When we go to Seoul,

1117
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,960
we'd check out these places together.

1118
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,630
I'm leaving for Seoul first and--
Seriously,

1119
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,100
what's the point of giving this to me now?

1120
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,850
To mess with me?
No, I'm not trying to--

1121
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,310
Then do you feel sorry for me
or something?

1122
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,560
Hey.

1123
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,570
How can I go to Seoul?

1124
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:08,530
My ankle's wrecked, and my life's ruined.

1125
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,580
It's not ruined.

1126
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,000
You'll get better.

1127
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,250
Are you a doctor?

1128
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,000
How am I ever supposed to get better?

1129
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,010
Now I get why you acted out.

1130
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,310
Being pitied

1131
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,940
feels like crap.

1132
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:46,610
We're done here, right?

1133
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:49,570
Mi-ji.

1134
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:14,050
It's weird.
I said way worse things to him.

1135
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,260
But when he asked
if I was really Mi-ji,

1136
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,930
it just really stuck with me.

1137
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:24,900
I thought, "The Mi-ji he knew
was the bright, happy runner."

1138
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:29,780
"That version of me is gone now,
so he can't recognize me anymore."

1139
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:34,610
So his first love was that Mi-ji,

1140
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,910
not me.

1141
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,370
Gosh.

1142
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,750
Cut the "old me, new me" crap.

1143
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,210
So what now?

1144
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,750
What are you going to do?

1145
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:47,000
What do you mean?

1146
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,960
You said you like Ho-su.

1147
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,260
And he knows, right?

1148
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,720
Then man up and tell him.

1149
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,800
I can't even look him in the eye.
How can I tell him?

1150
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,100
Jeez.

1151
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,810
Why can't you look at him?

1152
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,230
Does the sight of him make you go crazy?

1153
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,770
It's not that. Listen.

1154
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,940
When I was pretending to be Mi-rae,
it was fine.

1155
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,940
But as me, I don't know
how to act around him.

1156
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,320
It's like I've taken off a mask.

1157
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,110
Everything feels too real all of a sudden.

1158
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,910
What am I going to do with you,
you hopeless little virgin?

1159
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,200
Good heavens.
Jeez.

1160
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,080
So what now? You won't tell him?

1161
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,620
I don't know. Maybe later.

1162
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,460
When exactly is "later"?

1163
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,960
We'll be 40 before you know it.

1164
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,800
Come on. Mi-rae's going through hell.

1165
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,300
Is this really the time
to be asking him out?

1166
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,680
Whatever. I don't know.

1167
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,310
Ho-su, will you pick me up
tomorrow when I get discharged?

1168
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,770
What's wrong with this?

1169
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,860
If you do, I'll be so happy.

1170
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,110
Getting injured has its perks!

1171
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,650
No.

1172
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,200
I just mean that I'm happy.

1173
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,780
Okay, sleep tight.

1174
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,880
What?
I'm just amazed.

1175
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,470
How can you say things like that
and not even cringe?

1176
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,340
If it pisses you off,
just close the curtain.

1177
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:24,640
Who said I'm pissed off?
I just said I was amazed.

1178
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,680
I can't say things like that, you know.

1179
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,850
Instead of saying you can't…

1180
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,270
why not try a little harder?

1181
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,070
What was that earlier?

1182
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,650
You hadn't seen Mi-rae in ages,
and you basically sent her away!

1183
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,740
It's not that I don't like her.

1184
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:41,280
Then you sent her away
because you love her?

1185
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,450
How is anyone supposed to know
what you mean when you talk like that?

1186
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,830
Even if I say things plainly,
people always take it the wrong way.

1187
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,880
You did it just now.

1188
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,500
When?
A moment ago.

1189
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,510
I said I was amazed,
and you assumed I was pissed off.

1190
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:00,010
Unbelievable. And what?

1191
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,930
You thought I was talking
about Ho-su's condition?

1192
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,220
Bun-hong.

1193
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,850
My child suffers from health problems too.
How could I ever say such a thing?

1194
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:11,230
What did you think of me all these years?

1195
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,400
Gosh.

1196
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:16,190
Then you should've
cleared things up right there…

1197
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,820
I did!

1198
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,530
I said it was a misunderstanding
over and over, but you didn't listen.

1199
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,200
Forget it.

1200
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:28,160
I can't blame you.
I was just born this way.

1201
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,920
Maybe I have a victim mentality,
like you said.

1202
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:41,760
Fine. I took your words
the wrong way. Happy?

1203
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,240
Are you asleep?

1204
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:07,620
Good night.

1205
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,290
Delivery!
What the heck?

1206
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,960
Jeez.

1207
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,550
I didn't order anything.

1208
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,460
Yes, I lied.

1209
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,590
Hey. Wow.

1210
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,890
It's been a while.

1211
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:30,930
So, I heard you stood up for me
at the wedding?

1212
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,350
I wouldn't say that exactly.

1213
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,730
Whatever. Thanks anyway.

1214
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:43,740
Since you stood up for me,
I figured I should ask.

1215
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,620
Are you stringing Mi-ji along?

1216
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,410
What?
She doesn't have a proper job,

1217
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,910
and she's not educated like you.
Is that it?

1218
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,370
Is she not good enough for you?
Don't be ridiculous.

1219
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,710
Good.

1220
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,210
You're getting defensive and upset.

1221
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,170
But why won't you tell her?

1222
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,630
You've liked her since way back.

1223
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,840
The timing wasn't right back then.

1224
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,720
Just when I finally made up my mind…

1225
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,310
she was in a really bad place.

1226
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,860
So you couldn't tell her?

1227
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,990
What about now?

1228
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,860
We missed our chance once.

1229
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,080
This time, I want to do it right,
when nothing's in our way.

1230
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,000
Are you plotting an assassination?

1231
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,920
Do you need to plan out

1232
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
the exact spot, the route,
and even the exit strategy?

1233
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,380
I'll do it later.

1234
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:43,010
She's uncomfortable around me now.

1235
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,720
When exactly is "later"?

1236
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,180
Fine. Just keep wasting time
and start dating when you're old and gray.

1237
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,680
You two are exactly the same.

1238
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,850
Ho-su.

1239
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,400
There's no such thing as perfect timing.

1240
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,230
Nothing in this world is perfect.

1241
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:21,670
"There's no such thing as perfect timing."

1242
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,590
You killed it.

1243
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,260
RESIGNATION LETTER

1244
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:35,810
KFMC PLANNING STRATEGY TEAM
YU MI-RAE

1245
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,230
Weren't you scared?

1246
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:43,690
You worked so hard to get there,

1247
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,990
but you just gave it all up and left.

1248
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:48,320
I was terrified.

1249
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:53,410
But if you don't let go,
you can't grab onto anything else.

1250
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,330
So let's grab onto
any happiness, goodness,

1251
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,960
or joy we can find.

1252
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,500
You too, Mi-rae.

1253
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,430
RESIGNATION LETTER

1254
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,650
FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE,

1255
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:29,280
I HEREBY SUBMIT MY RESIGNATION

1256
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,280
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE

1257
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,250
NEW HQ PROJECT

1258
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,040
What do I do with this?

1259
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:48,460
What are you doing?

1260
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:53,260
Just organizing things to tell you
before you go back to Seoul.

1261
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,390
Sorry, but…

1262
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,690
can we wait a few more days
before we switch back?

1263
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,350
It won't take long.

1264
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,230
I'll wrap things up here first
and go back right away.

1265
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,900
That's fine with me.

1266
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,820
But why? Is something going on?

1267
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,580
Remember what you said

1268
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,170
the first day we switched?

1269
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,970
You told me to write a resignation letter
when I was ready to come back.

1270
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,890
I said I would,

1271
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,770
but honestly,
I wasn't planning to write it.

1272
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,560
I never considered quitting.

1273
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,230
I was scared.

1274
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,400
Of what?

1275
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:54,160
I feel like KFMC
is way more than I deserve.

1276
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,410
Don't say that.
I mean it.

1277
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:59,740
I was just lucky to get in.

1278
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:05,540
You and Mom always talk like
I'm some big deal,

1279
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:08,250
but I'm just average.

1280
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,210
I'm just good at enduring tedious stuff.

1281
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:15,970
If you just compare
the results to my effort,

1282
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,760
I might even be below average.

1283
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,730
That's why I was scared to quit.

1284
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,980
Getting into KFMC

1285
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,690
was just a stroke of luck

1286
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,110
for someone as average as me.

1287
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:37,570
Come on. You could get a job
at a much better place.

1288
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,330
For me, this company is…

1289
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,830
like what running was to you.

1290
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,870
I could go somewhere else,

1291
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,130
but I don't think I could go
anywhere better than KFMC.

1292
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,050
So I was scared to let it go.

1293
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,760
If I leave, I have to start over.

1294
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,430
And I'm just tired…

1295
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,600
of being disappointed in myself.

1296
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:12,360
That's why it took me so long
to write a resignation letter

1297
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,070
that I might not even hand in.

1298
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,570
I must sound so pathetic.

1299
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,780
Hey.

1300
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,330
Either laugh or cry. Pick one.

1301
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,790
I spent days in silence,

1302
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:35,050
keeping to myself
so no one would see how vulnerable I was.

1303
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,270
Hello.

1304
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,270
Ok-hui.

1305
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,070
Are you hurt?

1306
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,160
Does it hurt a lot?

1307
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,490
Mom, is that you?

1308
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,500
I'm fine.

1309
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,130
I'm hanging up.

1310
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,180
Thank you.

1311
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,020
I'm sorry.

1312
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:42,110
KIM RO-SA

1313
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,410
Inside the layers of bark I've built up

1314
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,370
in my wish to become a tree…

1315
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,550
there are fragile feelings

1316
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,130
trapped within,

1317
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,340
unable to grow.

1318
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,410
Ho-su. I just saw your text.

1319
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,460
What's up? It's late.

1320
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,000
Have you been waiting long?

1321
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,000
No.

1322
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,130
You're lying.

1323
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,090
Your face looks numb from the cold.

1324
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,180
Honestly, I've been waiting a long time.

1325
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,970
A very long time.

1326
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,850
Mi-ji.

1327
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,560
I've been thinking about that day…

1328
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,900
the whole time I was waiting.

1329
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,030
On the day before I left for Seoul,

1330
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,360
I was waiting for you here just like this.

1331
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:09,120
I had something I needed to say…

1332
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:13,750
but I couldn't say a word
when you came out.

1333
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:17,880
Back then, I was in a bad place,
and I took it out on you.

1334
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,960
When I was in a bad place,
you always reached out to me,

1335
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:24,180
even when I was mean.

1336
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,100
I wanted to be
that kind of person for you too.

1337
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,140
But seeing you struggle after your injury…

1338
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:36,520
I lost my courage.

1339
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:41,820
I don't have the strength
to help someone heal like you do.

1340
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,950
I thought I'd only end up
hurting you more.

1341
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,910
If I was never going to see you again,

1342
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:54,080
I thought I'd rather just say nothing
and keep things the way they were.

1343
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:57,630
It would have been enough
just to catch a glimpse of you

1344
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:59,590
on the day of the ancestral rite.

1345
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:00,960
Back then, at least.

1346
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,360
Mi-ji.

1347
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,490
I've been waiting to tell you this,

1348
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,280
waiting until your heart was lighter

1349
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:32,410
and I had become a better person.

1350
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,790
But I'll say it now.

1351
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:42,460
I've liked you…

1352
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,220
for a long time.

1353
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:49,890
More than you know.

1354
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,680
When are you going to Seoul?
If you're not leaving today,

1355
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,180
do you want to meet up tonight?

1356
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,520
Why at night?

1357
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,430
Because the stars are visible at night.

1358
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,770
Are you her son?
You're just as handsome as she said.

1359
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:43,810
What was the conception dream?
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

1360
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,570
Mom, just focus
on taking care of yourself.

1361
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:48,280
If you're not a customer, get out.

1362
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,030
Hyeon Sang-wol. You know her, right?
Who are you?

1363
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:52,320
Hello.

1364
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:54,490
Sang-yeong!
You're back!

1365
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:55,950
You're back already?

1366
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,160
How have you been?

1367
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,670
