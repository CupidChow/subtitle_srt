OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,470
Ho-su. Doesn't your neck hurt?

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,180
DESTINATION
IAN MEMORIAL PARK

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,680
I guess this attitude
is typical of an eighth grader.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,770
You're not even responding.
I'm going to tell your mom later.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,350
Which mom?

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,780
Ho-su.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,200
Someday, you're also
going to make someone miserable.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,160
There will definitely be a moment

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,660
when you cause the person
by your side to lose.

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,120
But you know, Ho-su…

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,550
Love isn't about winning or losing.
It's about--

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,140
You've been through a lot, Ho-su.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,220
But in my opinion,

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,180
it's pointless for him
to have any more surgeries.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,100
What do you mean, Doctor?

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,810
We should still do everything we can--

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,770
Ma'am.

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,320
You recall Ho-su's condition
right after the accident, don't you?

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Just the fact that he's alive
and walking again is a miracle.

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,950
It's time for Ho-su
and the rest of us to face the truth.

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,160
Ho-su will never fully recover
from the accident.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,250
There are ducks here!

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,370
- Did it swim away? Where is it?
- Hey, a duck!

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,710
- It's a duck.
- A duck.

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,790
Yes, really.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,550
<i>The best we can do right now</i>
<i>is to maintain his current condition.</i>

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,470
<i>He can't run.</i>

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,850
<i>He should avoid any strenuous exercise.</i>
<i>No hiking, no long walks.</i>

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,480
The hike up Dusonbong Peak
before becoming seniors,

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,520
the biggest event of your lives,
has been our long-standing tradition.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,690
- Mi-ji, want to race to the top?
- To train your body and mind…

33
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,360
- Winner gets 10,000 won. Deal?
- …and your dedication to studying…

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,740
- Jeez.
- …at your final crossroads.

35
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
Is it really okay for me
to keep taking your money?

36
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,370
You wanna bet?

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,950
…so you can soar even higher…

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,700
Don't fool around and get hurt.

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,120
We'll be checking
to see if all of you reach the top.

40
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,790
Don't try to cheat by coming down
before reaching the top.

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,090
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,340
Those who aren't feeling well are exempt.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,680
You can stay over there
with the school nurse.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,930
Are you sure
they're not exempt for being smart?

45
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,890
Get going!

46
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,740
Where are you going?

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Dusonbong Peak.

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,660
What for?

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,460
You're being self-absorbed.

50
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,130
No one cares
whether we go up there or not.

51
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,170
Stop making a big deal out of it.

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,560
Ho-su!

53
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,070
I'm surprised you're here.

54
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,410
Are you also going to the top
to wish for good CSAT results?

55
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,620
Why did you come back down?

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,370
The others said you were coming up,
so I wanted to see for myself.

57
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,670
Do you want some water?

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,460
DUSONBONG PEAK
NOKYEONG WATERFALL

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,670
Hey, do you want to use this?
It seems useful.

60
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,880
Hey, hiking is all about the gear.
Here you go.

61
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,350
What's going on?
You already reached the top?

62
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,890
No, I'm just running away.

63
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,400
Seung-hyeon is at the top right now,
and he said no one is checking.

64
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,980
Mi-ji, if you don't hurry,
you're gonna be last.

65
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,070
Okay.

66
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,030
Go on ahead.

67
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,570
No, I don't want to break a sweat
when I'm not even training.

68
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,070
Just go.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
It's fine. Let's go together.

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,950
Please just go!

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,880
Damn it.

72
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,220
<i>Your first love is Mi-ji?</i>

73
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,010
Why are you acting all surprised?

74
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,930
I thought you knew.

75
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
I did?

76
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,020
But you definitely…

77
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,270
Wait. Since when?

78
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,270
What do you mean?

79
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,400
No one decides when to start
falling in love for the first time.

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,530
You must have some idea
of when or why you fell for her.

81
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,490
Dusonbong Peak.

82
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,030
Dusonbong Peak? The mountain?

83
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,910
You mean the one the whole school hiked?

84
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes, if I had to pick a time.

85
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,040
Hey…

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,250
Hold on. Hello?

87
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,170
Yes, I'll be right there.

88
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,180
- That mountain--
- Let's go.

89
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,470
Wait. Hey!

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,100
Wow. Dusonbong Peak? Me?

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,560
Me? Seriously?

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
EPISODE 5
ALONE WITH YOU

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,660
HO-SU

94
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,080
<i>The more I think about it,</i>
<i>the weirder it is.</i>

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,790
<i>He liked Mi-rae, though.</i>

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,080
You came, though.
You came and left with Mi-rae.

97
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,250
- Am I wrong?
- You're right.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,380
<i>That's what he said.</i>

99
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,800
<i>Why is he suddenly claiming</i>
<i>that I'm his first love?</i>

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
SINCE WHEN? JEALOUSY?

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,090
<i>Don't tell me he's trying</i>
<i>to make Mi-rae jealous.</i>

102
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,350
<i>And what's with Dusonbong Peak?</i>

103
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,100
<i>I can't even ask him outright</i>
<i>what he meant.</i>

104
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,600
This is the Planning
Coordination Department.

105
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,070
The Digital Innovation Team.

106
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,480
Hello.

107
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,070
The Corporate Relations Team.

108
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,150
Hello.

109
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,660
And this is the Planning Strategy Team.

110
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,290
What are you waiting for?
Say hello to the CEO.

111
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,750
Hello, sir.

112
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,370
Is this the team in charge
of the new HQ project?

113
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,420
Yes, our team is taking care
of all the minor tasks,

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,710
such as securing the site
before the construction--

115
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,500
The site issue isn't a minor task.

116
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,860
Yes, you're right.
Every task is important. I--

117
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,430
No, they're not all important.

118
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,390
I'm just spouting nonsense
because I don't know much.

119
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,850
As you all know,
I don't come from a public corporation,

120
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,310
so I'm not up-to-date on the new HQ
and how things work around here.

121
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,110
You didn't give him a separate report
on the new HQ project?

123
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,110
Ms. Yu, is the report ready yet?

124
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,490
Pardon?

125
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,530
I'm sorry. The employee in charge is--

126
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,620
It's my fault, sir. I'll tell them
to get it ready as soon as possible.

127
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,750
Okay, then.

128
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,080
Good work, everyone.

129
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,290
Thank you, sir.

130
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,840
Mi-rae. You heard him, right?

131
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,050
Get the project report ready by next week.

132
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,390
Pardon?

133
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,980
Sir.

134
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,190
I can't make a project report
by myself in just a few days.

135
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,360
Come on. That report should be
a piece of cake for you.

136
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,900
Then can you at least assign
one more person to help?

137
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,450
You joined this project knowing
it was confidential, didn't you?

138
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,700
- But…
- Well?

139
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,950
Why did you accept it in the first place?

140
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,950
Wasn't it because you wanted
the reward all for yourself?

141
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,290
So do the work by yourself.

142
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,000
If you can't, then say so.

143
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,790
The penalty will be all yours too.

144
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,850
It looks so pretty.

145
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,310
How should I repay you
for giving me such a precious gift?

146
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,650
What goes well with strawberry jam?

147
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,900
Scones! I should make scones.

148
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,440
Let's get the scone ingredients first!

149
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,030
But we…

150
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,410
You're lasting a pretty long time.

151
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,500
At this rate, this strawberry farm job
is going to be your longest gig.

152
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Right.

153
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,590
Getting paid 200,000 won a day
is a pretty sweet deal.

154
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,260
But what if you were offered a job
that pays 250,000 won right now?

155
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,260
We're organizing our warehouse next week.

156
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,930
Plus, it's not just for a day.

157
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,010
Four days!
That's a total of one million won.

158
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,980
What's with that reaction?

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,730
Did your blood sugar just spike
because the offer was too sweet?

160
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,150
Oh, me?

161
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,690
You want me to organize the warehouse?

162
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,070
So should I pay myself to organize it?

163
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,950
Put your muscles to good use.

164
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,620
But…

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,830
it's a really important time
for the strawberries right now.

166
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,620
What do you mean?

167
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,790
So you're turning down a job
that pays 250,000 won a day?

168
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,250
Are you really Mi-ji?

169
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,050
I would love to organize the warehouse.

170
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,050
But I need to finish up
what I started, so--

171
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,140
What's with that pointless sense
of responsibility?

172
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,390
It's just a temporary job.

173
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,890
"It's just a temporary job"?

174
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,390
Did you miss the village chief's warning
about not poaching other people's workers?

175
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,230
Why do you keep sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong?

176
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,400
And you stole my worker first.

177
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,780
She almost became our store's
assistant deputy manager.

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,030
That's a ridiculous job title.

179
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,990
Why are there so many job titles anyway?

180
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,990
Plus, she's my business partner.

181
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,870
Your "business partner."

182
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,960
- Are you willing to give her some land?
- I can. Can you?

183
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,170
Did you get one of these?

184
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,420
What is that?

185
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,220
My business partner made this herself.

186
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,050
It's 100% handmade strawberry jam.

187
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,890
As of now, I refuse to talk to anyone
who didn't receive one.

188
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,430
Are you saying she made this…

189
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,060
For him?

190
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,980
Mi-ji! That's not right.

191
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,820
You can't do this to me.

192
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,780
I just made it with the strawberries
from the farm, though.

193
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,740
But you've never made
anything like this for me.

194
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,750
Make me one too.
Make one using our store's strawberries!

195
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,420
- We're in public. Quiet down.
- Make me one too!

196
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,420
No, please don't get up.

197
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,140
Fortunately, there's nothing wrong
with your head or your bones.

198
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,270
Ma'am, have you ever been sick before?

199
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,100
Pardon?

200
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,150
You must've been in pain.

201
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,310
Did you have severe abdominal pain…

202
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,270
- Well…
- …or indigestion?

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,320
If you're talking about

204
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,660
the stomach issue I had
when I was younger…

205
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,870
Oh no! Ro-sa!

206
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,830
Ro-sa, are you okay? Oh dear…

207
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,540
Why is no one coming here to help her?

208
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,040
No, I just saw some gallstones on your CT.

209
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,750
- Gallstones?
- Yes.

210
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,590
I saw quite a few.

211
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,590
With this many gallstones,
the pain must've been unbearable.

212
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,550
Haven't you gone to see a doctor?

213
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,930
Oh, I…

214
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,060
I just thought it was due to old age.

215
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,900
Ro-sa, hang in there just a little longer.

216
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,070
Surgery?

217
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,740
They found gallstones
while doing a pelvic CT scan.

218
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,290
So she would've never known
if she hadn't hurt her back.

219
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,000
Hey, this is totally…

220
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,580
A disguise something…

221
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,130
Yes, a blessing in disguise.

222
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,670
It's not a major surgery,
so I got the earliest date possible.

223
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,220
Your friend is also very stubborn.

224
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,930
I told him it's fine, but he kept…

225
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,890
You're not okay.
You were just enduring it.

226
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,640
- Gosh.
- He's right.

227
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,180
You also hurt your back,

228
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,270
so just focus on your recovery
until the surgery.

229
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,140
You two make a great team.

230
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,560
Anyway, given my current situation,

231
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,400
he'll have to go alone
to that meeting we talked about.

232
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,740
It'll be easier
than dealing with an old lady

233
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,030
who doesn't know anything.

234
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,410
So when should I tell my company
you're available?

235
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,000
It doesn't matter to me.
Choose a day that works for you.

236
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,540
A day that works for me?

237
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,840
Then let me ask my team leader and…

238
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,090
Never mind. I'll just call him myself.

239
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,630
Why?

240
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,380
He might yell at you
since you're in the middle of it all.

241
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,550
We're the ones rescheduling,
so I'll tell him.

242
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,720
I can call your team leader, right?

243
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,760
<i>See?</i>

244
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,730
<i>He's making it so obvious</i>
<i>that he still likes Mi-rae.</i>

245
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,440
<i>Why is he pretending otherwise?</i>

246
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,600
<i>First love, my butt.</i>

247
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,110
Why are you looking at me like that?

248
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,360
Why Dusonbong Peak?

249
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,570
What?

250
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,080
I kept thinking about it
after what you told me.

251
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,120
Nothing special really happened
at Dusonbong Peak

252
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,460
for you to have fallen for her.

253
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,830
You wouldn't know.

254
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,300
You stayed at the foot
of the mountain instead of hiking.

255
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,720
But I saw the two of you come down.

256
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,640
Mi-ji! Ho-su! You brats!

257
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,770
- What took you so long?
<i>- Everyone was back except you two.</i>

258
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,850
<i>You showed up right before</i>
<i>the teachers went looking for you.</i>

259
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,730
Did you start liking her
because she helped you come down?

260
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,240
Mi-ji practically carried you down
on her back.

261
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,530
Was it because of a sense
of camaraderie or solidarity?

262
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,320
It happened when we were going up.

263
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,120
What?

264
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
I fell in love with her on the way up,
not coming down.

265
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,460
Anyway, I'll call you after we set a date.

266
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,260
What is he talking about?
He went up by himself.

267
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,010
What could it be?

268
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,720
HOW TO WRITE A PROJECT REPORT

269
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,220
There are so many places

270
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,220
that offer to write papers
and personal statements for a fee.

271
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,770
So why aren't there any places
that write reports?

272
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,350
Why is no one willing to write it? Jeez!

273
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,110
She threw a fit just over the meeting.

274
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,030
As soon as I mention the project report,
Mi-rae is going to kill me!

275
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,290
<i>Just stay put and don't do anything.</i>

276
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,620
Jeez! I'm so screwed!

277
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,380
What am I going to do?

278
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,090
Should I just write whatever I can?

279
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,760
But I need to know the basics
in order to write anything at all.

280
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,340
Damn it! I'm so screwed.

281
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,310
I'm seriously screwed.
What am I going to do?

282
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,590
MI-JI

283
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,730
- What?
<i>- You're alone now, right?</i>

284
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,690
Why?

285
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,820
Grandma wants to hear your voice.
Talk to her for a minute.

286
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,700
<i>Grandma, I'll go get more blankets.</i>

287
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,360
Grandma!

288
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,830
Goodness, you're going to make
my ears fall off.

289
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,120
Why did you suddenly become a baby?

290
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,290
Grandma, is Mi-rae doing a good job?

291
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,630
Are you okay?
Wait. Did you get your haircut?

292
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,210
Goodness, slow down.

293
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,930
Everything is good here.

294
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,140
Are you doing okay over there?

295
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,310
No, I'm not okay.

296
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,890
I don't know
what I'm doing here right now.

297
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,150
I don't know how to do anything,
but things keep happening.

298
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,440
<i>I'm living on edge every day.</i>

299
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,610
Mi-ji.

300
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,820
Do you remember the promise we made?

301
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,990
<i>Even though you're not here,</i>

302
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,040
I'm holding up my end of the promise.

303
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,040
<i>You will too, right?</i>

304
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,420
Whatever.

305
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,130
Don't ever forget our promise.

306
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,470
I'll call you again.

307
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,850
What promise?

308
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,110
It's a secret.

309
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,860
Jeez.

310
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,570
You two always have secrets of your own.

311
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,750
KFMC

312
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,750
REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FOR THE NEW HQ

313
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,850
Tae-i, do you have
the documents I requested?

314
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,140
AESIM-DONG
LAND LOT SIZE REPORT

315
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,980
I'm doing them in order.

316
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,020
Tae-i, can you do mine first?

317
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,690
I have to submit this
to the audit office, so I'm in a rush.

318
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,780
I'll do them in order.

319
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,990
Where are you going?

320
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,580
It's lunchtime.

321
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,710
Look at how he talks.
AI is probably more human than he is.

322
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,250
We hired him as a contract worker,

323
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,670
but he's acting all high-and-mighty
just because he's a data analyst!

324
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,720
He's telling us to do it ourselves
if we don't like it.

325
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,220
There's nothing we can do.

326
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,640
He can generate data in just a few hours,
whereas it would take us days to do it.

327
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,430
Beggars can't be choosers.

328
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,270
Are you okay? I'll do it.

329
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,190
Pardon?

330
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,190
I'll finish getting things ready here.
You go check on her.

331
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,210
It was you, right?

332
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,420
Pardon?

333
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,840
You left this for me, didn't you?

334
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,140
But I never asked you to do it.

335
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,980
So why did you do it
before everyone else's requests?

336
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,070
The CEO visited us recently,
so it seemed more urgent.

337
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,990
But you don't seem to prioritize things
solely based on urgency.

338
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,400
You do them in order.

339
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,530
What are you trying to say?

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,410
Please help me.

341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't.

342
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,340
I've never even written a report before.
How am I supposed--

343
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,510
I'm not asking you
to write the report for me.

344
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,680
If you just continue to help me
with things like this--

345
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,010
If you need documents, then request them.

346
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,310
You keep saying I helped you,
but providing documents is my job.

347
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,310
I wasn't going out of my way to help you.

348
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,810
You did help me.

349
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,600
You asked me if I was okay,
and you did my work for me.

350
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,110
So…

351
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,570
why did you take on this project
after laying low all this time?

352
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,030
Do you even know
who's in charge of the new HQ?

353
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,360
I…

354
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,580
I think I heard it was Mr. Park.

355
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,540
You accepted this project
knowing Mr. Park is in charge?

356
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,960
Anyway, I'm sure you're a pro
when it comes to paperwork.

357
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,090
You've probably written
countless project reports.

358
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,550
So even without my help, you'll--

359
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,710
I can't do it alone.

360
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,470
When someone is forced into a corner,

361
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,050
they become a mess.
They can't function like they usually do.

362
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,760
Don't I sound weird right now?

363
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,390
But you've been doing this for a while.

364
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,640
So I…

365
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>I'm sorry, Mi-rae.</i>

366
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,230
To be honest, I'm taking medications,
and I'm getting therapy too.

367
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,980
I cry every day. I can't sleep,
and I also have trouble breathing.

368
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,030
You saw me at the bus stop the other day.

369
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,740
I was sitting there
because I suddenly forgot how to walk.

370
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm not myself right now.

371
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,370
I really don't want to ask
for a favor like this,

372
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,500
and I know I look weird doing it.

373
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,080
But I really have no one to ask for help.

374
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,380
I mean, I'm asking you
of all people for help.

375
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,550
You just need data?

376
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,760
Yes.

377
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,430
I'll prioritize your data.

378
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,720
Tell me what you need.

379
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,180
Please just give me everything.

380
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,900
What do you mean by "everything"?

381
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,520
Any project reports or documents
that you think seem relevant.

382
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,690
Just give me everything!

383
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,570
Tae-i, are you done with mine yet?
I'm in a rush.

384
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,160
Tae-i, what about mine?

385
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,000
AESIM-DONG 1-GA RESIDENT DEMOGRAPHICS

00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,170
Damn it.

A STUDY ON WAYS TO EXPAND

00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,430
TOTAL OF 32 KPIS

390
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,430
I see.

391
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,100
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR

392
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,100
Given that it was the most critical issue,

393
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,070
we anticipate that
it will positively impact the KPIs too.

394
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,570
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR

395
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,030
Next is the website management…

HOW TO WRITE A TABLE OF CONTENTS
WRITE CONTENT TO MATCH TABLE

397
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,550
TABLE OF CONTENTS

398
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,970
20% OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS LONG-TERM

399
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,790
Everyone is desperate to get a job.

400
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,760
<i>- Twenty percent are unemployed.</i>
- Why would he quit his perfectly good job?

401
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>More than half of them are youths…</i>

402
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,560
Who quit?

403
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,560
You didn't hear about it
when you were making jam?

404
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,150
Ho-su quit his job at the law firm.

405
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,400
Ho-su? Why?

406
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,900
How would I know that
when his own mom doesn't?

407
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,030
How could he just suddenly quit

408
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,660
when his mom worked so hard
to support him?

409
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,540
That brat, Bun-hong, used to always brag

410
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,790
about how it's one of the top three
law firms in the country.

411
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,670
But these days, she's really down.

412
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,170
He must have had a good reason.
Maybe the law firm was the problem.

413
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,840
Even if there was a problem,
it was probably his fault.

414
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,800
You know Ho-su was always like that.

415
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,810
He had a hard time adjusting to school.

416
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,470
He was probably the same at the office.

417
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,270
People who have issues…

418
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,440
always take their issues with them
wherever they go.

419
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,860
Give me that towel.

420
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,790
You set up your own firm? Out of the blue?

421
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,210
Where's your office?

422
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,380
I just filed a business registration
to help someone I know.

423
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,550
You? Who is this person?

424
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,970
That crochet lady from before?

425
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,770
I'm telling you,
she and I are just friends.

426
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,430
Your face tells me a different story.

427
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,060
I might receive
a wedding invitation next spring.

428
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,450
She's my first love's twin.

429
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,000
What?

430
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,330
So you're saying…

431
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,840
that the crochet lady
is your first love's twin?

432
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,920
They look the same?

433
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,420
Yes, they're identical.

434
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,380
Did it work out with your first love?

435
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,180
No, there was nothing like that.
We were just too young.

436
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,890
I see.

437
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,020
You're trying to make it work
with your unrequited first love's twin?

438
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,480
That's a bit strange.

439
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,060
I told you that it's not like that.

440
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,730
There's nothing going on between us,
and I'll make sure it doesn't.

441
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,940
You'll make sure it doesn't?

442
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,660
- So there is something between you two.
- There isn't.

443
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,620
So did you ever tell your first love
how you felt?

444
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,000
- No, it was just one-sided.
- Does the crochet lady know?

445
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,790
That her twin was your first love?

446
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,380
- I thought she did.
- Yes.

447
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,840
But now she's acting like she never knew.

448
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,090
That's good.
Then there's nothing stopping you two.

449
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,340
You can go out with the crochet lady now…

450
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,100
Wait. Hold on.

451
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,310
You don't still have feelings
for your first love, do you?

452
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
- Pardon?
- I mean, look at this.

453
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,610
They look the same.

454
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,280
But you only liked one of them.

455
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,280
She must've been different somehow,
but now you're attracted to the other one.

456
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,490
Has your taste changed?

457
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,830
Or are you looking
for your first love in the other twin?

458
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,420
See, I knew it!

459
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,090
It's important to figure out how you feel.

460
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,590
Things could get weird
if you're not careful.

461
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,220
Fine.

462
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,590
At times like this,
there's only one solution.

463
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,850
<i>Since you have nothing to do,</i>
<i>go see for yourself.</i>

464
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,890
<i>Once you see her,</i>
<i>you'll know right away who you like.</i>

465
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,100
If you had called me yesterday,
I would've gone grocery shopping.

466
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,400
You came all this way,
but there's not much to eat here.

467
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,240
It's okay.
I'm only here for a short visit.

468
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,740
A short visit? You won't spend the night?

469
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,620
I even cleaned your room.

470
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,500
I have somewhere to go
tomorrow afternoon for work.

471
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,670
I see. You have work.

472
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,800
Why did you buy so much stuff?

473
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,590
You bought two of the same thing.

474
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,550
One is for next door.

475
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,100
Even for your neighbors? My gosh.

476
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,720
- I'll make sure to…
- I'll…

477
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,730
I'll give it to them myself
before I leave.

478
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,850
You will?

479
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,770
Okay.

480
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,030
Step on the clutch and--

481
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,700
That's why you should change gears
after you step on the clutch.

482
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,750
I was surprised
when you asked me for a ride.

483
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,630
Did you want to give me a driving lesson?

484
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,920
There are no tricks or tips
for driving manual.

485
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,420
You just drive every day
and get used to it.

486
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,760
You're so alike.

487
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,600
What do you mean?

488
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,640
I once said you reminded me of someone.

489
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,390
You're just like my grandfather.

490
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,020
- Pardon?
- What's with that reaction?

491
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,690
It is a big compliment.

492
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,360
My grandfather
was my favorite person in the world.

493
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,610
I see.

494
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,700
I mean it.

495
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,410
Grandpa, should I stop over there?

496
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,170
Well, drive safely.

497
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,010
I will. Oh, wait, the scones!

498
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,140
I got all the ingredients to make scones.

499
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,520
But the oven I ordered has been stuck
at a distribution center for days.

500
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,350
Anyway, as soon as I have an oven,

501
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,980
I'll officially invite you
to an afternoon tea party.

502
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,150
Gosh, it's okay. You don't have to.

503
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,110
Mi-ji?

504
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,850
You dyed your hair.

505
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,220
It looks good.

506
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,060
Yes, I guess.

507
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,810
So, what brings you here?

508
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,980
I just stopped by my house.

509
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,740
I recently left the firm.

510
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,240
I see.

511
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,380
Who was that earlier?

512
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,420
I've never seen him before.

513
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,670
He's just someone I work with.

514
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,930
Work?

515
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,970
Did you start a new job?

516
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,060
Didn't you say
you had something to tell me?

517
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,140
Yes.

518
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,770
It's nothing special.

519
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,690
These days…

520
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,150
I've had a lot of time to think
since I quit my job.

521
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,110
So I've been thinking
a lot about the past.

522
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,910
And it brought back memories
of our time in high school.

523
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,540
By any chance…

524
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,580
do you remember the day
we hiked up Dusonbong Peak?

525
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,130
What?

526
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,920
Dusonbong Peak?

527
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,590
Yes.

528
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,640
Sometimes…

529
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,970
I still think about the time
we spent together at the top.

530
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,120
Now that you're here,
there isn't much to see, is there?

531
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,830
So why did you try so hard
to come up here?

532
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,830
Because I don't want to live.

533
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,460
What?

534
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,540
I felt that…

535
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,340
if I couldn't even climb
a mountain like this,

536
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,760
then I would rather die.

537
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,390
Why are you so dramatic?

538
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,480
We should go down now.

539
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,790
Aren't you hot?

540
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,920
Take it off.

541
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,710
<i>Looking back now…</i>

542
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,670
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>a turning point in my life.</i>

543
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,760
<i>If I hadn't made it all the way</i>
<i>to the top that day…</i>

544
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,270
<i>I would be a very different person.</i>

545
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,440
I mean, I'm not saying that
I'm doing exceptionally well right now.

546
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,110
But I would've turned out even worse.

547
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,030
So, I know it's late…

548
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,990
but I wanted to thank you.

549
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,160
I went all the way to the top that day…

550
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,340
because of you, Mi-ji.

551
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,510
Because of me?

552
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,760
Yes.

553
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
I see.

554
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,820
If you have nothing else to say,
should we get going now?

555
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,330
Okay.

556
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,910
I'm sorry I took up your time.

557
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,460
Oh, and take this.

558
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,390
Why does she seem
so different from before?

559
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm off now.

560
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,820
Did I keep you from leaving?

561
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,320
No, I still had work to do.

562
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,710
Wait.

563
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,250
Have you eaten yet?

564
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,590
We're all doing this to make a living,

565
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,170
so we should eat well.

566
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,680
That chair's broken. You should sit here.

567
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,600
This project was forced on you,
but I guess you still want to do it.

568
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,100
You look way more comfortable than before.

569
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,190
My gosh, have you been observing me?

570
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,110
Why?

571
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,150
- I'll get going now.
- Okay, fine.

572
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,280
Gosh, I was just kidding.
Eat before you go.

573
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,160
Here…

574
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,580
I hope you enjoy it.

575
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,470
It's good.

576
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,770
I'm really curious, though.

577
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,100
Why are you helping me?

578
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,400
I wasn't going to ask,

579
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,490
but I feel a little uneasy
because you're helping me so much.

580
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,400
- Why do you feel uneasy?
- Because I don't know why you're helping.

581
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,700
I'm wondering if you're a spy
sent by Director Choi.

582
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,250
Isn't it a little too late
to be suspicious?

583
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,710
You're right.

584
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,460
You're going through
way too much trouble to be a spy.

585
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,710
You helped me before.

586
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,590
Pardon?

587
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,470
You may not remember,

588
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,970
but I owe you a big favor.

589
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,020
<i>Mi-rae, you know Kim Tae-i, right?</i>

590
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,980
STRAWBERRY CULTIVATION

591
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,730
- The actress?
<i>- No.</i>

592
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,230
Tae-i, not Tae-hee.

593
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,360
You know, that contract worker
on your team?

594
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
That person's name is Kim Tae-i?

595
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,330
So?

596
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,620
Did you ever help him?

597
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,580
Or do you know him somehow?

598
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,130
Not at all.
I've never spoken to him before. Why?

599
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,300
This is just my gut feeling.

600
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,890
But I think he likes you.

601
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,720
What are you talking about?
That's so random.

602
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,430
Did something happen?

603
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,230
What? No, nothing happened.

604
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:33,570
It's just that I sensed a romantic vibe.

605
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,190
I told you that I've never spoken to him.

606
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,650
By the way,

607
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,660
I met Ho-su today.
He said he quit his job.

608
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,320
What? He left the firm?

609
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,750
But why did he suddenly show up there?

610
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,210
I don't know. He said he wanted
to talk to me out of the blue.

611
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,630
And he randomly started talking
about Dusonbong Peak.

612
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,090
Dusonbong Peak? What about it?

613
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,050
<i>He just said</i>
<i>that it was a turning point in his life.</i>

614
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,010
He thanked you.

615
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,930
He said he made it to the top
because of you.

616
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,220
Because of me?

617
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,850
Why did he randomly bring that up?

618
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,190
Are you okay?

619
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,440
It was a bit awkward.

620
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,730
I was afraid
that he'd recognize me, but he didn't.

621
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,150
That's not what I meant.

622
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,870
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

623
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,040
I know that you two dated in the past.

624
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,620
<i>What?</i>

625
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,670
Are you saying that because of that rumor?

626
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,840
You two came to my race that day,
and you were hugging.

627
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,510
What?

628
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,560
You're talking about the day
you got hurt, right?

629
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,180
I was sick that day.

630
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,980
You were sick?

631
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
95TH NATIONAL SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIP

632
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,810
<i>I wasn't feeling well,</i>

633
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,860
<i>but I had an academic competition</i>
<i>that day.</i>

634
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,360
<i>Honestly, I don't know</i>
<i>how I even managed to get there.</i>

635
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,280
The others are over there. Let's go.

636
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,660
What's wrong? Are you okay?

637
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,370
I'm fine. It's okay.

638
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,420
Mi-rae!

639
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,590
Mi-rae, wake up! Hey!

640
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,630
Hey!

641
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,800
<i>Don't tell them?</i>

642
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,050
Even if you don't want to,
you should tell them that you're sick.

643
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,130
No.

644
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,220
I'll be hospitalized
the moment my family finds out.

645
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,430
I can't tell them until the CSAT is over.

646
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,400
What's the point of taking the CSAT
when you're this sick?

647
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,480
You know how it is.

648
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,530
You know what it means.

649
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,110
You know how crappy it feels
when your body doesn't listen to you.

650
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,200
It's bad enough
that my own body won't listen to me.

651
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,120
I don't need anything else
being out of my control.

652
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,000
So…

653
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,630
don't tell anyone.

654
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,420
Even Mi-ji.

655
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Why…

656
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,680
Why didn't you tell me that?

657
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,430
I just told you.
It was a secret until I took the CSAT.

658
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,480
<i>Ho-su didn't tell you after that?</i>

659
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,190
He didn't.

660
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,900
Why didn't you tell me after the CSAT?

661
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
You know how things were after the CSAT.

662
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,740
How could I tell you
when you refused to even see me?

663
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,120
But…

664
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,870
You could've at least told me later.

665
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,120
<i>Why would I when you never asked about it?</i>

666
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,080
<i>And you were dating Gyeong-gu back then.</i>

667
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,170
<i>I thought you weren't interested in Ho-su.</i>

668
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,670
Did you like him?

669
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,590
No.

670
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,220
Why did Ho-su send mixed signals?

671
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,470
<i>You confused him back then.</i>

672
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,770
What did I do?

673
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,150
Who knew you'd suddenly
start dating Gyeong-gu?

674
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,110
But Ho-su was very obvious
about his feelings.

675
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,440
He even treated you and me differently.

676
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,190
<i>You had a feeling, didn't you?</i>

677
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,570
Then why was there a rumor
that you two were dating?

678
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,200
Is that so important?

679
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,830
I told you it wasn't true.

680
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,540
Is it my job to figure out why
people said that when it's not even true?

681
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,670
No.

682
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,540
That's not what I'm saying.

683
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,590
<i>Why are you suddenly getting upset?</i>

684
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,430
I don't know why.

685
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,850
People just saw what they wanted to
and spread rumors.

686
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,810
Let's stop talking about this. I'm tired.

687
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,730
Okay. Good night.

688
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,720
<i>That was it?</i>

689
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,760
<i>We ended up like this</i>
<i>over a simple misunderstanding?</i>

690
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,940
<i>I didn't have the courage</i>
<i>to ask about what happened,</i>

691
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,820
<i>so I gave up on my life,</i>
<i>running, and even Ho-su.</i>

692
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,690
What have I been doing?

693
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,370
Who had a lovers' quarrel?

694
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,710
Mi-ji, Ok-hui's daughter.

695
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,670
She's in a love triangle.

696
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,500
A love triangle? With whom?

697
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,590
You know, the mart owner's son
and the grandson from Changhwa Farm.

698
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,140
They were arguing over Mi-ji.

699
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,520
Gyeong-gu threw a fit, demanding
that Mi-ji give him some jam as well.

700
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,100
He ended up on the floor
like a kid throwing a tantrum.

701
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,900
My goodness, in front of everybody?

702
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,820
Goodness, you know how it is
to get into a lovers' quarrel at that age.

703
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,070
- You're right…
- Oh my gosh!

704
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,490
Who did she give the jam to?

705
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,110
Pardon?

706
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,870
Who was it?

707
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,830
Enjoy.

708
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,540
What is up with you? Jeez…

709
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,460
Why are you smiling so much?

710
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,880
It seems like the long winter is over

711
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,010
and the flowers are in full bloom
for our dear Mi-ji.

712
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,760
What are you talking about?

713
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,010
I don't know if I should tell you this.

714
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,520
- Whatever. I'm just going to tell you.
- I hope you enjoy your food.

715
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,400
Mi-ji has fallen in love.

716
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
What?

717
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm sorry. Enjoy.

718
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,030
What in the world are you talking about?

719
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
With whom?

720
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,620
The strawberry farm owner
she's working with.

721
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,080
When you work with someone,
you start developing feelings for them.

722
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,090
That's how I met my husband.

723
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,090
Don't say such ridiculous things.

724
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,050
Why is that ridiculous?

725
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,470
Mi-ji is 30 years old.
She should be dating at her age.

726
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,470
And it seems like
she's found her calling these days.

727
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,810
It would be nice if they got married
and worked on the farm together.

728
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,730
Are you saying those awful things
because she's not your daughter?

729
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,860
Mi-ji doesn't have a lot going for her,

730
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,480
so I should just marry her off,
is that it?

731
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,440
- What are you talking about?
- Jeez.

732
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,450
Hey, what's wrong with getting married?

733
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,030
I think getting married
was the best decision I ever made.

734
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,290
If marriage is so wonderful,
then why not marry off your son?

735
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,160
Switch places with me.

736
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,550
This is confidential,
so don't share it with anyone yet.

737
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,880
NEW HQ AND LRT LINE INTEGRATION

738
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,090
The city has agreed to it.

739
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,720
Whether the project proceeds
as planned depends on that building.

740
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,050
What was it called again?

741
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,390
- Rosa Restaurant, sir.
- Right.

742
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,850
The General Affairs Team told me
that there's been some progress.

743
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,730
Yes, we're meeting with the landowner's
legal representative today.

744
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,150
I heard the landowner
was giving us trouble.

745
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,480
But I guess things worked out,
seeing as you're having a meeting.

746
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,900
Who's in charge of it?

747
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,030
Me, sir.

748
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,410
You're in charge?

749
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,820
It's my department's job.

750
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,660
So I should be responsible for it
from start to finish.

751
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,080
Okay. I trust you'll do well.

752
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,960
Do well on this,
and you may get promoted this time.

753
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,590
Yes, I'll do my best.

754
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,220
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes, sir.

755
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,260
Please tell the General Affairs Team
not to attend today's meeting. I'll go.

756
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,560
- You're going, sir?
- Yes. Is the room ready?

757
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,350
I was just about to…

758
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,770
Why haven't you started yet?
Look at the time.

759
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,440
Everyone, get the meeting room ready!

760
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,480
Yes, sir. Get it ready.

761
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,570
What's wrong with Director Choi today?

762
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,990
What's he up to?

763
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,950
You don't have any hacking skills, do you?

764
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
I think I can go steal a cell phone.

765
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,040
Wow…

766
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,800
Mi-rae got her claws into a kid this time.

767
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,970
If she's smart,
she should avoid married men.

768
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,350
I'm sure she doesn't want
to get slapped again at Gwanghwamun.

769
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,640
Right.

770
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,060
How did she manage
to seduce that guy when he's like a robot?

771
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,100
You know she's an expert at that.

772
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,900
She pretends to have feelings for you,

773
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,570
only to abandon you once you're useless
and then play the victim.

774
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,700
Women like her
are a disgrace to the rest of us.

775
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,530
Do you know that statement

776
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,790
could get you up to five years in prison
or a ten-million-won fine?

777
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,740
Pardon?

778
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,660
Publicly stating false facts
about a specific individual constitutes

779
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,790
the crime of defamation under Article 307,
Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Act.

780
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,510
If this falls under workplace harassment,
then a civil lawsuit may be possible too.

781
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,300
We were just talking to each other.
How is that a public statement?

782
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,800
But I heard you.

783
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,690
- What the hell?
- Come in.

784
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,030
Ho-su--

785
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,110
My name is Lee Ho-su.
I'm Ms. Ro-sa's legal representative.

786
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,450
Where should I sit?

787
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,120
Okay.

788
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,000
Please come this way.

789
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,750
When you look at the first page--

790
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,710
If you read it, I'm sure you'll see

791
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,670
that the proposed amount is nearly 40%
higher than the local market average.

792
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,050
Yes.

793
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,180
As for the retail spaces
within the new headquarters--

794
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,100
We also plan
to guarantee the landowner priority

795
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,720
for leasing a retail space,
if that is her preference,

796
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,440
so she may continue operating
her current restaurant.

797
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,490
Exactly who is in charge of this matter?

798
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,110
It's me.

799
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,870
So, you're Director Choi.

800
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,960
It's the same proposal
you sent last time, isn't it?

801
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,630
Yes. Probably.

802
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,260
My client has stated that
she won't sell under these terms.

803
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,100
From our standpoint, these terms
are already pushing the limits.

804
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,390
Other landowners who've already sold
may even complain if they find out.

805
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,190
Doesn't that mean that it's a site
that you need to secure,

806
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,230
even if it means
you have to go beyond your limits?

807
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,900
Yes, then…

808
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,570
Are there any additional terms
you would like?

809
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,450
That's something you should propose.
Persuading the landowner isn't my job.

810
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,370
I see. Then we'll continue
to visit her and…

811
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,910
And my client feels uncomfortable

812
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,880
with negotiations
that try to sway her emotionally

813
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,550
through individual employees.

814
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,800
From now on, I kindly request

815
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,970
that only Director Choi, who is in charge,
convey the company's official stance

816
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,850
directly through me,
Ms. Ro-sa's representative.

817
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,270
Yes, of course.

818
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,040
Hey, Ho-su!

819
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,290
Ho-su.

820
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,330
You were just going to leave
without saying goodbye?

821
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,540
Bye.

822
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,630
That's all you have to say?

823
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,760
Why did you follow me in here?
What if someone sees us?

824
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,220
Who cares if they do?

825
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,760
No good will come
from anyone seeing us together.

826
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,970
Let's keep our personal
and work lives separate.

827
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,520
Is that what you were doing
when you took my side earlier?

828
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,140
What do you mean?

829
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,850
Didn't you help me earlier?

830
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,360
Why would I help you?

831
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,570
Why are you suddenly getting annoyed?
I was just thanking you.

832
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,820
Hey!

833
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,030
What's wrong with him?

834
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,340
TEA PARTY AT CHANGHWA FARM
TOMORROW AFTERNOON

835
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,770
Who are you texting?

836
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
The strawberry farm owner.

837
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,980
<i>Mi-ji has fallen in love.</i>

838
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,280
<i>The strawberry farm owner</i>
<i>she's working with.</i>

839
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,700
How old is the strawberry farm owner?

840
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,950
Is he pretty old?

841
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,210
I've never asked, so I don't know.

842
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,710
How could you not even ask that?

843
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,920
Jeez.

844
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,590
You need to be able
to take care of yourself

845
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,420
before dating or getting married.

846
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,390
Relying on a man
just because your future looks uncertain

847
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,180
is one of the quickest ways
to ruin your life.

848
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,480
You don't have to look far.
I'm living proof of what happens.

849
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,060
Do you want to end up like me?

850
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,190
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

851
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,950
I hear you're seeing
the strawberry farm owner.

852
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,160
No wonder you've stuck
with this job for so long!

853
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,870
Is it because you're dating him?

854
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,540
Are people saying that?

855
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,210
Is it not true?
Is that just a false rumor?

856
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,260
They're already saying I am,
so does my response even matter?

857
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,510
Stop playing games with me.
Is it true or not?

858
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,300
It's not true.

859
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,510
It's not?

860
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,480
Jeez, I knew it.

861
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,520
These ridiculous stories are made up
by people with nothing better to do.

862
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,070
- Goodness.
- You believed them.

863
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,280
I didn't believe them.

864
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,570
It's just that there's never been a rumor
about you and a man before.

865
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,370
So I thought there might be
something going on.

866
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,130
Mi-ji, why aren't you eating?

867
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,950
It's confidential information,
so make sure it doesn't get leaked.

868
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,620
As you can tell, that restaurant
is the key to our new HQ project.

869
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,580
But the landowner has suddenly appointed
a legal representative, so…

870
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:15,340
But there's not much we can do
since the landowner doesn't want to sell.

871
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,010
Her legal representative is Mr. Lee Ho-su.

872
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,340
Do you know him?

873
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,390
Yes, he used to work at our law firm.

874
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,680
Are you just looking for assistance
in purchasing Rosa Restaurant?

875
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,310
Yes, do you have any way…

876
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,480
Give me all the information
you have concerning this case.

877
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,150
I'll take this on.

878
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
Welcome.

879
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,840
Please come this way.

880
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,170
Should I take your hat?

881
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,880
I…

882
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,720
I quit.

883
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,300
I went overboard, didn't I? I'm sorry.

884
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,180
Please have a seat.

885
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,270
Wait. You're really quitting?
Just like that?

886
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,860
Why? Did I do something wrong?

887
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,400
No, it's nothing like that.

888
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,620
But you didn't say anything yesterday.

889
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,490
We've just planted the strawberries,
and they're growing steadily.

890
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:30,290
We also need to work on the tarp.
I can't do it all by myself.

891
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,620
I'm sorry.

892
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,670
Wait. Hold on.

893
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,680
At least tell me why.

894
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,220
Even if you're a temporary worker,
we've been working together for a while.

895
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,850
- If you tell me the problem--
- It's my problem.

896
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,100
Thank you for everything.

897
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,740
NEW HQ PROJECT REPORT

898
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,460
Sir, here's the new HQ project report.

899
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

900
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
Pardon?

901
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,900
Look at these sentences.

902
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,450
The bullet points don't align either.

903
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,750
All the tables have different units.
Some are in thousands and some aren't.

904
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,630
And why didn't you cite your source here?

905
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,840
Who submits a report like this to the CEO?

906
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,340
Did you just wing this
because you didn't want to do it?

907
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,680
Or is this the best you can do?

908
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,640
I'm sorry. I was a bit careless
because I was in a hurry.

909
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,760
You were careless? So you did wing this?

910
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:14,770
Take it.

911
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,810
I'm sorry. I'll fix it right away and--

912
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,020
Forget it.

913
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,280
I'll fix it, so give me
the original file and the raw data.

914
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,190
You should've just passed this
onto me sooner.

915
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,650
What were you doing until now?

916
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,490
Are you trying to make my life harder?

917
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,530
Go.

918
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,680
RAW DATA
UNPROCESSED DATA

919
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,570
I WILL BE TAKING A SHORT BREAK
DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES

920
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,690
Yes, ma'am.

921
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,530
I took a look around the restaurant.
Everything is fine.

922
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,160
Don't worry.
I hope your surgery goes well tomorrow.

923
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,490
After the surgery, I…

924
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,330
Is the restaurant closed again?

925
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:20,080
Yes, the owner is sick, so…

926
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,840
Ho-su.

927
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,680
Thanks.

928
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,940
- Thanks for the drink.
- Try this.

929
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,440
This is their signature drink.

930
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,730
It's okay. I'll drink this…

931
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:45,030
Come on. Give that to me.

932
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,690
This is my drink. Hurry up and try it.

933
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,330
It's good.

934
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,580
You always drink Americanos, don't you?

935
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,540
Drinks like this are fun.
You should try them sometimes.

936
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,510
Anyway, why did you come
to the restaurant?

937
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,840
- For work?
- Yes.

938
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,300
Our next theme is retro.

939
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,720
I went there a few times
to bring Ms. Ro-sa on board.

940
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,140
I never expected to see you there, Ho-su.

941
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,270
Did Mi-rae ask for your help?

942
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,190
- Mi-rae?
- Yes.

943
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,310
Didn't she ask for your help
because she was busy?

944
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Mi-rae's great-aunt runs that place.

945
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,400
- Great-aunt?
- Yes.

946
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,030
You didn't know?

947
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,410
I didn't know.

948
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,580
I'm the owner's legal representative.

949
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,160
I see.

950
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,540
I just assumed you were there
because of Mi-rae.

951
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,800
Why?

952
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,760
It's not like that.

953
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,260
Well, you two are always together.

954
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,260
And you also arrived
at the high school reunion together.

955
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,970
Plus, back in the day, there was a rumor
that you two were dating.

956
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,650
I wanted to ask you about that.

957
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,190
Why did that rumor start?

958
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,690
That's because…

959
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,070
you two gave off similar vibes
and you seemed so alike.

960
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,570
You always hung out together
and skipped school on the same days.

961
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,410
That's because we were the only ones
in the academic competition prep class…

962
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,120
Anyway, we didn't date.

963
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,130
Then what about now?

964
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,880
What do you think of Mi-rae now?

965
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,060
Are you interested in anyone?

966
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,260
What are you doing by yourself?

967
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,600
I'm so sorry that things
turned out this way

968
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,600
even after you helped me.

969
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,160
Why did you do that earlier?

970
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,580
What do you mean?

971
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,620
The report…

972
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,250
You didn't wing it.

973
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,510
You worked hard on it
day and night, so why…

974
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,050
I didn't want him to know.

975
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:04,980
Know what?

976
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,730
That I did my best.

977
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,860
If that were the best I could do,

978
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,570
I'd feel so small and pathetic.

979
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,870
That's why I lied
about not giving it my all.

980
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,500
I thought it'd be better for him
to think I'm lazy than incompetent.

981
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,130
Even though I made a promise…

982
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,060
You're not yourself right now, though.

983
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,850
But you managed to do all that on your own
despite what you're going through.

984
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,110
I know, right?

985
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,150
To be honest,

986
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:58,240
it's a miracle that I managed
to even make that report.

987
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,910
But no one knows that.

988
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,620
Yes.

989
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,040
They shouldn't know.

990
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,790
If you're having a hard time,

991
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,790
why don't you take a short break?

992
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,880
If you rest a little
and take some time for yourself…

993
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,180
Absolutely not.

994
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,140
That's really dangerous.

995
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,600
That's how I ended up
holing myself up in my room.

996
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,060
Holed up?

997
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,770
Don't even get me started.

998
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,230
Once you go in there,
it's so hard to come out.

999
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,150
So how did you get out?

1000
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,700
How did I get out?

1001
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,710
My grandma…

1002
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,080
asked for me.

1003
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
<i>Mi-ji.</i>

1004
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,170
Mi-ji.

1005
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,840
Grandma keeps asking for you.

1006
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,810
She can't even walk now.

1007
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,940
She's bedridden.

1008
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,480
You need to go see her.

1009
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,110
She said she has something to tell you.

1010
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,780
So she'll be waiting for your visit.

1011
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,050
I somehow managed to go out
on the day she collapsed.

1012
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,970
But I couldn't bring myself

1013
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,600
to keep going out
just because I did it once.

1014
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,140
<i>I was such an idiot.</i>

1015
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,120
<i>But all of a sudden,</i>

1016
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,240
<i>for some reason, I thought of someone.</i>

1017
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,700
I felt that…

1018
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,710
if I couldn't even climb
a mountain like this,

1019
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,090
then I would rather die.

1020
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,220
<i>So I thought to myself,</i>

1021
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:32,180
<i>"If I can't even go see Grandma today…</i>

1022
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,600
<i>then I should just die."</i>

1023
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,730
Yesterday is over.
Tomorrow is yet to come.

1024
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,980
Yesterday is over.
Tomorrow is yet to come.

1025
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,740
Yesterday is over.
Tomorrow is yet to come.

1026
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,820
Yesterday is over.
Tomorrow is yet to come.

1027
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,030
<i>Yesterday is over.</i>
<i>Tomorrow is yet to come.</i>

1028
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,780
And so…

1029
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,000
A trip that would usually take me
30 minutes on foot…

1030
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,590
It…

1031
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,670
took me…

1032
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,010
four hours for me to get to her.

1033
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,040
Grandma!

1034
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,010
Grandma!

1035
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,680
- Grandma…
- My goodness, sweetie.

1036
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,510
I knew you'd come.

1037
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,390
I knew you would, sweetie.

1038
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,560
I'm sorry, Grandma. It's my fault.

1039
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,360
It's not your fault, Mi-ji.

1040
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,410
I asked you to come
so I could tell you that.

1041
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,620
Now that I'm bedridden,

1042
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,250
I finally understand how you feel.

1043
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,750
I'm old, but I'm scared too.

1044
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:30,970
So I can only imagine how scary
and difficult it must've been for you.

1045
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,140
But you know,

1046
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:38,520
I've realized something
now that you're here.

1047
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,390
Just like your name means "unknown,"

1048
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,190
we don't know yet.

1049
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,490
Yesterday is over.
Tomorrow is yet to come.

1050
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:57,120
But today is yet unknown, Mi-ji.

1051
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,330
So…

1052
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,170
let's live today.

1053
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,090
I'll do my best to live somehow.

1054
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:12,430
So I want you to live too.

1055
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,510
Yes…

1056
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,560
Promise me…

1057
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,060
that you'll never run away from anything.

1058
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:25,940
Promise me…

1059
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,820
now.

1060
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:35,490
Together, let's endure one day at a time.

1061
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,450
Yes.

1062
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,960
From that day,

1063
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:58,930
I've endured one day at a time
and made it to today.

1064
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,890
I had no idea.

1065
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,190
I didn't know you'd been through so much.

1066
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,570
What's the point, though?

1067
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,280
I promised her
that I wouldn't run away from anything.

1068
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,780
But I broke that promise today.

1069
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,910
You didn't break your promise.

1070
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,500
You didn't run away,
and you submitted the report.

1071
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,540
I lied.

1072
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,090
I could've just said,

1073
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,420
"I'm sorry."

1074
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,170
"Even though I did my best,

1075
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:38,470
this is all I can do."

1076
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,810
But… I lied.

1077
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,230
No one knows that, though.

1078
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:50,860
That you lied.

1079
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,110
But I know.

1080
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:00,990
To be honest, I got a bit hopeful today.

1081
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,210
It's been a while since I've put
all my effort into something.

1082
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,500
I should've expected
that I wouldn't do well.

1083
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,960
But I really wanted to do a good job.

1084
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,640
So I guess I didn't want to find out

1085
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,890
that this is all I am.

1086
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,850
But…

1087
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,400
I can't fool myself.

1088
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,320
I should just accept it.

1089
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,110
But I can't.

1090
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:44,080
That's why I've spent my whole life
running away like this. I'm an idiot.

1091
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,850
Thank you for the ride.

1092
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:14,480
I'll see you later.

1093
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,860
Wait, Ho-su.

1094
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:19,950
Here.

1095
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,200
And this too.

1096
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,870
What's all this?

1097
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,080
I collected these souvenirs
from the restaurants I covered.

1098
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,420
There's a lot of interesting food,
so try one at a time.

1099
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,960
You didn't have to.

1100
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,920
Thanks.

1101
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,050
How was today?

1102
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:45,970
Didn't you have fun going to new places
and trying new foods with me today?

1103
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,930
Yes, I got to experience new things,
thanks to you.

1104
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,690
Then…

1105
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,730
can I call you again?

1106
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:59,280
You don't need my permission for that.

1107
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,610
Let's see each other again.

1108
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,830
I'll make sure that you have
a really good time, Ho-su.

1109
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,300
I'm home.

1110
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,600
About Ms. Yu…

1111
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:32,730
I think I should keep helping her.

1112
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,860
I think I have to.

1113
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,670
PLEATED SEA SQUIRT SSAM-JEOT

1114
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,420
MINT CHOCOLATE HIGHBALL

1115
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:05,930
YU MI-RAE

1116
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,770
MISSED CALL
YU MI-RAE

1117
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,700
YU MI-RAE

1118
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,790
What is it?

1119
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,460
<i>Hey! Ho-su!</i>

1120
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,790
<i>Come out!</i>

1121
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:45,170
Ho-su…

1122
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,590
Come out.

1123
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,680
Hello?

1124
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,310
- Mi-rae.
- Where…

1125
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,810
You…

1126
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,060
Oh, hey!

1127
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,480
Why are you so drunk?

1128
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,650
Jeez. Hey.

1129
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,990
When a woman's dealing
with work and life,

1130
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:13,160
there are days
when you get drunk like this,

1131
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,790
and there are days when you get upset.

1132
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:20,080
You should've gone home if you were drunk.
Why did you come here?

1133
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,630
Why, you little…

1134
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:25,720
Hey, Ho-su. Are you going
to keep treating me like this?

1135
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,970
What did I do?

1136
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:32,140
You jerk.

1137
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,230
You keep confusing me,
sending me mixed signals.

1138
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,640
When did I ever do that?

1139
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,440
"When did I ever do that?"

1140
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,940
My gosh.

1141
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,150
Hey, you know what?

1142
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:47,990
I found it a bit odd when you started
talking about your first love.

1143
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,740
If you like Mi-ji,

1144
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,280
why can't you just tell me
why you like her?

1145
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,450
Why were you going on
about Dusonbong Peak instead?

1146
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,960
Are you playing Twenty Questions
with me right now?

1147
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,000
Why…

1148
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,250
are you curious about that?

1149
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,090
You made me curious.

1150
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:08,800
Hey, and another thing…

1151
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:13,010
You definitely went up
to Dusonbong Peak by yourself.

1152
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:14,890
So…

1153
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,480
So how could you have fallen for her
when you were going up?

1154
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,480
What do you mean by that?

1155
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,940
You really…

1156
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:25,820
Explain yourself.

1157
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:32,030
Explain exactly what you meant.

1158
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,620
Jeez…

1159
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,540
Well?

1160
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,420
Mi-ji wasn't there.

1161
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:50,010
What?

1162
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,100
<i>That day…</i>

1163
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,230
<i>- I was the last one to the top.</i>
- Hang in there, Ho-su.

1164
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:02,060
You're doing great.
You're almost there, Ho-su.

1165
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,810
<i>- I was the only one going up.</i>
- Hang in there, Ho-su.

1166
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,940
Just a little more, Ho-su.

1167
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:09,440
You're almost there.

1168
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:12,240
<i>Later on, I saw no one else coming down.</i>

1169
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,700
<i>And I was alone.</i>

1170
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,030
<i>To be honest, I was so tired.</i>

1171
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,660
<i>I thought about giving up</i>
<i>and going back down several times.</i>

1172
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,540
<i>But I kept going up…</i>

1173
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,420
<i>because I didn't see Mi-ji…</i>

1174
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,050
<i>among the people coming down.</i>

1175
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,140
<i>I didn't even have faith in myself.</i>

1176
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,810
<i>But she kept waiting,</i>
<i>believing that I'd come.</i>

1177
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,400
<i>That's what Mi-ji did for me.</i>

1178
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,180
I went up there because of Mi-ji.

1179
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,140
If I'd been alone,
I would've never made it to the top.

1180
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,400
That's why I fell for her,

1181
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,400
because I kept thinking about her
while I was going up.

1182
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,070
Me too.

1183
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,450
You… What?

1184
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,160
I went out that day
because I was thinking about you.

1185
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,420
I…

1186
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:50,960
I liked you too.

1187
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:40,760
YU MI-JI

1188
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,970
<i>Who's in charge of Rosa Restaurant?</i>

1189
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,720
About the new HQ project.
I heard you might step down.

1190
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,730
If I took him out of the picture,
would you take the lead?

1191
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,980
<i>It's just that she's been</i>
<i>down all day. She even quit the farm.</i>

1192
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,570
<i>Why don't you take her out</i>
<i>for some fresh air or something?</i>

1193
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,440
You basically kidnapped me in your car.

1194
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,410
You really shouldn't cross the line.

1195
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,070
You're not Mi-ji, are you?

1196
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,490
What do you think of Ho-su?

1197
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,240
<i>I want to give it a shot with him.</i>

1198
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:06,330
<i>It's like I've lost</i>
<i>before the fight began.</i>

1199
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,910
Who are you going to go see?
She's not Mi-rae.

1200
