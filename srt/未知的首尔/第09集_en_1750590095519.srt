DATA PROCESSING ROOM

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,880
What are you waiting for? Scan it.

4
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,930
Pardon?
Scan your fingerprint.

5
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,010
Ah, my finger's like this, so I can't.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,810
Hurry up and scan it.

7
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,480
What? Did you hurt your finger too?

8
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,230
Or…

9
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,900
is there another reason why you can't?

10
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,040

YU MI-RAE
VERIFIED

13
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,720
Verified.

14
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,940
The only lesson I learned
from battling my childhood illness…

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,480
is that there are some fights in life
you just can't win.

16
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,570
Where are you going?

17
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,030
Dusonbong Peak.

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,450
I also know…

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,540
that you always gain something
at the end of a fight.

20
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,760
But I didn't have the strength
to keep fighting until I won.

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,090
You failed by just three points?
You'll definitely pass next time, Mi-rae.

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,140
I didn't pass either.

23
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,180
I made it to the second round
last time, though.

24
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,310
I had to make a quick decision
between a fight I could win…

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
PUBLIC CORPORATIONS

26
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,440
…and a fight I could not win.
Mi-rae.

27
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,980
What are you doing? Let's go.

28
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,690
Maybe that's why…

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,820
I was so concerned about Su-yeon,
who was fighting for what was right…

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,870
KIM SU-YEON

31
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,990
…unlike me.

32
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,700
Ms. Kim Su-yeon said…

33
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,250
She lit up a small light

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,620
that I didn't even know
existed inside of me.

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,170
That light led me…

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,380
It's all true.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,260
…to jump into a fight
I would've normally walked away from.

38
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,640
Exhausted from fighting a hopeless fight,

39
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,390
I grabbed hold
of the finger Mi-ji extended,

40
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,850
and I ran away.

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,770
And then…

42
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,020
Is staying here an option, by any chance?

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,400
…I unexpectedly found
another light in the place I had run to.

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,650
Someone to take over?

45
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,360
I think he's going to the States

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,650
to start working again or something.

47
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,370
I felt ashamed
that I had tried to rely on that light,

48
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,620
so I ran away again.

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,830
Excuse me.

50
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,330
I went back to the place
I had run away from.

EPISODE 9
BACK AGAIN, ONCE MORE

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,460
STRAWBERRY FARM

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,890
How would you like your hair?

54
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,220
I want hair extensions.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,980
You didn't tell me you were coming.

56
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,900
You didn't answer my calls.

57
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,990
What's going on?
Well…

58
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,660
This is…

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,420
My name is Kim Tae-i,
a coworker of Ms. Yu.

60
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,480
You brought someone from work here?
Have you lost your mind?

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,310
I had no choice. It wasn't something
we could talk about outside.

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,860
Hey, why would you be talking
to someone from work about--

63
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,900
He's Kim Su-yeon's younger brother.

64
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,450
What?
You know, your senior coworker.

65
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,870
Tae-i is the younger brother
of that coworker who blew the whistle.

66
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,620
Why is Su-yeon's brother…

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,290
I thought that SY stood for Sang-yeong,

68
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,580
but it was Su-yeon.

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,250
He said he joined the company
to collect evidence for his sister.

70
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,210
He mentioned a guarantee or something.

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,550
Anyway, he's done collecting evidence,
so he said you need to make a decision.

72
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,720
About what?
Reporting the company.

73
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,550
You need to tell the world
what those jerks have been doing!

74
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,310
Why would I do that?
What?

75
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,140
Because…
Why are you dragging me into this?

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,730
Tell him to do that.

77
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,400
Tae-i said he can't do it
because he's not someone on the inside.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,770
You're the one who saw
what happened to her from the start,

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,480
and you're the only one who testified.

80
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,980
He said only you can do this.

81
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,990
Why do I have to fight?

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,450
Hey.

83
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,240
Don't you think this is unfair?

84
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,080
The bad guys didn't even get punished,

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,620
while the person who spoke up
was bullied and then driven out.

86
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,750
You two are doing this
because you don't know better,

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,330
but this is a fight we can't win.

88
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,130
You won't know if you'll win or lose--

89
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,420
I already fought, and I lost.

90
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,710
I learned the hard way

91
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,840
that I'll be the only one suffering
if I fight them.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,470
You want me to go through that again?
Why should I?

93
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,220
You said you're going to quit anyway.

94
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,850
But before you do,

95
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,230
you could at least teach
the people who bullied you a lesson.

96
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,690
Who said I'm quitting?

97
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,650
I said I'd think about it.
You're not quitting?

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,230
You're going to keep working there?

99
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,610
If you're staying,
then more reason to fight.

100
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,900
You're gonna go back to staring
at walls and wasting away?

101
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,700
Why do you keep running away
when you did nothing wrong?

102
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,870
So what about you, Mi-ji?
What?

103
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,790
Do you have some plan
to get your life together now?

104
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,750
Mi-rae.

105
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,420
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

106
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,800
Stop butting into my life
and focus on your own.

107
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,920
We're done pretending to be each other.

108
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,840
Fine.

109
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,930
Do whatever you want with your life.

110
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,780
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE
BUT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU

111
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,160
I heard…

112
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,620
that Su-yeon trained you.

113
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,170
I'm the one who trained Su-yeon.

114
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,050
I look forward to working with you.

115
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,100
Right…

116
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,350
Why'd you even bother…

117
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,810
BACK FROM PATERNITY LEAVE

118
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,360
Why not? She's part of the team.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,530
Gosh.

120
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,030
Here you go.

121
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,240
Here's your latte,
and here's your Americano.

122
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,160
Oh, I…
I already had a cup earlier.

123
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,010
CHECK FOR ERRORS
SUBMIT THE EDITED FILE BY SUNDAY

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,850
These people are unbelievable.

125
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,350
You can't do this all by yourself.

126
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,190
Just leave it. I'll do it.

127
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,190
I'll help you.

128
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,480
That's what senior coworkers are for.

129
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,190
That's what senior coworkers are for.

130
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,150
Do the same
for your junior coworker in the future.

131
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,530
What?

132
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,410
Did I sound like an old geezer?

133
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,740
No.

134
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,290
Thank you.

135
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,330
Let's wrap this up quickly
and head home.

136
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,880
You really don't have to take me home.

137
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,340
Come on. We're headed
the same way, so hop in.

138
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,800
We worked late together,
so let me give you a ride.

139
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,400
PARK MI-RAE

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
My daughter's name is Mi-rae too.

141
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,070
I was pleasantly surprised
when I learned you two had the same name.

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,700
When I was on paternity leave,
I wanted to come to work so badly.

143
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,210
But now that I'm back in the office,
I miss my daughter so much.

144
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,340
Sir…

145
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,260
Here.

146
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,810
What's this?

147
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,100
A gift voucher for gas?

148
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,270
Gosh, it's okay. You don't have to.

149
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,730
Please take it.

150
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,940
I feel bad that you're always helping me
and giving me a ride.

151
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,820
Gosh…

152
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,070
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

153
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,740
I wasn't there
when you really needed help.

154
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,920
Okay, then…

155
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,670
When you buy your coffee in the morning,

156
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,550
bring one for me too, okay?

157
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,130
Okay.

158
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,890
MI-RAE! I LOVE YOU!

159
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,750
Hey.

160
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,710
Mi-ji.

161
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,770
Ma'am.

162
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,440
What brings you here at this hour?

163
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,700
I wanted to say goodbye
before going to work.

164
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,540
I'm dropping out of the new HQ project.

165
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,750
What?

166
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,370
Are you backing out because of me?
Because I said I'm not selling?

167
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,000
Gosh, of course not.

168
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,710
I just… Hold on.

169
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,090
You decided not to sell the restaurant?

170
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,920
I see. I'm really glad to hear that.

171
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,590
They're the ones in a hurry, not you.

172
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,260
Just take your time deciding.

173
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,310
Are you saying that
because you're not part of it now?

174
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,060
Who cares?
I'm out, so I can say whatever I want.

175
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,940
Gosh, that feels so good.

176
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,940
Why are you here to say goodbye, though?

177
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,280
Are you going somewhere far away?

178
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,490
No, it's not like that.

179
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,160
It just won't be easy for me
to come see you anymore.

180
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,540
So I wanted to say goodbye one last time.

181
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,170
You're kind of special to me.

182
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,970
I know I'm not
that special to you, though.

183
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,050
But looking back,

184
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,680
I realized
that ever since I came to Seoul,

185
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,850
you were the only person
who accepted me for who I am,

186
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,020
regardless of my job
or educational background.

187
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,740
To be honest, it's been a really long time
since I got to know someone new.

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,780
We may not be friends,

189
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,950
but you're kind of special to me.

190
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,550
Have you…

191
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,470
heard of an adult guardianship?

192
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,680
A guardianship?

193
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,520
I've never told you this before.

194
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,850
But I have a son.

195
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,020
You have a son?

196
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,070
He's been living in a facility
for a while now.

197
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,070
Because he's not of sound mind.

198
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,000
I need someone to look after him
if anything happens to me.

199
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,040
I'm sure you've noticed,

200
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,670
but I have no one around me
to ask for help.

201
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,550
If you're up for it,

202
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,380
I'll give you a bit of money
for the trouble,

203
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,260
so please think about it.

204
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,020
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

205
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm sorry about yesterday.

206
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,860
I didn't know you had family coming.

207
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,580
Ms. Yu, can we talk for a moment?

208
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,910
Ms. Yu, you're not busy
right now, are you?

209
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,960
Come with me for a second.

210
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,130
May I go now?

211
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,920
Yes, you may go.

212
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,110
What's going on?

213
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,980
You said she was Mi-rae's twin,
but the prints match.

214
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,190
They matched?

215
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,580
Ms. Yu.

216
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,120
Can we talk?

217
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,330
No, I--

218
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,790
It won't take long.

219
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,130
There's something
I didn't tell you yesterday.

220
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,550
A few years ago,

221
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,550
my sister called me out of the blue.

222
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,390
She started talking about her company,
which I didn't know much about.

223
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,350
Re-do it.

224
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,100
She said she was doing work
that wasn't her responsibility,

225
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,940
but her bosses kept making
unreasonable demands.

226
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,940
She was told to pressure
a third-party evaluator

227
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,030
into giving favorable results
for a specific company.

228
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,110
And so she…

229
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,610
She blew the whistle.

230
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,030
Let's skip what we both know.

231
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,290
Over the past three years,

232
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,920
among the payment guarantees
provided by KFMC to midsize companies,

233
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,590
the Planning Strategy Team
oversaw 20 cases,

234
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,590
and 60% of them were focused
on a single company.

235
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,180
Sixty percent.

236
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,470
Can you believe it?

237
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,890
The company recently chosen
as the contractor for the new HQ

238
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,640
is that same company,
which is headed by our new CEO's relative.

239
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,400
The one that my sister supposedly gave
preferential treatment to "voluntarily."

240
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Sihan Construction.

241
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,570
There's obviously something going on.

242
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,030
But no one's doing anything about it.

243
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,570
Someone has to raise the issue.

244
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,330
And that someone is me?

245
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
You already said all this yesterday.

246
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,790
You didn't hear about it from me, though.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,420
You showed up late.

248
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,590
You did seem strange lately.

249
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,390
The way you were acting recently
was so different from how you usually are.

250
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,150
I never would have imagined
that you had a twin.

251
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,310
So…

252
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,400
are you going to blackmail me?

253
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,150
The company would likely
be more intrigued by the younger brother

254
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,700
collecting company secrets
to avenge his sister

255
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,240
than by baseless rumors
about twins switching lives.

256
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,290
But you're not going to tell the company.

257
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
I don't plan on telling them either.

258
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,130
If the evidence is that solid,

259
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,170
then you can make a move yourself.

260
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,920
As you just said,

261
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,050
if I get involved,

262
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,050
everyone will focus more

263
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,390
on the younger brother seeking revenge
than on the real issue.

264
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,390
You're the only one
who can do this, Ms. Yu.

265
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,640
Why me, of all people?

266
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,310
You know how things are at work
for me right now.

267
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,440
You're the only one who testified.

268
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,230
The Planning Strategy Team?

269
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,570
They all saw it,
but they turned a blind eye.

270
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,440
They can't do anything
even if they wanted to

271
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,910
because everything they said
would become a lie.

272
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,660
This is a chance to prove
that you were right.

273
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,490
I don't want to prove anything.

274
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,710
I know it must have been hard
for you all this time, but…

275
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,710
No.

276
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,130
You don't know.

277
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,920
Do you know why those people bullied you?

278
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,760
They did that to hide their wrongdoing.

279
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,720
We should expose them
and have them face the consequences.

280
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,970
Don't you resent them for what they did?

281
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,430
I'm saying this
because I've been through it.

282
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,100
No matter how clear the evidence is,
it's useless if the company covers it up.

283
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,110
It's a fight we can never win.
We may lose, but…

284
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,360
But it's not right
to keep letting those guys win.

285
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,200
I don't care if we win or lose.
I don't want to fight anymore.

286
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,780
That's enough.

287
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,490
I'm sure Su-yeon doesn't want
her brother getting hurt either.

288
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,250
Why did you help my sister, then?

289
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,630
You didn't help her just so she could win.

290
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,090
You did it
because it was the right thing to do.

291
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,170
You're not like those cowards!

292
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,810
You're really amazing, Mi-rae.

293
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,650
On behalf of all the cowards,

294
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,400
I want to apologize to you.

295
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,200
You're a very brave person, Mi-rae.

296
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm brave?

297
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm not.

298
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,890
I don't even have the courage
to be a coward.

299
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,310
Yes.

300
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,480
It was the right thing to do.

301
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,520
But…

302
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,520
if I had known…

303
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,190
that doing the right thing
would make things this hard…

304
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,950
then I never would've done it.

305
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,250
Why did I step forward?

306
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm nothing.

307
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,170
I should've just stayed out of it.

308
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,640
I keep thinking about it

309
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,260
and regretting it.

310
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,390
And I betray Su-yeon every night.

311
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,940
That's why…

312
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,320
with each passing day,

313
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,410
I hate myself more and more.

314
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,280
No, Director Yoon.

315
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,030
The offer is very tempting,
and I'm grateful.

316
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,870
But I still have quite a bit
to take care of here.

317
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,130
I'll decide within the week.

318
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
Yes, I'll contact you. Okay.

319
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,520
CALLS
DIRECTOR YOON

320
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
BUSINESS PARTNER

321
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,570
Where did my business partner go?

322
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,230
She left a while ago.

323
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,650
She left?

324
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,700
I told her you were looking
for your replacement,

325
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,990
and she bolted,
afraid that she'd get stuck with the farm.

326
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,580
Why did you tell her that?

327
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,120
I told you it wasn't confirmed yet.

328
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,840
The person you are trying to reach

329
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,380
has their phone turned off. Please--

330
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,800
I NEED TALK TO YOU IN PERSON

331
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,090
You said you needed to
tell me something. Why can't I reach you?

332
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,300
Did something happen?

333
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,720
BUSINESS PARTNER

334
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,560
I'll be in Seoul for a while.
I'll get in touch when I'm back.

335
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,190
She's in Seoul right now?

336
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,150
This should be good enough, right?

337
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,400
Who are you texting?

338
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,610
The strawberry farm owner
we met that time.

339
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,200
We'll be working together from now on,
so I should keep in touch with him.

340
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,540
What will you two be doing?

341
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,420
Farm work.

342
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,960
I'll be taking over
from Mi-rae once I'm back.

343
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,590
I should get going now.

344
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,180
Go where?

345
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,430
Duson-ri.

346
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,680
I should go back since Mi-rae is here now.

347
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,350
Why?
What do you mean?

348
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm done filling in for her,
so I should go and take back my place.

349
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,320
Now that you're done filling in for her,
it's no longer about whose place is where.

350
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,690
You can just stay wherever you want.

351
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,700
That is true, but…

352
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,660
I have nowhere to stay in Seoul,

353
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,580
and I can't stay at Mi-rae's
since we fought yesterday.

354
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Then stay here.

355
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,330
What?

356
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,670
If you're going back
because you have nowhere to stay,

357
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,210
then sleep here.

358
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,010
But we…

359
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,930
Can… we…

360
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,390
do…

361
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,350
that?

362
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,930
Why not?

363
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,310
Don't confuse the toothpaste
with the cleansing foam.

364
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,690
There are more towels here,
so use them.

365
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,060
Okay.

366
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,860
What? You don't want to shower?

367
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,820
Of course, I should shower.

368
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,820
I should, for the sake of hygiene.

369
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm going to shower.

370
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,740
Okay, then.

371
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,490
Shower.

372
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,040
Thanks.

373
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,750
I'm just sleeping over.
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

374
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,920
Just think of this place as a motel.
Wait. No!

375
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,340
Don't do that.

376
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes?

377
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,630
I'll leave some clothes by the door.

378
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,590
My gosh, thank you.
The service here is great!

379
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,470
Stop overreacting. Seriously.

380
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,490
Are you going somewhere?

381
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,700
What? No.

382
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,330
Are you done washing up?
Yes.

383
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,620
Should I sleep here?

384
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,750
No, you sleep in my bed.
I'll sleep here.

385
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,460
You said you have
an interview tomorrow, though.

386
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,630
You should sleep comfortably in your bed.

387
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,420
Then whoever gets sleepy first
can take the bed.

388
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Okay.

389
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,970
Your hair is still wet.

390
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,430
These are hair extensions,
so they get tangled without conditioner.

391
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,560
I'll just let it air dry.

392
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,600
That's right.
Your hair was a bit shorter before.

393
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,690
Yes.

394
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,860
May I take a look?
Sure.

395
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,910
This is so interesting.
So that's how they're attached.

396
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,330
Yes… I'm going to remove them all soon.

397
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,250
It's been a while
since I've had long hair.

398
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,420
It doesn't suit me, right?

399
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,130
You look pretty.

400
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,010
Your old hairstyle was pretty too.

401
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
It looked pretty even when it was shorter.

402
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,510
Hold on…

403
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,600
What are you thinking right now?

404
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,270
What am I thinking?

405
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,980
What do you mean?

406
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,020
Never mind.

407
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,690
Forget it. I'm sorry.

408
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,290
Why?

409
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,420
What are you thinking about?

410
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,590
What? I…

411
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,510
There's so much going through my mind
that I don't know where to begin.

412
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,840
Tell me everything.

413
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,050
Well… Am I being too clumsy?

414
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,970
Do I seem pathetic, doing this
when I've got nothing going for me?

415
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,100
I don't know how long
I'm supposed to hold my breath for.

416
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,650
And have I turned you off
and ruined the mood by saying all this?

417
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,690
Why am I even thinking
about this right now?

418
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,650
I must seriously have a problem.

419
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,410
I can't stop talking.

420
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,530
I wish I could be as relaxed as you are.

421
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,700
Mi-ji.

422
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,080
Should I tell you what I was thinking?

423
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,750
"Is she only staying

424
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,170
because I asked her to,
not because she wants to?"

425
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,220
"What's the latest we can leave
to catch the last bus to Duson-ri?"

426
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,800
"When would be the best time
to set up the bedding for her?"

427
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,760
"Should I sit on the couch or the floor?"

428
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,640
"If I wear short sleeves,

429
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,440
my scars will show,
so should I wear something on top?"

430
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,520
I put this on and took it off three times.

431
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,150
Jeez…

432
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,700
You're an idiot.

433
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,580
None of that bothers me at all.

434
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,430
You don't bother me, either.

435
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,930
No matter what you're thinking…

436
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,940
Regardless of whether
you can stop talking or not…

437
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,960
Did you see this?

438
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,460
What is this? Wow.
Is this for real?

439
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,960
If this is true, it'll be chaos.

440
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,340
It will be really disastrous.

441
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,720
Hey, Ms. Yu. Did you do it?

442
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,680
Pardon?

443
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,520
Did you upload that post
on the anonymous company forum?

444
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,360
What are you talking about?

445
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,320
Yes, sir. I just saw it.

446
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,070
Yes, sir.

447
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,290
WELCOME, MS. YU MI-RAE

SIHAN CONSTRUCTION
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

450
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,550
SIHAN CONSTRUCTION BECOMES
CONTRACTOR FOR KFMC'S NEW HQ

451
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,960
POST DELETED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR

452
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,060
How could you let an employee
post something like this on your watch?

453
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,390
I'm sorry, sir.

454
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,070
But we deleted the post right away,
and it was posted anonymously.

455
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,860
So in terms of credibility--
That's not the issue!

456
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,030
People will remember Sihan Construction,
thanks to this post!

457
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,620
What if the media catches wind of it
before we break ground on the new HQ?

458
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,500
I'll make sure that doesn't happen, sir.

459
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,210
We need to start construction
before this causes more talk.

460
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,750
How is the land acquisition going?

461
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,250
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lee.

462
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,090
You're sure that we'll be able
to buy Rosa Restaurant, right?

463
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,430
You can never guarantee anything 100%.

464
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,350
I'm doing my best to increase
our chances, so don't worry.

465
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,060
We don't have time for such…

466
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,020
I'll give you a month.

467
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,310
If we can't buy it by then,
we won't wait anymore.

468
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,030
What will you do then?

469
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,820
The company will use another law firm
for everything, not just this case.

470
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,240
You know how much our company
pays Wongeun every year, right?

471
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,120
Do you have the power to do that
as a director?

472
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,080
This isn't coming from me.

473
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,670
Our CEO ordered this.

474
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,210
I'm not threatening you right now.
I'm begging you for your help.

475
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,010
You make the impossible happen.

476
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,300
The fate of our new HQ is in your hands.

477
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,470
A month.

478
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,470
This means I need to make a risky move.

479
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,310
Will you be okay with that?

480
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,950
Why did you make that post?

481
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,820
You said you wanted no part in this,

482
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,740
so I made a move by myself.

483
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,290
So you thought making
an anonymous post was the best move?

484
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,080
It was deleted within a day.

485
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,000
Did you really think
you could fight the company like that?

486
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,760
Stop this before you get sued.

487
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,050
It has nothing to do with you.

488
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,510
It has nothing to do with me?

489
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,600
Haven't you noticed
that people think I wrote that post?

490
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,770
This is why I said I didn't want to fight.

491
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,440
People say, "We're in it together,"
but I still get blamed for everything.

492
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,190
It's not like you wrote the post yourself.

493
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,820
I'll be the one getting sued, so…

494
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
That…

495
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,530
doesn't matter to people.

496
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,870
Even if you get sued,
people will still suspect me

497
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,500
because they already think
I'm capable of doing that.

498
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,460
No one cares…

499
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,880
Sir!

500
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,300
Hey, Mi-rae. Over here.

501
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,510
No one cares about the truth.

502
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,760
Say hello.

503
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,220
This is my favorite
junior coworker from my team.

504
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,390
She's our ace.

505
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,680
Nice to meet you.

506
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,930
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

508
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,730
I was going to call a driver,

509
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,030
but I guess I was too drunk
and called you instead.

510
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,200
I'm sorry.

511
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,370
Why don't you hop in my car
since you're here anyway?

512
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,370
I'll just drive.

513
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,830
You?

514
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,590
I'm a good driver. I'll drive you home.

515
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,090
Okay. Let's go.

516
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,440
Sir, you should put on your seatbelt.

517
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,320
Sir?

518
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,790
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep…

519
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,330
What are you doing?

520
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,170
I thought you liked me too.

521
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,960
Pardon?

522
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,550
Wait, Mi-rae. I mean, Ms. Yu.

523
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,220
Wait. Stop.

524
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:15,890
I…

525
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,110
I admire you as a senior coworker.
I don't see you in that way.

526
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,190
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

527
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,150
I'm drunk, so I'm not thinking straight.

528
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,990
Damn it.

529
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,530
I must've lost my mind.

530
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,370
Just hit me once.

531
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,460
Yes, you know what?

532
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,420
Just hit me until you feel better.

533
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,630
Sir, please don't do this.

534
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,750
No, I…

535
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
What…

536
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,300
What should I do for you to forgive me?

537
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,340
I'll do whatever you want.

538
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,600
Let's…

539
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,600
Let's just pretend this never happened.

540
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,480
What?

541
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,980
I said,

542
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,320
let's just pretend this never happened.

543
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:12,370
Are you… sure about that?

544
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,870
I don't want things to get weird
between us over this.

545
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,960
I just want us

546
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,210
to be good coworkers
like we have been until now.

547
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,550
Yes, right.

548
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,720
I understand. Let's do that.

549
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,050
Thank you. Thank you so much.

550
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Thanks.

551
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,480
Ms.…

552
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,790
Ms. Yu.

553
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,170
Thank you, but please stop doing this.

554
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,050
I don't feel comfortable.

555
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,460
Pardon?

556
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,230
Sir, what is wrong with you?

557
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,560
Why are you acting like this?

558
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,270
I want to ask you that.

559
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,860
I think I'm acting
appropriately right now.

560
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,690
If you keep acting like this…

561
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,910
then people will think I'm being weird.

562
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,280
If this is because of what happened,

563
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,330
we agreed to forget about it
and carry on as usual.

564
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,080
Ms. Yu.

565
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,580
I'm a married man.

566
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,670
People are watching us.
Please don't cross the line.

567
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,300
I'd rather not meet privately
like this anymore, either.

568
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,030
Am I your first customer today?

569
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,540
That's right. You don't serve solo diners.

570
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,540
So…

571
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,750
Did you give it some thought?

572
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,260
If you don't feel comfortable
speaking one-on-one,

573
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,720
shall I ask Ho-su to come?

574
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,050
Why have you come back?

575
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,800
I told you I have no intention of selling.

576
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,850
I wanted to give you one last chance.

577
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,680
You're going to sell it anyway.
If you do it voluntarily,

578
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,810
then everyone will be happy.

579
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,270
Are you saying
you'll take it from me if I refuse?

580
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,530
That's what thugs do.

581
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,780
I will create circumstances…

582
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,330
that will force you to sell.

583
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,420
I will uncover secrets you want to hide,

584
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,460
expose them,

585
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,090
and determine whether you have
the right to the restaurant.

586
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,970
Gosh.

587
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,970
Let's stop before it gets that far.

588
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,180
That way, you can keep protecting
the things you've always protected.

589
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,980
Things like… your secret

590
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,480
or your son
at the Seonham Mental Nursing Home.

591
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,110
How did you find out about that?

592
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,530
Who knows?

593
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,450
Maybe there are many people around you
who are helping me.

594
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,250
A guardianship?

595
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,620
Here.

596
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,710
So…

597
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,430
I'll give you until tomorrow
to think about it.

598
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,270
Why are you so nervous?
It's not a formal interview.

599
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,190
You were recommended, right?

600
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,400
I don't know. I just have a bad feeling.

601
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,110
Should I have just said no?

602
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,990
I didn't think
you had moments like this too.

603
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,450
Let me.

604
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,090
You look decent now.

605
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,260
It's more crooked now.

606
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,060
Are you going to see Ms. Ro-sa today?

607
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,690
Yes, I should.

608
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,980
I'm supposed to give her
an answer by today.

609
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,650
What did you decide to do?

610
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,190
Are you going to tell her the truth?
Yes.

611
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,110
What if she gets really mad, though?

612
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,280
What if she calls the company

613
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,910
and reports me to the police,
and I end up in jail?

614
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,700
And I--
Don't go that far.

615
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,500
Don't be so worried.
Remember what I said.

616
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,630
There must be a reason

617
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,010
why she asked you for that favor
but couldn't ask me.

618
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,800
And you're telling her the truth
because you want to help her.

619
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,140
She let the lie
I told Ji-yun slide before,

620
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,600
so since I'm doing this to help,
she'll forgive me, right?

621
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,070
Your honesty is your best weapon, Mi-ji.

622
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,740
Right.

623
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,200
How do I look?

624
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,950
You look like…

625
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,330
someone who failed the interview already.

626
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,080
Hey, stop being so scared.

627
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,460
If they don't hire you, it's their loss.

628
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,130
Even if you don't get the job,
don't cry until you see me.

629
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,340
How many times are you going to tell me
that I'm going to fail?

630
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,590
Jeez. I'm trying to cheer you up.

631
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,300
Ho-su, you've got this!

632
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,260
You can do it! Go for it!

633
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,770
Yes.

634
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,400
I'm Bae Gi-cheol. Please have a seat.

635
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,960
I'm here, ma'am.

636
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,180
I…

637
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,270
I've thought about
the guardianship you mentioned.

638
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,060
But…

639
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,440
I want to be honest with you
about something first.

640
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,700
Go ahead.

641
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,700
I'm…

642
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,280
not Yu Mi-rae.

643
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,330
What?

644
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm her twin.

645
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,630
Something happened,
so I was pretending to be her.

646
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,420
So what happened to the girl
who was here before?

647
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
That…

648
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,390
was me.

649
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,310
It was me all along,
from the first day I met you.

650
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,350
So?

651
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,070
Is that it?
You don't have anything else to tell me?

652
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,230
Pardon?

653
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,530
What…

654
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,650
Go.

655
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,660
Don't ever come back here again.

656
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,080
Ma'am, are you mad?

657
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,420
I just wanted to help…

658
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,590
Why help when there's nothing more
to dig up?

659
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,130
Did that lawyer tell you to do that?

660
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,010
Lawyer?

661
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,800
Which lawyer?

662
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,930
You're really gonna keep
acting clueless?

663
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,890
How would the lawyer have found out
where my son is, if it weren't for you?

664
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,980
Ma'am, it wasn't me.
I never mentioned that to anyone.

665
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,230
Then who did?

666
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,770
You're the only one I trusted
and mentioned it to.

667
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,490
Ma'am…

668
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,530
I'm such an idiot.

669
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,450
Even after going through it
all those years…

670
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,330
I had no one else to turn to,
so I trusted you…

671
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,460
You should go now.

672
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,670
Let's stop all these lies here and now.

673
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,050
Ma'am.

674
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,970
I swear I haven't lied
about anything else.

675
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,310
I meant everything I said and did
every time I saw you…

676
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,350
Ma'am.

677
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,110
I don't know you.

678
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,860
I don't even know who you are!

679
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,360
Get out right now!

680
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,400
Mi-ji, I think I did well.

681
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,900
What do you mean?
The interview.

682
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:53,360
I think I got the job. I'm having lunch
with the executives tomorrow.

683
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,660
Really?

684
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,950
See? I told you that you'd do well.

685
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
You're right. I was worried for nothing.

686
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,080
What about you? Did you tell her?

687
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,000
Of course, I did.

688
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,790
Really? What did she say?

689
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,840
She was very surprised,

690
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,010
but it turned out fine.

691
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,550
I'm glad.

692
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,060
We were both worried about today,
but things worked out for both of us.

693
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,640
When do you apply for guardianship?
Before you go to court--

694
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,850
Hey, that's not important right now.

695
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,690
You're employed again!

696
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,400
Let's have a party.

697
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,900
It's not even confirmed yet, though.
Let's celebrate tomorrow.

698
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,030
No, let's party today.

699
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,780
What do we need first for the party?

700
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,570
Let's buy a cake first.

701
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,620
We should get party poppers
and balloons too.

702
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,790
And party hats too.

703
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,210
I thought it was strange that she agreed
to back out of the project so easily.

704
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,840
I told you that Mi-rae
would cause problems.

705
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,680
But we don't know who made that post yet.

706
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,340
What other employee
would write a post like that?

707
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,470
We should've nipped it in the bud.

708
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,890
We put it off,
and now it's coming back to haunt us.

709
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,190
Hey.

710
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,060
Get rid of Mi-rae.

711
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,690
Pardon? But…

712
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,940
How--
You know how to handle her.

713
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,160
We've got to act now.
We don't have time to just sit around.

714
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,580
If this gets any messier…

715
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,580
won't you be in trouble too?

716
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,520
This is the evidence
I've collected until now.

717
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,770
Why are you giving this to me?
I told you that I'm staying out of this.

718
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,150
Just throw it away, then.

719
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,030
It's useless unless you use it, anyway.

720
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,420
Why do you keep running away
when you've done nothing wrong?

721
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,590
I hadn't intended
to run away from the start.

722
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,630
I actually tried to just hang in there,

723
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,720
clinging to that faint belief
that at least I was in the right.

724
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,610
Ms. Yu?

725
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,780
I used to work here.

726
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,620
You thought I wouldn't hear about
what you've been up to at the office?

727
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,120
How dare you seduce a married man!

728
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,830
Honey, what are you doing? Please stop.

729
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,710
Let go of me. You keep being too soft.

730
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,000
That's why she's not getting the message!

731
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,790
Come on. Please stop.

732
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,960
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

HUMAN RESOURCES

734
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,720
We're a public corporation,
so we have a responsibility

735
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,560
to maintain professional conduct.

736
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,810
We'll let this incident slide
with a warning.

737
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,100
But please stop making--

738
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,150
Why am I getting punished
when I'm the victim?

739
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,570
For assault cases, the parties
should settle the issue among themselves.

740
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,950
For a case like this,

741
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,410
you can't claim
that you're an innocent victim…

742
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,120
What kind of case is this?

743
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,160
Pardon?

744
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,750
It wasn't an affair.

745
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,760
It was sexual harassment.

746
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,720
I'm the victim.

747
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,600
Then why didn't you report it
as soon as the incident occurred?

748
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,610
At that moment,
a seed of doubt was planted inside me.

749
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,650
Did I do something wrong?

750
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,780
At the time,
I didn't want to cause any trouble.

751
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,320
We spoke to members of your team.

752
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,910
They said that even after the incident,
you kept buying him coffee.

753
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,790
After an incident like that,
it's not normal to keep buying coffee

754
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,620
for someone who harassed you, is it?

755
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,420
At the time, I thought it was best
to maintain our relationship as usual--

756
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,670
But I heard

757
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,130
that you two worked overtime together
all the time,

758
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,050
and you carpooled too.

759
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,600
People also said
that you were more friendly with him

760
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,140
than with the others.

761
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,770
Are you sure you didn't have
a personal relationship with him?

762
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,860
Did I really do nothing wrong?

763
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,400
Did I give him the wrong idea?

764
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,030
Did I really have no part
in how this all went down?

765
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,240
Jeez, don't worry.
It's nothing to worry about.

766
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,580
Just relax.

767
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,620
She's just making a fool of herself.

768
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,750
Okay?

769
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,550
Am I…

770
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,260
really the victim?

771
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,470
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE

772
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,560
I'm sorry I'm late.

773
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,480
When the onslaught of questions started…

774
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,280
I had to run away.

775
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,540
I couldn't answer a single question.

776
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,210
Because more than anyone else,

777
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,920
I was doubting myself.

778
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:59,770
CONGRATS ON GETTING A JOB

779
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,370
So what about you, Mi-ji?

780
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,250
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

781
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,420
I don't know you.
I don't even know who you are!

782
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,540
Ho-su.

783
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,710
Yes, Mi-ji. What is it?

784
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,920
Your hair…

785
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,800
I think I should go.

786
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,220
Go where? At this hour?

787
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,100
Duson-ri.

788
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,100
Why the rush?
Did something happen back home?

789
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,060
Nothing's happened.

790
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,980
I just don't have a reason
to stay in Seoul anymore.

791
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,150
Of course you do.

792
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,240
You need to register as a guardian and…

793
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,870
I lied.

794
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,910
I couldn't even talk to her
about the guardianship.

795
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,500
Ms. Ro-sa…

796
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,130
got very…

797
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,840
very angry.

798
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,180
It was probably because she was shocked.

799
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,820
She said she doesn't know who I am now.

800
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,400
I don't know what I was expecting.

801
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,580
It all started with a lie
in the first place.

802
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,410
This all belongs to Mi-rae.

803
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,290
It was only possible because I was Mi-rae.

804
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,670
I want to go back to where I belong.

805
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,970
I have no reason to stay here anymore.

806
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,060
Mi-ji.

807
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,150
You belong where you choose to stay.

808
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,860
We can come up with a reason together.

809
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,570
I'd love to do that, but…

810
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,870
But for some reason,
I feel like I don't belong here.

811
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,370
I feel like there's no place
for me in Seoul.

812
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,470
Then let's go.

813
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,260
Let's leave as soon as the sun comes up.

814
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,720
Get some sleep until then, okay?

815
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,220
Mi-ji.

816
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,140
What are you doing?
Why aren't you going in?

817
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,600
Is the gate locked?

818
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,520
No, I just…

819
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,770
Are you okay?

820
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,900
Did you fight with your mom?

821
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,490
Gosh, I'm no match for her.
I can't even put up a fight.

822
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,910
I was just staring at the gate,

823
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,370
wondering if it's always looked
this worn-out.

824
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,950
Oh, that? If you repaint it,
it will look brand new in no time.

825
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:34,250
I guess I should repaint it sometime.
I'm going to keep living here anyway.

826
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,710
Well, have a good day.

827
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,220
Okay, see you.

828
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,340
Bye.

829
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,730
Mom, I'm home.

830
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,940
You're back early.
I thought you'd stay longer.

831
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,690
No, I just came back.

832
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,070
Mi-rae is at work anyway,
so what would I do by myself in Seoul?

833
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,950
Wow, there were so many people
that everything felt chaotic.

834
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,490
Why? Did something happen?

835
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,330
No, what would happen to me?

836
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,590
Did you go somewhere?

837
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:30,890
Seoul.

838
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,400
I'm feeling a little carsick
because I've not taken the bus in so long.

839
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,860
Mom, I'm going to go sleep.
Don't wake me up.

840
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,570
STRAWBERRY FARM

841
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:36,710
I'm sorry. I was in Seoul.
What should I start with?

842
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,340
I guess Mi-rae left?

843
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,510
Can I work instead of her?

844
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,730
Of course, you can. I hired you
because of your resume, Ms. Seoul.

845
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,520
My name is Mi-ji.

846
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,070
Mi-ji.

847
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,660
Mi-ji. The name's finally
starting to stick.

848
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,240
Let's go, Mi-ji.

849
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,450
Okay.

850
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,250
Ok-hui.

851
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,380
I heard you got hurt. Are you okay?

852
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,970
Did the kids switch places?

853
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,140
What?

854
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,810
Was Mi-ji actually Mi-rae this whole time?

855
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,220
Did you know about it?

856
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,560
You did.
Ok-hui.

857
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,110
Jeez, forget it. Whatever.

858
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,440
Ok-hui.

859
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,150
Don't…

860
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,610
Don't scold the kids too much.

861
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,030
Mom.

862
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,490
What do you all take me for?

863
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,460
Ok-hui…

864
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,550
Ok-hui…

865
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,770
I guess Mi-rae

866
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,190
has decided what to do,
considering she's back in Seoul.

867
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,480
I don't know. That's her business.

868
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,020
She doesn't tell me every single detail.

869
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,740
How does it feel to be back?

870
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,660
Crappy.

871
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,160
Then why did you return?
You could've just stayed in Seoul.

872
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,700
Because I felt even crappier
staying there.

873
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,830
I didn't do anything wrong,

874
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,500
but I felt uneasy for some reason.
I felt like I needed to come back.

875
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,300
I guess I'm just destined
to just live here forever.

876
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,800
Don't you feel a little like this?

877
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,090
Like a runaway teenager
bouncing around friends' places.

878
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,760
I know that feeling too.

879
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:56,850
I don't think you have any idea.

880
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,480
You studied abroad and lived in Seoul.

881
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,110
It doesn't matter
if it's the States or Seoul.

882
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,360
Anyone who's away from a place
they care about feels that way.

883
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,740
Do you still feel that way?

884
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,610
Not anymore.

885
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,080
The reason I cared
about the place is gone now.

886
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,450
Don't get the wrong idea.
I mean my grandfather, not Mi-rae.

887
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,790
I think this is a matter of the heart,
not destiny.

888
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,750
That's why I don't open up
to people very easily.

889
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,090
Because I might feel like
I've run away again.

890
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,050
A&A has been focusing

891
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,770
on barrier-free access
for the past few years.

892
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,600
And we're continuing to make improvements
to the office building.

893
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,400
Among major law firms,
we're also the most actively involved

894
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,230
in public interest cases.

895
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,530
You seem like the perfect person

896
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,570
to represent our company's goals, Mr. Lee.

897
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,620
Me?

898
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,290
Gosh, you two need to stop already.

899
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:05,080
I told them why you ended up
leaving Wongeun,

900
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,250
and I guess they were very impressed.

901
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,960
Of course we were.

902
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,470
You defied orders
and left Wongeun of all places

903
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:15,050
to protect the weaker party
and not the client. My gosh.

904
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,140
It's just like a movie.

905
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,560
Oh, that's--

906
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,100
Plus, I heard the senior lawyer
you clashed with was Mr. Lee Chung-gu.

907
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,980
I've heard so many rumors about him.

908
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,480
What's he actually like?

909
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:31,030
I tend to be a bit oblivious
when it comes to rumors--

910
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:35,320
He's famous for handling sensitive cases
while using his disability as a shield.

911
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,330
How can he be so cruel to the weak
when he's vulnerable too?

912
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,410
It's worse because
he actually knows what it's like.

913
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:43,540
He makes us look good in comparison,
so it works for us.

914
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,040
A senior and a junior lawyer,
both with disabilities,

915
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,050
making completely opposite choices.

916
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,260
It's a great story.

917
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,640
Sir.

918
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,520
Mr. Lee isn't like that.

919
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,230
He may use cheap methods sometimes,

920
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,980
but he doesn't use
his disability as a shield.

921
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,940
He's not like that.

922
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,400
What those two were saying earlier--
And…

923
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,120
I'm not like that, either.

924
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,580
I didn't step up to protect the weak.

925
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,870
I just couldn't ignore
a client's wrongdoing, so if anything,

926
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,750
I'm not fit to be a lawyer.

927
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,210
Justice, disability…

928
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,930
If you're looking for someone
to represent things like that,

929
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,430
then I don't think
I'm the right person for the job.

930
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,020
Then, uh,

931
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,360
if you don't represent things
like the vulnerable or justice,

932
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,240
what do you think you represent?

933
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:01,490
I don't think
I've ever really thought about that.

934
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,000
Then think about it,

935
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,830
and if you want to work for us, call me.

936
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,800
Come to think of it, it seems like
we were the ones being interviewed.

937
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,630
I should get going.

938
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,100
I'm back.

939
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,270
Mom, what are you doing here?

940
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,780
Come here. We need to talk.

941
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:39,030
I'm tired from work. Let's talk later.

942
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,070
Mi-ji.

943
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,240
Are you going to keep treating me
like an idiot?

944
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,580
I know you switched places with Mi-rae.

945
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,830
Were you ever going to tell me?

946
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,710
How could you be so brazen?

947
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,130
What were you thinking,
doing something like that?

948
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:59,130
It's nothing serious.
We just switched places briefly for fun.

949
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,300
For fun?

950
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,930
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

951
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,600
Why did you switch places?

952
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,020
Did something happen to Mi-rae?

953
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,560
Nothing happened to Mi-rae.

954
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,520
And I didn't ruin her life. Happy now?

955
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:15,520
Mi-rae is not the type
to go along with your plans

956
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,280
when everything is okay.

957
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,240
What happened?
Jeez, it's all over now!

958
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,200
You couldn't even tell us apart,
so why make such a big deal about it now?

959
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,540
What did you say?

960
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,620
Just because I can't tell you two apart,
it's okay to treat me like an idiot?

961
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,590
Do you even consider me family?

962
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,170
Your bedridden grandma knew about this,
so why didn't I?

963
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,340
Do you two even see me as your mom?

964
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,470
So what about you?
Do you see me as your daughter?

965
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,010
What?

966
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,140
You're always going on and on
about Mi-rae.

967
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,060
I'm your daughter too.

968
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,890
Why don't you ask if I'm okay?

969
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,360
You were nice to me at the hospital,
thinking I was Mi-rae.

970
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,400
Do you hate me now that you know it's me?

971
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,730
What in the world are you talking about?

972
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,440
You two are both my daughters--

973
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,150
We're not the same to you!

974
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,280
You can't even tell us apart.

975
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:06,580
What's so different
between me and Mi-rae?

976
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,950
I don't even expect to be treated
the same way.

977
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,710
Why can't you just look at me once
for a change?

978
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,370
Hey.

979
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,420
Do you think my mom was interested in me
when I was growing up?

980
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,380
This is all I learned growing up,
so what do you expect me to do?

981
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:23,760
How am I supposed to be a good mom?

982
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,260
I just can't figure it out,
so why don't you tell me?

983
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,060
You're a daughter too.

984
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,480
You may not know how to be a good mom,

985
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,730
but you must understand how I feel.

986
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,110
You kept waiting for Grandma
to notice you too.

987
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,400
What do you want me to do?

988
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,780
Should I stare at you all day?
Is that what you want?

989
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,320
Forget it. I can't talk to you
about anything.

990
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,780
Hey, what do you mean by that?

991
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:53,160
I'm asking because I don't know.
I'll do what you want me to do.

992
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,040
I said, forget it!

993
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,340
This is why I didn't want
to come back here.

994
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,670
Then you should've stayed in Seoul!
Why did you come back?

995
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,550
Because you're here by yourself.

996
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:07,850
If I leave, then you'll be left all alone
and you'll have to care for Grandma alone.

997
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,270
Hey.

998
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,980
Why would you worry about that?

999
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,940
I don't know. Jeez.
It's not like we have a good relationship…

1000
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,940
I'm annoyed too.

1001
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:23,820
I want to live freely too,
without thinking about things like that.

1002
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,780
But I can't help it, so I have no choice.

1003
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,080
Mi-ji, no one ever asked you
to worry about those things.

1004
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,660
I may not seem like a mom to you,

1005
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,670
but why would you worry
about things like that?

1006
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,880
Then who will?

1007
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,750
Who else would worry about that
besides me?

1008
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,220
I might suck at everything else,

1009
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,430
but being here is something I can do.

1010
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,510
Of course you can do other things.

1011
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:52,350
I told you countless times that
you're capable of everything and anything.

1012
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:58,020
Why do you keep trying to live like me?

1013
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:03,110
Why do you keep making me
a poor excuse for a mom?

1014
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:08,360
Why are you crying?

1015
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:11,240
You should go.

1016
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,950
Go wherever you want
and do whatever you want.

1017
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:19,000
I'll stay here,
so you should leave, Mi-ji.

1018
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,210
Why would you worry about those things

1019
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,090
and break my heart like this?

1020
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:25,760
Don't cry.

1021
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:30,680
Mom, I'm sorry. Please stop crying.

1022
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,640
I'm sorry.

1023
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,600
Mom.
Hurry up and go.

1024
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,140
I told you to go.

1025
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:44,190
Go wherever you want.
Don't worry about things here and just go.

1026
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,040
What is it this time?

1027
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,000
How many times do I--
Do you want to go see my sister?

1028
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:05,420
Right now.

1029
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,060
Are we…

1030
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,060
really going to go see Su-yeon right now?

1031
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,940
There's something
I didn't tell you earlier.

1032
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,190
You probably won't be able
to see my sister.

1033
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,320
Pardon?

1034
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,660
She's in her room.

1035
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:35,200
It's been about half a year
since she last left it.

1036
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:39,330
But she'll probably hear everything
you say if you talk outside her door.

1037
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,180
Su-yeon.

1038
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,300
Ms. Yu is here.

1039
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,970
I'll let you two talk.

1040
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,700
Su-yeon, it's me.

1041
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,660
Mi-rae.

1042
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,870
You came early.

1043
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,500
It's your first day of work.

1044
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,590
I'm Kim Su-yeon.

1045
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:31,920
Why are you here like this?

1046
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:36,260
You left, so you should've forgotten
about everything and moved on.

1047
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,350
Is it because you resent what happened?

1048
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:47,230
I came to tell you
that I can't help you this time.

1049
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,820
You know how it is.

1050
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,240
This is a fight we'll never win.

1051
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:56,620
To be honest, I don't even know
why I need to fight.

1052
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,330
I can barely take care of myself,

1053
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,500
so I'm not interested in punishing anyone.

1054
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,790
I'm scared and tired.

1055
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,500
You left because
you were scared and tired too.

1056
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,880
I get it, so…

1057
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,890
So please try to understand me
just this once.

1058
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,810
Your brother worked very hard.

1059
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,150
But I'm ruining everything.

1060
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,610
I'm sorry.

1061
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,410
No.

1062
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,750
Su-yeon?

1063
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,960
I'm the one who ruined everything.

1064
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,800
I'm so sorry, Mi-rae.

1065
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,090
Why…

1066
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,300
are you apologizing?

1067
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:00,970
I ran away by myself…

1068
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,480
even though I knew
how hard things would be for you.

1069
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,770
I'm just as bad as those people.

1070
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,990
That's why I'm so ashamed,

1071
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,660
and I'm sorry.

1072
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,280
But why are you sorry?

1073
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,330
Why are you apologizing?

1074
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:26,250
The people who should feel sorry
aren't even apologizing.

1075
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,170
No.

1076
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,630
It was my fault.

1077
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,210
What was your fault?

1078
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,670
You're a victim.

1079
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,220
You did the right thing,
so why are you here like this?

1080
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,760
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you here like this?

1081
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:13,540
You're back late.

1082
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,260
I thought you might have moved,

1083
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:23,720
but I guess you still live here.

1084
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,100
Why have you come all this way to see me?

1085
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,230
You kept avoiding me, so I had no choice.

1086
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,070
Can you spare me a few minutes?

1087
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,690
Say what you need to here.

1088
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:48,000
I'm sorry, but please move
to the Childal branch for a bit.

1089
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,000
The Childal branch? Why should I?

1090
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,420
What do you mean why?

1091
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,460
You pulled out of the new HQ project
without any warning.

1092
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,340
It's a high-profile project,

1093
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:03,640
so I guess the higher-ups
can't just let this slide.

1094
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,850
What are you talking about?
You said you'd take care of it.

1095
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,600
You said if I backed out of the project,

1096
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,810
you'd make sure I wouldn't be penalized.

1097
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,850
You told me this yourself.

1098
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,190
But if you're not backing out…

1099
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,940
PROMISED NO REPERCUSSIONS
REFER TO RECORDING

1100
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,400
…because you're worried
about the repercussions,

1101
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,030
then I can take care of that for you.

1102
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,280
That was before the post was made.

1103
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,700
You acted like you were going
to let this go quietly.

1104
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,500
Why did you make a post like that?

1105
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,250
I didn't upload that post.

1106
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,960
Ms. Yu. Do you expect me to believe that?

1107
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:42,590
Even if you didn't write it,
the higher-ups already think you did.

1108
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:46,720
And honestly, the company was ready
to take legal action,

1109
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,640
but I talked them out of it,
on the condition that you go to Childal.

1110
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,520
I'm not the reason
the company can't take legal action.

1111
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,610
You didn't learn
from what happened to Su-yeon.

1112
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,860
Don't pick a fight you can't win.
You're only going to get hurt.

1113
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,700
Move to the Childal branch for now.

1114
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,370
I'll help you come back
once things quiet down.

1115
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,660
By that time, I'll be a team leader.

1116
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:13,160
And I'll have the power
to transfer you back to HQ.

1117
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,500
This is just like last time.

1118
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,460
What?

1119
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:20,170
The day you tried to kiss me,

1120
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:24,590
you got down on your knees and begged me
to forgive you when we were alone.

1121
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,260
Then you suddenly acted like
you were the victim in front of others.

1122
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:31,060
Do you really think
I'll fall for the same trick twice?

1123
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,560
Let go! Let go of it!

1124
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,520
Let go! Give me that!

1125
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,980
DON'T SAVE

1126
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,990
Hey!

1127
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,150
Damn it.

1128
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,660
Mi-rae, why are you so naive?

1129
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,910
Let go! Give me that!

1130
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:51,740
Damn it.

1131
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:55,750
You can do this crap all you want,
but no one will believe you.

1132
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:58,790
This isn't like some kind
of truth-telling game.

1133
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,090
It's basically a battle of reputations.

1134
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:03,210
Let go!
You still don't get it?

1135
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,880
No matter what you try to do,
no one is on your side.

1136
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:12,720
No matter what I do, you'll end up
getting blamed for everything.

1137
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,650
No, I did nothing wrong.

1138
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:19,730
Damn it.

1139
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,690
Hey!

1140
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,400
You jerk!

1141
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,900
Darn it.

1142
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,950
You bastard! Because of you, I…

1143
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,240
Mi-ji! Hey, Mi-ji!
Because of you, Mi-rae…

1144
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:34,790
You jerk!

1145
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,660
Damn it.

1146
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,710
Hey, are you okay? Wait.

1147
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,590
Why, you little!
Hey…

1148
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,250
Hey, hit him a little more.

1149
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,760
You really…

1150
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:48,760
No one's coming.

1151
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,090
PEOPLE'S POLICE

1152
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:55,970
Hey, Ho-su.

1153
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,900
I'm the perpetrator's lawyer.
Is it okay if I sit in?

1154
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,360
Does having a lawyer show up
change the fact that you assaulted me?

1155
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,230
I refuse to settle.

1156
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,320
Mr. Park Sang-yeong was previously accused

1157
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,280
of sexual harassment against
Ms. Yu Mi-rae within their company.

1158
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:15,410
That same individual came to her house,
grabbed her wrist, and threatened her.

1159
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,660
So shouldn't this
be considered a rescue instead?

1160
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,960
Hey, look.

1161
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,130
I believe Ms. Yu Mi-ji's action
was a lawful and justified act.

1162
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,550
Is it true that you were accused?

1163
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,560
No, that was just a false accusation.

1164
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,890
She accused an innocent person
of sexual harassment,

1165
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:42,900
but she couldn't even follow through
and dropped it midway.

1166
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,900
Is that true?

1167
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,980
This time, I won't drop the charges.

1168
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:52,070
I want to press charges against Mr. Park
for sexual harassment and defamation.

1169
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,450
The void left behind by my self-doubt

1170
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,870
began to fill with courage.

1171
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,840
Why does it feel
like I've run away from home again?

1172
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:23,310
With that courage,
I take a heavy step forward…

1173
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,560
SEOUL

1174
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:27,230
…into a fear I've already faced,

1175
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,530
one I know all too well.

1176
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,650
1 HOUR 58 MINUTES
119 KM

1177
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,700
Yes, ma'am. Did you decide what to do?

1178
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:45,790
No matter what future awaits us
at the end of the fight…

1179
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,290
I have no intention of selling.

1180
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:52,510
So that's what you decided to do.

1181
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:55,180
Okay, I understand.
Well, we'll meet again somewhere else.

1182
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,480
Yes, Reporter Im.

1183
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,650
I'm going to send an email right now.

1184
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:15,860
It's a bit urgent,
so release an article tomorrow.

1185
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:17,660
THE WOMAN WHO STOLE HER FRIEND'S LIFE

1186
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,120
Thank you for always helping me out.

1187
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:22,910
Yes.

1188
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,500

YU MI-RAE

1192
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:02,950
I'll do it my way, at my own pace.

1193
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,250
I don't want to lose a fight
I already lost once.

1194
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:06,580
Did she just scoff?

1195
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:08,920
The restaurant,
assets, and her only son.

1196
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
They should all go back
to the rightful owner.

1197
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:12,300
Are you in there?

1198
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,170
It's a violation of privacy, and illegal.

1199
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,170
It's not the time
to worry about legal stuff.

1200
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,890
Not everyone can ask for help.

1201
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,010
I finally found you.

1202
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,430
Se-jin?

1203
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,890
So this is your usual look.

1204
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,730
Let's go. We don't have much time.

1205
