00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>I still find myself</i>
<i>thinking about that moment.</i>

3
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,970
Shoot.

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,860
Hyeon Sang-wol! I know you're here.

5
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,910
Come out now.

PRESENTS FROM AMERICA

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
Hey!

8
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,210
Sang-wol went to the rooftop a minute ago.

9
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,500
-Darn it.
-The rooftop?

10
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,590
Don't "hey" us.

11
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,970
<i>The moment when you,</i>
<i>who devoured every book</i>

12
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,300
<i>and carried around a thick dictionary…</i>

13
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,310
They're gone.

14
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,230
<i>…chose to open</i>
<i>the pages of my book,</i>

15
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>pages no one had bothered to read.</i>

16
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,360
There. "Sang-wol."

17
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,900
Lucky you. Ro-sa isn't in here.

18
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,530
Look.

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,790
It's okay. From now on, I'll read for you.

<i>"Sangwol."</i>

21

-"A term for frost and the moon."
<i>-The moment my foggy world…</i>

22
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,550
-"The cold moon on a frosty night."
<i>-…became clear because of your voice.</i>

23

EPISODE 10
READING YOU

29
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,340
Are you sure you'll be okay?
Take a few more days off.

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,500
No, I'm good.

31
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,880
I have a lot to do.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,380
Should I go instead?

33
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,550
I'll just say I got a haircut.

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,810
Wipe the sleep out of your eyes first.

35
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm just worried.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,350
Everyone will be gossiping again at work.

37
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,400
It's fine. My mind is clear now.

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,440
See you later.

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,770
You really don't want me
to come with you?

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,530
What if that jerk is holding a grudge
and is waiting for you?

41
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,150
He's probably too busy
to wait around for me.

42
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,290
Sexual harassment?

43
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,210
Why is she bringing up something
that's already been settled?

44
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Ms. Yu was supposed to be transferred
to the Childal branch.

45
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,470
But the person who filed the report
can't be transferred.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,060
She used the rule to her advantage.

47
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,060
Still, you were unfairly accused.
Why do <i>you</i> have to switch teams?

48
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,520
They're acting like you're guilty
when nothing's been settled.

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,810
It is what it is.

50
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,150
It's unfair, but rules are rules.

51
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,610
I'll be back
once the investigation is over.

52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,360
I know you'll be short-staffed
while I'm away,

53
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,990
but hang in there.

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,450
But you just got back.

55
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,910
Here she comes.

56
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,760
Did she… just scoff?

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,510
Gosh. What the heck?

58
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,730
I heard you pressed charges
against Mr. Park.

59
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Did something happen?

60
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,070
No. I just finally did the homework
I'd been putting off.

61
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,990
If you ever need help, please let me know.

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,620
It won't be right away,

63
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,830
but I plan to do the homework
you gave me too.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,420
Why the change of heart?

65
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,960
Did my sister ask you to?

66
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,880
You know she's not
the type to ask for such a favor.

67
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,510
It was my decision.

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,600
So you're in this with me?

69
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,470
But I'll do it my way, at my own pace.

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,140
I don't want to lose a fight
I already lost once.

71
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,230
Ta-da!

72
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,240
Here's a little thank-you
for making the trip to the police station.

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,950
And this is a bribe
for handling Mi-rae's lawsuit.

74
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,750
There's also a bagel.

75
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,840
Okay. Talk.

76
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,050
You can't just recklessly jump
into a situation like that.

77
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,470
-You should've called me--
-Hey.

78
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,510
I can beat you in a fight easily.

79
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,220
Maybe you can, but that guy…

80
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,890
Beating him
would still be a problem. Listen.

81
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,020
You should settle things
with words or the law,

82
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,350
not with your fists.

83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,400
What if you had really gotten hurt?

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,270
If they'd considered it assault,
you could've--

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,280
I get it, mister. Just eat.

86
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,650
I won't do it again.

87
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,040
It's good, right?

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,460
What were you even doing there?

89
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,300
Were you on a stakeout or something?

90
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,710
Not at all.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,920
Mom pushed me to come to Seoul, so I did,

92
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,510
and that's what I ran into.

93
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,390
I think she had a hunch.

94
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,890
Maybe it was some
hidden maternal instinct.

95
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,270
So, you'll be staying in Seoul?

96
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,350
Yes, probably for a little while.

97
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,690
You said you felt
like you didn't belong here.

98
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,030
What changed your mind?

99
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,280
I don't know.

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,240
I still don't have anything to do here.

101
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,330
Maybe it's because of Mom.

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,700
-Your mom?
-Yes.

103
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,830
When I was living in Seoul
without telling Mom,

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,080
I felt so uneasy and anxious.

105
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,130
But when she told me to go,
I suddenly felt at peace,

106
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,010
as if I had gotten her permission
or something.

107
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,590
Funny, right?

108
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,220
Since when do I need Mom's permission?

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,180
Maybe you just wanted confirmation,
not permission.

110
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,350
That your mom's okay without you.

111
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,560
Why am I like this at 30?

112
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,650
Anyway, for the time being,
get used to seeing me around.

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,820
What if… you wake me up crying again?

114
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,910
Hey.

115
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,450
Seriously?

116
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,870
I'm going to eat this.

117
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,300
What do you mean
Mom's not doing well?

118
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,880
<i>It's not that she's sick or anything,</i>

119
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,930
but she doesn't have much energy
and hasn't been eating.

120
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,640
So I was wondering when Mi-ji is coming.

121
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,730
<i>Could she drop by, even just for a bit?</i>

122
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,110
<i>I think she'll eat something</i>
<i>if Mi-ji's here.</i>

123
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,150
That's not Mi-ji's responsibility.

124
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,280
If Mom's not eating,
you should get her to do it.

125
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,490
You know how stubborn she is.

126
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,160
I thought she might listen to Mi-ji.

127
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,500
Mi-ji won't be around for a while.
She's got something to do.

128
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Okay.

129
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,710
Please take good care of her.

130
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,080
All right.

131
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,750
Your mom's not doing well?

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,920
Goodness gracious.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,710
Why do you eavesdrop on people's calls?

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,970
You were talking loudly.

135
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,970
Where did Mi-ji go?

136
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,890
Seoul.

137
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,510
What? Why is she there?

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,390
Does she need to have a reason?

139
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,560
I told her to go and stay with Mi-rae.

140
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,900
Your mom's not doing well.
Ask her to come back for a few days.

141
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,690
Like you said, I'm her daughter,
and Mi-ji's just a granddaughter.

142
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,910
She deserves to live her own life.

143
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,040
What?

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,410
Moments like this remind me
of the true purpose of education.

145
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,750
People do change.

146
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,130
Even you can grow as a person.

147
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,670
I'm so proud.

148
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,630
-Are you making fun of me?
-But shouldn't you at least drop by?

149
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,100
When old folks stop eating,
that's serious.

150
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,640
You should get her to eat something.

151
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,980
You can't eat around someone you dislike.

152
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,440
Nothing goes down.

153
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,310
Who does she dislike? You?

154
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,020
Jeez.

155
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,860
Why would you think that?
You're her daughter.

156
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,820
You don't get it.

157
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,360
I can't believe this is happening
right after Mi-ji left.

158
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,450
Don't think like that.
What are you, a teenager?

159
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,160
You're too old now. Go see your mom.

160
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,210
Fine. Let me get back to my business.

161
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,960
You're acting like a kid.

162
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,040
How much is it?

163
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,420
-It's 24,000 won.
-Thanks for the meal.

164
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,050
-It's 24,000 won.
-All right.

165
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,300
Here you go.

166
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,050
-Thanks. It was great.
-Excuse me.

167
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,220
I forgot my glasses today.

168
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,390
-Okay.
-Could you read something for me?

169
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,520
Sure!

170
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,360
You see the poetry book?

171
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,650
This article with the photo.

172
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,030
Let's see.

173

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,960
living under the name of the late poet."

178
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,920
"An acquaintance from
the late poet's orphanage

179
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,550
allegedly took possession
of her building, royalties, and assets--"

180
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,680
It's nothing special. You can go.

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
Okay. Thank you.

182
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,320
FAMOUS POET KIM RO-SA EXPOSED

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,150
Is this true? You're not spreading
false information, are you?

184
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,950
It's a suspicion based on facts.

185
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,490
Didn't you ask me to do whatever it takes?

186
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,330
But what do we gain
by stirring up this mess?

187
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,620
Making noise in the media
won't change the landowner's mind.

188
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,880
It doesn't look
like she'll change her mind,

189
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,630
so I'm trying to change the owner.

190
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
Pardon?

191
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,970
How can we…

192
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,970
The late poet Kim Ro-sa left behind
more than just a name.

193
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,010
There's the restaurant, assets,

194
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,890
and her only son.

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,810
They should all go back
to the rightful owner.

196
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,060
Does the son want to sell the building?

197
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,690
His uncle does.

198
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,690
Kim Ro-sa's son is legally incompetent,

199
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,700
so even if he gets the inheritance,
he still needs his guardian's consent.

200
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,330
His uncle volunteered to be his guardian.

201
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,370
An investigative TV show
covering this issue is airing today,

202
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,750
so an official investigation
will begin soon.

203
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,670
Taking legal action…

204
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,550
will probably be much faster
than trying to change her mind.

205
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,630
RESTROOM

206
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,600
What were you talking about?

207
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,020
There's a sign saying
they're hiring, so I asked.

208
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,520
But they want men
because the job requires heavy lifting.

209
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,190
Have you always wanted
to work in a restaurant?

210
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Not at all. I just need to make money.

211
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,570
I have to do something while I'm here.

212
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,080
Then you don't need to rush to get a job.

213
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,660
There are more opportunities
in Seoul than in Duson-ri.

214
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,580
You've done all kinds of part-time jobs,
so you have a lot of options.

215
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,710
Do something you actually want to do.

216
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,590
Mm. Something I want to do?

217
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,300
Is there anything
you're interested in, even just a little?

218
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,930
Do you like being a lawyer?

219
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,060
I wouldn't say I like it…

220
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,440
but I wanted to become one.

221
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,980
Why was that?

222
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,320
You did well in school.
You could've become anything.

223
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,240
This feels like a law school interview.

224
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,120
At the interview,
I said, "to pursue social justice,"

225
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,830
but if I'm being honest…

226
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,870
Because it's a good job?

227
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,880
Do I sound too shallow?

228
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,130
No, it <i>is</i> a good job.

229
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,510
But what if you suddenly couldn't work
as a lawyer anymore?

230
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,510
Like, you couldn't work in law at all.

231
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,510
What would you do?

232
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,390
Is there anything you're interested in,
even just a little?

233
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,400
Okay. I admit I asked
a tough question to answer.

234
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,860
No, don't get me wrong.
I'm just really curious.

235
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,200
I've never thought
about anything else since I quit running.

236
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,330
Then let's try to find out together.

237
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,210
I'll think about
what else I could do besides law.

238
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,370
Okay.

239
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,300
I did plenty
of physical labor, though.

240
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,630
MURDERER STEALS
POET KIM RO-SA'S IDENTITY FOR MONEY

241
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,970
Hello?

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,640

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,400
Yes, this is she.

<i>Would you be available sometime this week?</i>

248
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,660
A crime? What do you mean?

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,160

CAREER ROADMAP

255
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,150
Why are you looking at job postings again?

256
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,360
We agreed to just read today.

257
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,660
Look.

258
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,080
<i>Teen Career Guide.</i>
<i>Finding Your Dream in Your Teens.</i>

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,490
<i>Career Coaching for Kids.</i>

260
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,080
Just reading the titles makes me anxious.

261
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,000
Do you know what it feels like
to start ten years late?

262
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,340
Don't judge by the titles. Just read them.

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,550
I picked out the good ones
after reading them first.

264
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,510
What about you?

265
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,260
You said you were going to look
for careers outside of law,

266
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,060
so what's this?
<i>"Why I Chose a Career in Law"?</i> Seriously?

267
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,350
I couldn't answer your question last time.

268
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,190
Maybe that's why I'm hesitant
about joining A&A.

269
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,520
I figured I should really think about it
before I start officially.

270
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,690
Gosh.

271
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,690
You really live

272
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,490
a tiring, hardworking, but admirable life.

273
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,490
I'll just… keep doing things my way.

274
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,500
Wow!

275
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,370
They pay 150,000 won
for a bioequivalence test? Amazing.

276
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,500
Why don't you try using an app?
Where did you even find these?

277
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,510
Analog has its own special charm.

278
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,050
Print ads feel more…

279
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,470
desperate.

280
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,260
Like they really need me.

281
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,390
Digital ads need you just as much.

282
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,100
Don't be so stubborn.

283
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,980
I'll just…

284
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,990
What is it?

285
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,700
This…

286
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,240
seems to be about Ms. Ro-sa.

287
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,240
What?

288
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,620
POET KIM RO-SA
ACCUSED OF IDENTITY THEFT

289
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,410
FILED A FALSE DEATH REPORT
TO SEIZE ASSETS?

290
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,630
She had a baby and things were fine,
but then she suddenly disappeared.

291
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,760
<i>My whole family</i>
<i>searched the entire country for her.</i>

292
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,340
<i>But when my brother finally found them…</i>

293
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,720
<i>that woman killed him.</i>

294
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,520
<i>After filing her own death report,</i>
<i>the ex-convict took the poet's name.</i>

295
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,640
<i>She put her friend's son</i>
<i>in a psychiatric hospital</i>

296
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,230
<i>and lived as Kim Ro-sa for over 30 years.</i>

297
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,730
<i>The poet's life savings, the royalties</i>
<i>from her best-selling poetry book,</i>

298
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,320
<i>and even the restaurant</i>
<i>she ran to make a living…</i>

299
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,950
<i>The fake Kim Ro-sa took</i>
<i>everything the real one left behind.</i>

300
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,540
<i>A publisher who had met her,</i>

301
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,460
<i>thinking she was</i>
<i>the real Kim Ro-sa, said…</i>

302
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,380
Is this the place from the TV show?

303
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,380
-Must be. Why else would it be closed?
-Oh my.

304
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,630
I ate here a few times.

305
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,180
-Gosh. I've got chills!
-Really?

306
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
Goodness.

307
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,600
-How could someone do that?
-I know.

308
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,270
Should a criminal like her
be allowed to run a restaurant?

309
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,560
Of course not.

310
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,730
Ms. Ro-sa.

311
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,230
Are you in there?

312
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,190
I don't think she's home.

313
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,700
What if she collapsed again
and she's on her own?

314
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,910
-Should we call the police?
-No. Ms. Ro-sa!

315
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,370
If you're home, please open the door.

316
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,420
Ma'am.

317
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Ms. Ro-sa.

318
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,920
It's all over now.

319
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,140
Ms. Ro-sa!

320
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,570
This isn't just any case.
It's a sexual harassment case.

321
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,990
If you want, you can take paid leave
until the investigation is over.

322
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,530
Would you like to do that?

323
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,790
No.

324
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,160
Are you sure?

325
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,910
We've separated the other party from you,

326
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,750
but since it happened
within the same department,

327
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,880
things might still get uncomfortable.

328
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,260
If I go on leave now,

329
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,590
everyone will think
I'm running away from this.

330
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
I doubt that.

331
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,890
If you stay quiet and out of sight,

332
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,180
people don't believe you.

333
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm already swamped,

334
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,490
and I still had to go
to the police station.

335
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,280
What for? The harassment case?

336
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,120
You'll all get called in.

337
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,490
The whole department is a mess
thanks to a nutjob.

338
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,750
What if…

339
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,290
something actually happened?

340
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,340
What do you mean?

341
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,010
It's not just any accusation.
She pressed charges for sexual harassment.

342
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,300
Who would go that far just out of spite?

343
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,140
Didn't you hear what Mr. Park said?

344
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,300
She did it to avoid going to Childal.
That incident was already over.

345
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,220
She just withdrew the complaint.
Nothing was settled.

346
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,480
Something feels off.

347
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,730
What's gotten into you?

348
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,210
Mi-rae!

349
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,630
Se-jin?

350
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,180
I finally found you.

351
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,690
Did you just see that lane change?

352
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,940
I'm not great with stick shifts,
but I'm actually a good driver.

353
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,110
How did you get to Seoul?

354
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,570
I drove my truck.

355
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,490
I nearly died three times on the highway.

356
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,070
Then what about this car?

357
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Remember what you said last time?

358
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,910
That I wouldn't recognize you
if I saw you in Seoul.

359
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,790
That stuck with me,

360
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,290
so I waited around Gwanghwamun
for two days.

361
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,130
But I couldn't find you.

362
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,050
Everyone looked so similar,
with their outfits and hairstyles.

363
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,510
So I figured
it'd be faster for you to find me.

364
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,350
-That's why I brought this car.
-You could've just called.

365
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,060
Mi-ji would've given you my number.

366
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,180
You think I didn't think of that?

367
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,440
That's why I wore sunglasses,
out of embarrassment.

368
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,190
Don't you believe in chance encounters
that feel like fate?

369
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,440
You have no sense of romance.

370
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,320
Why did you want to see me?

371
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,490
Jeez.

372
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,540
You left me hanging
after saying you had something to tell me.

373
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,910
You even promised you'd let me know
before going to Seoul.

374
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,710
Sorry. I had some things to deal with.

375
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,340
Looks like we both have a lot to say.

376
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,800
Can you make time for me tomorrow?

377
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,560
-You can talk now.
-Come on. Just a day.

378
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,520
I came all this way, risking my life.

379
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,270
Let's just think of it
as a one-day workshop

380
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,060
and spend a day together, okay?

381
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,600
Will you show up in this car?

382
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,940
-Will you meet me if I do?
-No. Only if you leave it behind.

383
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,780
Then we'll spend the entire day together.

384
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,320
Wait, the entire day?

385
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,360
You want me to bring this car?

386
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,450
See you in the morning.

387
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,740
This car is not supposed to be a threat.

388
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,120
When did driving cars like this one
become a bad thing?

389
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,610
What's so funny?

390
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,270
So this is your usual look.

391
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,820
Let's go. We don't have much time.

392
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,820
Hello.

393
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,370
Gosh, Se-jin! Long time no see.

394
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,780
This is my business partner.

395
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,950
Nice to meet you.

396
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,580
-Here, take this.
-No, I…

397
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,950
Take it. It suits you.

398
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,290
It's pretty.

399
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,290
-She got this to celebrate your opening.
-Oh, right.

400
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,170
Thank you.

401
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,010
It's sweet.

402
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,010
This is my business partner.

403
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,930
Nice to meet you.

404
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,100
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

405
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,810
It's so good.

406
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,350
Jeez, who comes to a brewery
and drinks Coke?

407
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,860
Enjoy, Mi-rae.

408
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,740
You seem to know
all the owners wherever we go.

409
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,150
It's not that I know the owners.

410
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,780
My friends became the owners.

411
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,200
They were all office workers.

412
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,490
But now they're running
their own businesses.

413
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,080
Looks like things worked out for everyone.

414
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,830
Don't even get me started.
Every time we drank,

415
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,340
they'd cry about why nobody
stopped them from quitting their jobs.

416
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,380
Even that one was barely scraping by
until last year.

417
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,140
The chocolate shop owner's first shop
went under, so that is his second.

418
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,720
They're all amazing.

419
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,890
I wonder where they get the courage.

420
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,890
I know. Where does it come from?

421
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,860
I guess that's the thing.

422
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,570
They all started from the bottom,

423
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,780
so even if they hit rock bottom again,

424
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,490
they believe they can climb back up.

425
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,330
This really is a workshop.

426
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,290
You wanted me to see them.

427
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,130
Originally, I just wanted to show you
what it means to throw money around.

428
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,460
But your reaction to the car
wasn't great, so I switched gears.

429
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,550
You said you had no one in Seoul
to give strawberries to.

430
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,800
I wanted you to meet some nice people.

431
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,480
Now that you've met them,
put whatever you want on my tab.

432
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,560
Cheers.

433
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,320
I think I'm getting drunk.

434
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,320
Did you spike this?

435
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,660
<i>I tried, but she's not eating.</i>

436
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,840
<i>Please convince your mom to eat.</i>

437
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,680
Oh dear.

438
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,600
Look at you eating so well.

439
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,560
How about one more bite?

440
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,680
Hey.

441
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,230
What are you doing?

442
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,600
You're here.

443
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,520
Ok-hui's here.

444
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,780
A FLAVOR KIDS LOVE

445
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,940
Ok-hui.

446
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,620
Are you still mad?

447
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,120
Am I someone who's always angry?

448
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,550
Why did you butt in without telling me?
That was unnecessary.

449
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,880
Jeez.

450
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,390
You butted into my business first.
Is it only "unnecessary" when I do it?

451
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,640
I brought pine nut porridge.
Feed her later.

452
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,020
Old people are just like babies
when it comes to feeding them.

453
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,850
Try to get her to eat gently.

454
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,400
Maybe even smile while you're at it.

455
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,070
I've never even done that
for my own kids. How can I…

456
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,160
Well, I've never raised a baby.

457
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
If I can do it, why can't you?

458
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,710
She wasn't like this before.

459
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,720
Haven't you heard that everyone
turns into a child when they get old?

460
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,640
She's no exception.

461
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,390
Not my mom.

462
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,850
She didn't shed a tear
when she got kicked out by my dad.

463
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,940
Instead, she yelled at me
for not walking fast enough.

464
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,030
I'd never seen that expression
on her face before.

465
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,620
But the thought of her hiding
that expression all this time…

466
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,040
makes me wonder
what I've been resenting all my life.

467
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,920
You're lucky it's not too late.

468
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,390
I never got

469
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,730
much love from my mom either.

470
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,810
Those new clothes I got every season?

471
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,650
Jeez.

472
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,860
My mom thought
I wasn't as good as my sisters,

473
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,950
so she always dressed me well
to save herself the shame.

474
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,790
All my life, I'd been sidelined.

475
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,050
It wasn't until I met Ho-su's dad
that I knew what it was like to be loved.

476
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,220
Once I felt that, I finally understood.

477
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,640
Gosh.

478
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,100
You have to be loved…

479
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,730
to know how to love.

480
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,020
Then, later on, this thought hit me.

481
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,480
"If…

482
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,280
I had loved my mom first…

483
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,790
would she have loved me back?"

484
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,550
It's too late for me,
but not for you, Ok-hui.

485
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,550
Give her some love before it's too late.

486
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,050
Okay?

487
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,860
POET KIM RO-SA
ACCUSED OF IDENTITY THEFT

488
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,620
That's way too detailed.

489
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,910
Who on earth…

490
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,170
Ho-su, come sit. Quick.

491
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,090
What's going on?

492
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,630
Did you get in touch with Ms. Ro-sa?

493
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,010
First, promise me you won't get mad.

494
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,560
Why would I…

495
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,020
Don't tell me you picked the lock.

496
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,980
That's illegal…

497
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,860
What is this?

498
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,610
SEOUL WESTERN DISTRICT
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

499
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,820
The prosecutor's office?

500
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,360
Where did you…

501
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,450
I went through the trash.

502
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,410
I swear, I was just trying to see
when she'd left the house.

503
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,000
Then I found this.

504
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,000
No, put it back.

505
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,750
And then what?

506
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,340
She threw it away
without even knowing what it was.

507
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,670
If it's important, we should let her know.

508
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,960
Even if she threw it away,

509
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,090
that's theft, a violation of privacy,
and illegal.

510
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,380
It's not the time
to worry about legal stuff.

511
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,970
Does the law know that she can't read?

512
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,470
Does the prosecutor's office know?

513
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,180
Only we know.

514
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,640
She didn't ask us for help.

515
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,230
We don't exactly know what's going on.

516
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,020
I'm not sure if we should jump in--

517
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,730
Not everyone can ask for help.

518
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,780
Mi-rae didn't tell me about
her situation either until I found out.

519
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,410
We have family, but Ms. Ro-sa has no one.

520
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,530
She probably doesn't even know
how to ask for help.

521
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,200
Is it right to leave her alone
just because she didn't say anything?

522
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm going to start breaking…

523
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,500
that privacy law or whatever right now.

524
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,970
I'm reading it out loud to myself.
This has nothing to do with you.

525
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,510
If you don't want to hear it,
cover your ears.

526
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,930
"Regarding the criminal case

527
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,810
involving forgery of private documents,
among other charges,

528
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,310
you are requested to appear at Prosecutor
Ko Yeong-hak's office, Room 503."

529
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,270
"It is alleged that you used
another person's name for your own benefit

530
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,820
-for a considerable period--"
-Wait.

531
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,400
What's the prosecutor's name?

532
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,700
Ko Yeong-hak.

533
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,080
PROSECUTOR KO YEONG-HAK'S OFFICE

534
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,380
Sir, what brings you here?

535
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,220
Is Mr. Lee here right now?

536
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,930
Yes.

537
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,310
Sir, you can't go in.

538
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,480
It's fine.

539
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,400
Ho-su.

540
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,400
What brings you here?

541
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,570
Thinking about coming back?

542
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,400
Were you behind everything?

543
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,240
What exactly are you referring to?

544
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,950
You orchestrated
the news articles and TV coverage.

545
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,370
And isn't Prosecutor Ko Yeong-hak,
who's conducting the investigation,

546
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,920
your closest friend from law school?

547
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,630
Are you saying I pulled strings?

548
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,380
Without any grounds,

549
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,720
that's a dangerous thing to say.

550
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,640
Do you really have to go this far?

551
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,100
Rosa Restaurant…

552
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,640
is just one of the many cases you handle.

553
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,980
Why are you targeting someone
with no family or friends?

554
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,060
Why are you so angry?

555
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,030
Did I fabricate a crime?

556
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,530
Ms. Kim Ro-sa… No.

557
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,660
Ms. Hyeon Sang-wol's wrongdoings
are only now coming to light.

558
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,660
Sir!

559
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,580
Again, this is the problem with you.

560
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,960
Do you think the law applies differently
to the poor or those without family?

561
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,130
Or are you blindly defending your client?

562
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,510
Then you should've done the same
for Chairman Choi.

563
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,550
Do you…

564
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,060
really think Chairman Choi
and Ms. Kim Ro-sa are comparable?

565
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,730
What makes them so different?

566
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,350
As lawyers, we should see them as equals.

567
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,360
By the way,

568
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,860
it's Ms. Hyeon Sang-wol, not Kim Ro-sa.

569
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,450
You should get your client's name right.

570
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,880
Are you okay? Ho-su.

571
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,380
If I'd known what kind of person you are,
I wouldn't have come today.

572
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,390
I don't think I'll be coming back.

573
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,820
Ms. Ro-sa.

574
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,280
If you're home, please come out.

575
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,160
Ms. Ro-sa!

576
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,330
Hey, Ho-su.

577
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,740
<i>KFMC was behind this.</i>

578
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,120
They started the scandal
because of the restaurant.

579
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,750
What does the restaurant
have to do with it?

580
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,290
If the identity theft charges stand,
the ownership could change.

581
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,500
In place of her son,
who's in the nursing home,

582
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,510
they'll probably appoint a guardian
they've already set up.

583
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,720
A guardian?

584
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,890
I'll call you back soon.

585
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,440
What do you mean I can't?

586
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,440
It's against our policy
to take that type of payments.

587
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,150
I mean… I'm just trying to pay

588
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,570
for several months in advance.
Why is that a problem?

589
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,410
Are you really his family?

590
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,580
What?

591
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,950
Ever since that show aired,
we've been flooded with calls.

592
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,620
Someone claiming to be his family
showed up the other day.

593
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,590
It's putting us
in a really difficult position.

594
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,050
I… have my reasons.

595
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,760
If you could just let me pay in advance--

596
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,770
I'm telling you I can't.
No matter how much you insist, I can't.

597
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,940
Why not?

598
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,020
It's not like she's asking for money.

599
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,730
What's the reason for saying no?

600
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,110
She said she has her reasons.
Does she have to beg?

601
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,950
It's against our policy--

602
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,950
What policy? Does it even exist?

603
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,540
If it does, show me.

604
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,540
Why were you just standing there?
That's not like you.

605
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,000
What do you know about me?

606
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
About you?

607
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,260
You shout, you argue,
and you throw salt at people.

608
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,800
You're not the type
to just stand there and take it.

609
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,180
You haven't done anything wrong--

610
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,970
Because that's who I really am.

611
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,890
Because I'm not Kim Ro-sa!

612
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,150
You must've heard it too.

613
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,530
When an uneducated orphan kills someone…

614
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,320
this is what she gets.

615
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,990
That's just how it is.

616
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,750
Why should it be like that?

617
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,540
Who are they to punish you?

618
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,380
I've lied my whole life.

619
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,880
Then you should be punished for just that.

620
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,220
People shouldn't disrespect others
like that.

621
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,640
You can come clean about the lies.

622
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,140
It sucks, but you can set things right.

623
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,600
I'll help you.

624
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,950
No one helps others for no reason.

625
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,830
That's the one thing I've learned in life.

626
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,750
Maybe you still have more to learn.

627
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,080
You only just met me.

628
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,590
Ms. Ro-sa.

629
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,760
Don't give up.

630
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,140
You never know what might happen.

631
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Okay?

632
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,710
Wow.

633
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,960
I've never been to an observatory before.

634
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,050
Me neither.

635
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,840
I thought we should wrap up the day
by looking at the stars.

636
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,180
I feel like we've been doing a lot
of stargazing ever since we first met.

637
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,770
What was it you wanted to talk about?

638
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,610
Something about "that option."

639
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,240
It doesn't matter anymore.
I heard you're going to the States.

640
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,700
I haven't decided yet.

641
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,830
How could you just disappear like that
without even hearing me out?

642
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,500
Why are you undecided?

643
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,750
I haven't heard the details,
but it seems like a good opportunity.

644
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,970
Because I haven't discussed it
with my business partner yet.

645
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,680
I'm not the type to juggle
two different things at once.

646
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,640
I wanted to look you in the eye,

647
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,140
talk things through,

648
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,650
and then decide.

649
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,110
So…

650
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,990
have you made up your mind?

651
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I didn't realize it until you asked…

652
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,090
but I guess I want to go.

653
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,640
You've made the right call.

654
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,470
Duson-ri isn't big enough
for someone like you.

655
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,770
You should go back to where you belong.

656
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,900
What about you?

657
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,690
You haven't said what you're going to do.

658
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,450
I'll finish what I need to do on my end
and then think about it.

659
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,660
I can't juggle two things at once either.

660
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,380
When you're done…

661
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,630
do you want to keep working with me?

662
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,590
But you're going to the States.

663
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,970
Yes. In the States.

664
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,440
<i>…and even the restaurant</i>
<i>she ran to make a living.</i>

665
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:45,320
<i>The fake Kim Ro-sa took</i>
<i>everything the real one left behind.</i>

666
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,240
Ma'am.

667
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,210
I need you to tell me
which parts of the story are true

668
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,500
and which aren't.

669
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,050
It's not like they made it all up.

670
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,220
Even in a single case,
there can be multiple perspectives.

671
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,720
But your side of the story
matters the most to me.

672
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,720
So feel free to talk.

673
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,480
Gosh.

674
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,900
I don't even know where to begin…

675
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,580
I've never told anyone before.

676
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,540
And to you…

677
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,330
it might sound bizarre.

678
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,500
We're not here to judge your life.

679
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,050
We're here to help.

680
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,220
But to do that, as your lawyer,
I need to know the whole story.

681
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,980
Ma'am.

682
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,600
It's okay.

683
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,150
Take your time.

684
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,450
My real name…

685
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,200
is Hyeon Sang-wol.

686
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,750
Ro-sa and I were very different.

687
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,960
Ro-sa was the neighborhood genius,

688
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,050
whereas I couldn't read…

689
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,880
even after finishing elementary school.

690
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,390
I'd learned the alphabet,

691
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,390
but for some reason,
I just couldn't do it.

692
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,690
<i>So I only worked jobs</i>
<i>where I didn't have to read.</i>

693
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,770
It was written right there
on the envelope.

694
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,730
How could you not know
there was money inside?

695
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,360
<i>-I faced unfair situations…</i>
-The foreman said…

696
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,110
<i>-…but I did my best to hide it.</i>
-…you were the last one at the office!

697
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,740
Where did you hide the money?

698
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,080
<i>People forgave a thief…</i>

699
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,410
-Forget it.
<i>-…but not being able to read…</i>

700
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,040
You put the money back.

701
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,670
<i>-…made you less than human.</i>
-If you can't, call the police right now!

702
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,590
What do you think you're doing?

703
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,130
Who are you?

704
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,090
Sang-wol, get up.

705
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,180
<i>-Only Ro-sa knew everything…</i>
-Are you okay?

706
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,140
I'm sorry I came too late.

707
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,930
<i>…and never let go of my hand.</i>

708
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,600
Sorry.

709
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,600
<i>The autumn leaves</i>
<i>Have had their moment</i>

710
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,810
<i>-And now, everywhere I walk</i>
-Okay, smile.

711
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,810
<i>The ground is soft</i>

712
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,610
-One, two. That's lovely.
<i>-With freshly fallen leaves</i>

713
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,280
"Plum Blossoms in Winter."

714
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,240
<i>-I'm only renting this house</i>
<i>-The book she read…</i>

715
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
<i>The yard is filled with</i>

716
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,910
<i>-Six or seven kinds of trees</i>
<i>-The first poem she wrote…</i>

717
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,200
<i>Persimmon, jujube</i>

718
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,540
<i>-Cherry, and grape for fruit</i>
<i>-Even the meaning of my name…</i>

719
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,960
<i>-And lilac, rose</i>
<i>-Ro-sa read them all to me.</i>

720
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,330
<i>-And wisteria for flowers</i>
-Next person!

721
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,250
Smile. One, two…

722
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,050
One more!

723
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,140
Are you two sisters or friends?

724
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,010
We're twins!

725
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,720
No wonder you look alike.

726
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,480
All right, then.

727
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,310
-Isn't this fun?
-One, two…

728
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,190
APRIL 12, 1974
RO-SA AND SANG-WOL

729
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,870
Hey!

730
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,750
-What?
-You should've called me.

731
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:20,870
-Goodness.
-My gosh.

732
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,670
Let's have some steamed buns.

733
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,800
<i>We lived together</i>
<i>after we left the orphanage.</i>

734
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,880
It's so good.

735
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,880
<i>Those were good times.</i>

736
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,850
<i>When it was just the two of us,</i>

737
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,060
<i>-nothing felt wrong.</i>
-Eat some more.

738
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,310
KIM RO-SA

739
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,700
Are you insane? Why are you burning this?

740
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,200
What's wrong?

741
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,580
She's burning the poem you wrote, Ro-sa.

742
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,080
I told her she could.
I already memorized it.

743
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,580
Let's go.

744
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,750
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,630
<i>I only realized that…</i>

746
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,510
<i>once others started moving in with us.</i>

747
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,930
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

748
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,140
-Cheers!
-We have so much to eat.

749
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,020
Ro-sa, your poetry…

750
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,730
lacks the current zeitgeist.

751
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,190
If you just want to write pretty lines,

752
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,490
-then write children's poems.
-I agree.

753
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,570
<i>What felt natural to us…</i>

754
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,990
I guess so.

755
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,750
<i>…seemed flawed to the rest of the world.</i>

756
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,160
That's why…

757
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,040
I like Ro-sa's poems.

758
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,300
Wait. What's going on here?

759
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,720
-What do you think?
-What's between you two?

760
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
-Nothing's going on.
-Hey…

761
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,970
-It's not nothing. Have a drink.
<i>-No.</i>

762
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,640
I'm not letting it go
until you tell us!

763
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,020
<i>I was the one who was flawed.</i>

764
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,890
To me, Ro-sa was…

765
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,090
That night, I left the house.

766
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,800
Nothing would be flawed
once I was out of the picture.

767
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,810
Ro-sa begged me not to go,

768
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,520
but I couldn't even tell her why.
I just ran away.

769
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,400
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Sang-wol! Take this to the table!

770
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,940
Just a moment!
Next customer, please come in.

771
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,610
Ice pops!

772
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,240
<i>I wandered wherever my feet took me</i>

773
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,950
<i>and ended up working at a restaurant.</i>

774
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,780
-Sang-wol.
-Yes?

775
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,910
<i>-I learned the recipe back then.</i>
-Come here.

776
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,040
Two spoons.

777
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,580
<i>-No one wanted chicken giblets.</i>
-One spoon of soy sauce,

778
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,290
half a spoon of <i>doenjang</i> and gochujang.

779
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,340
<i>-So I could always get my share.</i>
-Good.

780
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,550
<i>I couldn't help myself…</i>

781
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,090
<i>so I called Ro-sa just once.</i>

782
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,800
<i>Ro-sa?</i>

783
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,890
<i>She moved after getting married.</i>
<i>Haven't you heard?</i>

784
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,900
<i>I figured as much.</i>

785
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,940
<i>Ro-sa always…</i>

786
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,870
<i>wanted a family.</i>

787
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,390
<i>Years passed.</i>

788
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,510
<i>I went to Seoul on an errand…</i>

789
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,680
-It's good, right?
-So good.

790
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,970
<i>…and ran into her by chance.</i>

791
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,810
-Thanks. Come again.
-Thank you.

792
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,770
-I should take a look at this.
-Go ahead.

793
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,650
Can I get two steamed buns?

794
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,070
-Two?
-Yes.

795
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,030
Let me get you the warmest ones.

796
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Ro-sa?

797
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,620
Are you Ro-sa?

798
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,130
Sang-wol.

799
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,880
How long has it been?

800
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,550
I heard you married Jong-su!
Now you have a child?

801
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,640
Let's go somewhere warm and catch up…

802
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,360
<i>Ro-sa was being abused.</i>

803
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,580
<i>Even when she was pregnant.</i>

804
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:15,790
She blamed herself
until the day she died,

805
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,840
thinking her child's condition
was her fault.

806
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,090
Did you report it?

807
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,220
Did you not go to the police?

808
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,720
Back then,

809
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,810
if you ran to a station begging for help,

810
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,640
they'd tell you to listen to your husband
and send you home.

811
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,900
All of their friends took his side.

812
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,610
With no family to turn to,

813
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,570
Ro-sa endured it all alone
with no support.

814
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,910
I took her and the child and ran away.

815
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,250
Things were good for a while.

816
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,670
I'd come back from work,

817
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,500
and Ro-sa would be waiting with the baby.

818
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,720
But misery…

819
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,310
isn't something you can
cut off that easily.

820
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,150
Damn you.

821
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,950
-Shit.
-What are you doing?

822
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,580
Damn it!

823
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,540
I never liked you from the start.

824
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,310
Mommy!

825
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,330
Take Yeong-ho and leave.

826
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,550
What?

827
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,510
<i>I</i> killed Cha Jong-su.

828
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,630
What are you saying?

829
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,470
Sang-wol.

830
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,140
Get a grip, Ro-sa.

831
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,810
You have to raise Yeong-ho.

832
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,500
While I was in prison,
Ro-sa suffered even more.

833
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,880
People judged her for siding
with a woman who killed her husband.

834
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,510
Her in-laws cut ties with her.

835
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,760
She raised a child
with special needs on her own.

836
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,600
She even sold her poems
for next to nothing just to get by.

837
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,070
<i>The real problem started</i>
<i>after I was released.</i>

838
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:31,320
<i>Ro-sa's occasional publishing work</i>
<i>didn't bring in enough to support us.</i>

839
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,120
<i>I had to work,</i>

840
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,450
<i>but word got out that I was a murderer.</i>

841
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,120
<i>No one would hire me.</i>

842
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,370
Ro-sa.

843
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,720
<i>That's when Ro-sa suggested it.</i>

844
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,010
Sang-wol,

845
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,600
let's go to Seoul.

846
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,020
Somewhere no one knows us,

847
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,100
where we can start over.

848
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,060
So, that was when you started
using her name?

849
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,150
Whenever I needed a name for anything,

850
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,320
I used Ro-sa's.

851
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,330
Because I had a criminal record.

852
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,960
Getting a family register,
or opening a bank account…

853
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,630
For anything that needed a name,
we used hers.

854
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,050
After a few years of scraping by,

855
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,050
we finally managed to save enough

856
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,930
to buy a two-story house
that that was listed at a low price.

857
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,730
TITLE DEED
GRANTEE: KIM RO-SA

858
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,770
We'll run a restaurant on the first floor

859
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,190
and live on the second.

860
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,070
It's just down the stairs,

861
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,400
so we can take Yeong-ho
back and forth easily.

862
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,700
What will you name the restaurant?

863
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,740
Kim Ro-sa.

864
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,370
Come on.

865
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,710
It should sound like a real restaurant.

866
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,210
Then Rosa Restaurant?

867
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,300
Rosa Restaurant?

868
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,720
<i>Why does life</i>
<i>always take something away…</i>

869
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,050
-Do you like it?
<i>-…whenever it gives you something?</i>

870
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,050
Look at this.

871
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,720
Ro-sa, are you okay?

872
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:23,730
<i>-She had cancer.</i>
-Why is no one coming here to help her?

873
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,600
<i>-By the time she saw a doctor…</i>
-Hang in there.

874
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,270
<i>…it was already too late to do anything.</i>

875
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,740
You're not well.
Where did you go all alone?

876
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,660
I admitted Yeong-ho.

877
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:44,040
What? Did you really leave him
at that place?

878
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,710
You can't run the restaurant
and look after him by yourself.

879
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,420
Why would I be by myself?

880
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,630
Stop talking about dying
and get treatment.

881
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,010
This is a death report form.

882
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,430
-Ro-sa.
-Listen to me.

883
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,560
When I die…

884
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,650
report my death as Hyeon Sang-wol's,

885
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,360
and you live as Kim Ro-sa.

886
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,110
Are you crazy?

887
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,530
How could I live under your name?

888
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,200
How could I live as you?

889
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,700
Then what about Yeong-ho?

890
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,750
Besides me, the only family he has
is Cha Jong-su's family.

891
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:32,000
And you know they don't care about
what happens to him.

892
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,630
When I die,

893
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,300
they'll take him for the money
and abandon him without a second thought.

894
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:42,510
So please…

895
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,970
live as me.

896
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,310
I'm begging you.

897
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,870
TITLE DEED
GRANTEE: KIM RO-SA

898
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,620
These are the things Ro-sa left behind.

899
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,130
I don't know what's written on them,
but I thought they might help.

GIFT DEED

903
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,150
<i>If you're reading this letter,</i>

904
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,780
<i>it means Sang-wol has finally</i>
<i>found someone to confide in,</i>

905
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:29,620
<i>or she's desperate enough</i>
<i>to hand this over.</i>

906
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,290
<i>I sincerely hope</i>
<i>that you're someone with a kind heart.</i>

907
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,840
<i>Life is like poetry.</i>

908
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,970
<i>From a distance,</i>
<i>it looks like an indecipherable code,</i>

909
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,430
<i>but if you look closely</i>
<i>with a heart willing to understand,</i>

910
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,390
<i>only then will you see the meaning within.</i>

911
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,650
<i>I spent my whole life trying to define</i>
<i>Sang-wol and me with a single word.</i>

912
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,770
<i>But each word felt</i>
<i>either too grand or too small.</i>

913
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,280
<i>I never found the right one.</i>

914
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:05,360
<i>Still, you can define</i>
<i>who Hyeon Sang-wol is</i>

915
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,820
<i>in just three syllables.</i>

916
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,990
<i>What will you name the restaurant?</i>

917
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,830
Kim Ro-sa.

918
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,460
<i>Kim Ro-sa.</i>

919
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,000
<i>With that foolishly kind heart of hers,</i>

920
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,460
<i>she took all the bad</i>
<i>so I could have only the good.</i>

921
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,590
<i>All her kindness is held</i>
<i>within the three syllables of my name.</i>

922
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:32,600
<i>I held onto everything for a while</i>
<i>because the world is harsh and cold.</i>

923
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:37,440
<i>But everything in my name</i>
<i>truly belongs to Sang-wol.</i>

924
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:44,280
<i>Now I hope</i>
<i>that she can finally let go of the lies</i>

925
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,030
<i>and reclaim what's hers.</i>

<i>Please,</i>

929
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,630
<i>look upon this lonely yet kind soul</i>

930
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,130
<i>as you would read a poem.</i>

931
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,430
Ms. Sang-wol!

932
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,930
It's me, Ho-su!

933
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,930
Please open the door just for a second.

934
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,350
Okay.

935
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,820
I came to read it for you.

936
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,650
-What?
-I'll read it for you.

937
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,200
This will fix everything.

938
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,530
What?

939
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,490
We have one strategy.

940
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,790
We'll admit to the identity theft charges.

941
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,200
Right away? We're not fighting it?

942
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,120
There's no need. We have this.

943
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,960
This is the will Kim Ro-sa wrote
before she died.

944
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,840
It's notarized and legally binding.

945
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,590
We admit that she's been living
under Ms. Kim Ro-sa's name,

946
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,970
but since all the assets
were already gifted to her,

947
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,680
it's hard to say she profited
from the identity theft.

948
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,270
According to the publisher,

949
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,480
she pretended to be the poet
until recently.

950
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,110
Wasn't that to take advantage
of royalties and other earnings?

951
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,150
All income earned as a poet

952
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,440
was donated in full
to the deceased's alma mater, HNU,

953
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:10,990
with Ms. Hyeon contributing
her own funds as well.

954
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,370
Those are also included in the gift deed.

DONATION RECEIPT - DONOR: KIM RO-SA
RECIPIENT: HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

957
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:29,840
We just met your friend
and admitted to the charges.

958
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,550
I was wondering how that would go.
Thanks for calling.

959
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,720
Things won't go as you want them to.

960
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,180
I called to tell you that.

961
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,200
Hi, please have one.

962
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,200
Hello.

963
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,120
Hi, thank you for your hard work.

964
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,490
Hello. Thanks for everything.

965
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,450
-What brings you here?
-Hi, please have one.

966
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,000
You know the Kim Ro-sa Scholarship
here at HNU

967
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,750
that's been around for 20 years?

968
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,170
Hello.

969
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,920
You received the Kim Ro-sa Scholarship
in college, right?

970
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,380
That would be great. Thank you.

971
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,640
DONATION STATEMENT

972
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,510
The claim that they were a happy family
comes only from the brother-in-law.

973
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,730
The poet was a victim
of serious domestic violence,

974
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,480
even while she was pregnant.

975
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,310
<i>Those people refused</i>
<i>to look after her son,</i>

976
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,110
<i>using his disability as an excuse.</i>

977
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:31,190
<i>I don't understand why</i>
<i>they've waited until now to step up.</i>

978
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,910
<i>It seems like they're after the deceased's</i>
<i>inheritance and other benefits.</i>

979
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,990
IF YOU BADMOUTHED HYEON SANG-WOL,
REFLECT ON YOURSELF

980
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,500
-Hello. Here it is.
-Thank you.

981
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,580
Good luck!

982
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,560
Are you okay?

983
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,680
Should we go in a little later?

984
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:03,140
No.

985
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,690
We can't be late.

986
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,270
Today will probably be
the last day of questioning.

987
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,030
No matter how things turn out,
we'll handle it together, just like now.

988
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,610
Don't worry too much.

989
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,740
Hey, Ho-su!

990
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,700
PROSECUTION SERVICE

991
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,370
Wait, take this!

992
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,120
Here.

993
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,040
I told you that you didn't have to come.

994
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,420
What are these?

995
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,090
They're petitions.

996
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,010
It's from students who received
the Kim Ro-sa Scholarship.

997
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,970
They wrote them after hearing about you.

998
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,520
I'll read them all to you later.

999
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,310
So good luck, and do your best in there.

1000
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,940
So that's how it went.

1001
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,320
All right. I'll tell her.

1002
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,200
What did they say?

1003
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,160
Suspended indictment.

1004
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,540
-It's a good thing.
-Ms. Sang-wol!

1005
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,420
You've made it through.

1006
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,130
I had a good feeling about today.
I had this dream last night,

1007
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,590
and as soon as I woke up,
I looked up the interpretation.

1008
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,300
It said it was a lucky dream!

1009
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:18,680
But I didn't want to jinx it,

1010
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,010
so I couldn't even tell you,
and I kept it…

1011
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,260
All right. Calm down.
I'll get you some water.

1012
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,600
-No, I…
-Let me.

1013
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,430
-I'll get it.
-I…

1014
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,310
This is amazing.

1015
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,810
Listen. Here's what I dreamed last night.

1016
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,110
I was fighting a tiger.

1017
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:35,780
Bare hands. No weapons.

1018
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:39,070
But the tiger didn't use its teeth either,
and stood up out of the blue,

1019
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,280
took a boxing stance,
and threw the first punch at me.

1020
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:43,740
I took the punch. And guess what?

1021
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,790
<i>On the day you closed my book and left,</i>

1022
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,580
<i>Ro-sa, you said to me…</i>

1023
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,000
Don't leave me behind.

1024
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,920
How can I live without you?

1025
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,970
You'll meet…

1026
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,180
…good people.

1027
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,180
There's no one else.

1028
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:13,560
You're all I have.

1029
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,030
You'll meet them.

1030
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,540
It might take a while, but one day,

1031
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:31,250
you'll meet people who will read you…

1032
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,710
for who you are.

1033
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,140
It specifically said I'd win a lawsuit.

1034
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:54,980
It's a suspended indictment, not a win.

1035
01:04:55,820 --> 01:05:00,070
Whatever. You should go and buy a cake.
Let's have a party.

1036
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,780
<i>It might take a while…</i>

1037
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,160
Sweet potato cake, maybe?

1038
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,030
<i>-…but one day…</i>
-Let's ask her.

1039
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,990
<i>…you'll meet people</i>
<i>who will read you for who you are.</i>

1040
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,800
Everyone loves
sweet potato cake in Duson-ri.

1041
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,460
-Let's see who wins.
-Fine.

1042
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,470
-Ms. Sang-wol.
-Ms. Sang-wol.

1043
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,180
Do you prefer sweet potato
or strawberry?

1044
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,390
For cake.

1045
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:30,220
-Strawberry.
-I told you!

1046
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,070
RING

1047
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,240
Hello.

1048
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,160
Hello?

1049
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,830
Hello? Hello?

1050
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,270
Why aren't you coming in?

1051
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,650
Is something wrong?

1052
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,000
I need to take this call real quick.

1053
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,760
YU MI-RAE - YU MI-JI

1054
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,680
<i>I'm calling from the hospital.</i>

1055
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,300
<i>Are you Ms. Kang Wol-sun's daughter?</i>

1056
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:32,850
We're from the Fair Trade Commission.

1057
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,720
We're investigating the Sihan Construction
case, so please cooperate.

1058
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:38,560
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>you're here now.</i>

1059
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,650
<i>That must mean you're ready</i>
<i>to respond to my offer.</i>

1060
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:44,400
I want to see things through
to the very end here.

1061
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,440
<i>You're sick again, aren't you?</i>

1062
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,030
Let me see if you have a fever.

1063
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,700
I'm just a bit tired.

1064
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,700
<i>Let's meet up tomorrow.</i>

1065
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,660
<i>What should I do now?</i>

1066
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,580
<i>You mean there's nothing I can do</i>
<i>until things get worse?</i>

1067
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,120
Here's what I dreamed last night.

1068
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:01,040
I was fighting a tiger.

1069
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,840
Bare hands. No weapons.

1070
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,130
But the tiger didn't use its teeth either,
and stood up out of the blue,

1071
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:09,380
took a boxing stance,
and threw the first punch at me.

1072
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:12,050
I took the punch.
And guess what? It was soft.

1073
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,970
And it didn't hurt. Total kitty punch.

1074
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,270
So I grabbed it by the scruff,

1075
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,440
slammed it down, and beat it up.

1076
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,980
So you hit an animal?

1077
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,310
Yes.

1078
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:26,030
But it was a really mean tiger.

1079
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,070
Like the uncle from <i>The Lion King.</i>

1080
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:31,240
Right. The lion, I mean, tiger.

1081
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,740
So it was a lucky dream?

1082
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,120
That's the thing.

1083
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,330
I looked it up,
and it's not just any lucky dream.

1084
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,790
It specifically said I'd win a lawsuit.

1085
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,620
You shouldn't get ahead of yourself.

1086
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,920
It's a suspended indictment, not a win.

1087
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:48,130
Whatever. You should go and buy a cake.
Let's have a party.

1088
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:54,050
