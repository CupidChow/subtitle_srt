OUR UNWRITTEN SEOUL

2
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,423
Are you sure about this?

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,471
Once you walk out that door…

4
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,932
we won't be on the same team.

5
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,227
You know I don't play fair, right?

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,479
It won't be easy
getting into a decent firm.

7
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,817
I don't speak kindly about someone
who turned their back on me.

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,320
- I'll find somewhere to work.
- That's not the issue.

9
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,699
You're not the kind of person
who'll take any job.

10
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,118
What matters to you is where you go.

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,370
From college to law firms,

12
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,748
you think that your affiliations
define your worth, don't you?

13
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,334
Only two of the top three
law firms are left.

14
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,255
How far down
are you willing to go after that?

15
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,383
If it's not up to your standards,

16
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,594
I bet you'd rather
change careers entirely.

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,056
I'm curious to see…

18
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,226
how far…

19
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,146
you are willing to fall.

20
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,317
<i>I'll help you.</i>

21
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,404
That whistleblowing case
you never got to finish.

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,197
I'll help you with it.

23
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,868
Who asked for your help?

24
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,704
I told you. That's all behind me.

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,541
I was still with the firm then,
so I couldn't take the case myself.

26
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,210
Now I can handle the lawsuit
or whatever else needs to be done.

27
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,378
Look…

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,213
I said I'm fine.

29
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:14,217
And wait. You quit?
Why'd you suddenly leave?

30
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,594
Why not?

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,554
That's not the only law firm in the world.

32
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,599
I can go anywhere.
No, somewhere even better.

33
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,060
That's what I'll do.

34
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,728
I will.

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,357
Are… you drunk?

36
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,651
No.

37
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:35,238
I'm more clear-headed than ever,
and I don't regret my decision.

38
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,408
- I'm going to help you.
- I said I don't need help.

39
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,785
I'm still going to help.

40
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,870
I'll do whatever it takes.

41
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,080
I have to.

42
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,793
<i>Every animal has</i>
<i>its own way of surviving.</i>

43
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,295
Mi-ji has missed
nearly two months of school.

44
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,174
If she's sick,
she should submit a doctor's note.

45
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,134
She's barely meeting
the attendance requirement.

46
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,262
If this keeps up, she won't graduate.

47
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,153
- Lee Da-yeon.
- Here.

48
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,906
- Yu Mi-ji.
- Present.

49
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>When sensing danger or predators,</i>

50
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>chameleons change their appearance</i>
<i>to fool their enemies.</i>

00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,586
CONSENT LIST

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,175
Doesn't Mi-ji get
some kind of terminal leave?

53
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,886
- Pardon?
- Unless she joined the army,

54
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,471
how can she be gone this long?

55
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,101
She went to Seoul. To a relative's house.

56
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:51,690
What kind of relative lets someone stay
for over a year?

57
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,945
- There you go.
- Okay. Thanks.

58
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,322
- Bye.
- All right. Take care.

59
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,118
<i>Some animals, like pheasants,</i>
<i>just tuck their heads to blend in.</i>

60
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,079
By the way, is Mi-ji still not back yet?

61
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,375
It's been two years since she left!
Has she moved out for good?

62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,460
Moved out?

63
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,671
Didn't she go to Seoul
to get her leg fixed?

64
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,757
- What the heck!
<i>- Octopuses and squids…</i>

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,051
- Are you out of your mind?
<i>- …release ink to escape danger.</i>

66
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,935
<i>And humans,</i>

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,689
<i>when in crisis,</i>

68
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:38,737
<i>often behave in ways</i>
<i>no other animal does.</i>

69
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,992
Gosh, it's tough cooking
all three meals at home every day.

70
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,789
No deliveries, no eating out…

71
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,583
It's not good to eat out all the time.

72
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,169
It's cheaper and healthier to eat at home.

73
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,462
Did you get garlic?

74
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,174
Wait. Did I buy garlic?

75
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,430
EPISODE 4
MY NEMESIS

76
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,101
New York? Or London?

77
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,478
Man!

78
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,438
New York?

79
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,565
London?

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,069
Choosing between
the London and New York branch?

81
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,278
- No.
- Don't get up.

82
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,656
You deserve it.

83
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,450
You already set up a meeting
with the landowner of Rosa Restaurant.

84
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,661
Yes, it's set for Friday afternoon.

85
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,081
I had high hopes,
and you really delivered.

86
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,585
Our Ms. Yu exceeded our expectations,
don't you think?

87
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,837
Well…

88
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,298
She hasn't agreed to sell yet.
All we have is a meeting scheduled.

89
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,969
Securing a meeting with someone
who refused to speak to us is impressive.

90
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,972
Hey, everyone!

91
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,933
Let's give Ms. Yu a round of applause
for her hard work.

92
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,355
It's fine. Stay seated.

93
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,904
Thank you.

94
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,782
Don't worry too much, Mr. Choi.

95
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,536
I will make sure our team
gets the credit, not her.

96
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,162
No way. We need to go bigger.

97
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,873
Invite the General Affairs Team.

98
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,084
And keep emphasizing,
"Ms. Yu made this meeting happen."

99
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,213
- Sorry?
- Get her under the spotlight now.

100
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,174
So when things go wrong,
all the attention's on her.

101
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,718
You know how landowners are.

102
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,014
They say they will turn up
and then ghost you at the last minute.

103
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,642
Still, if by some miracle
Mi-rae pulls off the land acquisition--

104
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,394
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes.

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,522
Who's leading the new HQ building project?

106
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,274
Lead Specialist Park…

107
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,822
So, even if Mi-rae pulls it off,

108
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,699
she'll end up backing out.

109
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,413
Sir, you are ten steps ahead.

110
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,082
I'm learning so much from you.

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,420
Lead Specialist Park?

112
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,384
Ghost me?

113
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,970
No way.

114
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,267
No.

115
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,065
Please, that can't be true.

116
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,320
Is she really ghosting me?

117
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,906
Ma'am, please. That can't be true.

118
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,244
Please, ma'am. Don't do this to me.

119
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,957
Ms. Ro-sa.

120
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,751
Ma'am.

121
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,432
Gosh, a leak out of nowhere?
This is terrible.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,729
Are you here to keep me put
before the meeting?

123
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,731
What? No!

124
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,067
I was just heading home and…

125
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,195
How long should I say
you'll be closed for?

126
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,990
Until the day after tomorrow…

127
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,533
No.

128
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,951
Make it three days.

129
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,412
Gosh, three days?

130
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,664
Does it really take that long
to fix a leak?

131
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,792
I also need a new fridge.

132
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,336
Jeez.

133
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,715
The old one was ancient,
so they don't make parts for it anymore.

134
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,801
It short-circuited and burned.

135
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,929
Where will you go to buy one?
I can come with you.

136
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,598
Doesn't your company give you any work?

137
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,976
I am working right now.

138
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,394
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

139
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,689
If you're done
checking up on me, take this.

140
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,066
- Just put it in a pot and let it boil.
- Yes!

141
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,278
I finally get a single portion takeout?

142
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,696
Thank you.

143
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,615
No need to pay.

144
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,577
I'm giving it to you
so it doesn't go to waste.

145
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,121
And give this to that guy.

146
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,248
Ho-su, Ho-se, or whatever it was.

147
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,500
You mean Lee Ho-su?

148
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,090
He's getting ginseng chicken soup?

149
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,136
He must be feeling anxious
because he quit his job.

150
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,472
He should at least eat well.

151
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,223
Drop it off and check in on him.

152
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,476
Don't worry.

153
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,188
He probably even makes
a to-do list on his days off.

154
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,232
People like him can end up

155
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,943
like deflated balloons
when faced with such hardship.

156
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,446
Really? Ho-su?

157
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,829
- Come in.
- Okay.

158
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,042
- Want something to drink?
- Just water.

159
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,598
What's that?

160
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,391
It's ginseng chicken soup.

161
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,519
Ms. Ro-sa told me to bring it to you.

162
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,771
You haven't eaten, right? Have some.

163
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,982
- It's fine. I'll eat later.
- Have some now.

164
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,485
It won't taste good
once it's been in the fridge.

165
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,529
- I'll eat it later. I promise.
- Oh no!

166
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,072
Gosh.

167
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,659
- Sorry, let me get that.
- No, you get out of the way.

168
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,827
I'll clean it up.

169
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,457
You grabbed that with your bare hands?

170
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,168
Sit over there. I'll take care of it.

171
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,886
Last time I saw you,
you were all fired up about helping me.

172
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,389
Why do you seem so down now?

173
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,598
Are you sick?

174
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,893
I'm just tired from switching jobs.

175
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,604
Switching jobs?

176
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,523
You just quit a few days ago.

177
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,150
When do you start at the new place?

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,821
I've been rejected
everywhere I've applied so far.

179
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,116
You must have been in too much of a hurry.

180
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,911
But hey, it's good! You've never
really taken a break before, right?

181
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,079
Now you can!

182
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,290
Go travel or enjoy your hobbies.

183
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,584
I don't have a hobby.

184
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,087
It doesn't have to be anything big.
Just something you usually enjoy.

185
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,882
What do you do when you're not working?

186
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,341
I sleep…

187
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,260
or do chores.

188
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,596
No, not those.

189
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,014
What do you do for fun?

190
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,475
Like TV or games.
There has to be something you enjoy.

191
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,977
Not really.

192
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,190
What were you doing before I came over?

193
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,859
- Thinking.
- About what?

194
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,652
Everything.

195
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,114
Things I've been too busy to think about.

196
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,201
Things I didn't want to think about.

197
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,207
That won't do. Let's go.

198
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,215
Here it is.

199
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,342
- Hello.
- Welcome.

200
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,763
- Oh. How much is this?
- Gosh, you picked a fancy yarn.

201
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,307
It's 30,000 won. What are you making?

202
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,310
- Wrap it once, then pull through.
- Okay.

203
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,187
- Through here?
- Yes.

204
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,689
- Let me.
- Wait. Didn't I hook one?

205
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,567
I told you to hook two.

206
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,945
Wrap it once.
Then pull it through.

207
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,154
Ta-da!

208
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,656
- I see.
- Now it's a circle.

209
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,867
If you keep doing this,
you'll end up with a scrubber.

210
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,662
So, what's on your mind right now?

211
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,872
Nothing, really.

212
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,584
That's the power of crochet.

213
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,670
It gives your mind a break.

214
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:44,180
They say your brain waves while crocheting
are similar to those when you meditate.

215
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:48,309
It's basically meditation with your hands.

216
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,770
There. Go on.

217
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,860
Being unemployed is a fight
against your own mind and the clock.

218
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,488
When everyone else is working
and you're home alone,

219
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,739
you think too much.

220
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,659
And the more you think,
the more you lose track of time.

221
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,912
You wonder if the clock's broken,

222
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,748
but before you know it,
the whole day's gone.

223
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,749
That's true.

224
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,629
And 99% of those thoughts are useless.

225
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,675
Thinking about the past
only brings regret,

226
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,886
and thinking about the future
only brings anxiety.

227
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,223
So whenever you start overthinking,

228
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,933
just crochet.

229
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,603
Just get through the day,
one stitch at a time.

230
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,065
If you just hang in there,
something new will come along.

231
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,525
And even if it doesn't,

232
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,986
at least you'll have yourself a scrubber.

233
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,988
How would you know?

234
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,157
You've never been unemployed.

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,161
Hey!

236
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,080
I spent years on the civil service exam.

237
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,499
And you can't call yourself…

238
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,585
unemployed.

239
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,046
You're just a lawyer who's between jobs.

240
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,008
If you find a firm, that's great.
If not, just open an office.

241
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,593
There's no need to be down.

242
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,097
What if I end up being useless?

243
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,895
I wanted to join a better firm

244
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,440
and prove that I made the right choice.

245
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,860
But now that I'm out,

246
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,572
I think the firm I quit

247
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,367
was the best I could ever achieve.

248
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,621
It feels like
there's nowhere to go but down.

249
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,332
So I'm scared to take the next step.

250
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,465
Ho-su.

251
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,761
You're still you.

252
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,014
You're not any worse,

253
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,101
you haven't disappeared,

254
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,811
and you haven't gone downhill.

255
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,897
You just quit a job.

256
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,400
You're okay.

257
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,866
Why…

258
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,577
are you being so nice to me?

259
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,703
What?

260
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,334
Mi-rae, you're the last person
to try and comfort others.

261
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,924
So what? You don't like it?

262
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,843
No, it's just…

263
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,348
- You seem different from usual.
- There you go again.

264
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,143
You think you know me so well?

265
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,145
What have you thought of me all this time?

266
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,646
Gosh.

267
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,942
Oh.

268
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,111
- You dropped a stitch.
- What do I do?

269
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,281
- Undo the whole thing?
- No, there's no need.

270
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,741
Just go back to where you got lost.

271
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,035
Give it to me.

272
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>I let my guard down.</i>

273
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,915
<i>Why do I end up being myself around him?</i>

274
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,960
Pay attention.

275
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,257
Hook it in.

276
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,482
- Not bad.
- Are you buying that?

277
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,068
You startled me.

278
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,448
Didn't you say you'd rather
throw out your back than look silly?

279
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,283
It's for my partner, not for me.

280
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,784
Buy two.

281
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,038
They seem better than farming seat pads.

282
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,128
Se-jin, are you getting those?

283
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,424
Didn't you say you'd rather
throw out your back than look silly?

284
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,719
Cut it out. Don't tease him.

285
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,096
It's not for him. It's for Yu Candy.

286
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,852
I see. Still, I'd never heard
that Mi-ji had two butts until today.

287
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,271
People have two butt cheeks,
with one on each…

288
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,606
Forget it.

289
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,526
Come on. Just get them.

290
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,195
You've got the money.
Buy three or four for her.

291
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,822
And you know what?

292
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,785
Since working with you, Mi-ji's been
closed off and looking down again.

293
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,704
I hope she doesn't disappear
like she did before.

294
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,706
Gosh. Take that back, now!

295
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,750
I take that back.

296
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,336
Why do you keep saying
she'll disappear or run away?

297
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,046
What did I do to her?

298
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,217
Il-lam isn't saying
that you did something.

299
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,846
He's just concerned
since Mi-ji has disappeared before.

300
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,225
What do you mean, disappeared?
Did she go missing?

301
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,311
Who knows whether she was missing
or if she ran away.

302
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,856
She was gone for two or three years
and then came back.

303
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,527
And her whole family clammed up

304
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,280
and never explained what happened.

305
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,617
They say she was in Seoul.

306
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,329
But it was her twin who went to Seoul.

307
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
She has a twin?

308
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,794
I guess she just keeps quiet
and picks strawberries all day.

309
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,714
Hurry up and check out.

310
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,427
Never.

311
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,636
What?

312
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,638
- Jeez.
- Come on.

313
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,939
Well, it's comfortable.

314
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,149
Right?

315
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,320
I could tell just by looking at it.

316
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,904
Why did you just get one for me?

317
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,075
I just prefer picking the classic way.

318
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,036
I'm a bit old-school, you know.

319
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,087
- Seoul?
- Yes.

320
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,673
They say you have a twin in Seoul.

321
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,218
Are you identical or fraternal?

322
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,929
Identical.

323
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,266
So you look exactly the same? That's wild.

324
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,685
What does your twin do?

325
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,521
Do you have any siblings?

326
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,689
Me?

327
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,067
No, I'm an only child.

328
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,027
Where in Seoul is your twin--

329
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,196
Have you ever lived in Seoul?

330
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,781
Me?

331
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,743
I moved to Seoul after college.

332
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,830
Well, technically I didn't graduate
because I started working.

333
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,250
I used work as an excuse
because I didn't want to write my thesis…

334
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,795
Wait, what? I got sidetracked.

335
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,506
Min-hee, you lived
in Seoul for a bit, right?

336
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,300
- Me?
- Yes. Didn't you?

337
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,554
Some say you were in Seoul,
and others say you were hospitalized.

338
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,057
They said you were gone
for two or three years.

339
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,851
Military service
isn't even that long these days.

340
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,104
- What were you doing in Seoul--
- By the way,

341
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,439
how far are you picking today?

342
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,441
- Me?
- Yes.

343
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,655
I don't want to overdo it,
so up to this row.

344
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,366
Okay. I'll do that side, then.

345
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,084
Where have you been interviewing?

346
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,213
Never mind.
You probably got rejected everywhere.

347
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,841
Why did you quit so suddenly?

348
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,593
You could've just transferred
to another team.

349
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,095
Is it true?

350
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,099
The rumor about your fistfight
with Attorney Lee Chung-gu?

351
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,186
Is that why you wanted to meet me,
to ask if we really had a fistfight?

352
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,147
That's part of it, I guess.

353
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,858
Anyway, listen.

354
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,027
You're not failing these interviews
because of your abilities,

355
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,779
so don't rush things.

356
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,532
Just wait until things blow over.

357
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,913
By the way, what are you doing?

358
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,752
I crochet whenever I have
a lot on my mind.

359
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,795
Do you want a scrubber?

360
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,715
Oh my.

361
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,134
You must have had a lot on your mind.

362
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,097
Who taught you how to crochet?

363
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,098
Just a friend.

364
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,272
Why are you making that face again?

365
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,523
Is the friend a girl?

366
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,900
Or a guy?

367
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,403
Or a girl who's basically a guy?

368
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,197
She's an old classmate.

369
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,866
- Nothing's going on between us.
- Okay.

370
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,826
There's nothing between you two,

371
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,703
but you keep thinking about her
before bed.

372
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,790
When you see her,
your feelings are all over the place,

373
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,292
and you end up doing whatever she wants.

374
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,837
Maybe she's changed,
or something's off with you.

375
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,173
Do you know what you call

376
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,884
this neuropsychiatric symptom?

377
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,344
What is it?

378
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,387
Having a thing.

379
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,766
You should go now.

380
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,643
I'm glad to see you doing well.

381
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,395
I'll head off with some scrubbers.

382
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,647
One's for me.

383
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,775
This one's cute.

384
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,986
And one is for Ms. Min Ye-rin,
since her crush sailed away.

385
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,238
Take care.

386
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,906
I'm off.

387
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,919
<i>You said you were up for anything, right?</i>

388
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,213
<i>Come to Sindang Station, Exit 1,</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

389
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:23,425
KITCHEN FURNITURE STREET

390
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,156
Ho-su?

391
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,534
Ms. Ro-sa.

392
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,911
What brings you here at this time of day?

393
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,416
<i>The person</i>
<i>you are trying to reach is not available.</i>

394
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,501
She's not answering.

395
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,130
She's unbelievable.

396
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,841
Making a busy guy
come all the way out here…

397
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,470
If you're talking about me, I'm not busy.

398
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,057
- I'm unemployed now.
- Still.

399
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,019
A lawyer shouldn't be dragged
into petty errands like this.

400
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,478
It's fine, really.

401
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,732
- I don't have much to do anyway.
- Just go home.

402
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,567
You're just wasting time by coming here.

403
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,903
- Go on, now.
- The thing is…

404
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,280
I have too much time these days.

405
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,658
As much as I enjoy crocheting at home,

406
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,994
helping you is so much better.

407
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,167
- It's been forever.
- Look at you all dolled up!

408
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,002
The Sinsong Girls' High Queen
hasn't changed.

409
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,670
18TH GRADUATING CLASS REUNION

410
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,589
What do you mean, "dolled up"?

411
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,633
I just threw on whatever I could grab.

412
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,427
Gosh, you're still the queen of Sinsong.

413
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,762
Queen Ok-hui, okay?

414
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,555
Stop it.

415
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,974
How'd you manage to come on a weekday?

416
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,602
Did the vice principal
give you permission?

417
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,148
What permission?

418
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,025
There's no school. It's Foundation Day.

419
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,944
- Okay.
- I see.

420
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,989
Bun-hong hasn't changed a bit.

421
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,075
People would think
that you're the vice principal

422
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,369
and she's the lunch lady.

423
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,706
What's a lunch lady supposed to look like?

424
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,668
- Oh…
- Come on.

425
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,380
Then I'll ask Ho-su to look into that too.

426
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,343
There must be a lawyer
specializing in insurance at the firm.

427
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,846
So did Bun-hong come here for the reunion
or to give legal advice?

428
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,517
She finds all sorts of ways
to brag about her kid.

429
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,312
Ok-hui!

430
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,107
Did you come because it's Foundation Day?

431
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,652
Yes, I'm here, ma'am.

432
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,072
What are you doing?

433
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,491
The vice principal wants you
to assist her.

434
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,076
- Hurry up.
- Go away.

435
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,412
- What is it? Why?
- Just go.

436
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,997
What's with her today?

437
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,584
- Move. I'm going to the restroom.
- Don't push me.

438
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,754
Let's have fun today.

439
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,215
I'm counting on you.

440
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,426
You two sat together? What about me?

441
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,095
- How have you been?
- Mi-kyung!

442
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,305
- So nice to see you.
- My goodness.

443
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,558
- You've been well, right?
- Of course.

444
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,730
<i>Jjan, jjan, I won't cry anymore</i>

445
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,274
<i>Goodbye, farewell, my love</i>

446
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,608
<i>Jjan, jjan!</i>

447
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,904
Now, next up…

448
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,284
Let's find out just how loved
the Sinsong ladies really are.

449
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:42,332
The first person to hear "I love you"
over the phone wins!

450
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,377
Excuse me. Attention please.

451
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,922
Isn't this kind of unfair
for widows like us?

452
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,258
- Not at all.
- Come on!

453
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,302
It's totally unfair.

454
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,638
What do you mean? I am a beloved woman.

455
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,975
It doesn't have to be your husband.

456
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,602
That's right. Anyone's fine.

457
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,438
It could be your kids
or the guy next door. Whoever!

458
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,689
All right.

459
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,234
As long as you hear "I love you,"
you're good.

460
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,236
If you hear "I love you," you win.

461
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,490
I'll take ten seconds off
for the first challenger.

462
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,076
- Who wants to go?
- Here, here!

463
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,704
Let's hear Bun-hong
call her famous lawyer son!

464
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,416
No, what's with you?

465
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,795
Come on. Didn't you say
you're a beloved woman?

466
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,798
Or were you thinking
of someone other than your son?

467
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,426
Whoever it is,

468
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,179
let's have Vice Principal Yeom Bun-hong
give it a try!

469
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,892
Beloved Yeom Bun-hong!

470
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,519
Yeom Bun-hong!

471
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,605
Beloved Yeom Bun-hong!

472
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,983
Ma'am, this one's the best.

473
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:54,238
Strong compressor,
9-watt fan motor, indirect cooling,

474
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,448
and all stainless steel.

475
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,867
Don't you have direct cooling models?

476
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,328
These days, everyone uses fridges
with indirect cooling.

477
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,038
They're frost-free, so it's convenient.

478
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,581
But I heard at another store

479
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,792
that for places that use up
ingredients daily,

480
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,377
direct cooling is better.

481
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,504
Price aside,

482
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,799
don't frost-free refrigerators
use more electricity too?

483
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,594
Ma'am, your son is very thorough.

484
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:21,473
You must feel reassured
to have a son like him.

485
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,269
I'll show you the direct cooling ones.
Right this way, ma'am.

486
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,563
Oh my.

487
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,940
This way, ma'am.

488
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,402
MOM

489
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,659
<i>Hello?</i>

490
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,995
Ho-su, where are you?

491
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,290
I hope I didn't call
while you were working.

492
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh…

493
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,711
I'm actually with a client right now. Why?

494
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,923
Oh…

495
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:59,887
Ho-su, you know you're the only person
I love in this world, right?

496
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,225
- What?
<i>- I just feel like I never say it enough.</i>

497
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,937
Is there anything
you've wanted to say to me

498
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,231
but haven't been able to?

499
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,567
MY SON

500
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,069
<i>What do you mean?</i>

501
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,364
Hey.

502
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,657
This could take a while.

503
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,535
You know, things you've kept to yourself.

504
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,663
<i>Things you thought about saying</i>
<i>but couldn't.</i>

505
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:30,000
Something you've buried deep
in your heart.

506
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,253
You know, like "I…"

507
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,005
<i>"I…"</i>

508
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,515
I quit my job.

509
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,643
What?

510
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,479
<i>I left the law firm.</i>

511
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,605
When?

512
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,484
Why didn't you tell me?

513
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,361
Excuse me, sir!

514
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,740
I can take care of my own issues,
so please don't worry.

515
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,325
This one is good.

516
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,331
- It's been over a minute.
- Okay, Ho-su.

517
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,917
I'll call you again later.

518
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,254
How long was that? How many seconds?

519
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,757
Two minutes and 32 seconds.
Sorry, you failed!

520
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,801
That's too bad.

521
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,970
Who's next?

522
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,287
Did you wipe with your hands or something?
Your skin's going to peel.

523
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,871
Oh my.

524
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,624
I know. I wasted too much water.

525
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,176
Sometimes it feels like
they're someone else's kid.

526
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,888
They act like they raised themselves.

527
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,725
They don't even remember
who changed their dirty diapers

528
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,311
and who'd tell them,
"Don't worry. I'll take care of it"

529
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:16,523
Hey, just take it as the price
of raising a brilliant kid.

530
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,151
Better than having one
who can't take care of herself.

531
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,414
We're leaving in five minutes.

532
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,089
The child you gave birth to
doesn't feel like yours?

533
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,425
I don't think I can relate.

534
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,017
It's funny how you act so cold
to your real one.

535
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,729
- Pardon?
- To your real mom, I mean.

536
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,941
I overheard, and it sounded like
you just told her that you'd quit.

537
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,444
She…

538
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,405
worries about me a lot.

539
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,662
Letting your parents worry a little
is part of being a good son.

540
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,956
To me,

541
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,795
being a good son means
moving on and letting her have her life.

542
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,089
Who am I to judge

543
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,842
a parent-child relationship
based on something I just overheard?

544
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,470
Sorry about earlier.

545
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,224
For lying and saying you were my client
when you were right there with me.

546
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,644
Instead of lying,
why don't we make it a reality?

547
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,188
What do you mean?

548
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,569
Pardon?

549
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,490
So you're saying that
starting now, he's officially your…

550
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,158
Legal representative.

551
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,415
I'll go to the meeting
since I already promised I would.

552
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,793
But from now on, handle all those
annoying issues through your friend.

553
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,004
- Ms. Ro-sa.
- Oh, and here.

554
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,175
- What's all this?
- The documents I need before the meeting.

555
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,718
What?

556
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,180
We should at least know
the company's terms for negotiations.

557
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,308
Send me the purchase proposal
and the business plan first,

558
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,102
- and if possible…
- Hey.

559
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,982
Why are you making this a big deal?
We're friends.

560
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,609
Work is work, and friends are friends.

561
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,528
Send them by Monday.

562
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,327
- I'll head out first.
- I'll finish up and head home too.

563
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,954
- Good work today.
- Thanks.

564
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,880
WONGEUN LAW FIRM

565
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,634
Hey!

566
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,971
I gave you work because I felt bad.
How could you give me more work?

567
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,639
It's not me.

568
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,602
Your company did
an unacceptably sloppy job.

569
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,895
Jeez.

570
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,063
Let me take this call.

571
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,066
Hey, Ji-yun.

572
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,485
<i>Hi, Ho-su.</i>

573
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,779
Thanks to you, the interview went well.

574
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,284
It's all because of you.
You even made the reservation for me.

575
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,662
Are you at the office?

576
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,500
<i>If you are, I thought I'd stop by</i>
<i>for a quick chat.</i>

577
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,002
I quit the firm.

578
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,005
You quit?

579
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,967
- Just like that?
- Yes, it just happened.

580
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,262
This weekend?

581
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,224
Is the reunion you mentioned this weekend?

582
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:38,934
What reunion?

583
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,310
Okay.

584
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,105
Did you tell Mi-rae?

585
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,653
No, I didn't tell her on purpose.

586
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,322
What do you mean by "on purpose"?

587
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,158
<i>I guess you don't know,</i>

588
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:59,204
<i>but Mi-rae doesn't really socialize</i>
<i>since giving up on the civil service exam.</i>

589
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,122
Everyone knows how hard she worked.

590
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,792
It must be hard for her
to have people see how she is now.

591
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,377
What's wrong with how she is now?

592
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,837
I don't mean she's in a bad place.

593
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,633
From her perspective,
she probably feels like she settled.

594
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,135
<i>I think she feels awkward</i>
<i>about meeting everyone.</i>

595
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:19,099
Ji-yun, I appreciate the thought,
but I'll be there too.

596
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,141
What?

597
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,563
I'll bring Ho-su with me. See you there.

598
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,401
What was that? Are you going?

599
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,527
Of course I am.

600
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,822
They're painting me as a social recluse
who failed the civil service exam.

601
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,490
But you don't have to…

602
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,993
Why would you take me?

603
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,202
And you…

604
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,705
Come looking sharp.

605
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,332
Otherwise,
they'll gossip about you forever.

606
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,001
Get your hair done too.

607
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,088
What's with you?

608
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,550
Since when do you care about that stuff?
If you don't want to go, then don't.

609
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,343
Why give them the satisfaction?

610
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,721
If I don't go,
they'll say whatever they want.

611
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,723
"Mi-rae this" and "Mi-rae that."

612
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,559
I'm not letting that happen.
I'm going, no matter what.

613
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,272
What's up with her?

614
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,527
FALL RISK
BED REST ONLY

615
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,907
I wondered where that went.
Did you wash it?

616
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,451
Yes, I did.

617
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,536
Grandma kept looking for it.

618
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,747
It gets pretty chilly at night these days.

619
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,457
I see.

620
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,458
Mi-ji.

621
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,501
It's about time
you gave Grandma a haircut.

622
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,378
Okay… What?

623
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,672
Me?

624
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,924
You've always done it yourself.

625
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,552
Time to reopen "Mi-ji's salon,"
don't you think?

626
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,595
That's right.

627
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,681
At this pace, they'll turn
into gray-haired witches.

628
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:44,726
I'll see… what I can do.

629
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,020
How did Grandma's skills

630
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,564
skip her daughter
and land on her granddaughter?

631
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,774
That's amazing.

632
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:54,194
They say talent skips a generation.

633
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,197
Is your sister good with hair too?

634
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,158
No, she's not really good with her hands.

635
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,328
It's not about skill.
She just doesn't care.

636
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,247
There's always one in every family.

637
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,751
They think giving money is enough
and wash their hands of everything else.

638
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,629
She's probably just busy making money.

639
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,172
Kids like Mi-ji are rare.

640
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:18,301
Still, she hasn't shown her face once
since I've been here.

641
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,969
Grandma's going to forget her face.

642
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,930
How could she forget?

643
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,684
- She looks just like Mi-ji.
- Good point.

644
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,813
Here, have these while you work.

645
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,481
- Wow.
- They're still a bit tart.

646
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,525
But they'll wake you up!

647
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,444
- Thank you.
- Please, try some.

648
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,405
By the way, ma'am,

649
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,241
have you had a chance to check
this month's payment?

650
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,243
What about it?

651
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,537
Well…

652
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,290
Some things haven't been paid for yet.

653
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,168
The caregiver fee and the meals.

654
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,380
That can't be right.

655
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,883
Wasn't it transferred under "Yu Mi-rae"?

656
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,928
There's nothing on record
for this month yet.

657
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,263
Oh dear.

658
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,517
Maybe she forgot because she's so busy.

659
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,018
I'll look into it.

660
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,693
What the…

661
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,996
<i>So what happens to Mi-ji now?</i>

662
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,874
What do you mean? She's done for.
HNU is off the table for her.

663
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,876
Life really is unpredictable.

664
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,003
<i>- What's she going to do now?</i>
<i>- What else?</i>

665
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,504
<i>She should marry Gyeong-gu.</i>

666
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,006
<i>That's not so bad.</i>

667
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,758
<i>- Come on!</i>
<i>- It's possible.</i>

668
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,384
<i>Like in a romance comic!</i>

669
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,261
<i>It's not like one of them is settling.</i>

670
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,304
<i>That's harsh!</i>

671
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,347
<i>Elementary school sweethearts</i>
<i>getting married.</i>

672
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,058
<i>- This is pure romance.</i>
<i>- Seriously.</i>

673
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,856
Yesterday is over.

674
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,692
Tomorrow is yet to come. Today is.…

675
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,071
Mi-ji?

676
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,323
Or is it Mi-rae?

677
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,534
Mi-rae.

678
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,162
Long time no see, Mi-rae.

679
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,540
Choi Seung-hyeon! Choi Seung-hyeon!

680
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,210
Choi Seung-hyeon! Choi Seung-hyeon!

681
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,007
Does he ever pass the ball?

682
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,926
That's insane. He's on fire!

683
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,012
- Seriously, what's the secret?
- Hey there!

684
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,680
He looks amazing.

685
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,353
Take a guess.
Is she Mi-ji or Mi-rae?

686
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,857
Mi-rae's here.

687
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,276
Come on, Ji-yun. What a buzzkill.

688
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,486
It's Mi-rae.

689
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,447
It's been ages. We never get to see you.

690
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,201
It's been crazy at the office.

691
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,453
Right, you work at the KFMC.

692
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,913
No wonder you're so busy.

693
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,290
Still, you should've shown up
for weddings and stuff.

694
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,042
You missed
our wedding invitation gathering.

695
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,210
Are you two getting married?

696
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,879
Come on, we've got a two-year-old.

697
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,090
Ji-yun, you didn't tell Mi-rae about us?

698
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,925
I <i>did </i>tell her.

699
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,718
I told you. You probably forgot.

700
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:10,181
If you ask me, Mi-rae's the only one
who traveled through time.

701
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,101
Let's sit. Have we ordered yet?

702
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,394
Yes, all done.

703
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,188
What's the best thing on the menu?

704
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,731
It really has been a while.

705
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,067
HOW TO CUT GRANDMA'S HAIR

706
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:30,076
Oh my. This is driving me crazy.

707
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,665
Seriously, what do I do?

708
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,293
I feel so hopeless.

709
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,172
What is it? What's wrong?

710
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,971
Is something going on with Mi-rae?

711
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,682
What do you mean?

712
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,562
I mean, even if she never calls,

713
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,608
she always pays
the hospital bills right on time.

714
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,861
Do you think she's having money problems?

715
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,364
I'll cover it this time.

716
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,953
Goodness, with what money?

717
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,623
I've been working on the farm.
I'll pay you in cash.

718
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,292
Don't waste your money.

719
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,752
Just save it.

720
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,047
I make more per hour than Mi-rae.

721
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,673
I'll save what's left--

722
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,091
Jeez!

723
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,968
Just save it.

724
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,310
Is it okay to use Mi-rae's money, then?

725
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,104
You think you and Mi-rae are the same?

726
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,482
What's so different?

727
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,525
What do you think? I mean…

728
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,125
Cheers!

729
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,003
Remember when Seung-hyeon
did the speech at graduation?

730
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,465
Girls from other schools and lower grades
were bawling their eyes out.

731
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,759
Stop. That's ancient history.

732
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,386
Seriously.

733
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,930
Ho-su, you made it.

734
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,056
Hey, Ho-su!

735
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,432
Long time no see.

736
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,060
- You're looking good.
- So handsome.

737
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,603
He is.

738
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,066
You're late.

739
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,319
I heard you're a lawyer now.

740
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,738
He's the only lawyer
from our class, right?

741
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,450
That's wild.
I've never met a real lawyer before.

742
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,996
Where did you do your military service?

743
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,790
Do lawyers get assigned
to special roles like army doctors?

744
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,291
I'm not sure.

745
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,710
I was exempt.

746
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,838
Shoot. Sorry, I forgot.

747
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,257
Wow, you're blessed, man.

748
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,426
Ho-su, can I get your business card?

749
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,177
- Gosh.
- Okay.

750
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,263
I don't have…

751
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,140
- You know Wongeun Law Firm, right?
- Yes.

752
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,726
- Ho-su was there until recently.
- Wongeun?

753
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,894
Isn't that the top firm in Korea?

754
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,857
What's up with you two?
Since when have you two kept in touch?

755
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,900
Gosh!

756
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,362
Ho-su and Mi-rae…
I always knew you two would do well.

757
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,572
Come on.

758
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,533
They were the top two in the whole school.
We all knew it.

759
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,455
Turns out Duson High
has some pretty successful alumni.

760
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,957
A lawyer,
and a public corporation employee.

761
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,626
I honestly thought Seung-hyeon
would be the most successful.

762
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,253
Hey.

763
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,964
He's way too good-looking
to just be a store clerk.

764
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,341
I thought he'd be
a TV personality or something.

765
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,427
He's not just a clerk. He's a manager.

766
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,553
I know.

767
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,973
Sorry, she's drunk.

768
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,517
Cut her some slack.
She used to be your fan club president.

769
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,145
Thanks for seeing me in such a good light.

770
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,524
But Mi-ji was
the most likely to succeed, right?

771
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,194
- That's true.
- I know.

772
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,905
What's she doing these days
after quitting track and field?

773
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,116
I saw her in Duson-ri the other day.
She was moving some stuff at the mart.

774
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,243
- What?
- My mom said she's a janitor.

775
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,579
Wait, a janitor?

776
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,415
<i>What do you mean? She's done for.</i>
<i>HNU is off the table for her.</i>

777
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,667
<i>- She should marry Gyeong-gu.</i>
<i>- That's harsh!</i>

778
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,503
<i>Like in a romance comic!</i>

779
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,546
<i>It's not like one of them is settling.</i>

780
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,340
<i>Seriously.</i>

781
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,592
<i>Don't ask me.</i>
<i>Her twin is sitting next to you.</i>

782
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,760
<i>Fair point.</i>

783
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,762
<i>Mi-rae, how's Mi-ji doing?</i>

784
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,097
<i>Why would you ask that?</i>

785
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,265
<i>Mi-rae, you must have it so hard.</i>

786
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,975
Why are we talking…

787
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,813
…behind her back?

788
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:37,198
Ho-su still goes from zero
to a hundred in no time.

789
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,033
Just like the old days.

790
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,285
But he's right.

791
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,371
Mi-rae's right here too.

792
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,334
Is your wedding
really happening this time?

793
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,877
- Of course!
- Definitely.

794
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,713
You said that last time,
but it didn't happen.

795
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,049
- This time we have to do it.
- Really?

796
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,551
- You better come.
- I will.

797
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,099
Ho-su! You should come to the wedding too.

798
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,892
Okay. It's a bit late, but congrats.

799
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,269
Yes, congratulations.

800
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,354
- Bye.
- See you.

801
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,814
Ho-su, are you leaving?

802
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,482
- I'll join you then.
- Hey, traitor!

803
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,485
You got us all together.
You're staying till the end.

804
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,028
Bye. I'll call you.

805
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,780
Who's up for karaoke?

806
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:18,739
Mi-rae.

807
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,953
I just realized I don't have your number.

808
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,000
Okay.

809
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,130
- Here.
- Thank you.

810
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,300
I'll contact you before the wedding.

811
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,552
If you're going, then let's go together.

812
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,761
All right.

813
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,891
Would you like to come with us?

814
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,061
Do you want me to?

815
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:52,815
I'll get going.

816
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,026
- You two take care.
- Okay.

817
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,826
How are you getting home?

818
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,329
No idea.

819
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,499
Are you mad?

820
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,044
Why would I be?

821
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,046
How should I know?

822
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,301
You've barely said a word,
and you don't seem so happy.

823
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,595
What's there to be happy about?

824
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,805
It wasn't exactly a fun gathering.

825
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,557
Then why did you even come?

826
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,519
No, seriously.

827
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,273
You're not the type to show up
just because I asked you to.

828
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,944
Why did you come?

829
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,570
Me?

830
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,406
- I've already told you.
- Right.

831
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,992
You said you hate it
when people gossip about you.

832
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,037
Then why were you so quiet earlier?

833
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,038
What?

834
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,457
You can't stand people talking about you
behind your back,

835
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,253
but you're fine with them
talking about Mi-ji right in front of you?

836
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,425
I'll get going.

837
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,340
Hello.

838
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,759
Why weren't you answering your phone?

839
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,470
<i>Sorry, I was out, so I didn't notice.</i>

840
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,763
<i>What's up?</i>

841
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,141
You've been paid, right?

842
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,020
I forgot to mention the hospital bill.

843
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,439
I texted you my bank account info.

844
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,524
Transfer the money
and keep the rest for yourself.

845
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,194
No thanks. It's your paycheck.

846
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,071
<i>You're the one who went to work.</i>

847
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,949
Anyway, come down on Friday.

848
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,492
Grandma needs a haircut.

849
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,828
Oh…

850
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,955
Can't it be another day?

851
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,541
Mom's not coming home on Friday night.

852
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,710
You should come when she's not around.

853
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,503
Any other day works for me.

854
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,173
I have something on Friday.

855
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,841
Something? Like what?

856
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,426
Well…

857
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,637
There's this really important meeting
at work.

858
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,556
I have to be there.

859
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,099
<i>Just come down.</i>

860
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,684
They don't need me anyway.

861
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,479
<i>Still, I should do what the company asks…</i>

862
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,899
Do what? I told you to just sit tight.

863
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,277
Come on.
I can't just sit there and do nothing.

864
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,613
Gosh.

865
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,824
I'll make time and come later.

866
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,452
You're unbelievable.

867
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,496
So work comes before Grandma now?

868
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,665
- That's a stretch.
<i>- What is?</i>

869
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,834
It's what you always said to me.

870
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,669
<i>It's not the same for me.</i>

871
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,797
And I'm not doing this for myself.

872
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,091
- It's all for you--
<i>- What's so different?</i>

873
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,426
I wasn't doing it for myself either.

874
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,392
Anyway, I really can't make it on Friday.

875
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,893
What am I supposed to…

876
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,313
Should I tell Mom
to change her plans for you?

877
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,482
What's with the attitude?

878
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,525
<i>Forget it.</i>

879
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,443
I'll handle the haircut
and everything else.

880
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,736
Just send the money.

881
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,406
Is it that much of a burden
to take care of Grandma for me?

882
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,784
<i>If it is, then don't do it!</i>
<i>That's what you always told me.</i>

883
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,749
Is it as easy as you thought,
just sending money from Seoul?

884
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,043
- What?
<i>- Transfer the money now.</i>

885
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,586
<i>Hey.</i>

886
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,558
CALL ENDED

887
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,935
She's freaking mean.

888
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,754
NICE SEEING YOU
SEE YOU AT THE WEDDING!

889
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,599
Just sip at your own pace.

890
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,477
Thanks.

891
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,315
<i>Are you mad?</i>

892
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,942
What's there to be happy about?

893
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,736
It wasn't exactly a fun gathering.

894
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,280
Then why did you even come?

895
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,795
<i>When you see her,</i>
<i>your feelings are all over the place,</i>

896
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,507
<i>and you end up doing whatever she wants.</i>

897
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,928
<i>Do you know what you call this</i>
<i>neuropsychiatric symptom?</i>

898
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:27,483
I've finally cleared out
all of last year's produce!

899
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,776
What's all this?

900
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,613
Some boxes and shipping labels.

901
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,281
- For you to send out.
- Oh.

902
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,784
I don't have anyone to send them to.

903
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,202
You haven't sent any to Seoul yet.

904
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,704
Send some to your twin
to share with her friends.

905
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,000
She has no one
to share them with in Seoul.

906
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,627
That can't be right.

907
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:51,090
Strawberries aren't a big deal here,
but in Seoul, you have to pay for them.

908
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:55,094
Even if I send these, they'll just spoil.
There's no one to share them with.

909
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,805
How can there be no one?
Seoul is not a deserted island.

910
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,182
She only cares about herself.

911
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,853
Only her problems matter,
and only her struggles count.

912
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,313
That's why she has no one.

913
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,400
Still, she can have some strawberries.

914
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,195
Do whatever you want. They're yours.

915
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,415
PARCEL SHIPPING FORM

916
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,792
RECIPIENT ADDRESS

917
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,672
Mi-ji.

918
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,007
Hello.

919
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,592
Is your mom home?

920
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,846
She said she's staying over
at a friend's tonight.

921
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,934
I never seem to catch your mom
at the right time.

922
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,477
I wanted to talk to her.

923
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,896
What's with all these strawberries?

924
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,317
I got them from work. Would you like some?

925
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,779
They're organic, but they're a bit tart.

926
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,866
You're right.

927
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:04,705
The tart, ugly ones like these
are perfect for jam.

928
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,419
Mi-ji, do you want to make
strawberry jam with me?

929
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,254
Sorry?

930
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,220
For God's sake.

931
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,646
<i>The person</i>
<i>you are trying to reach is not available.</i>

932
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,981
<i>- Please try again later.</i>
- She's not answering.

933
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:20,239
Still setting up? Where is the landowner?

934
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,575
She should be on her way,
but I can't reach her.

935
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,745
You can't reach her?

936
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,290
Is she ghosting you or something?

937
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,001
I'll ask her representative
who was supposed to come.

938
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,966
- Hello.
- You're on your way, right?

939
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,759
And you're with Ms. Ro-sa?

940
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,471
No, we agreed to meet at your office.

941
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,973
What?

942
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,142
When was the last time
you spoke with her?

943
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,436
We spoke last night.

944
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,938
I haven't called her today.

945
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,900
Did she say anything unusual last night?

946
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,027
She just said, "See you at the meeting."

947
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,614
Why? Is she not answering?
Should I go to her place?

948
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,618
No, it's fine.
Just come to the office for now.

949
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,620
Once I finish setting up the meeting room…

950
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,038
Wait, never mind.

951
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,790
I'll just go there myself.

952
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:12,958
I'll do it.

953
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,752
Pardon?

954
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:18,088
I'll finish getting things ready here.
You go check on her.

955
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,923
- Oh…
<i>- What's going on?</i>

956
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,885
Oh… Nothing. I'll go.

957
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,303
Mi-rae.

958
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,476
Then I'll leave it to you. Thank you.

959
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,776
Ma'am!

960
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,695
Ma'am!

961
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,655
Are you home?

962
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,536
If she's not home,
where could she possibly be?

963
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,623
Ms. Ro-sa!

964
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,836
Ma'am?

965
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,923
Oh my goodness.

966
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,429
Oh gosh.

967
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,816
<i>Grandma!</i>

968
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,985
- Ms. Ro-sa!
- Gosh.

969
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,698
I thought I was going to
starve to death here all alone.

970
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,160
It's just a minor sprain in my back.

971
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:31,995
Call 911.

972
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,177
Hey. What's going on?

973
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,307
What's wrong?

974
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,601
Stay with me, okay?

975
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,478
Ma'am?

976
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,189
Ho-su? Here!

977
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,358
Over here!

978
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,861
- Go get a plastic bag!
- Ma'am!

979
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,779
- Put a bag over her mouth.
- Okay.

980
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,740
- All right.
- Go get a bag. Hurry!

981
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,951
Stay with me!

982
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,620
Mi-rae, here!

983
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,330
What's going on?

984
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,791
Calm down and breathe.

985
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,341
<i>Attention, patients</i>
<i>and guardians in the emergency room…</i>

986
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,896
Any word on the CT scan?

987
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,439
Is it her brain?

988
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,650
There's nothing serious on the scan.
Just a minor back injury.

989
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,863
They'll keep an eye on her
until tomorrow, just to be safe.

990
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,242
Are you okay?

991
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,244
Still not feeling well?

992
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,705
It almost happened again.

993
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,666
If it weren't for you, Ho-su…

994
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,507
Mi-ji, open the door.

995
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,468
Open up.

996
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,719
Yu Mi-ji!

997
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,348
Yu Mi-ji!

998
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,854
I can't take this anymore.

999
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,067
Let's settle this
once and for all today.

1000
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,833
Get up.

1001
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,544
I said, "Get up."

1002
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,505
Why did you cut the phone line?

1003
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,508
Get up.

1004
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,012
You're not even going to
show your face anymore?

1005
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,514
Get up!

1006
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,766
Do you want to see me go crazy?

1007
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,351
Get up!

1008
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,104
Come on, I said get up!

1009
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,399
You…

1010
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,027
How long are you going to keep this up?

1011
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,530
You won't go outside,
you don't see anyone,

1012
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,782
and now you've cut the phone line too?

1013
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,702
You call this a home? It's a prison cell.

1014
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,287
Get up. Come on.

1015
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,207
Let's go out.

1016
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,628
It's been three years!

1017
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,923
You've done enough, and I've had enough!

1018
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,885
Just because you can't run anymore,
your life is over?

1019
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:38,432
How long are you going to waste your life
stuck in the past?

1020
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,226
Are you going to hide forever?

1021
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,645
What are you going to do with yourself?

1022
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,939
Since when do you care?

1023
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,027
What?

1024
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,196
Since when do you ever care about me?

1025
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,365
You don't give a damn what happens to me.

1026
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,951
Mi-ji.

1027
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,411
It's true, isn't it?

1028
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:03,123
You never paid any attention to me
before I started running.

1029
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,958
I can't run anymore.

1030
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,503
So just go back to worrying about Mi-rae,
like you always have.

1031
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,714
Do you hear yourself right now?

1032
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,133
To you, I've always been Mi-rae's add-on.

1033
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,178
So keep ignoring me like you always have.

1034
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,096
I'm just sitting here, dead quiet.

1035
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,390
So please leave me alone!

1036
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,351
So you're saying
all of this is my fault now?

1037
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,730
How far back are you going to trace this?

1038
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,357
What's next?
Will you blame me for giving birth to you?

1039
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,526
Yes, why did you even have me?

1040
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,528
You could've just had Mi-rae.

1041
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,238
You think so too, don't you?

1042
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,990
You brat!

1043
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,117
Did you really just say that?

1044
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,411
I can't believe you.

1045
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:45,624
How could you break
your mother's heart like that?

1046
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,542
- What are you doing?
- How could you do this?

1047
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,420
- You can't… Get up and come out.
- Calm down.

1048
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,757
- Come out!
- Stop! Come out!

1049
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,220
- Let go.
- Stay out of here.

1050
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,309
Are you insane?

1051
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,394
Why are you going after her like that?

1052
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:09,689
If she won't come out,
maybe I have to make her!

1053
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,733
Give it time.

1054
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,277
You think this is something you can force?

1055
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,362
Jeez.

1056
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,406
This is all your fault!

1057
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,701
You coddled her too much
and turned her into a recluse.

1058
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,121
You were never like this with me as a kid,

1059
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:27,582
so why do you baby my kid and spoil her?

1060
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,209
Gosh.

1061
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,181
Mi-ji.

1062
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,643
Grandma's coming in.

1063
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,790
Why are you sitting like that?
It must be suffocating.

1064
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:11,960
Look at me.

1065
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,045
Come on.

1066
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,590
No.

1067
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,757
No?

1068
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,926
Then don't.

1069
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,890
Oh, my little cocoon.

1070
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:28,268
How big of a butterfly
are you trying to become?

1071
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,395
No.

1072
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,857
I'm not going to become anything.

1073
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,942
That's fine too.

1074
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:40,488
As long as you stay healthy, eat well,

1075
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:44,409
and keep Grandma company, that's enough.

1076
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:50,123
I have enough money to take care of you.

1077
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,042
I mean it.

1078
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,137
Grandma.

1079
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,600
There might be something wrong with me.

1080
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,605
I regret everything and worry so much…

1081
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,441
that I can't do anything.

1082
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,903
What's there to regret and worry about?

1083
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,573
Yesterday is over.

1084
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,951
Tomorrow is yet to come.

1085
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:28,870
I don't know.

1086
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,333
I know I should get out of here…

1087
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:40,048
but I don't want to go back
to being nothing again.

1088
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,718
I know that's the only place
I can go back to…

1089
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,847
but it feels so pathetic,

1090
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,767
and I'm sick of it.

1091
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,022
I have all this life ahead of me,

1092
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,694
and I feel completely lost.

1093
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,114
Grandma.

1094
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,826
I feel like trash.

1095
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:15,208
If a deer runs away from a lion,

1096
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,752
does that make it trash?

1097
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:23,216
If a hermit crab hides
in fear of being eaten,

1098
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:24,968
is it a coward?

1099
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,637
They're all just trying to survive.

1100
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,433
You're hiding to survive too.

1101
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,521
No matter how pathetic or messy it looks,

1102
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:41,067
anything you do to survive is brave.

1103
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,031
Grandma.

1104
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,875
It's okay, my dear.

1105
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,169
Let's brush it off and get back up.

1106
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,340
Grandma.

1107
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:19,981
Grandma.

1108
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,702
Grandma?

1109
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,254
Grandma.

1110
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,300
Grandma?

1111
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,556
Why aren't you answering me?

1112
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,308
Grand…

1113
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,192
Grandma!

1114
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,653
Grandma!

1115
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,905
Grandma, are you okay?

1116
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,116
Please wake up! Grandma!

1117
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,243
Where's the phone?

1118
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,078
The phone.

1119
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,631
Oh no, Grandma!

1120
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,602
Hang in there, Grandma. Please, please…

1121
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,111
Grandma…

1122
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,613
Come on!

1123
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,838
Someone, please help.

1124
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,757
Please help!

1125
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,553
Help me.

1126
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,722
Save my grandma!

1127
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,099
Please save my grandma.

1128
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,979
Hello?

1129
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,522
Anyone home?

1130
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,818
<i>Anyone?</i>

1131
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,571
<i>Please, save her!</i>

1132
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,422
I talked to your team leader.

1133
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,509
We'll reschedule
after Ms. Ro-sa is discharged.

1134
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,851
What was that earlier?

1135
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,354
You were having trouble breathing.

1136
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,105
Is that your heart again? Or…

1137
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,357
Thank you.

1138
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,610
For what?

1139
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,572
For everything.

1140
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,658
The meeting, and Ms. Ro-sa.

1141
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,994
If it weren't for you,
everything would've gone wrong.

1142
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:22,372
I only went because you told me about her.

1143
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,712
Don't worry too much about Ms. Ro-sa.

1144
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,881
The doctor said we made it just in time.

1145
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,716
We got here before it was too late.

1146
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,598
Would it have been
the same for my grandma?

1147
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,562
The day she collapsed…

1148
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:48,064
If someone other than Mi-ji
had been with her,

1149
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,568
would things have turned out better?

1150
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,612
I think so.

1151
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,699
Even the hospital said so.

1152
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,701
That we should've gotten there sooner.

1153
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,412
If it hadn't been for Mi-ji,

1154
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,748
Grandma might not be bedridden
like she is now.

1155
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,502
How is that…

1156
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,546
Mi-ji's fault?

1157
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,256
Then whose fault is it?

1158
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,633
She's always like that.

1159
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:19,262
It's not enough that she's miserable.
She drags everyone else down with her.

1160
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,722
Mi-rae.

1161
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,390
You know what I hate the most?

1162
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,934
That she keeps on living like that.

1163
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,478
While Grandma's lying there
because of her,

1164
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:31,399
she still laughs, eats, and goes out
like she didn't do anything.

1165
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,632
Then I guess
my dad died because of me.

1166
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:58,301
What?

1167
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,765
The day he died…

1168
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,685
I insisted we go out.

1169
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,814
I didn't want to go on any other day,

1170
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,484
and I didn't want to go with Mom.

1171
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,571
I wanted it to be just us two.

1172
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,574
I got my way in the end.

1173
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,495
And the car ended up totaled.

1174
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,039
A drunk driver crashed into us.

1175
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:38,174
Dad died, and I survived.

1176
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:44,097
If I hadn't insisted that day,
he might still be alive.

1177
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,306
That's…

1178
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,686
That's not your fault.
It's the drunk driver's fault.

1179
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,271
Then why would you
say stuff like that about Mi-ji?

1180
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,526
You tell me it's not my fault,

1181
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,236
yet you're so harsh with her.

1182
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,075
Just like no one was to blame
for what happened today,

1183
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,704
what happened to your grandma
isn't on Mi-ji either.

1184
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:12,709
- I guess.
- You guess? It's the truth.

1185
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,545
How is any of that Mi-ji's fault?

1186
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,049
Okay, I get it--

1187
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,592
No. Be clear about it.

1188
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,847
It wasn't Mi-ji's fault.

1189
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,463
You know, jam tastes best
when the strawberries are a bit tart.

1190
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,299
If they're too sweet, they're not as good.

1191
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,554
You've been working hard
on the farm, right?

1192
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,890
I wouldn't say hard…

1193
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,183
I see.

1194
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:16,355
Things don't always feel right
in the beginning.

1195
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,442
If you start with something super sweet

1196
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,737
and try something sweet and tangy,
all you can taste is the tang.

1197
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,990
But life's funny, you know?

1198
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,159
Just like strawberries.

1199
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:33,414
Even if it feels too sour right now,
the tart ones make the best jam.

1200
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,669
Did you get it?

1201
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:41,088
I'm using strawberries
as a metaphor for life.

1202
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,008
Yes.

1203
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,510
Oh, you did?

1204
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,179
Can you stir this for a bit?

1205
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,736
You're looking at that photo again?

1206
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,821
Sorry?

1207
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,409
Be honest. This is Mi-rae, right?

1208
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:12,870
No, it's not.

1209
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,455
Come on.

1210
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:17,792
Even I can recognize Mi-rae at that age.

1211
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,253
She always had that look.

1212
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,089
What look?

1213
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,132
Like she was holding it all in.

1214
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,926
Trying to hide her soft side.

1215
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:33,224
She may look sullen on the outside,

1216
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,143
but kids as thoughtful
and kind as her are rare.

1217
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,897
She's not that kind.

1218
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:41,148
What do you mean?

1219
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,860
Of course she is.

1220
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:48,072
She was nice enough to cut her hair short
just so her sister could graduate.

1221
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,491
Mi-ji, don't be like that.

1222
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,160
No one cares more about family
than Mi-rae.

1223
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,707
<i>For so long,</i>

1224
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:01,919
<i>I was harder on myself than anyone else,</i>
<i>just for being me.</i>

1225
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:07,800
<i>Even deer and hermit crabs</i>
<i>do everything they can to survive.</i>

1226
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,011
<i>So why do humans…</i>

RECIPIENT: YU MI-RAE

1229
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:17,643
<i>Why do I end up attacking myself</i>

1230
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,521
<i>in the moments</i>
<i>I most need to protect myself?</i>

1231
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,332
<i>It wasn't until I lived as someone else</i>

1232
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,960
<i>that I realized my worst enemy was myself.</i>

1233
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,175
<i>Now I know, but so what?</i>
<i>What difference does it make?</i>

1234
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:56,140
Why are you defending Mi-ji?

1235
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,142
You're not even that close.

1236
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,063
Because I like her.

1237
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:07,902
What?

1238
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,031
You already know.

1239
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,700
Mi-ji is my first love.

1240
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,628
<i>Knowing doesn't mean</i>

1241
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,922
<i>I can change anything.</i>

1242
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,783
YU MI-JI

1243
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,952
<i>Is this team in charge</i>
<i>of the new HQ project?</i>

1244
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,996
Ms. Yu, prepare the project report
by next week.

1245
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,914
- What?
<i>- If you can't, then say so.</i>

1246
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,542
<i>- The penalty will be all yours too.</i>
- Can you help me?

1247
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,420
- Did you receive this?
<i>- Mi-ji, that's not fair.</i>

1248
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,171
<i>I hear you're dating the farm owner.</i>

1249
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,090
<i>Is that just a false rumor?</i>

1250
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,341
<i>Does my response even matter?</i>

1251
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:13,592
Hey, Ho-su!

1252
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,761
Let's keep this strictly professional.

1253
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,972
I'm Ms. Kim Ro-sa's
legal representative, Lee Ho-su.

1254
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,474
<i>Are you going</i>
<i>to keep treating me like this?</i>

1255
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,351
Why are you curious about that?

1256
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,280
