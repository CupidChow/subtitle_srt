1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm starting over, we're learning to walk again

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,380
Your hair is long?

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,320
It's not a short one?

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,880
It's a long one, isn't it?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,380
It's a future?

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,780
It's definitely a future

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,280
No, it's not

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,660
It's just that I told my daughter next door

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,600
Then you didn't tell me about it

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:23,820
Not at all

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,300
I don't know if it's a future or a future

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,940
The reason I asked you to help me in the morning was because of your hair

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,240
It's okay

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,480
It's a double-eyelid, but it could be confusing

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,820
This time, you're doing well

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,920
Who is it?

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,060
There are questions about the same existence

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:57,180
Zoe, wife, a housekeeper and housekeeper

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,040
I think it might be difficult to get it right, but it's difficult without a hint

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,060
I'll be back.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,060
I'll be back.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,060
I'll be back.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,060
I'll be back.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Don't be late.

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,060
What?

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,060
Hey, you didn't make a car.

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,060
I got a car.

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,060
I cut it.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,060
You're kidding me? I made a car.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,060
Uh?

31
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,060
By the way, what's with this manual?

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,060
You should have at least found out when you were sleeping.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,060
It's transparent, but there are a few pages of data.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,060
I don't have to find out anything before I go down?

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,060
No, I already know how I live.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,060
But I don't care who I meet.

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,060
I told you to go to the car.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Let's go to the car oven right away.

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,060
Please hurry up.

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
It's our birthday.

42
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
It's a warning when it comes to the stars.

43
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,060
It's just a matter of time.

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,060
Are you sure it's okay?

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,060
What's wrong with you? You're trying to be okay.

46
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,060
Keep your promise.

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,060
Don't let me go and just sit down.

48
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,060
If you're dizzy after solving my problem, I won't be quiet.

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,060
It's a little more meaningful to see you talk cheaply.

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
Why aren't you answering?

51
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
Promise.

52
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,060
I won't let you go and stay still.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,060
Did you?

54
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I got it.

55
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Don't do anything.

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Ah...

58
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:21,060
It's over yesterday and my name is far away.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:31,060
Today, I don't know yet.

60
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:39,060
Let's go.

61
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:49,060
Daebing?

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,100
You need sponsors to buy this?

63
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I'll go buy it?

64
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I love pastsual videos.

65
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:08,820
You know what?

66
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,900
Bageora investor,

67
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,320
and current client,

68
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,700
Wo lÃ¥ng Think twice

69
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,860
I have to go.

70
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,860
It's been an hour since I left.

71
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,860
These things.

72
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Hey, I guess it's before everyone left.

73
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,860
I'm in the meeting.

74
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:53,860
Oh.

75
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:03,860
If you're going to do that, go in quietly. Don't look at me.

76
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,260
Yoo-seon.

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,740
Yes.

78
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,740
The meeting is over.

79
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,780
Have a seat.

80
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,780
I'm sure there's no room.

81
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,780
I have a chair in the corner, so you can sit down.

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Yes.

83
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm here for coffee.

84
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Don't forget. You're a transparent human being.

85
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,780
When you're crying like I can see, it's just when I want to see my reaction.

86
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Don't react even if you're annoyed.

87
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,780
I'm done with coffee, so drink it.

88
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,780
I think I forgot about Yoo-seon because I got a warning. Drink it.

89
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,780
Keep going.

90
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
Yes.

91
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,780
In conclusion, the PD of the existing PD we have...

92
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,780
There are so many professional movies and baseballs at the meeting, so it's hard to understand.

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,780
But I don't have anything to ask for anyway, so just stay still.

94
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,780
What do you think of the secretary?

95
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Didn't you sit there to say something?

96
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,780
He's a staff member with a more PC and moral sense than anyone else.

97
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Can you tell us about his experience in ESG?

98
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
ESG.

99
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,780
To tell you about ESG,

100
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,780
it's very important and...

101
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,780
I don't have the sense of last week.

102
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,780
So how do you want to set up the important and important ESG KPI?

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,780
K... K... K...

104
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,780
K... K...

105
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
It's okay.

106
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,780
There's no time to ask such a question.

107
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Anyway, it's nice to hear Yoo-seon's voice after a long time.

108
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,780
Yes.

109
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,780
The meeting is like this.

110
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,780
I'm going to answer again after asking you.

111
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,780
I'm sorry for the mistake because I heard it so stubbornly.

112
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,780
I'm sorry for the applause.

113
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,780
I shouldn't have taken that.

114
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,780
People are so...

115
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
Yoo-seon.

116
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
No,

117
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,780
Mir.

118
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,780
It's Yumi.

119
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Why are you here?

120
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I told you.

121
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
It's Yumi.

122
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
It's Yumi.

123
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
It's Yumi.

124
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
It's Yumi.

125
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,780
Mir.

126
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Mir.

127
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,780
It's Yumi.

128
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Mir.

129
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,780
You...

130
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,780
You're in Seoul.

131
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh, my.

132
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Did you dye your hair?

133
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,780
What?

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,780
Oh, my.

135
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
You did a good job.

136
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,780
It's so refreshing to see you dye your hair.

137
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
You did a pretty job.

138
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
Oh, my.

139
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
You did a good job.

140
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Eat.

141
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
You're so...

142
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Did you eat everything you sent me?

143
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,780
No, I left a lot.

144
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,780
I think I can stop sending you the side dishes.

145
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,780
I didn't eat well at home, so I just called for a plate.

146
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
I know.

147
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,780
I don't know.

148
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
You know?

149
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Why are you sending me the side dishes?

150
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,780
I don't have a plate.

151
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,780
I send you the side dishes every month.

152
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,780
I'm going to have to answer you.

153
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,780
You sent me the side dishes because of the side dishes?

154
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Because you're so careful?

155
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,780
You're so careless.

156
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,780
But why don't you answer my phone?

157
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
What phone?

158
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,780
My grandmother called me because she was in a hurry.

159
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,780
I have to be away from home for a few days.

160
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,780
You're going to go if you don't go, right?

161
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Where?

162
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,780
You're going to the hospital?

163
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
My condition is just one.

164
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,780
I'm going to see my grandmother on the second week.

165
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
What?

166
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
You know, when you see your grandmother.

167
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,780
I'm going to see my grandmother on the second week.

168
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm busy.

169
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Are you busy with the meeting?

170
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,780
I'm working.

171
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Come to the strawberry bar until 2 o'clock.

172
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Jang Hwan Park.

173
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,780
It's better to see you than to hear it.

174
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Huh?

175
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:31,780
Ssam-ki.

176
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:41,780
Oh, my.

177
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,780
Hey, Yoon Min-jae.

178
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Did you dye your hair?

179
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Yoon Min-jae.

180
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780
What is it?

181
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,780
That's not a drink.

182
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,780
Hey, that's enough.

183
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:01,780
You have to get a new one for the police.

184
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Hello.

185
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,780
I'm Yoon Min-jae, the director.

186
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Oh, you're getting a new one?

187
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Isn't this the warehouse?

188
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,780
What's the concept of this?

189
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,780
I've been sitting down and doing something bad for a long time.

190
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,780
If you don't have anything to do, tie this up.

191
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
Huh?

192
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Yes.

193
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Did you get a new one at this house?

195
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,780
I'm almost all late to bed, so I'm going to go and plant strawberries.

196
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
I'll eat this and go.

197
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,780
It's a pipe.

198
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,780
What?

199
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,780
Stop it.

200
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,780
What are you going to do with the exercise?

201
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,780
Oh, exercise.

202
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,780
Why don't you give me money and get me to work?

203
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Huh?

204
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
You know?

205
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,780
And you should ask the farmer.

206
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,780
Did anyone come by text?

207
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,780
Oh, yes.

208
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Isn't the farmer in front of you?

209
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,780
He's in front of me.

210
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,780
The house is in total three rooms, but I'm going to change here.

211
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Uh...

212
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:46,780
Here.

213
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,780
These days, smart pams are flying around, but our farm is a soil-based farm.

214
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,780
What's the point of saying that?

215
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,780
That's easy.

216
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Right?

217
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,780
You're a good patient.

218
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,780
And what else?

219
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,780
It's a organic farm.

220
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't know if I heard it from the president last year, but I ruined the farm last year.

221
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,780
All the villagers were following the order, and the farmers went to the mountains.

222
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,780
But now you can only listen to me.

223
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
It's me.

224
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
It's me.

225
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,780
Anyway, you joined the battle, so I'm going to do my best to make the farm.

227
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,780
I'm thinking about my main job as long as this month is over.

228
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,780
The end.

229
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,780
What should I do now?

230
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Well, first of all...

231
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,780
What do you want to do?

232
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,780
Do what you want to do as you want.

233
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,780
I hope you don't want too much from me.

234
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
I'm not an employee, I'm a business partner.

235
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
You can let me go if you don't have anything to do.

236
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,780
I'll give you a chance to go home every day.

237
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,780
You can go home on your own.

238
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,780
Good luck!

239
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,780
It's a fake.

240
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,780
You're a fake even if you breathe.

241
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,780
It's not that you're just breathing.

242
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,780
First of all, it's the first thing to avoid the operation.

243
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Let's try it together.

244
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
Together?

245
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Oh, my.

246
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,780
It's the first time I've ever received money from a cigarette company.

247
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
It's almost like I'm getting a headache.

248
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
Solve it with money.

249
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
It's over if you give me a stone.

250
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,780
If you go to the operation, you'll be fired.

251
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Don't give me a stone. I have to win!

252
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
I wish I could, too.

253
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,780
There's a time when you're at your boss's house.

254
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,780
I thought you were just a carpenter when you hit him.

255
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,780
You broke your legs, but what are you doing?

256
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,780
Oh, my.

257
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,780
You're a guy with the same haze.

258
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Are you taking care of it?

259
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
What is this?

260
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,780
June 15, 2020.

261
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
What?

262
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,780
Kim Sooyoung is a member of the lawyer's department of the Law and Order Committee for theå and drink operation.

263
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,780
And the day I went to see the interview was September 15, 2020.

264
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Then this is...

265
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,780
I started the driver's article in the state of the law.

266
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,780
If you do well, I won't give you a stone.

267
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,780
What's the deal?

268
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Hurry up and end it.

269
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Don't waste your time to get the money.

270
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,780
You're paying less than you paid today.

271
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,780
My money is for the chairman to pay.

272
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
What?

273
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,780
If you're burdened with income, I'll always connect you to another hospital.

274
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Because they're all good friends.

275
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Then come in.

276
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,780
I'll pay you and pay you back.

277
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
What?

279
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,780
I couldn't tell you in advance.

280
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,780
I was looking for a free-form court, but I was worried about whether I should say it.

281
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,780
But you're saying it's a coin against me who was attacked by the fire?

282
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,780
No, if you hit me like that, I'm just trying to get my own ability.

283
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
Then you'll just say it.

284
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,780
What did you just say?

285
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,780
I just wanted to win.

286
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,780
That's right.

287
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:05,780
Let's go. I'll tell you what's good.

288
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
What did you do?

289
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Yes.

290
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,780
I posted a video of the English law, the first draft of the English law and the Derma Beauty analysis.

291
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm going to proceed with the eco-energy travel agreement.

292
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
Good.

293
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
Keep it in mind.

294
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,780
Now, it's done.

295
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,780
I'll give you a drink.

296
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
You can drink it.

297
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,780
Do you know the students?

298
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,780
There were people who gave me money when I was in college.

299
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
They all got stuck in the desert.

300
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
I lost my body.

301
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,780
Now, the lunch is over.

302
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Is the construction of the gold mine the second time?

303
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,780
Yes, it's a small project.

304
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,780
It's the last mountain accident.

305
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,780
You can drink it now.

306
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,780
It's already over.

307
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
It's over.

308
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780
I haven't even investigated it yet.

309
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,780
I guess it was just a car accident in the mountains.

310
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
Yes.

311
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,780
The report is in the same place, so be careful.

312
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
No, it's not.

313
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Yes.

314
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,780
It's a minus for us to think too deeply.

315
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,780
You know that, right?

316
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
I'll go in first.

317
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Don't say hi.

318
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,780
Okay.

319
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Isn't that just me?

320
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,780
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,780
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,780
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,780
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:50,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Shall I go outside or not?

329
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,780
territories.

330
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,780
I'm sorry, but like this, I have one more.

331
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,780
Musa, are you ÑÐ» Black?

332
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
No, I don't have much to do.

333
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,780
I'm so%$...

334
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,780
I'm still a dog.

335
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Is it just me?

336
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,780
I'm sitting down, but I'm a dog.

337
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Oh, I'm going to go for a year.

338
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Mirim.

339
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,780
What do you want to eat for lunch?

340
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:06,780
Don't tell me.

341
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm going to eat a lot.

342
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:36,780
What's Mirim's name?

343
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
It's a pig.

344
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Is that all?

345
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Can't you eat meat?

346
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:50,780
It's delicious.

347
00:22:50,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Wow, this isn't where people will do it. How did you get this?

348
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:20,780
It's uncomfortable.

349
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:30,780
No.

350
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:40,780
No, it's not.

351
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,780
Why are you so upset these days?

352
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,780
I heard that our team is the best.

353
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,780
I'm the best at the competition, so I'm not in a hurry.

354
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,780
But I'm afraid of the busy guys.

355
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Director, please give me a little more time.

356
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,780
Why do you give such a key to Yu Mirim?

357
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,780
Team leader Shin.

358
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:29,780
What if you get a problem with the employee's job later?

359
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,780
I'm going to make a decision.

360
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,780
The moment you receive the data for the competition is a college.

361
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:53,780
If you're not confident, you might as well sit down like now.

362
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,780
I checked the person's email.

363
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,780
The evaluation standard of the year's personnel department has become much tighter, so I'm going to work hard.

364
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,780
I'll do it well.

365
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Come on out.

366
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:19,780
Oh, come on.

367
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Did you see what you saw in the 7th floor this time?

368
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,780
You went to the company team last month and went to the 7th floor.

369
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
You haven't seen it for a month?

370
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,780
I saw the notice and I'm going to send it to my brother-in-law.

371
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,780
What's the rush?

372
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
Oh, my.

373
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Did you get the letter from the company?

374
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:50,780
It's going to be 7 months now.

375
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,780
7 months.

376
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:08,340
I'm almost done with the

377
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:18,340
proposal.

378
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:24,340
It's my specialty.

379
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,340
Hello.

380
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Let's just buy it here.

381
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,340
I just got one point.

382
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,340
Isn't it a drink?

383
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
What are you doing?

384
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
You guys go out, too.

385
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
It's not a drink.

386
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
You guys are going to drink alone.

387
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,340
We're going to go.

388
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
I'm going to go in.

389
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
I'm going to go in.

390
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,340
Why are you so serious?

391
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,340
What's up?

392
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,340
Can I have a meal alone?

393
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
I don't sell 2 servings.

394
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Then I'll order 2 servings.

395
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,340
It's good.

396
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
Boss, I'll order 2 servings.

397
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
It's okay.

398
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:18,340
What?

399
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:28,340
I'll order 2 servings.

400
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,340
I can't order 2 servings here alone.

401
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,340
If it's a quantity, that's the rule.

402
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,340
And the manager is the boss, too.

403
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Don't put a doubt in it.

404
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Did you see that?

405
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
It's never too big.

406
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,340
I'll put the packaging delivery in the end.

407
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Don't look at the bread.

408
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
What are you talking about?

409
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
It's a good deal.

410
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,340
I'm looking forward to a meal with you.

411
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
I mean, that's all.

412
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
If you eat it, you'll know.

413
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
If you eat it, you'll know.

414
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm coming out.

415
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
I'm coming out.

416
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I'm coming out.

417
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
I'm coming out.

418
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I'm coming out.

419
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
I'm coming out.

420
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
I'm coming out.

421
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Eat it.

422
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
Try it.

423
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,340
Boss, it was good.

424
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Thank you for the food.

425
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,340
I've never had a chicken intestines before.

426
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,340
But it's so delicious that I can't eat anything.

427
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
I'm so busy eating.

428
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
I'm so late for the greeting.

429
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm Yoo Mi-rae from the Korean Financial Management Agency.

430
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
You got a call before, right?

431
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,340
About the new business.

432
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:12,340
So today, I'm going to give you some advice.

433
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,340
Shall we talk outside?

434
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Then we have to go out here.

435
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
What?

436
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
Wait a minute, Miss.

437
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,340
I'm here with some advice.

438
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,340
I don't have any plans, so don't come back.

439
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:44,340
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Thank you.

441
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,340
I'm on a business trip today.

442
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Already?

443
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Why is the time so fast?

444
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,340
Since the time is up, if you decide to quit or quit,

445
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
you can decide on your own.

446
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
Director Eun-joo.

447
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,340
What?

448
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,340
I want to do it again.

449
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
No.

450
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,340
This is like sweet potato or potato.

451
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I really want to eat potatoes.

452
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
What should I do?

453
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,340
Oh, no.

454
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,340
I mean, I wrote down the sweet potato snack.

455
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
I didn't write down the building manual.

456
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
Huh?

457
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
What?

458
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Huh?

459
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Did you write down something like this?

460
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,340
I should have read it in advance.

461
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
What?

462
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Team leader Shin Kyung-min.

463
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
I'm going to get married.

464
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,340
I'm going to get married, but the truth is, the first place is the second place.

465
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Second place?

466
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Who pushed you?

467
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,340
The president of the Supreme Court.

468
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
The president of the Supreme Court?

469
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,340
You forgot about the president's case because you were so arrogant.

470
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Drink it.

471
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,340
The ace is going to stay still all the time, so you're going to see it.

472
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,340
The moment you get the news of the competition, you're going to be in trouble.

473
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,340
Never get fooled by that kindness.

474
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
The first place in the Supreme Court.

475
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Wow, that was all a trap.

476
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Wow, what should I do?

477
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,340
Please, please, please.

478
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,340
Yubi, calm down.

479
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
I'm still in trouble.

480
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
You just have to calm down and do it.

481
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Yes.

482
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Oh my gosh, it's so dark.

483
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
What?

484
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Isn't it just watching?

485
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Oh my gosh.

486
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
What are you doing in the middle of the winter?

487
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,340
Winter?

488
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:16,340
You're playing, right?

489
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:31,340
I'm going to play.

490
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Oh my gosh, I'm going to play.

491
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Give it to me.

492
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:57,340
Did you have nothing to do?

493
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Of course.

494
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
You bastard.

495
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
I've never seen you.

496
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
You bastard.

497
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:20,340
Hand, hand, hand.

498
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Is there anything wrong?

499
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Oh.

500
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Oh, my gosh.

501
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,340
I heard seven months is hot.

502
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Don't send me what's in my pocket.

503
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Oh, my gosh.

504
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,340
Oh, my gosh.

505
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
Oh, my gosh.

506
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,340
I'm going to wake up.

507
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:49,340
I'm going to wake up.

508
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Oh, my gosh.

509
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:58,340
Then I'll finish the first round like this.

510
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Oh, and the wild boar I was in charge of outside investigation last time.

511
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
I heard it was self-sufficient inside.

512
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Can you tell the result of the first round?

513
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
There was no special request.

514
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Is the senior employee in charge of the field?

515
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
What about the field?

516
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
I don't know.

517
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,340
I don't know, but when the foreign investigation started, I saw it immediately.

518
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
What?

519
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
I was afraid of the mojito.

520
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:34,340
What are you doing right now?

521
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Oh, Mi-young.

522
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Did you see the chair over there?

523
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Is it stuck on the table?

524
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Oh, did you break it?

525
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Yes, did you see it?

526
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
I put it in the trash in the morning.

527
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Wasn't it a throwaway?

528
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,340
No, why...

529
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Why don't you even ask me to do it?

530
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,340
No, I didn't ask you to do it.

531
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
You said you'd do it yourself.

532
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,340
You know it's not a clean job, but you're running away.

533
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:11,340
I'm not cleaning, I'm working as a salesman.

534
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Salesman is a salesman who works together.

535
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
Oh, you're good at writing.

536
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,340
You're a very magical person.

537
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:27,340
If you're doing that because of the chair, I'll buy you one tomorrow.

538
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,340
It was just a joke.

539
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,340
When I was at work, there were people who were as powerful as Mi-young.

540
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Then there's only one of them.

541
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
There's no sincerity or fear.

542
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,340
I told the company not to pick people like that, but I always picked them.

543
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,340
People who are afraid are so greedy.

544
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,340
And I don't let anything happen for a week and I watch.

545
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,340
Then everything is revealed.

546
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
What is it, what is it.

547
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,340
If you don't know, you can't even fight.

548
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,340
It's scary to make a mistake.

549
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
You can't even fight to the end.

550
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,340
I thought Mi-young was a very fearless person.

551
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Unfortunately, it was more.

552
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,340
It's not Mi-young, it's Mi-ji.

553
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:21,340
You don't even know the name of the person, why don't you tell me everything?

554
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,340
It's like a great way to keep you from working.

555
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
It's bothering him.

556
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,340
You're just evaluating what you want to do with words and making people do something you don't know how to do.

557
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,340
Like you're playing with a bug, you just take one arm and leg and see how far you can hold on.

558
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
But it's so fun.

559
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,340
Why are you so cruel?

560
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,340
How can a person be like that to a person?

561
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Oh my god.

562
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
What are you doing?

563
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
What are you doing?

564
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
What are you doing?

565
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
What are you doing?

566
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,340
Why are you lying down here?

567
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:43,340
Why are you crying right?

568
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Why are you crying right?

569
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:51,340
Should I just look at you?

570
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,340
Oh, In-gwan.

571
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,340
Don't think about leaving and think about doing something.

572
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Oh, there's still more.

573
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
In-gwan.

574
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Lee Ho-soo?

575
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Why is he here?

576
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,340
What is it?

577
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
What are you?

578
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
What are you?

579
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
What are you?

580
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,340
Why don't you answer my call after you've lost your mind?

581
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,340
Did you really go to the beach?

582
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,340
What are you talking about?

583
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
Can't you do it?

584
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,340
Do you have any intention to answer your call?

585
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,340
What happened to your high school uniform?

586
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,340
How do you know that?

587
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,340
Do you do a back investigation?

588
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Don't you remember what you saw me?

589
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,340
No, I mean, the external investigation.

590
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,340
So what's the reason?

591
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,340
If you have something to say, text me.

592
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,340
I have to go in.

593
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:47,340
You're at the company.

594
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Talk to me.

595
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
I don't have anything to leave with that text.

596
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
Just listen to me now.

597
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
I'll do my best to do it near the company.

598
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,340
Hey, Yu-mi.

599
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,340
What's the solution if you keep avoiding it like this?

600
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
I'm sorry.

601
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,340
I'm sorry.

602
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
I'm sorry.

603
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,340
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
I'm sorry.

605
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
I'm sorry.

606
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
I'm sorry.

607
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
I'm sorry.

610
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,340
What's the solution if you keep avoiding it like this?

611
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
It's your problem.

612
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,340
Let's talk about it together.

613
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Just once.

614
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,340
I'm also lazy.

615
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,340
Then call me on the weekend.

616
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Saturday evening?

617
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:34,340
You can write down the details in the text.

618
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,340
What?

619
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:42,340
Lee Ho-su?

620
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,340
So you're going to see him?

621
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
No, I just talked about it for a while.

622
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,340
It's weird that I don't like him.

623
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
But did you get to know him?

624
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,340
He was like a stranger.

625
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Don't lie.

626
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,340
What if he finds out that you met him?

627
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,340
I thought he was going to play with you today.

628
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Did you think about it when you were in high school?

629
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Who is it?

630
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:18,340
He found out right away that we were fighting.

631
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Who are you?

632
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Is it Yumi?

633
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
I can't understand.

634
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,340
There's a way to make him suspicious.

635
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,340
It's a fruit.

636
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Don't look at me.

637
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,340
We promised not to touch each other's lives.

638
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
But you know what?

639
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:54,340
You can't just do anything that makes you feel like you're in a situation where you have to live.

640
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
What did you do?

641
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,340
What?

642
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,340
What do you mean?

643
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,340
I really want to do something.

644
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
I want to do it.

645
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
Don't meet him anyway.

646
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,340
I don't want you to pretend to be me.

647
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Okay.

648
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
Don't you answer?

649
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Okay.

650
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
I got it.

651
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,340
Oh, my.

652
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,340
I told you to forget about this because I saw this.

653
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
I know I'm in trouble.

654
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,340
Oh, my God.

655
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:37,340
What about the fruit of Saturday?

656
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,340
I'm sorry.

657
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:48,340
I accidentally looked at the bill last time, but it seemed a little hard.

658
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,340
What's the solution if you keep avoiding it like this?

659
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:58,340
It's your problem. Let's talk about it together.

660
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Isn't it a little painful?

661
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Oh, my God.

662
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:16,340
What's the meaning of this?

663
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Oh, my God.

664
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:36,340
Oh, my God.

665
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Who goes to the office on weekends?

666
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,340
Then where?

667
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
Where?

668
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Hey, it's a genius's secret.

669
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,340
I have to go to the south.

670
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,340
I have to go to Hongdae.

671
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,340
I have to take a picture of the park and say hello to the three of us.

672
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:16,340
And I have to go to the Han River at night to get a rainbow fountain.

673
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Hey, Seoul.

674
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,340
Try recommending Hyunjin.

675
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,340
Do you like Seoul the most?

676
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,340
I don't think there's anything.

677
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,340
Seoul.

678
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:37,340
There's nothing. I just did it as a book.

679
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
Cheers.

680
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,340
If you don't go after seeing it, check it out.

681
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,340
Why?

682
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
No, we're going to see it in Seoul anyway.

683
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,340
If it's Ki-won, it's more fun to see it without going.

684
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:58,340
I think it's a little bit like a guest.

685
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,340
But why aren't you going home?

686
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,340
There's no one at home.

687
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,340
Everyone's going to Seoul.

688
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Hey, I'm going to Seoul in an hour.

689
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,340
Later.

690
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,340
Later.

691
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,340
I'm going to Seoul later.

692
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:27,340
Seoul is a hospital in the future.

693
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Hey, and I'm waiting for you.

694
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,340
How long does it take to get a five-minute note?

695
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:42,340
Hurry up and end it.

696
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
Hello.

697
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,340
I'm just out of the store. Are you okay?

698
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,340
Yes.

699
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,340
Come this way.

700
00:46:53,340 --> 00:47:05,340
Oh, thank you.

701
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,340
I think I'm full of food and medicine for the restaurant.

702
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,340
I'm still eating.

703
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:22,340
I'll give you a menu.

704
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:32,340
I'm going to eat here.

705
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,340
Did I make a mistake? Why all of a sudden?

706
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,340
If you wanted to talk, I don't think this is the right place to talk.

707
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:03,340
Are you taking care of me now?

708
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,340
It's noisy, but you hate it.

709
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,340
You're really a good guy.

710
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,340
I just asked.

711
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,340
Then where are you going?

712
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:20,340
All the restaurants around here are full.

713
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:31,340
It's okay to walk for 10 minutes.

714
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:37,340
Oh, my God.

715
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:47,340
Oh, pretty.

716
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,340
Why?

717
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,340
You...

718
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,340
What, did you see Han River for the first time?

719
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,340
Do you think I'm crazy? How can I see Han River in Seoul?

720
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,340
But why do you like Han River every day?

721
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:27,340
Did you go to Han River with Han River on the subway?

722
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,340
And then I think I haven't been here in a long time.

723
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,340
Yeah, you should watch this, too.

724
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,340
But what are you eating here?

725
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,340
I don't know. It's Han River.

726
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,340
Han River?

727
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
It's ramen.

728
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,340
But it's cup ramen.

729
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,340
You know, the japan-giramyeon.

730
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,340
Isn't it all the same ramen anyway?

731
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,340
Are you kidding me?

732
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,340
No, the japan-giramyeon is a base ramen.

733
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Then the noodles are different.

734
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,340
But it's not a bowl.

735
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,340
There's a rich taste in the japan-giramyeon.

736
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,340
He's rich.

737
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
You have to try it.

738
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,340
Try it.

739
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:37,340
How is it?

740
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,340
Huh?

741
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,340
It's good, right?

742
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,340
It's different.

743
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,340
I know.

744
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:55,340
There was a reason why Yu-mi was singing in Han River.

745
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:59,340
So what's the story?

746
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,340
Eat first.

747
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,340
After eating.

748
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:17,340
What are you talking about? Just tell me.

749
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:25,340
Did you do it because of me?

750
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,340
Because of you?

751
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:35,340
That day.

752
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,340
I didn't expect you to face me there.

753
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:45,340
As you know, your construction regulations are the principle of going out of the law firm with San-ae-gu.

754
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:51,340
That day, I was in a hurry to go into the senior senior's detachment.

755
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,340
I'm sorry.

756
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,340
But what's the reason?

757
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:09,340
In this case, there are cases where the victim may be killed because of the sexual relationship issue.

758
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,340
For reference, I don't know the details, so don't worry about that.

759
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,340
I didn't do anything good after I knew it was your job.

760
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:21,340
Are you talking about the Supreme Court now?

761
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,340
Supreme Court?

762
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,340
I knew it was Park Sang-young's case.

763
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,340
I'm sorry for the senior.

764
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,340
Why did you bring me something like that?

765
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:39,340
What else happened in Yu-mi?

766
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:49,340
If you really got drunk because of me, let's find a way together.

767
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,340
San-ae detachment is already over, but in this case, it's better to go to Min-sa.

768
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,340
I promised not to touch each other's lives.

769
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,340
It's not like you're a criminal.

770
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Lee Yu-soo, you're still the same.

771
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
What?

772
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,340
The world doesn't go back to your center.

773
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,340
It's all my decision to think about it, not because of you.

774
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,340
I mean, I was going to avoid it as soon as I saw you.

775
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,340
This is a self-discipline.

776
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,340
Why do I avoid you?

777
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:23,340
I'm not worried about anything else because of the project I've been in these days, so I'm drunk.

778
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,340
Don't get me wrong.

779
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,340
Really?

780
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,340
It's all my fault?

781
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,340
Of course it's your fault.

782
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:39,340
You guys didn't know our relationship, so you sent it out to the police.

783
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,340
Yes.

784
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,340
I'm worried because the new report is a colleague.

785
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:49,340
Isn't it just a coincidence that the coincidence has been over?

786
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,340
No, that's right.

787
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,340
I'm sure you didn't do that on purpose.

788
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,340
Did you do that on purpose?

789
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:03,340
What are you doing with a lawyer like this?

790
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,340
You're so weak that you don't even change your money?

791
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,340
You don't know what you're talking about.

792
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,340
I'm different from before.

793
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,340
You're sitting with me like this on the weekend.

794
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,340
You're the same.

795
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,340
I can't just fall if I get caught in something from the past.

796
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:28,340
I'm not like a rock in my shoes.

797
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,340
Me?

798
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,340
Then it's you, not me.

799
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,340
It hurts.

800
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,340
Eat it.

801
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,340
What are you two doing at home?

802
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,340
I'm waiting for you to make a note.

803
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,340
What kind of note?

804
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:57,340
Go ahead.

805
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:02,340
What are you doing?

806
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:08,340
You didn't make a mistake.

807
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:18,340
I don't know, but I took a few.

808
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:44,340
I don't know if it was a problem that I got caught in shoes.

809
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,340
If you're done eating, get up quickly.

810
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,340
I should go to the company.

811
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,340
If you're a little bit, you'll be analyzed.

812
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,340
You're not a childish kid.

813
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,340
What are you doing at the supermarket?

814
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,340
If you want to see me.

815
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,340
That's crazy.

816
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,340
You said that, too.

817
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Don't you remember?

818
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:13,340
When we went to Seoul to see the meeting.

819
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,340
I remember everything.

820
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Go and throw it away.

821
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,340
Yeah.

822
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:37,340
Give it to me.

823
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,340
What's going on at this time?

824
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:49,340
What's going on?

825
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:59,340
What's the smell?

826
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,340
What's wrong with you?

827
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,340
What?

828
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,340
You didn't say anything.

829
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:14,340
What did you think I would know?

830
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,340
You drank too much.

831
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:22,340
If you drink too much, you'll be in trouble.

832
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,340
What did I do?

833
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,340
You said you drank too much.

834
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,340
You're going to get caught in the car without drinking.

835
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,340
What?

836
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,340
Are you talking nonsense?

837
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:37,340
I'm drunk when I see you on the car.

838
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,340
No, I'm not.

839
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:49,340
No, I'm not.

840
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:56,340
What?

841
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,340
I'm not.

842
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,340
What's the reason?

843
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,340
I'm worried about the residents.

844
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,340
What's wrong with you?

845
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:12,340
You can do it?

846
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,340
Candy.

847
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,340
Even if you're lonely or sad, it's candy.

848
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:21,340
I don't have anything, but I'm not worried about anything.

849
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,340
What?

850
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,340
The president said that.

851
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,340
You just had a rotten expression yesterday.

852
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,340
Hey, then I'm going to break it and cut it off.

853
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,340
You're right.

854
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:37,340
You were so chubby that you were choked up by the love you had at that time.

855
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,340
How can you be 24 hours bright?

856
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,340
So.

857
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:49,340
So 24 hours is not normal.

858
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:59,340
So it's so thin.

859
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:04,340
I've never seen you so chubby before.

860
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,340
Did I do that?

861
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,340
Yes.

862
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:20,340
I'm going.

863
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:28,340
I just got home.

864
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,340
What are you doing on the weekend? Come in now.

865
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,340
I'm going to Han River alone.

866
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:40,340
By the way, you.

867
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:45,340
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

868
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:49,340
What do you mean?

869
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:54,340
That.

870
00:59:54,340 --> 01:00:00,340
Have you ever wanted to see a rainbow fountain?

871
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,340
I think so.

872
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,340
You used to sing all the time.

873
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,340
But why?

874
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:11,340
I don't think that's the case with you.

875
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,340
Anyway.

876
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,340
That's right.

877
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,340
Do you know that the door is broken?

878
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,340
That's right.

879
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,340
That door won't close.

880
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,340
If you're uncomfortable, you can just change the door.

881
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,340
Are you still tired?

882
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,340
Huh?

883
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,340
It's me.

884
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,340
I was supposed to visit you.

885
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:40,340
You know that's not the case.

886
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,340
Hey, I'm a yukendi.

887
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,340
What's so hard about me?

888
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,340
I don't know.

889
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,340
I'm sorry.

890
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,340
I'm a yukendi.

891
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,340
What's so hard about me?

892
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:56,340
Who's worried about who?

893
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,340
Hey, Yu Mi-rae.

894
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,340
You're so good.

895
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,340
Yu Mi-ji, you.

896
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,340
Hey, that's right.

897
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,340
You're so high up on the heels.

898
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,340
I'm not even going crazy because I'm holding a water bottle behind me.

899
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,340
Didn't you hurt?

900
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:19,340
I've been wearing it all the time, so I'm getting tired.

901
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,340
Why?

902
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,340
Is it uncomfortable?

903
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,340
No, I'm going to get used to it soon.

904
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,340
You and I are the same.

905
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:37,340
Yeah, we're the same.

906
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,340
Yeah, hey, go to bed early.

907
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,340
I'll call you again.

908
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:52,340
Oh, yeah.

909
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,340
We're more like each other than anyone else.

910
01:01:55,340 --> 01:02:00,340
Why did I think you were against me?

911
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:05,340
I don't know who you've been following for a while.

912
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:15,340
Why would I think you knew?

913
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,340
What are you doing?

914
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,340
Just breathe.

915
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,340
Why?

916
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:38,340
You said you wouldn't be out for half a day.

917
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,340
I have to see my mom's pregnancy, so you can see your grandma today.

918
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,340
Go to the hospital right away.

919
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,340
Huh?

920
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:53,340
Oh, my.

921
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
Oh, Yu Mi-ji is here.

922
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,340
What happened last time?

923
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,340
Did you hurt?

924
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,340
No, I'm fine.

925
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:08,340
Grandma, wake up and see who's here.

926
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:11,340
I told you not to come every day, but you waited because you couldn't see me.

927
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:24,340
Who's there?

928
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,340
Mi-ji.

929
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,340
Oh, my.

930
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,340
Mi-ji is here.

931
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,340
Shall we go to the flower shop?

932
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,340
I'll bring my stuff.

933
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,340
Please give it to me.

934
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,340
I'm fine.

935
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,340
Please give it to me.

936
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,340
The exception is the agreement.

937
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,340
I've written it down, but it's not too much.

938
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,340
I should write it down again.

939
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,340
I agree without any compensation.

940
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,340
What?

941
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,340
As soon as I heard about the mother-in-law, the victim was full.

942
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,340
I'll have to take a picture soon.

943
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,340
I solved it easily because of you.

944
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:10,340
But there's no compensation for the victim.

945
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,340
I'm so deep in thought.

946
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,340
Our client is the chairman.

947
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:18,340
Why are you so good at it?

948
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,340
Let's go.

949
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:23,340
The vice president of the chairman is going to be a big hit.

950
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,340
No, I...

951
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,340
I like you.

952
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,340
I can't let you down if you know.

953
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,340
You can't be so mean.

954
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,340
Excuse me.

955
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,340
Yes.

956
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,340
How did the client who was going to be a senior in the mountain last time come to my school?

957
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,340
I found out after looking at the data.

958
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,340
Your name is unique.

959
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,340
Two-handed song.

960
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:08,340
Did the client send me on purpose because he was my classmate?

961
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,340
Of course.

962
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,340
Of course?

963
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,340
Yeah.

964
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,340
I'm going to do a QIU.

965
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:19,340
It's good to end it quickly.

966
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:24,340
If you ask me why I'm more fundamental, we're not a victim.

967
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,340
We're a public company.

968
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:40,340
I'm sorry I'm so sensitive to the media because I've just been changed.

969
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,340
Don't be so upset.

970
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,340
It's similar to the chairman's.

971
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,340
Who knows if the victim is unfair or if the client is sick.

972
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:52,340
But winning is the priority.

973
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:59,340
What about us?

974
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,340
I can't just fall if I get caught in something from the past.

975
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:08,340
It's like a rock in my shoes.

976
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,340
Shall we go?

977
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,340
The chairman is leaving the car below.

978
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:16,340
I...

979
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,340
I'm not going.

980
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:24,340
What?

981
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:29,340
Are you serious?

982
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:33,340
Yes.

983
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,340
Okay.

984
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,340
Good job.

985
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Let's go.

986
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:14,340
I'm sick.

987
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,340
Did you see me sick?

988
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:23,340
You're the strongest one in Oman.

989
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:27,340
It was hard in Seoul.

990
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,340
I only gave half of the car in the future.

991
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:34,340
What's so cool about it?

992
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:44,340
It's the future.

993
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,340
Did you know?

994
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:50,340
I'm waiting for my death.

995
01:07:50,340 --> 01:08:00,340
Let's find out the future.

996
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,340
Why am I doing this?

997
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,340
Don't ask me.

998
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,340
What do you ask?

999
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:17,340
I've been through a lot and I've been through a lot alone.

1000
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:24,340
No, I couldn't.

1001
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:29,340
I ran away, grandma.

1002
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,340
Good job.

1003
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:39,340
Good job.

1004
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:43,340
Good job.

1005
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:49,340
Can you still talk to you because you haven't even been in the store?

1006
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,340
Are you going out for a visit every day?

1007
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,340
You have a lot of personality.

1008
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,340
You didn't know that?

1009
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,340
You said you could do it.

1010
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,340
If you did, you should have done it.

1011
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,340
I won't say more.

1012
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,340
You're responsible anyway.

1013
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:10,340
Go.

1014
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:18,340
Take this.

1015
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:38,340
Hello, boss.

1016
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:48,340
Can you please listen to me for a second?

1017
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,340
Yes, really.

1018
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:56,340
Then I'll leave the documents here.

1019
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,340
Please read this one by one.

1020
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:03,340
You're so mean.

1021
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,340
I'm not a person.

1022
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,340
I'm just working.

1023
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:11,340
I'm just working like a boss.

1024
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:14,340
You don't have to do this with the beggars who eat together.

1025
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,340
I'm just working on the building.

1026
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,340
Just read this one by one.

1027
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:27,340
It's not like that much of a person's rice porridge.

1028
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:33,340
Are you done?

1029
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:43,340
Yes.

1030
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:59,340
What is it?

1031
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,340
I'm sure it's all ruined.

1032
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,340
It's easy to breathe.

1033
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,340
It's been a while.

1034
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:15,340
I'm happy to take off my mask that I couldn't see.

1035
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:45,340
You're here.

1036
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:48,340
What?

1037
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:53,340
Do you have more energy left?

1038
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,340
I'm going to do an accident.

1039
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,340
Accident?

1040
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:04,340
I didn't go into the detachment.

1041
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:11,340
I thought you were our colleague and sent you to the high school.

1042
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:16,340
Well, it's all over anyway.

1043
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:19,340
I didn't know you were here.

1044
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:28,340
I think you have my responsibility as a person who sent you to the high school.

1045
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:39,340
I can't help you, but I'll do anything I can to help you.

1046
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:42,340
You called me here to talk about that?

1047
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:47,340
Shouldn't you go back to the company anyway?

1048
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,340
I'm going to work like this today.

1049
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,340
Thanks to you.

1050
01:12:52,340 --> 01:13:01,340
Thanks to you?

1051
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:10,340
Actually, I sometimes felt uncomfortable doing this job.

1052
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:16,340
I tried to fix it because I felt like I was wrong.

1053
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,340
You said that.

1054
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:24,340
I used to walk around with my shoes on when I felt like it.

1055
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,340
I heard that and I realized it.

1056
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:37,340
Oh, I forgot about it.

1057
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:41,340
I know it's meaningless.

1058
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,340
I told you I forgot about me.

1059
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:49,340
But I did that.

1060
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:56,340
So I'm going to slowly become a pig from now on.

1061
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,340
What else did I forget?

1062
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:04,340
I have a child who is full of pride and is not afraid of the pressure.

1063
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:12,340
I didn't know that I was going to be a pig in the future.

1064
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,340
I didn't know that I was going to be a pig.

1065
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:40,340
I know it's right after I get it wrong.

1066
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:50,340
I know I'm wrong now, so I wonder if the day will come when I can solve it properly.

1067
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:55,340
Why?

1068
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,340
Just.

1069
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:11,340
If I do something like you and O-dan-notes, I might get better.

1070
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,340
Hello?

1071
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,340
Come to the girl's house tomorrow.

1072
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,340
What?

1073
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,340
What?

1074
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,340
You want to see a person?

1075
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:26,340
Come to the girl's house tomorrow.

1076
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,340
What's up?

1077
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,340
What?

1078
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:41,340
No, I don't know yet.

1079
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:45,340
Wow, I really like the smell.

1080
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,340
Hey, are you hungry?

1081
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,340
Do you want to ride a ramen?

1082
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,340
Wait, what time is it?

1083
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,340
Should I eat it?

1084
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,340
No, no, no, no, no.

1085
01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:07,340
It's a dream.

1086
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:17,340
It's a dream again.

1087
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:47,340
I guess I missed you.

1088
01:16:47,340 --> 01:17:07,340
When did you finish this?

1089
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,340
You're out of your mind now.

1090
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,340
I know.

1091
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,340
Why are you so sad today?

1092
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,340
You know, I did it.

1093
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,340
Is there a separate ward?

1094
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,340
Why?

1095
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,340
It's a little cool even in the usual way.

1096
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,340
Here.

1097
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,340
Oh, Mir.

1098
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,340
It's been a long time.

1099
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,340
How are you?

1100
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,340
Oh, Ji-yoon.

1101
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,340
I'm going to have a meeting next week.

1102
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,340
What?

1103
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,340
I'm the boss of this, right?

1104
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,340
What are you doing?

1105
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,340
Don't come back.

1106
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:42,340
I don't want to go to my land.
