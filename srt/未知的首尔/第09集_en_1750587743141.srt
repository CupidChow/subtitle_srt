DATA PROCESSING ROOM

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,880
What are you waiting for? Scan it.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,930
Pardon?
Scan your fingerprint.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,010
Ah, my finger's like this, so I can't.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,810
Hurry up and scan it.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,480
What? Did you hurt your finger too?

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,230
Or…

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,900
is there another reason why you can't?

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,040

YU MI-RAE
VERIFIED

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,720
Verified.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,940
The only lesson I learned
from battling my childhood illness…

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,480
is that there are some fights in life
you just can't win.

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,570
Where are you going?

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,030
Dusonbong Peak.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,450
I also know…

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,540
that you always gain something
at the end of a fight.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,760
But I didn't have the strength
to keep fighting until I won.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,090
You failed by just three points?
You'll definitely pass next time, Mi-rae.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,140
I didn't pass either.

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,180
I made it to the second round
last time, though.

24
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,310
I had to make a quick decision
between a fight I could win…

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
PUBLIC CORPORATIONS

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,440
…and a fight I could not win.
Mi-rae.

27
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,980
What are you doing? Let's go.

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,690
Maybe that's why…

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,820
I was so concerned about Su-yeon,
who was fighting for what was right…

30
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,870
KIM SU-YEON

31
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,990
…unlike me.

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,700
Ms. Kim Su-yeon said…

33
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,250
She lit up a small light

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,620
that I didn't even know
existed inside of me.

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,170
That light led me…

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,380
It's all true.

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,260
…to jump into a fight
I would've normally walked away from.

38
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,640
Exhausted from fighting a hopeless fight,

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,390
I grabbed hold
of the finger Mi-ji extended,

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,850
and I ran away.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,770
And then…

42
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,020
Is staying here an option, by any chance?

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,400
…I unexpectedly found
another light in the place I had run to.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,650
Someone to take over?

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,360
I think he's going to the States

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,650
to start working again or something.

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,370
I felt ashamed
that I had tried to rely on that light,

48
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,620
so I ran away again.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,830
Excuse me.

50
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,330
I went back to the place
I had run away from.

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,750
EPISODE 9
BACK AGAIN, ONCE MORE

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,460
STRAWBERRY FARM

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,890
How would you like your hair?

54
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,220
I want hair extensions.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,980
You didn't tell me you were coming.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,900
You didn't answer my calls.

57
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,990
What's going on?
Well…

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,660
This is…

59
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,420
My name is Kim Tae-i,
a coworker of Ms. Yu.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,480
You brought someone from work here?
Have you lost your mind?

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,310
I had no choice. It wasn't something
we could talk about outside.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,860
Hey, why would you be talking
to someone from work about--

63
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,900
He's Kim Su-yeon's younger brother.

64
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,450
What?
You know, your senior coworker.

65
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,870
Tae-i is the younger brother
of that coworker who blew the whistle.

66
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,620
Why is Su-yeon's brother…

67
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,290
I thought that SY stood for Sang-yeong,

68
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,580
but it was Su-yeon.

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,250
He said he joined the company
to collect evidence for his sister.

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,210
He mentioned a guarantee or something.

71
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,550
Anyway, he's done collecting evidence,
so he said you need to make a decision.

72
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,720
About what?
Reporting the company.

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,550
You need to tell the world
what those jerks have been doing!

74
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,310
Why would I do that?
What?

75
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,140
Because…
Why are you dragging me into this?

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,730
Tell him to do that.

77
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,400
Tae-i said he can't do it
because he's not someone on the inside.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,770
You're the one who saw
what happened to her from the start,

79
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,480
and you're the only one who testified.

80
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,980
He said only you can do this.

81
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,990
Why do I have to fight?

82
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,450
Hey.

83
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,240
Don't you think this is unfair?

84
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,080
The bad guys didn't even get punished,

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,620
while the person who spoke up
was bullied and then driven out.

86
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,750
You two are doing this
because you don't know better,

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,330
but this is a fight we can't win.

88
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,130
You won't know if you'll win or lose--

89
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,420
I already fought, and I lost.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,710
I learned the hard way

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,840
that I'll be the only one suffering
if I fight them.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,470
You want me to go through that again?
Why should I?

93
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,220
You said you're going to quit anyway.

94
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,850
But before you do,

95
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,230
you could at least teach
the people who bullied you a lesson.

96
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,690
Who said I'm quitting?

97
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,650
I said I'd think about it.
You're not quitting?

98
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,230
You're going to keep working there?

99
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,610
If you're staying,
then more reason to fight.

100
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,900
You're gonna go back to staring
at walls and wasting away?

101
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,700
Why do you keep running away
when you did nothing wrong?

102
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,870
So what about you, Mi-ji?
What?

103
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,790
Do you have some plan
to get your life together now?

104
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,750
Mi-rae.

105
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,420
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

106
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,800
Stop butting into my life
and focus on your own.

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,920
We're done pretending to be each other.

108
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,840
Fine.

109
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,930
Do whatever you want with your life.

110
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,780
SORRY I MADE YOU GO THROUGH THIS ALONE
BUT I'M ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU

111
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,160
I heard…

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,620
that Su-yeon trained you.

113
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,170
I'm the one who trained Su-yeon.

114
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,050
I look forward to working with you.

115
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,100
Right…

116
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,350
Why'd you even bother…

117
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,810
BACK FROM PATERNITY LEAVE

118
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,360
Why not? She's part of the team.

119
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,530
Gosh.

120
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,030
Here you go.

121
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,240
Here's your latte,
and here's your Americano.

122
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,160
Oh, I…
I already had a cup earlier.

123
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,010
CHECK FOR ERRORS
SUBMIT THE EDITED FILE BY SUNDAY

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,850
These people are unbelievable.

125
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,350
You can't do this all by yourself.

126
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,190
Just leave it. I'll do it.

127
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,190
I'll help you.

128
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,480
That's what senior coworkers are for.

129
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,190
That's what senior coworkers are for.

130
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,150
Do the same
for your junior coworker in the future.

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,530
What?

132
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,410
Did I sound like an old geezer?

133
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,740
No.

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,290
Thank you.

135
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,330
Let's wrap this up quickly
and head home.

136
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,880
You really don't have to take me home.

137
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,340
Come on. We're headed
the same way, so hop in.

138
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,800
We worked late together,
so let me give you a ride.

139
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,400
PARK MI-RAE

140
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,240
My daughter's name is Mi-rae too.

141
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,070
I was pleasantly surprised
when I learned you two had the same name.

142
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,700
When I was on paternity leave,
I wanted to come to work so badly.

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,210
But now that I'm back in the office,
I miss my daughter so much.

144
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,340
Sir…

145
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,260
Here.

146
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,810
What's this?

147
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,100
A gift voucher for gas?

148
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,270
Gosh, it's okay. You don't have to.

149
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,730
Please take it.

150
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,940
I feel bad that you're always helping me
and giving me a ride.

151
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,820
Gosh…

152
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind.

153
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,740
I wasn't there
when you really needed help.

154
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,920
Okay, then…

155
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,670
When you buy your coffee in the morning,

156
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,550
bring one for me too, okay?

157
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,130
Okay.

158
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,890
MI-RAE! I LOVE YOU!

159
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,750
Hey.

160
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,710
Mi-ji.

161
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,770
Ma'am.

162
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,440
What brings you here at this hour?

163
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,700
I wanted to say goodbye
before going to work.

164
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm dropping out of the new HQ project.

165
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,750
What?

166
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,370
Are you backing out because of me?
Because I said I'm not selling?

167
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,000
Gosh, of course not.

168
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,710
I just… Hold on.

169
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,090
You decided not to sell the restaurant?

170
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,920
I see. I'm really glad to hear that.

171
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,590
They're the ones in a hurry, not you.

172
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,260
Just take your time deciding.

173
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,310
Are you saying that
because you're not part of it now?

174
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,060
Who cares?
I'm out, so I can say whatever I want.

175
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,940
Gosh, that feels so good.

176
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,940
Why are you here to say goodbye, though?

177
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,280
Are you going somewhere far away?

178
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,490
No, it's not like that.

179
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,160
It just won't be easy for me
to come see you anymore.

180
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,540
So I wanted to say goodbye one last time.

181
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,170
You're kind of special to me.

182
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,970
I know I'm not
that special to you, though.

183
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,050
But looking back,

184
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,680
I realized
that ever since I came to Seoul,

185
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,850
you were the only person
who accepted me for who I am,

186
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,020
regardless of my job
or educational background.

187
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,740
To be honest, it's been a really long time
since I got to know someone new.

188
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,780
We may not be friends,

189
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,950
but you're kind of special to me.

190
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,550
Have you…

191
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,470
heard of an adult guardianship?

192
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,680
A guardianship?

193
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,520
I've never told you this before.

194
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,850
But I have a son.

195
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,020
You have a son?

196
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,070
He's been living in a facility
for a while now.

197
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,070
Because he's not of sound mind.

198
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,000
I need someone to look after him
if anything happens to me.

199
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm sure you've noticed,

200
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,670
but I have no one around me
to ask for help.

201
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,550
If you're up for it,

202
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,380
I'll give you a bit of money
for the trouble,

203
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,260
so please think about it.

204
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,020
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

205
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm sorry about yesterday.

206
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,860
I didn't know you had family coming.

207
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,580
Ms. Yu, can we talk for a moment?

208
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,910
Ms. Yu, you're not busy
right now, are you?

209
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,960
Come with me for a second.

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,130
May I go now?

211
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,920
Yes, you may go.

212
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,110
What's going on?

213
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,980
You said she was Mi-rae's twin,
but the prints match.

214
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,190
They matched?

215
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,580
Ms. Yu.

216
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Can we talk?

217
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,330
No, I--

218
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,790
It won't take long.

219
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,130
There's something
I didn't tell you yesterday.

220
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,550
A few years ago,

221
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,550
my sister called me out of the blue.

222
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,390
She started talking about her company,
which I didn't know much about.

223
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,350
Re-do it.

224
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,100
She said she was doing work
that wasn't her responsibility,

225
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,940
but her bosses kept making
unreasonable demands.

226
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,940
She was told to pressure
a third-party evaluator

227
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,030
into giving favorable results
for a specific company.

228
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,110
And so she…

229
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,610
She blew the whistle.

230
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,030
Let's skip what we both know.

231
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,290
Over the past three years,

232
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,920
among the payment guarantees
provided by KFMC to midsize companies,

233
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,590
the Planning Strategy Team
oversaw 20 cases,

234
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,590
and 60% of them were focused
on a single company.

235
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,180
Sixty percent.

236
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,470
Can you believe it?

237
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,890
The company recently chosen
as the contractor for the new HQ

238
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,640
is that same company,
which is headed by our new CEO's relative.

239
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,400
The one that my sister supposedly gave
preferential treatment to "voluntarily."

240
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,360
Sihan Construction.

241
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,570
There's obviously something going on.

242
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,030
But no one's doing anything about it.

243
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,570
Someone has to raise the issue.

244
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,330
And that someone is me?

245
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
You already said all this yesterday.

246
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,790
You didn't hear about it from me, though.

247
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,420
You showed up late.

248
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,590
You did seem strange lately.

249
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,390
The way you were acting recently
was so different from how you usually are.

250
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,150
I never would have imagined
that you had a twin.

251
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,310
So…

252
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,400
are you going to blackmail me?

253
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,150
The company would likely
be more intrigued by the younger brother

254
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,700
collecting company secrets
to avenge his sister

255
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,240
than by baseless rumors
about twins switching lives.

256
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,290
But you're not going to tell the company.

257
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,620
I don't plan on telling them either.

258
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,130
If the evidence is that solid,

259
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,170
then you can make a move yourself.

260
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,920
As you just said,

261
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,050
if I get involved,

262
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,050
everyone will focus more

263
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,390
on the younger brother seeking revenge
than on the real issue.

264
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,390
You're the only one
who can do this, Ms. Yu.

265
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,640
Why me, of all people?

266
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,310
You know how things are at work
for me right now.

267
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,440
You're the only one who testified.

268
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,230
The Planning Strategy Team?

269
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,570
They all saw it,
but they turned a blind eye.

270
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,440
They can't do anything
even if they wanted to

271
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,910
because everything they said
would become a lie.

272
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,660
This is a chance to prove
that you were right.

273
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,490
I don't want to prove anything.

274
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,710
I know it must have been hard
for you all this time, but…

275
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,710
No.

276
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,130
You don't know.

277
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,920
Do you know why those people bullied you?

278
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,760
They did that to hide their wrongdoing.

279
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,720
We should expose them
and have them face the consequences.

280
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,970
Don't you resent them for what they did?

281
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,430
I'm saying this
because I've been through it.

282
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,100
No matter how clear the evidence is,
it's useless if the company covers it up.

283
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,110
It's a fight we can never win.
We may lose, but…

284
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,360
But it's not right
to keep letting those guys win.

285
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,200
I don't care if we win or lose.
I don't want to fight anymore.

286
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,780
That's enough.

287
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,490
I'm sure Su-yeon doesn't want
her brother getting hurt either.

288
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,250
Why did you help my sister, then?

289
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,630
You didn't help her just so she could win.

290
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,090
You did it
because it was the right thing to do.

291
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,170
You're not like those cowards!

292
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,810
You're really amazing, Mi-rae.

293
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,650
On behalf of all the cowards,

294
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,400
I want to apologize to you.

295
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,200
You're a very brave person, Mi-rae.

296
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm brave?

297
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm not.

298
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,890
I don't even have the courage
to be a coward.

299
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,310
Yes.

300
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,480
It was the right thing to do.

301
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,520
But…

302
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,520
if I had known…

303
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,190
that doing the right thing
would make things this hard…

304
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,950
then I never would've done it.

305
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,250
Why did I step forward?

306
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,960
I'm nothing.

307
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,170
I should've just stayed out of it.

308
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,640
I keep thinking about it

309
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,260
and regretting it.

310
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,390
And I betray Su-yeon every night.

311
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,940
That's why…

312
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,320
with each passing day,

313
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,410
I hate myself more and more.

314
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,280
No, Director Yoon.

315
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,030
The offer is very tempting,
and I'm grateful.

316
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,870
But I still have quite a bit
to take care of here.

317
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,130
I'll decide within the week.

318
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,250
Yes, I'll contact you. Okay.

319
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,520
CALLS
DIRECTOR YOON

320
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,100
BUSINESS PARTNER

321
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,570
Where did my business partner go?

322
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,230
She left a while ago.

323
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,650
She left?

324
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,700
I told her you were looking
for your replacement,

325
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,990
and she bolted,
afraid that she'd get stuck with the farm.

326
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,580
Why did you tell her that?

327
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,120
I told you it wasn't confirmed yet.

328
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,840
The person you are trying to reach

329
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,380
has their phone turned off. Please--

330
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,800
I NEED TALK TO YOU IN PERSON

331
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,090
You said you needed to
tell me something. Why can't I reach you?

332
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,300
Did something happen?

333
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,720
BUSINESS PARTNER

334
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,560
I'll be in Seoul for a while.
I'll get in touch when I'm back.

335
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,190
She's in Seoul right now?

336
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,150
This should be good enough, right?

337
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,400
Who are you texting?

338
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,610
The strawberry farm owner
we met that time.

339
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,200
We'll be working together from now on,
so I should keep in touch with him.

340
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,540
What will you two be doing?

341
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,420
Farm work.

342
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,960
I'll be taking over
from Mi-rae once I'm back.

343
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,590
I should get going now.

344
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,180
Go where?

345
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,430
Duson-ri.

346
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,680
I should go back since Mi-rae is here now.

347
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,350
Why?
What do you mean?

348
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm done filling in for her,
so I should go and take back my place.

349
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,320
Now that you're done filling in for her,
it's no longer about whose place is where.

350
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,690
You can just stay wherever you want.

351
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,700
That is true, but…

352
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,660
I have nowhere to stay in Seoul,

353
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,580
and I can't stay at Mi-rae's
since we fought yesterday.

354
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Then stay here.

355
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,330
What?

356
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,670
If you're going back
because you have nowhere to stay,

357
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,210
then sleep here.

358
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,010
But we…

359
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,930
Can… we…

360
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,390
do…

361
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,350
that?

362
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,930
Why not?

363
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,310
Don't confuse the toothpaste
with the cleansing foam.

364
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,690
There are more towels here,
so use them.

365
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,060
Okay.

366
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,860
What? You don't want to shower?

367
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,820
Of course, I should shower.

368
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,820
I should, for the sake of hygiene.

369
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,700
I'm going to shower.

370
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,740
Okay, then.

371
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,490
Shower.

372
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,040
Thanks.

373
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,750
I'm just sleeping over.
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

374
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,920
Just think of this place as a motel.
Wait. No!

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,340
Don't do that.

376
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,880
Yes?

377
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,630
I'll leave some clothes by the door.

378
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,590
My gosh, thank you.
The service here is great!

379
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,470
Stop overreacting. Seriously.

380
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,490
Are you going somewhere?

381
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,700
What? No.

382
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,330
Are you done washing up?
Yes.

383
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,620
Should I sleep here?

384
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,750
No, you sleep in my bed.
I'll sleep here.

385
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,460
You said you have
an interview tomorrow, though.

386
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,630
You should sleep comfortably in your bed.

387
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,420
Then whoever gets sleepy first
can take the bed.

388
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Okay.

389
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,970
Your hair is still wet.

390
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,430
These are hair extensions,
so they get tangled without conditioner.

391
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,560
I'll just let it air dry.

392
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,600
That's right.
Your hair was a bit shorter before.

393
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,690
Yes.

394
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,860
May I take a look?
Sure.

395
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,910
This is so interesting.
So that's how they're attached.

396
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,330
Yes… I'm going to remove them all soon.

397
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,250
It's been a while
since I've had long hair.

398
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,420
It doesn't suit me, right?

399
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,130
You look pretty.

400
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,010
Your old hairstyle was pretty too.

401
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
It looked pretty even when it was shorter.

402
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,510
Hold on…

403
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,600
What are you thinking right now?

404
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,270
What am I thinking?

405
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,980
What do you mean?

406
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,020
Never mind.

407
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,690
Forget it. I'm sorry.

408
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,290
Why?

409
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,420
What are you thinking about?

410
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,590
What? I…

411
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,510
There's so much going through my mind
that I don't know where to begin.

412
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,840
Tell me everything.

413
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,050
Well… Am I being too clumsy?

414
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,970
Do I seem pathetic, doing this
when I've got nothing going for me?

415
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,100
I don't know how long
I'm supposed to hold my breath for.

416
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,650
And have I turned you off
and ruined the mood by saying all this?

417
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,690
Why am I even thinking
about this right now?

418
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,650
I must seriously have a problem.

419
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,410
I can't stop talking.

420
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,530
I wish I could be as relaxed as you are.

421
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,700
Mi-ji.

422
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,080
Should I tell you what I was thinking?

423
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,750
"Is she only staying

424
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,170
because I asked her to,
not because she wants to?"

425
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,220
"What's the latest we can leave
to catch the last bus to Duson-ri?"

426
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,800
"When would be the best time
to set up the bedding for her?"

427
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,760
"Should I sit on the couch or the floor?"

428
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,640
"If I wear short sleeves,

429
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,440
my scars will show,
so should I wear something on top?"

430
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,520
I put this on and took it off three times.

431
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,150
Jeez…

432
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,700
You're an idiot.

433
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,580
None of that bothers me at all.

434
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,430
You don't bother me, either.

435
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,930
No matter what you're thinking…

436
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,940
Regardless of whether
you can stop talking or not…

437
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,960
Did you see this?

438
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,460
What is this? Wow.
Is this for real?

439
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,960
If this is true, it'll be chaos.

440
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,340
It will be really disastrous.

441
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,720
Hey, Ms. Yu. Did you do it?

442
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,680
Pardon?

443
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,520
Did you upload that post
on the anonymous company forum?

444
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,360
What are you talking about?

445
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,320
Yes, sir. I just saw it.

446
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,070
Yes, sir.

447
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,290
WELCOME, MS. YU MI-RAE

SIHAN CONSTRUCTION
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

450
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,550
SIHAN CONSTRUCTION BECOMES
CONTRACTOR FOR KFMC'S NEW HQ

451
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,960
POST DELETED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR

452
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,060
How could you let an employee
post something like this on your watch?

453
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,390
I'm sorry, sir.

454
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,070
But we deleted the post right away,
and it was posted anonymously.

455
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,860
So in terms of credibility--
That's not the issue!

456
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,030
People will remember Sihan Construction,
thanks to this post!

457
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,620
What if the media catches wind of it
before we break ground on the new HQ?

458
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,500
I'll make sure that doesn't happen, sir.

459
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,210
We need to start construction
before this causes more talk.

460
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,750
How is the land acquisition going?

461
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,250
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lee.

462
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,090
You're sure that we'll be able
to buy Rosa Restaurant, right?

463
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,430
You can never guarantee anything 100%.

464
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,350
I'm doing my best to increase
our chances, so don't worry.

465
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,060
We don't have time for such…

466
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,020
I'll give you a month.

467
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,310
If we can't buy it by then,
we won't wait anymore.

468
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,030
What will you do then?

469
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,820
The company will use another law firm
for everything, not just this case.

470
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,240
You know how much our company
pays Wongeun every year, right?

471
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,120
Do you have the power to do that
as a director?

472
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,080
This isn't coming from me.

473
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,670
Our CEO ordered this.

474
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,210
I'm not threatening you right now.
I'm begging you for your help.

475
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,010
You make the impossible happen.

476
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,300
The fate of our new HQ is in your hands.

477
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,470
A month.

478
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,470
This means I need to make a risky move.

479
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,310
Will you be okay with that?

480
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,950
Why did you make that post?

481
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,820
You said you wanted no part in this,

482
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,740
so I made a move by myself.

483
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,290
So you thought making
an anonymous post was the best move?

484
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,080
It was deleted within a day.

485
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,000
Did you really think
you could fight the company like that?

486
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,760
Stop this before you get sued.

487
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,050
It has nothing to do with you.

488
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,510
It has nothing to do with me?

489
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,600
Haven't you noticed
that people think I wrote that post?

490
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,770
This is why I said I didn't want to fight.

491
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,440
People say, "We're in it together,"
but I still get blamed for everything.

492
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,190
It's not like you wrote the post yourself.

493
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,820
I'll be the one getting sued, so…

494
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
That…

495
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,530
doesn't matter to people.

496
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,870
Even if you get sued,
people will still suspect me

497
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,500
because they already think
I'm capable of doing that.

498
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,460
No one cares…

499
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,880
Sir!

500
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,300
Hey, Mi-rae. Over here.

501
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,510
No one cares about the truth.

502
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,760
Say hello.

503
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,220
This is my favorite
junior coworker from my team.

504
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,390
She's our ace.

505
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,680
Nice to meet you.

506
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,930
Nice to meet you.
Hello.

508
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,730
I was going to call a driver,

509
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,030
but I guess I was too drunk
and called you instead.

510
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,370
Why don't you hop in my car
since you're here anyway?

512
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,370
I'll just drive.

513
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,830
You?

514
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,590
I'm a good driver. I'll drive you home.

515
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,090
Okay. Let's go.

516
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,440
Sir, you should put on your seatbelt.

517
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,320
Sir?

518
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,790
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were asleep…

519
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,330
What are you doing?

520
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,170
I thought you liked me too.

521
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,960
Pardon?

522
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,550
Wait, Mi-rae. I mean, Ms. Yu.

523
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,220
Wait. Stop.

524
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,890
I…

525
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,110
I admire you as a senior coworker.
I don't see you in that way.

526
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,190
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

527
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,150
I'm drunk, so I'm not thinking straight.

528
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,990
Damn it.

529
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,530
I must've lost my mind.

530
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,370
Just hit me once.

531
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,460
Yes, you know what?

532
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,420
Just hit me until you feel better.

533
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,630
Sir, please don't do this.

534
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,750
No, I…

535
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
What…

536
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,300
What should I do for you to forgive me?

537
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,340
I'll do whatever you want.

538
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,600
Let's…

539
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,600
Let's just pretend this never happened.

540
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,480
What?

541
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,980
I said,

542
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,320
let's just pretend this never happened.

543
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,370
Are you… sure about that?

544
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,870
I don't want things to get weird
between us over this.

545
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,960
I just want us

546
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,210
to be good coworkers
like we have been until now.

547
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,550
Yes, right.

548
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,720
I understand. Let's do that.

549
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,050
Thank you. Thank you so much.

550
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Thanks.

551
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,480
Ms.…

552
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,790
Ms. Yu.

553
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,170
Thank you, but please stop doing this.

554
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,050
I don't feel comfortable.

555
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,460
Pardon?

556
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,230
Sir, what is wrong with you?

557
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,560
Why are you acting like this?

558
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,270
I want to ask you that.

559
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,860
I think I'm acting
appropriately right now.

560
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,690
If you keep acting like this…

561
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,910
then people will think I'm being weird.

562
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,280
If this is because of what happened,

563
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,330
we agreed to forget about it
and carry on as usual.

564
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,080
Ms. Yu.

565
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,580
I'm a married man.

566
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,670
People are watching us.
Please don't cross the line.

567
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,300
I'd rather not meet privately
like this anymore, either.

568
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,030
Am I your first customer today?

569
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,540
That's right. You don't serve solo diners.

570
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,540
So…

571
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,750
Did you give it some thought?

572
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,260
If you don't feel comfortable
speaking one-on-one,

573
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,720
shall I ask Ho-su to come?

574
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,050
Why have you come back?

575
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,800
I told you I have no intention of selling.

576
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,850
I wanted to give you one last chance.

577
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,680
You're going to sell it anyway.
If you do it voluntarily,

578
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,810
then everyone will be happy.

579
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,270
Are you saying
you'll take it from me if I refuse?

580
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,530
That's what thugs do.

581
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,780
I will create circumstances…

582
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,330
that will force you to sell.

583
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,420
I will uncover secrets you want to hide,

584
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,460
expose them,

585
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,090
and determine whether you have
the right to the restaurant.

586
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,970
Gosh.

587
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,970
Let's stop before it gets that far.

588
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,180
That way, you can keep protecting
the things you've always protected.

589
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,980
Things like… your secret

590
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,480
or your son
at the Seonham Mental Nursing Home.

591
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,110
How did you find out about that?

592
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,530
Who knows?

593
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,450
Maybe there are many people around you
who are helping me.

594
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,250
A guardianship?

595
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,620
Here.

596
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,710
So…

597
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,430
I'll give you until tomorrow
to think about it.

598
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,270
Why are you so nervous?
It's not a formal interview.

599
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,190
You were recommended, right?

600
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,400
I don't know. I just have a bad feeling.

601
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,110
Should I have just said no?

602
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,990
I didn't think
you had moments like this too.

603
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,450
Let me.

604
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,090
You look decent now.

605
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,260
It's more crooked now.

606
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,060
Are you going to see Ms. Ro-sa today?

607
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,690
Yes, I should.

608
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,980
I'm supposed to give her
an answer by today.

609
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,650
What did you decide to do?

610
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,190
Are you going to tell her the truth?
Yes.

611
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,110
What if she gets really mad, though?

612
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,280
What if she calls the company

613
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,910
and reports me to the police,
and I end up in jail?

614
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,700
And I--
Don't go that far.

615
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,500
Don't be so worried.
Remember what I said.

616
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,630
There must be a reason

617
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,010
why she asked you for that favor
but couldn't ask me.

618
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,800
And you're telling her the truth
because you want to help her.

619
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,140
She let the lie
I told Ji-yun slide before,

620
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,600
so since I'm doing this to help,
she'll forgive me, right?

621
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,070
Your honesty is your best weapon, Mi-ji.

622
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,740
Right.

623
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,200
How do I look?

624
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,950
You look like…

625
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,330
someone who failed the interview already.

626
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,080
Hey, stop being so scared.

627
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,460
If they don't hire you, it's their loss.

628
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,130
Even if you don't get the job,
don't cry until you see me.

629
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,340
How many times are you going to tell me
that I'm going to fail?

630
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,590
Jeez. I'm trying to cheer you up.

631
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,300
Ho-su, you've got this!

632
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,260
You can do it! Go for it!

633
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,770
Yes.

634
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,400
I'm Bae Gi-cheol. Please have a seat.

635
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,960
I'm here, ma'am.

636
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,180
I…

637
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,270
I've thought about
the guardianship you mentioned.

638
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,060
But…

639
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,440
I want to be honest with you
about something first.

640
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,700
Go ahead.

641
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
I'm…

642
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,280
not Yu Mi-rae.

643
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,330
What?

644
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm her twin.

645
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,630
Something happened,
so I was pretending to be her.

646
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,420
So what happened to the girl
who was here before?

647
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
That…

648
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,390
was me.

649
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,310
It was me all along,
from the first day I met you.

650
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,350
So?

651
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,070
Is that it?
You don't have anything else to tell me?

652
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,230
Pardon?

653
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,530
What…

654
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,650
Go.

655
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,660
Don't ever come back here again.

656
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,080
Ma'am, are you mad?

657
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,420
I just wanted to help…

658
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,590
Why help when there's nothing more
to dig up?

659
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,130
Did that lawyer tell you to do that?

660
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,010
Lawyer?

661
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,800
Which lawyer?

662
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,930
You're really gonna keep
acting clueless?

663
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,890
How would the lawyer have found out
where my son is, if it weren't for you?

664
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,980
Ma'am, it wasn't me.
I never mentioned that to anyone.

665
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,230
Then who did?

666
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,770
You're the only one I trusted
and mentioned it to.

667
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,490
Ma'am…

668
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,530
I'm such an idiot.

669
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,450
Even after going through it
all those years…

670
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,330
I had no one else to turn to,
so I trusted you…

671
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,460
You should go now.

672
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,670
Let's stop all these lies here and now.

673
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,050
Ma'am.

674
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,970
I swear I haven't lied
about anything else.

675
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,310
I meant everything I said and did
every time I saw you…

676
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,350
Ma'am.

677
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,110
I don't know you.

678
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,860
I don't even know who you are!

679
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,360
Get out right now!

680
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,400
Mi-ji, I think I did well.

681
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,900
What do you mean?
The interview.

682
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,360
I think I got the job. I'm having lunch
with the executives tomorrow.

683
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,660
Really?

684
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,950
See? I told you that you'd do well.

685
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
You're right. I was worried for nothing.

686
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,080
What about you? Did you tell her?

687
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,000
Of course, I did.

688
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,790
Really? What did she say?

689
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,840
She was very surprised,

690
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,010
but it turned out fine.

691
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,550
I'm glad.

692
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,060
We were both worried about today,
but things worked out for both of us.

693
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,640
When do you apply for guardianship?
Before you go to court--

694
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,850
Hey, that's not important right now.

695
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,690
You're employed again!

696
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,400
Let's have a party.

697
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,900
It's not even confirmed yet, though.
Let's celebrate tomorrow.

698
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,030
No, let's party today.

699
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,780
What do we need first for the party?

700
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,570
Let's buy a cake first.

701
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,620
We should get party poppers
and balloons too.

702
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,790
And party hats too.

703
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,210
I thought it was strange that she agreed
to back out of the project so easily.

704
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,840
I told you that Mi-rae
would cause problems.

705
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,680
But we don't know who made that post yet.

706
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,340
What other employee
would write a post like that?

707
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,470
We should've nipped it in the bud.

708
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,890
We put it off,
and now it's coming back to haunt us.

709
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,190
Hey.

710
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,060
Get rid of Mi-rae.

711
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,690
Pardon? But…

712
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,940
How--
You know how to handle her.

713
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,160
We've got to act now.
We don't have time to just sit around.

714
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,580
If this gets any messier…

715
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,580
won't you be in trouble too?

716
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,520
This is the evidence
I've collected until now.

717
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,770
Why are you giving this to me?
I told you that I'm staying out of this.

718
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,150
Just throw it away, then.

719
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,030
It's useless unless you use it, anyway.

720
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,420
Why do you keep running away
when you've done nothing wrong?

721
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,590
I hadn't intended
to run away from the start.

722
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,630
I actually tried to just hang in there,

723
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,720
clinging to that faint belief
that at least I was in the right.

724
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,610
Ms. Yu?

725
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,780
I used to work here.

726
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,620
You thought I wouldn't hear about
what you've been up to at the office?

727
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,120
How dare you seduce a married man!

728
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,830
Honey, what are you doing? Please stop.

729
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,710
Let go of me. You keep being too soft.

730
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,000
That's why she's not getting the message!

731
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,790
Come on. Please stop.

732
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,960
PS TEAM HOMEWRECKER GOT DRAGGED

HUMAN RESOURCES

734
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,720
We're a public corporation,
so we have a responsibility

735
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,560
to maintain professional conduct.

736
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,810
We'll let this incident slide
with a warning.

737
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,100
But please stop making--

738
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,150
Why am I getting punished
when I'm the victim?

739
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,570
For assault cases, the parties
should settle the issue among themselves.

740
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,950
For a case like this,

741
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,410
you can't claim
that you're an innocent victim…

742
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,120
What kind of case is this?

743
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,160
Pardon?

744
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,750
It wasn't an affair.

745
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,760
It was sexual harassment.

746
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm the victim.

747
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,600
Then why didn't you report it
as soon as the incident occurred?

748
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,610
At that moment,
a seed of doubt was planted inside me.

749
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,650
Did I do something wrong?

750
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,780
At the time,
I didn't want to cause any trouble.

751
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,320
We spoke to members of your team.

752
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,910
They said that even after the incident,
you kept buying him coffee.

753
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,790
After an incident like that,
it's not normal to keep buying coffee

754
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,620
for someone who harassed you, is it?

755
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,420
At the time, I thought it was best
to maintain our relationship as usual--

756
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,670
But I heard

757
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,130
that you two worked overtime together
all the time,

758
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,050
and you carpooled too.

759
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,600
People also said
that you were more friendly with him

760
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,140
than with the others.

761
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,770
Are you sure you didn't have
a personal relationship with him?

762
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,860
Did I really do nothing wrong?

763
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,400
Did I give him the wrong idea?

764
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,030
Did I really have no part
in how this all went down?

765
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,240
Jeez, don't worry.
It's nothing to worry about.

766
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,580
Just relax.

767
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,620
She's just making a fool of herself.

768
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,750
Okay?

769
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,550
Am I…

770
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,260
really the victim?

771
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,470
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE

772
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,560
I'm sorry I'm late.

773
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,480
When the onslaught of questions started…

774
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,280
I had to run away.

775
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,540
I couldn't answer a single question.

776
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,210
Because more than anyone else,

777
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,920
I was doubting myself.

778
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:29,770
CONGRATS ON GETTING A JOB

779
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,370
So what about you, Mi-ji?

780
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,250
Everything seems easy
after living as me, right?

781
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,420
I don't know you.
I don't even know who you are!

782
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,540
Ho-su.

783
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,710
Yes, Mi-ji. What is it?

784
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,920
Your hair…

785
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,800
I think I should go.

786
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,220
Go where? At this hour?

787
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,100
Duson-ri.

788
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,100
Why the rush?
Did something happen back home?

789
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,060
Nothing's happened.

790
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,980
I just don't have a reason
to stay in Seoul anymore.

791
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,150
Of course you do.

792
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,240
You need to register as a guardian and…

793
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,870
I lied.

794
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,910
I couldn't even talk to her
about the guardianship.

795
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,500
Ms. Ro-sa…

796
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,130
got very…

797
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,840
very angry.

798
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,180
It was probably because she was shocked.

799
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,820
She said she doesn't know who I am now.

800
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,400
I don't know what I was expecting.

801
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,580
It all started with a lie
in the first place.

802
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,410
This all belongs to Mi-rae.

803
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,290
It was only possible because I was Mi-rae.

804
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,670
I want to go back to where I belong.

805
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,970
I have no reason to stay here anymore.

806
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,060
Mi-ji.

807
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,150
You belong where you choose to stay.

808
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,860
We can come up with a reason together.

809
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,570
I'd love to do that, but…

810
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,870
But for some reason,
I feel like I don't belong here.

811
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,370
I feel like there's no place
for me in Seoul.

812
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,470
Then let's go.

813
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,260
Let's leave as soon as the sun comes up.

814
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,720
Get some sleep until then, okay?

815
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,220
Mi-ji.

816
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,140
What are you doing?
Why aren't you going in?

817
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,600
Is the gate locked?

818
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,520
No, I just…

819
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,770
Are you okay?

820
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,900
Did you fight with your mom?

821
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,490
Gosh, I'm no match for her.
I can't even put up a fight.

822
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,910
I was just staring at the gate,

823
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,370
wondering if it's always looked
this worn-out.

824
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:55,950
Oh, that? If you repaint it,
it will look brand new in no time.

825
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:04,250
I guess I should repaint it sometime.
I'm going to keep living here anyway.

826
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,710
Well, have a good day.

827
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,220
Okay, see you.

828
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,340
Bye.

829
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,730
Mom, I'm home.

830
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,940
You're back early.
I thought you'd stay longer.

831
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,690
No, I just came back.

832
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,070
Mi-rae is at work anyway,
so what would I do by myself in Seoul?

833
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,950
Wow, there were so many people
that everything felt chaotic.

834
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,490
Why? Did something happen?

835
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,330
No, what would happen to me?

836
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,590
Did you go somewhere?

837
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:00,890
Seoul.

838
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm feeling a little carsick
because I've not taken the bus in so long.

839
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,860
Mom, I'm going to go sleep.
Don't wake me up.

840
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,570
STRAWBERRY FARM

841
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:06,710
I'm sorry. I was in Seoul.
What should I start with?

842
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,340
I guess Mi-rae left?

843
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,510
Can I work instead of her?

844
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,730
Of course, you can. I hired you
because of your resume, Ms. Seoul.

845
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,520
My name is Mi-ji.

846
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,070
Mi-ji.

847
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,660
Mi-ji. The name's finally
starting to stick.

848
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,240
Let's go, Mi-ji.

849
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,450
Okay.

850
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,250
Ok-hui.

851
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,380
I heard you got hurt. Are you okay?

852
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,970
Did the kids switch places?

853
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,140
What?

854
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,810
Was Mi-ji actually Mi-rae this whole time?

855
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,220
Did you know about it?

856
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,560
You did.
Ok-hui.

857
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,110
Jeez, forget it. Whatever.

858
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,440
Ok-hui.

859
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,150
Don't…

860
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,610
Don't scold the kids too much.

861
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,030
Mom.

862
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,490
What do you all take me for?

863
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,460
Ok-hui…

864
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,550
Ok-hui…

865
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,770
I guess Mi-rae

866
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,190
has decided what to do,
considering she's back in Seoul.

867
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,480
I don't know. That's her business.

868
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,020
She doesn't tell me every single detail.

869
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,740
How does it feel to be back?

870
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,660
Crappy.

871
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,160
Then why did you return?
You could've just stayed in Seoul.

872
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,700
Because I felt even crappier
staying there.

873
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:07,830
I didn't do anything wrong,

874
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,500
but I felt uneasy for some reason.
I felt like I needed to come back.

875
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,300
I guess I'm just destined
to just live here forever.

876
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,800
Don't you feel a little like this?

877
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,090
Like a runaway teenager
bouncing around friends' places.

878
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,760
I know that feeling too.

879
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,850
I don't think you have any idea.

880
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,480
You studied abroad and lived in Seoul.

881
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,110
It doesn't matter
if it's the States or Seoul.

882
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,360
Anyone who's away from a place
they care about feels that way.

883
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,740
Do you still feel that way?

884
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,610
Not anymore.

885
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,080
The reason I cared
about the place is gone now.

886
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,450
Don't get the wrong idea.
I mean my grandfather, not Mi-rae.

887
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,790
I think this is a matter of the heart,
not destiny.

888
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,750
That's why I don't open up
to people very easily.

889
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,090
Because I might feel like
I've run away again.

890
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,050
A&A has been focusing

891
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:08,770
on barrier-free access
for the past few years.

892
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,600
And we're continuing to make improvements
to the office building.

893
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,400
Among major law firms,
we're also the most actively involved

894
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,230
in public interest cases.

895
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:21,530
You seem like the perfect person

896
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,570
to represent our company's goals, Mr. Lee.

897
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,620
Me?

898
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,290
Gosh, you two need to stop already.

899
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,080
I told them why you ended up
leaving Wongeun,

900
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,250
and I guess they were very impressed.

901
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,960
Of course we were.

902
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,470
You defied orders
and left Wongeun of all places

903
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:45,050
to protect the weaker party
and not the client. My gosh.

904
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,140
It's just like a movie.

905
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,560
Oh, that's--

906
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,100
Plus, I heard the senior lawyer
you clashed with was Mr. Lee Chung-gu.

907
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,980
I've heard so many rumors about him.

908
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,480
What's he actually like?

909
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:01,030
I tend to be a bit oblivious
when it comes to rumors--

910
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:05,320
He's famous for handling sensitive cases
while using his disability as a shield.

911
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:08,330
How can he be so cruel to the weak
when he's vulnerable too?

912
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,410
It's worse because
he actually knows what it's like.

913
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:13,540
He makes us look good in comparison,
so it works for us.

914
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,040
A senior and a junior lawyer,
both with disabilities,

915
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,050
making completely opposite choices.

916
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,260
It's a great story.

917
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:26,640
Sir.

918
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,520
Mr. Lee isn't like that.

919
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,230
He may use cheap methods sometimes,

920
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,980
but he doesn't use
his disability as a shield.

921
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,940
He's not like that.

922
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,400
What those two were saying earlier--
And…

923
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,120
I'm not like that, either.

924
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,580
I didn't step up to protect the weak.

925
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,870
I just couldn't ignore
a client's wrongdoing, so if anything,

926
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,750
I'm not fit to be a lawyer.

927
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,210
Justice, disability…

928
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,930
If you're looking for someone
to represent things like that,

929
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,430
then I don't think
I'm the right person for the job.

930
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,020
Then, uh,

931
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,360
if you don't represent things
like the vulnerable or justice,

932
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,240
what do you think you represent?

933
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,490
I don't think
I've ever really thought about that.

934
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,000
Then think about it,

935
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,830
and if you want to work for us, call me.

936
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,800
Come to think of it, it seems like
we were the ones being interviewed.

937
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:45,630
I should get going.

938
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,100
I'm back.

939
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,270
Mom, what are you doing here?

940
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,780
Come here. We need to talk.

941
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:09,030
I'm tired from work. Let's talk later.

942
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,070
Mi-ji.

943
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,240
Are you going to keep treating me
like an idiot?

944
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,580
I know you switched places with Mi-rae.

945
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,830
Were you ever going to tell me?

946
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,710
How could you be so brazen?

947
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,130
What were you thinking,
doing something like that?

948
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,130
It's nothing serious.
We just switched places briefly for fun.

949
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,300
For fun?

950
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,930
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

951
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,600
Why did you switch places?

952
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,020
Did something happen to Mi-rae?

953
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,560
Nothing happened to Mi-rae.

954
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,520
And I didn't ruin her life. Happy now?

955
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,520
Mi-rae is not the type
to go along with your plans

956
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,280
when everything is okay.

957
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,240
What happened?
Jeez, it's all over now!

958
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,200
You couldn't even tell us apart,
so why make such a big deal about it now?

959
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,540
What did you say?

960
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,620
Just because I can't tell you two apart,
it's okay to treat me like an idiot?

961
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,590
Do you even consider me family?

962
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:07,170
Your bedridden grandma knew about this,
so why didn't I?

963
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,340
Do you two even see me as your mom?

964
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,470
So what about you?
Do you see me as your daughter?

965
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,010
What?

966
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,140
You're always going on and on
about Mi-rae.

967
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,060
I'm your daughter too.

968
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,890
Why don't you ask if I'm okay?

969
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,360
You were nice to me at the hospital,
thinking I was Mi-rae.

970
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,400
Do you hate me now that you know it's me?

971
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,730
What in the world are you talking about?

972
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,440
You two are both my daughters--

973
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,150
We're not the same to you!

974
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,280
You can't even tell us apart.

975
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,580
What's so different
between me and Mi-rae?

976
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,950
I don't even expect to be treated
the same way.

977
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,710
Why can't you just look at me once
for a change?

978
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:43,370
Hey.

979
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,420
Do you think my mom was interested in me
when I was growing up?

980
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,380
This is all I learned growing up,
so what do you expect me to do?

981
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,760
How am I supposed to be a good mom?

982
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,260
I just can't figure it out,
so why don't you tell me?

983
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,060
You're a daughter too.

984
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,480
You may not know how to be a good mom,

985
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,730
but you must understand how I feel.

986
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:08,110
You kept waiting for Grandma
to notice you too.

987
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,400
What do you want me to do?

988
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,780
Should I stare at you all day?
Is that what you want?

989
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,320
Forget it. I can't talk to you
about anything.

990
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,780
Hey, what do you mean by that?

991
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:23,160
I'm asking because I don't know.
I'll do what you want me to do.

992
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,040
I said, forget it!

993
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,340
This is why I didn't want
to come back here.

994
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,670
Then you should've stayed in Seoul!
Why did you come back?

995
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,550
Because you're here by yourself.

996
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,850
If I leave, then you'll be left all alone
and you'll have to care for Grandma alone.

997
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,270
Hey.

998
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,980
Why would you worry about that?

999
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,940
I don't know. Jeez.
It's not like we have a good relationship…

1000
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,940
I'm annoyed too.

1001
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,820
I want to live freely too,
without thinking about things like that.

1002
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,780
But I can't help it, so I have no choice.

1003
01:05:55,860 --> 01:06:00,080
Mi-ji, no one ever asked you
to worry about those things.

1004
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,660
I may not seem like a mom to you,

1005
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,670
but why would you worry
about things like that?

1006
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:07,880
Then who will?

1007
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,750
Who else would worry about that
besides me?

1008
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,220
I might suck at everything else,

1009
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,430
but being here is something I can do.

1010
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,510
Of course you can do other things.

1011
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:22,350
I told you countless times that
you're capable of everything and anything.

1012
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:28,020
Why do you keep trying to live like me?

1013
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,110
Why do you keep making me
a poor excuse for a mom?

1014
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,360
Why are you crying?

1015
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:41,240
You should go.

1016
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,950
Go wherever you want
and do whatever you want.

1017
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:49,000
I'll stay here,
so you should leave, Mi-ji.

1018
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,210
Why would you worry about those things

1019
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:54,090
and break my heart like this?

1020
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,760
Don't cry.

1021
01:06:56,670 --> 01:07:00,680
Mom, I'm sorry. Please stop crying.

1022
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,640
I'm sorry.

1023
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,600
Mom.
Hurry up and go.

1024
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,140
I told you to go.

1025
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:14,190
Go wherever you want.
Don't worry about things here and just go.

1026
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,040
What is it this time?

1027
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,000
How many times do I--
Do you want to go see my sister?

1028
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,420
Right now.

1029
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,060
Are we…

1030
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,060
really going to go see Su-yeon right now?

1031
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,940
There's something
I didn't tell you earlier.

1032
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:57,190
You probably won't be able
to see my sister.

1033
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,320
Pardon?

1034
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,660
She's in her room.

1035
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,200
It's been about half a year
since she last left it.

1036
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,330
But she'll probably hear everything
you say if you talk outside her door.

1037
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,180
Su-yeon.

1038
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,300
Ms. Yu is here.

1039
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,970
I'll let you two talk.

1040
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,700
Su-yeon, it's me.

1041
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,660
Mi-rae.

1042
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,870
You came early.

1043
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,500
It's your first day of work.

1044
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,590
I'm Kim Su-yeon.

1045
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:01,920
Why are you here like this?

1046
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:06,260
You left, so you should've forgotten
about everything and moved on.

1047
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,350
Is it because you resent what happened?

1048
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,230
I came to tell you
that I can't help you this time.

1049
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,820
You know how it is.

1050
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,240
This is a fight we'll never win.

1051
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:26,620
To be honest, I don't even know
why I need to fight.

1052
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,330
I can barely take care of myself,

1053
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,500
so I'm not interested in punishing anyone.

1054
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,790
I'm scared and tired.

1055
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,500
You left because
you were scared and tired too.

1056
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,880
I get it, so…

1057
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,890
So please try to understand me
just this once.

1058
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,810
Your brother worked very hard.

1059
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,150
But I'm ruining everything.

1060
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,610
I'm sorry.

1061
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,410
No.

1062
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,750
Su-yeon?

1063
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,960
I'm the one who ruined everything.

1064
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:23,800
I'm so sorry, Mi-rae.

1065
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,090
Why…

1066
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,300
are you apologizing?

1067
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,970
I ran away by myself…

1068
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,480
even though I knew
how hard things would be for you.

1069
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,770
I'm just as bad as those people.

1070
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:45,990
That's why I'm so ashamed,

1071
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,660
and I'm sorry.

1072
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,280
But why are you sorry?

1073
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,330
Why are you apologizing?

1074
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:56,250
The people who should feel sorry
aren't even apologizing.

1075
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:58,170
No.

1076
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,630
It was my fault.

1077
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,210
What was your fault?

1078
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,670
You're a victim.

1079
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,220
You did the right thing,
so why are you here like this?

1080
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,760
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you here like this?

1081
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,540
You're back late.

1082
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,260
I thought you might have moved,

1083
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,720
but I guess you still live here.

1084
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:57,100
Why have you come all this way to see me?

1085
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,230
You kept avoiding me, so I had no choice.

1086
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,070
Can you spare me a few minutes?

1087
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:08,690
Say what you need to here.

1088
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm sorry, but please move
to the Childal branch for a bit.

1089
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,000
The Childal branch? Why should I?

1090
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,420
What do you mean why?

1091
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,460
You pulled out of the new HQ project
without any warning.

1092
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,340
It's a high-profile project,

1093
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,640
so I guess the higher-ups
can't just let this slide.

1094
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,850
What are you talking about?
You said you'd take care of it.

1095
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,600
You said if I backed out of the project,

1096
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,810
you'd make sure I wouldn't be penalized.

1097
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,850
You told me this yourself.

1098
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,190
But if you're not backing out…

1099
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,940
PROMISED NO REPERCUSSIONS
REFER TO RECORDING

1100
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,400
…because you're worried
about the repercussions,

1101
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,030
then I can take care of that for you.

1102
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:56,280
That was before the post was made.

1103
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,700
You acted like you were going
to let this go quietly.

1104
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,500
Why did you make a post like that?

1105
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,250
I didn't upload that post.

1106
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,960
Ms. Yu. Do you expect me to believe that?

1107
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:12,590
Even if you didn't write it,
the higher-ups already think you did.

1108
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:16,720
And honestly, the company was ready
to take legal action,

1109
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,640
but I talked them out of it,
on the condition that you go to Childal.

1110
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,520
I'm not the reason
the company can't take legal action.

1111
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,610
You didn't learn
from what happened to Su-yeon.

1112
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,860
Don't pick a fight you can't win.
You're only going to get hurt.

1113
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,700
Move to the Childal branch for now.

1114
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,370
I'll help you come back
once things quiet down.

1115
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,660
By that time, I'll be a team leader.

1116
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,160
And I'll have the power
to transfer you back to HQ.

1117
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,500
This is just like last time.

1118
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,460
What?

1119
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,170
The day you tried to kiss me,

1120
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,590
you got down on your knees and begged me
to forgive you when we were alone.

1121
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,260
Then you suddenly acted like
you were the victim in front of others.

1122
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,060
Do you really think
I'll fall for the same trick twice?

1123
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,560
Let go! Let go of it!

1124
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,520
Let go! Give me that!

1125
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,980
DON'T SAVE

1126
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,990
Hey!

1127
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,150
Damn it.

1128
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,660
Mi-rae, why are you so naive?

1129
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,910
Let go! Give me that!

1130
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,740
Damn it.

1131
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:25,750
You can do this crap all you want,
but no one will believe you.

1132
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,790
This isn't like some kind
of truth-telling game.

1133
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,090
It's basically a battle of reputations.

1134
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,210
Let go!
You still don't get it?

1135
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:37,880
No matter what you try to do,
no one is on your side.

1136
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:42,720
No matter what I do, you'll end up
getting blamed for everything.

1137
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,650
No, I did nothing wrong.

1138
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,730
Damn it.

1139
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,690
Hey!

1140
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,400
You jerk!

1141
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,900
Darn it.

1142
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:59,950
You bastard! Because of you, I…

1143
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,240
Mi-ji! Hey, Mi-ji!
Because of you, Mi-rae…

1144
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:04,790
You jerk!

1145
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,660
Damn it.

1146
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,710
Hey, are you okay? Wait.

1147
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,590
Why, you little!
Hey…

1148
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,250
Hey, hit him a little more.

1149
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,760
You really…

1150
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,760
No one's coming.

1151
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,090
PEOPLE'S POLICE

1152
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:25,970
Hey, Ho-su.

1153
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,900
I'm the perpetrator's lawyer.
Is it okay if I sit in?

1154
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,360
Does having a lawyer show up
change the fact that you assaulted me?

1155
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,230
I refuse to settle.

1156
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,320
Mr. Park Sang-yeong was previously accused

1157
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,280
of sexual harassment against
Ms. Yu Mi-rae within their company.

1158
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,410
That same individual came to her house,
grabbed her wrist, and threatened her.

1159
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,660
So shouldn't this
be considered a rescue instead?

1160
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:48,960
Hey, look.

1161
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,130
I believe Ms. Yu Mi-ji's action
was a lawful and justified act.

1162
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,550
Is it true that you were accused?

1163
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,560
No, that was just a false accusation.

1164
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,890
She accused an innocent person
of sexual harassment,

1165
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,900
but she couldn't even follow through
and dropped it midway.

1166
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,900
Is that true?

1167
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,980
This time, I won't drop the charges.

1168
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:22,070
I want to press charges against Mr. Park
for sexual harassment and defamation.

1169
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,450
The void left behind by my self-doubt

1170
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,870
began to fill with courage.

1171
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,840
Why does it feel
like I've run away from home again?

1172
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:53,310
With that courage,
I take a heavy step forward…

1173
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,560
SEOUL

1174
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:57,230
…into a fear I've already faced,

1175
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,530
one I know all too well.

1176
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,650
1 HOUR 58 MINUTES
119 KM

1177
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:09,700
Yes, ma'am. Did you decide what to do?

1178
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:15,790
No matter what future awaits us
at the end of the fight…

1179
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,290
I have no intention of selling.

1180
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,510
So that's what you decided to do.

1181
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:25,180
Okay, I understand.
Well, we'll meet again somewhere else.

1182
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,480
Yes, Reporter Im.

1183
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,650
I'm going to send an email right now.

1184
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,860
It's a bit urgent,
so release an article tomorrow.

1185
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,660
THE WOMAN WHO STOLE HER FRIEND'S LIFE

1186
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,120
Thank you for always helping me out.

1187
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:52,910
Yes.

1188
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,500

YU MI-RAE

1192
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,950
I'll do it my way, at my own pace.

1193
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,250
I don't want to lose a fight
I already lost once.

1194
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:36,580
Did she just scoff?

1195
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,920
The restaurant,
assets, and her only son.

1196
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
They should all go back
to the rightful owner.

1197
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,300
Are you in there?

1198
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,170
It's a violation of privacy, and illegal.

1199
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,170
It's not the time
to worry about legal stuff.

1200
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,890
Not everyone can ask for help.

1201
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,010
I finally found you.

1202
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,430
Se-jin?

1203
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:54,890
So this is your usual look.

1204
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:57,730
Let's go. We don't have much time.

1205
