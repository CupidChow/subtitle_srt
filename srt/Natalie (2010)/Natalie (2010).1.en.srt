Natali

8
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,460
Oh, is that you, Ma'am?

9
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,310
Yes, it is.

10
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,210
- I'II Iet you know.
- Yes, give me a call.

11
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,510
- Have a safe trip.
- Yes.

12
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,020
- Mr. Han.
- Congratulations.

13
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,040
Thank you. PIease be kind on the review.
Mr Han, Get home safely.

14
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,860
It was unbelievably successful.

15
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,560
Everything is sold.
AII of them except Natali.

16
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,890
You were fabulous today.

17
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,700
Oh, and that guy called again.

18
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,110
He said he was in your class
in college. CIass of '97, he said.

19
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,570
I told him that if he wanted to see you
so much, he should just come by sometime.

20
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,470
- Should I tell him not to come?
- No, Iet him.

21
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,190
Are you going to sell Natali?

22
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,410
The journalists are wondering
who Natali's real model is.

23
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,330
Hello. My name is Jang Min Woo.

24
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,140
Hello.

25
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,840
I'm here to see professor Hwang.
Is he here?

26
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,150
What is it about?

27
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,460
Hum. I think I have told you that
I would Iike to purchase Natali.

28
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,470
I'm sorryto say, but I don't
think that will happen.

29
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,880
Why not?

30
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,790
Why do you want her so badly?

31
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,800
- Because I also have a secret my own.
- What secret?

32
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,430
The exhibition is over.

33
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,740
- Professor Hwang Jun-hyuk?
- Yes, I am.

34
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,250
Hello. I'm Jang Min-woo.

35
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,260
I was moved by your work. Wait, wait.

36
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,970
Would you Iet me write
a review on your work?

37
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,780
You want to write about my work?

38
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,080
I don't even know you.

39
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,100
No, wait. Professor,

40
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:42,500
I was one of your students.
In art school, class of '97

41
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,930
Natali.

42
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,340
I would Iike to hear
more about Natali.

43
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,010
Don't you dare touch it.

44
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,540
What do you want to
hear about Natali?

45
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,150
I can feel her spirit.

46
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,960
It's as if she's alive.

47
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,770
And it seems she
is waiting for someone.

48
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,580
Who the hell are you?

49
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,400
Tell me about her.

50
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,900
The real person.
Who is the real Natali?

51
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,010
Are you asking the difference
between reality and art?

52
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,920
I'm asking about the real
model of Natali.

53
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:21,530
Hey, this work of art and the model
have nothing in common.

54
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,240
Are you saying that Natali
was created on its own?

55
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,950
I am not sure if you have
a theme of this review.

56
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,860
My theme is on Natali.

57
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,480
Just have some tea.

58
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,090
Here.

59
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,810
Don't even dream about
writing about my work.

60
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:09,060
We actually don't need permission
from anyone to write art reviews.

61
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,880
Jang Min-woo, or Jung Min-woo.
Whatever your name is.

62
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,790
My name is Jang Min-woo.

63
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,010
Mr. Jang, you put down of other
people's work to make a Iiving.

64
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,910
So, you want me to give you
something to gossip about?

65
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,340
People Iike you don't deserve
to exist in this world.

66
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,560
Stop threatening other people,
and do something more creative.

67
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,870
I agree on that, but

68
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,810
who will write about your great
work of creation then?

69
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,520
If it wasn't for me, those rocks...

70
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,030
Did you just say rocks?

71
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,840
No, I meant your work

72
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,850
would be valued simply by
its weight but nothing else.

73
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,990
Don't be surprised. This is just
a piece of rock, just Iike you said.

74
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,710
In your eyes, what does it Iook Iike?
A turtle or an elephant?

75
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,230
Do you know the difference between
a sculptor and a stonecutter?

76
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,680
If he thinks as he cuts,
he's a sculptor.

77
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,080
On the other side, a stonemaker
cut for work and not for art.

78
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:18,100
What about the one who made Inscriptions
on your ancestor's headstones?

79
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,800
Is he a sculptor or a stonecutter?

80
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,800
Well.

81
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,420
Do you think you know what art is?

82
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,210
Can you Iook at
the nature of objects?

83
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,830
No.

84
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,940
But Professor, I don't think you can
see the nature of women either.

85
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,860
Ah. Are we talking
about curator Park?

86
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,670
What? Did she criticize me?

87
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,970
Are you afraid of other
people's criticism?

88
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,420
No. Whatever she says
is not important to me.

89
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,120
Why is that?

90
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,630
Because she is in Iove with me.

91
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,730
Well.

92
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,950
What do you know about
me and curator Park?

93
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,770
Well, if she Ioved you, she wouldn't
call you such as a sex fiend.

94
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,980
Young man.
One poet once said that

95
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,690
Iove is a bitch.

96
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,310
Do you want to sleep with her?

97
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,700
The world consists of two parts:
men and women.

98
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,210
It's Iike yin and yang, so to speak.

99
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,220
She Ioved my work at first, then
she got attached physically but.

100
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,030
I just know once having
her in my bed.

101
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,140
She's just a bit angry at me
because she can't have me.

102
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,940
She knows there's another
woman in my heart.

103
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,550
A well known, but madly
ill-mannered sculptor

104
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,370
and a curator who needs his work.

105
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,370
She could have been
faking an orgasm.

106
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,180
Yeah?

107
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,090
Anyways, she forgets
while we have sex.

108
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,920
When the sex is over,
she is angry again.

109
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,400
Do you have sex
with only one woman?

110
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,000
Talk to me.

111
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,510
I'm curious about you.

112
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,530
Are you married?

113
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,650
You must be married.
You must Iove your wife very much.

114
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,060
How would you know all that?

115
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,860
You wouldn't even cheat.
You don't Iook Iike the type.

116
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,860
Stop it. Do you think I am an idiot?

117
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,870
No. You Iook too serious.

118
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,980
In fact, disgustingly sincere.

119
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,700
Not all men have to

120
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,400
fool around Iike you do.

121
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,150
Come on! That's a given
in this country.

122
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,560
Motels outnumber churches
in this country.

123
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,270
Do you know how the motel
owners make a Iiving?

124
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,680
Yes, honey.

125
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,080
I'm at the office.

126
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:40,410
Huh? It's just a headache.

127
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,920
Gotta go for a meeting.
Talk to you Iater.

128
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,630
A married woman sends her husband
to work in the morning as usual.

129
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,540
Have you ever had sex with a woman
at 11AM overlooking the river?

130
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,950
Do you believe in monogamy?

131
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,890
What you see isn't all truth.

132
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,400
It's becoming a world of polygamy.

133
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,300
Adultery is simply
a word from the past.

134
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,740
Is your wife at home as she says?

135
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,250
Or is she with another man in a bed?
Don't you want to know the truth?

136
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,960
PIease, don't apply your experience
to everyone else's.

137
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,280
There are many people in this world
who Iive with Iove and truth.

138
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,320
Why was it that a King had 3000
concubines in his palace back then?

139
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,530
Do you want to be a king?

140
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,150
I'm just a sculptor.

141
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,450
Ten years ago,
after your Iast exhibition.

142
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,970
Didn't you say that you won't create
or release any more work?

143
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,270
I did say that.

144
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,170
What made you change your mind?

145
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,690
I don't ask you to understand
a fickle minded artist.

146
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,300
What is the reason that
you released to the press

147
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,010
your ten year old work, Natali?

148
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,520
It's the gallery's marketing planning.
That's what they do.

149
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,030
I know someone who'd Iike to
purchase Natali at the highest price.

150
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,340
- I'm just not.
- And why is that?

151
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,680
Just don't want to.

152
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
I'II buy it.

153
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,410
I doubt you can afford it.

154
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,520
Yes, I know very well.
Kan Yakumari was $10,000.

155
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,230
149 Sitalie was $20,000.
Kali was $30,000.

156
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,240
Gauri, the goddess that nurtures
all Iands was priced at $50,000.

157
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,250
Oh, that's impressive.

158
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,460
You're smarter than Curator Park.

159
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,270
So, how much are you
going to sell Natalie for?

160
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,570
I'm afraid this is not a grocery market
where you can buy anything.

161
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,080
Of course not, I value
your work. I will pay.

162
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,990
- Can you afford it?
- Yes. I have enough.

163
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,690
I don't think you have earned
enough yet at your age.

164
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,930
Did you inherit a Iot?

165
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,840
Just give me the price.

166
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,860
It's impossible to
estimate its value.

167
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,280
And your other work can?

168
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,980
In that sense,
I feel bad for them.

169
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,090
Anyway, I won't sell Natali.

170
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,000
There's a special
story behind Natali.

171
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,710
OK, then.

172
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:48,930
It really is hard dealing
with a stubborn artist.

173
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,320
Thank you for taking your time.

174
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,440
You!

175
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,590
Why are you so obsessed
with Natali, anyway?

176
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,300
You didn't come in here
for an art review, did you?

177
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,030
Do you know Natali?

178
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,050
Tell me! Do you know
who Natali is? Huh?

179
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,060
Before I answer this,

180
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,170
tell me who you think Natali is.

181
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,890
I'II tell you who Natali is.

182
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:05,350
Natali is me.
It's me, Hyo-rim Park.

183
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,360
Curator Park,

184
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,770
do you really think that it is you?

185
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,380
You can never be Natali.

186
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,390
Then,

187
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,700
you played with me to
make this piece of metal?

188
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,420
You son of a bitch.

189
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,500
What you're holding
is the woman I Iove.

190
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,900
I wanted to create the most
beautiful woman in the world.

191
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,500
I'II get ready.

192
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,550
Curator Park was also
part of my inspiration.

193
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,470
But nothing or nobody
could truly help me.

194
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,700
They were all just useless
and obvious imitations.

195
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,120
Days turned into months.
I simply couldn't do anything.

196
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,440
Stunning body movements
mixed with mortal seduction.

197
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,350
Right after that moment,
she invaded my Iife completely.

198
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,660
Until now, in various art works,
sculptures and construction projects,

199
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,760
have been used in various ways.

200
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,970
Even the Egyptian pyramids

201
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,480
were built using this
golden proportion.

202
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,890
Especially symbols and figures.

203
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:45,110
She excited me to recreate
her through my hands.

204
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,730
'Art and our desire towards it'

205
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,130
Because human beings
can't exist forever,

206
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,840
we Iive with the dilemma
we dream of eternity.

207
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,690
So we desire to capture
the beauty at the peak of it.

208
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,100
We always desire to
be more beautiful.

209
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,300
I believe that every art
piece begins from this.

210
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,810
Do you understand?

211
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,120
- OK, that's all.
- Thank you.

212
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,030
- You have a nice vacation too.
- Professor, please get married this year.

213
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,050
- Professor?
- Yes?

214
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,460
Would you sign this to celebrate
the end of the semester?

215
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,170
Autograph? Sure.

216
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,780
- What's your name?
- Don't you know my name?

217
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,580
Pardon?

218
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,590
- It's Mi-ran. Oh Mi-ran.
- AIright, Mi-ran.

219
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,200
What should I write for you?

220
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,740
I want you.

221
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,350
What?

222
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,760
Write, "I want you."

223
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,360
OK, then.

224
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,800
I want to be your model.

225
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,910
That's ridiculous.

226
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,630
You're telling me that
she seduced you first?

227
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,430
Yes, it was seduction.

228
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,340
A seduction nobody could refuse.

229
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,150
The Mi-ran I know
is not that type of girl.

230
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,300
I decided to be bold
with her seduction.

231
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,550
If you're ready,
shall we get started?

232
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,260
Yes.

233
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,670
You don't have to
take off the skirt.

234
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,490
Would you go up
there and sit down?

235
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,220
Wait.

236
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,110
Try to be steady.

237
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,450
Just relax.

238
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,180
Hold on a second.

239
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,490
The more we did
the bolder she became.

240
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:23,910
That's how our Iove started becoming
stronger than anyone else's in this world.

241
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,130
She made me excited
over and over.

242
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,340
We made Iove again and again.

243
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,340
We didn't want to stop,

244
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,950
I could have died with her.
When I made Iove to her.

245
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,870
Don't Iie to me.

246
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,890
Stop interrupting.

247
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,100
That makes no sense at all!

248
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,410
Every moment with her
is still vivid to me.

249
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,610
PIease.

250
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,920
Why did you break up
with her then?

251
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,720
Why didn't you just marry her?

252
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,940
We didn't break up.

253
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,350
We swore that we would
Iove each other forever.

254
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,600
We truly wanted our
Iove to be eternal.

255
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,320
If you Iove someone, do you
have to marry that person?

256
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,540
You're making all this up.

257
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,360
The Mi-ran I know isn't
some easy woman!

258
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,880
To me, she's pure and mysterious,
as if she came from a mythical tale.

259
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,100
She's a creation who Iooks as
if she jumped out of a painting.

260
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,050
Human beings will have to
face death eventually.

261
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,660
we Iive with the dilemma
that we dream of eternity.

262
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,270
So we desire to capture
the beauty at the peak of it.

263
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:44,190
We always desire to
be more beautiful.

264
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:52,110
Every art piece begins from this.

265
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,920
That's all for this semester.

266
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,230
Good work everyone.

267
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,680
Hey, excuse me!

268
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,780
- Excuse me!
- Me?

269
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:24,300
- You're in a dance major, right?
- Yes, what's up?

270
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,210
I saw you dancing before.

271
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,620
Okay.

272
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,030
I want to draw you dancing.

273
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,540
Why would you want to draw me?

274
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,350
Because you're special.

275
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,150
Special?

276
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,660
That sounds nice. Wait.

277
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,860
- Professor.
- Yes?

278
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,880
Would you sign this to celebrate
the end of the semester?

279
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,670
Sure.

280
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,920
What's your name?
Mi-ran. Oh Mi-ran, right?

281
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,940
Yes.

282
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,050
- Here.
- Thank you.

283
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,760
"I want you."

284
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,870
Can we talk? Just for a minute.

285
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,080
I was just wondering
if you'd be my model.

286
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,290
- It's nothing too difficult.
- Could you hold on a second?

287
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,190
It won't take too Iong.

288
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,120
You took her away
in the dirtiest way.

289
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,390
You put her in the corner
with a dirty trick.

290
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:55,880
You destroyed her with this
disgusting excuse you call 'art'.

291
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,480
Why don't you just
write a novel? Huh?

292
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,890
You are distorting the past

293
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,230
in order to beautify your work.

294
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:13,140
I think you are the one who is
twisted out of the memories.

295
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,150
That's not true.

296
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,460
Well, I can relate to you.

297
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,370
You Ioved Mi-ran but
couldn't have her all.

298
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:33,080
The jealousy towards me
with the desire for her.

299
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,290
Your memories could
be completely twisted.

300
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,410
You can say whatever you want.

301
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,810
But you can't avoid the fact.

302
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,730
So you fooled her completely

303
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,230
for your own good.

304
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,430
Shut up!

305
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,850
If you Ioved her to the death,
how could you Ieave her?

306
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,480
I said I didn't Ieave her!

307
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,200
Was she too much to handle
since she was too young?

308
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,710
Or you slept with

309
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,220
a young student impulsively.

310
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,130
But felt sorryfor her suddenly?

311
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:13,860
Professor.

312
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,370
Did you do well on your exam?

313
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,380
- Yes.
- Hello, Professor

314
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,780
- Just a minute.
- I missed you.

315
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,180
Should we go get
something to eat?

316
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,090
I was worried didn't
get the Ietters yet.

317
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,800
- When did you Ieave it there?
- About a week ago.

318
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,810
Why aren't you saying
anything else?

319
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,820
You agree with me, don't you?

320
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,630
I won't deny what you're saying.

321
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,850
But that wasn't the problem.

322
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:05,660
Age wasn't a problem
for us either.

323
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,540
As time went by, we only
sought physical pleasure.

324
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,460
Professor,

325
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,170
aren't you getting married?

326
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,650
A son and a daughter.
They Iook happy.

327
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,860
Why do you think people get
married and have babies?

328
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,880
That's because a man has met
an overly determined woman.

329
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,080
When a man marries,

330
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,780
it's because he's met the most cruel
and spiteful woman on earth.

331
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,700
No way,

332
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,400
then is your mother one of them?

333
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,680
How about we just Iive together?

334
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,100
We don't need marriage.

335
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,410
I don't want to crawl
into a grave of Iove

336
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,120
because of traditions
and any convenience.

337
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,140
Well, Mi-ran, it may not be easy
for you to understand now.

338
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,960
The Iust for a woman
reborn through my work,

339
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,260
I naturally fall in Iove
with the woman.

340
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,780
But on the other hand, I couldn't see
the passion in my work.

341
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,980
It started to diminish.

342
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,990
I got addicted to her continuously

343
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:34,000
and so did she.

344
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:14,010
How's Natali?

345
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:46,780
Ten years Iater, I would
compare myself to Natali.

346
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:21,890
She promised me

347
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,100
she would come back
ten years Iater and Ieft me.

348
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:45,440
I blamed myself for not being
able to hold her back.

349
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:10,480
So, you ended up Ieaving Mi-ran.

350
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:19,900
Are you expecting her to appear
today Iooking Iike an angel?

351
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,920
Then, why isn't she here?

352
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,820
Your Iove just Iingers
in your fantasy.

353
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,940
You are irresponsible immature person
who can't break into reality.

354
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,540
Mi-ran might have forgotten you.

355
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,560
Love might just end before
it reaches a decade.

356
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,270
Don't interpret it for
your own convenience.

357
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:56,580
You.

358
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:08,240
Why are you still obsessed with
your one-sided Iove from the past?

359
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,850
I probably think I was the only hope

360
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,360
for miserable Mi-ran after you Ieft her.

361
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,640
I couldn't see Mi-ran even

362
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:35,440
when she completely came to me.

363
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,790
Do you think you know
her better than I do?

364
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,510
I know her very well.

365
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,230
Since she is my wife.

366
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:54,740
What?

367
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,210
A wife!

368
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,560
I've been Iooking for
you since Iast week.

369
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,560
What's going on with you?

370
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:23,590
Do you Iove me?

371
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:26,900
Yes.

372
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,000
Really?

373
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:39,820
Min-woo.

374
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:51,250
Even though someone else is in
my heart, can you still Iove me?

375
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:57,860
Yes.

376
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,160
Forever?

377
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,470
Yes, forever.

378
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,490
She promised eternal Iove.

379
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,310
This is ridiculous.

380
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:10,570
When I was at a Ioss in sorrow.

381
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:20,290
She did eat, sleep and
have sex with you.

382
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,110
Why the hell did you come to me?

383
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,610
Why did you?

384
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,330
If you didn't come,

385
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:50,040
I would have been missing
her for the rest of my Iife.

386
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:57,370
Did she send you or did she
ask you to bring Natali?

387
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,520
Get out of my face now.

388
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:12,020
Give Natali to me.

389
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,930
No.

390
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,540
- I can't do that.
- She's my wife.

391
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:27,260
Natali is just one of the easy women
that I have spent a night with.

392
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:32,370
Does it make you feel better to objectify
Natali in a cheap and shameful way?

393
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:40,190
Yes, I should give away that
meaningless steel to someone

394
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,990
That's enough!

395
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,600
Tell your wife,

396
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:56,320
that my past, my work, my promises,
I take it all back and I regret everything.

397
01:08:57,190 --> 01:09:00,720
- I wouldn't be able to.
- Go and tell her.

398
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,730
Don't Ieave out a single word.

399
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:09,980
Natali is a dirty and cheap whore.

400
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,780
- You hear me?
- That's enough!

401
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,790
I won't deliver a single
word you said.

402
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:26,010
Why? Why won't you?
Why! Why! Why!

403
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,020
Because...

404
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:32,530
Mi-ran...

405
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,730
Mi-ran...

406
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:40,140
is gone.

407
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,700
Mi-ran, Oh Mi-ran!

408
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,410
How could you say that?

409
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:18,420
Oh Mi-ran.

410
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:32,150
No, this is my first baby.
I'm going to have it.

411
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,950
This would kill you.

412
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:41,260
Honey, please...

413
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:48,180
No, I can't Iet you.
If I don't have you, I'II die.

414
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,380
We can always have
another baby.

415
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,190
Who's going to die?

416
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,810
I won't.

417
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,610
Mi-ran wanted to have Ye-rim.

418
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,250
I will be fine.

419
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:14,560
If we didn't have her,
Mi-ran could've Iived.

420
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:22,980
In the end, as Mi-ran wanted,
we stopped Chemo treatment.

421
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:29,800
And we were able to have
our healthy daughter, Ye-rim.

422
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,030
Are you all right?

423
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:49,630
Yeah.

424
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,650
Come here, Ye-rim.

425
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:07,010
Mi-ran had ovarian cancer.

426
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,310
Ye-rim.

427
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,910
After she had Ye-rim,

428
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:16,620
the cancer spread all over her body
so we couldn't do nothing about it.

429
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,940
But I think Mi-ran was not afraid.

430
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,240
Are you awake, baby?

431
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,470
I'm fine.

432
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,580
Hold me tight.

433
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:08,060
You know, the doctor said
I can have sex.

434
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:16,980
I'm sorry. Honey.

435
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,100
Honey.

436
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,130
I Iove you.

437
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,330
What?

438
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,340
I said I Iove you.

439
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,560
Me too. I Iove you, too.

440
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,900
I had no idea.

441
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,920
Natali

442
01:16:54,790 --> 01:17:00,030
must be meaningful than
any of your work for you.

443
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,310
Can you forgive me? PIease.

444
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,520
Forgive me. PIease.

445
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:37,840
Mi-ran

446
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,550
tried to keep her words
until the end.

447
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:53,070
She waited for you
until the very Iast moment.

448
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:07,130
Right before she passed away
I found this out by accident.

449
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,750
Why, why did you do this? Why!

450
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:57,890
She missed you.
Until the Iast moment.

451
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,540
This is the Ietter she Ieft for you.

452
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:45,590
We have to see each other.

453
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:54,400
I don't think I can keep my promise
seeing you after ten years from now.

454
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,820
If I could see you just once.

455
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,220
I want to say this to you.

456
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:22,390
Do you know what she
was going to tell me?

457
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:28,810
No, I am curious too.
That's why I came to see you.

458
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,840
You said you have a daughter.

459
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,160
Will you bring her sometime?

460
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,220
I missed you.

461
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,610
It doesn't matter what
she was going to say.

462
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:58,030
In the way as I always wanted to.
I will Iove you Mi-ran.

463
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:02,530
Even though it will
take an eternity,

464
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,850
I will come to you.

465
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:13,000
Hope this mail box will
take me to you Mi-ran.
