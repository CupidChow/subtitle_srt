 Son Hyun Joo
 ♫  Just a look across the sidewalk.  ♫

 Kim Myung Min

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,940
♫  Love.  ♫

 Your Honor 

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,610
 This is a work of fiction. 

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,930
 Characters, places, organizations, incidents, names, ethnic groups, and settings are unrelated to reality. 

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,710
This trial is being manipulated by a detective and prosecutor who abhor Woo One.

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,620
Your Honor!

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:06,020
This sacred court was being controlled by their personal ambition.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,070
Is it utterly impossible to beat him?

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,240
Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,390
How could Judge Song do that?

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,770
We can't end it here.

19
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,020
There's still more we can do.

20
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,120
Who are you?

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,570
Jang Chae Rim from Gangam Police Violent Crimes Department.

22
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,300
You're Tee Rab's girlfriend, right?

23
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,860
He suddenly came looking for me last fall.

24
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,150
 At first, he said he just wanted to be Tee Rab's friend. 

25
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,310
- Yeah!
 - Yeah!

26
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,280
 They started growing closer. 

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,270
Slow down! Why are you drinking so fast?

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,580
 One day, he suddenly gave Tee Rab 5 million won. 

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,680
 It's burning! What would you do without me? 

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,700
Let me ask you a favor.

31
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,270
He asked him to do a job for him.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,840
 To keep track of every move of a guy named Kim Sang Hyeon. 

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,360
- Cheers!
 - Cheers.

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,400
It doesn't make sense.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,250
So, did you get permission?

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,840
I persuaded him.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,870
And do you know what my dad said?

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,360
If I'll ride one anyway, he'll just buy it for me as a gift!

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,620
As expected of Chairman Kim!

40
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,520
Hey, when's the motorcycle arriving?

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,630
He'll probably have it delivered on the morning of my birthday.

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,600
 I heard him bragging 

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,300
 to his friends that his dad in jail would buy him a motorcycle as a birthday gift. 

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,780
Is your hyung coming on your birthday?

45
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't even mention my hyeong. He's one scary guy.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,560
Last time,

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,000
he even killed a judge's wife.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
 - What?
 - Really? 

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,540
 Keep it to yourselves, okay? 

50
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,370
My hyeong rocks, right?

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,340
On Kim Sang Hyeon's birthday...

52
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,760
 On the guy's birthday... 

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,160
 So, that day from 00:00 to 24:00, 

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,890
 he asked us to surveil him meticulously. 

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,990
Wow!

56
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,570
 - Then... 
 - Shit, daebak.

57
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,710
 on his birthday, the motorcycle really arrived. 

58
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,510
I said, not today!

59
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,590
I lost him.

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,570
I lost him!

61
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,540
What the heck?

62
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,790
- You see him? 
 - He's coming out.

63
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,920
 Rest in Peace Jo Eun Hye 

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,160
That morning,

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,890
Tee Rab told me to wait at home.

66
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,210
 And Tee Rab followed that boy. 

67
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 Tee Rab told me we could make big money now. 

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,890
Let's go to Egypt together.

69
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,430
 He said he'd take me to Egypt and marry me. 

70
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,830
 He said a stranger's weakness turns into big money. 

71
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,470
 Then, not even a month later, 

72
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,880
 he appeared in that state. 

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,970
 That man probably killed him. 

74
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,960
 Chairman Kim Gang Heon. 

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,500
I'll get revenge for you.

76
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,570
 I asked if he knew who killed him. 

77
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,420
 He said he didn't know yet. 

78
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,510
It was a crime he had prepared for a long time.

79
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,190
As to his motive,

80
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,130
you and I can both guess why.

81
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,330
To avenge his mom.

82
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,600
He prepared for at least six months and committed the crime on the day he set.

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,950
No. There's no way.

84
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,000
I've obtained both witness and evidence.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,420
He will be tried as a criminal, not for a car accident.

86
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,060
Can you give me a cigarette?

87
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,320
 Park Chang Hyeok 

88
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,060
 What is it? 

89
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,830
Detective Jang Chae Rim

90
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,760
knows Ho Yeong is the perpetrator of the hit-and-run accident.

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,390
She's blackmailing me right now with that knowledge.

92
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,420
To find Kim Sang Hyeok guilty.

93
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,490
In any case, my goal is to save Ho Yeong.

94
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,490
Detective Jang's blackmail is a critical obstacle in my way.

95
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,180
Until I can find a solution,

96
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,680
if you could confine her or something...

97
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,820
 Your Honor: Episode 9 

98
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,440
 To avenge his mom. 

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,570
 It was a crime he had prepared for a long time. 

100
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,570
 No. There's no way. 

101
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,140
 Script based on series "Kvodo" by Ohad Knoller, Shlomo Moshiah and Ron Ninio 

102
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,380
Stop using your phone during mealtime.

103
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,630
You can use your phone as you eat.

104
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,230
I'm sorry for how I've been.

105
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,420
Sang Hyeon is no longer with us.

106
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,750
But I held onto the child who is gone...

107
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,250
and made you and Eun suffer...

108
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,410
who are still living.

109
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,370
Life must go on...

110
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,540
for those who are still living.

111
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,490
What brings you here?

112
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,830
Do you remember a woman named Jo Eun Hye?

113
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,840
Jo Eun Hye?

114
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,150
Who's that?

115
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,590
 Volunteer Group 

116
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,980
 How long can someone pretend to be kind? 

117
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,310
I thought you had changed, Father.

118
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,630
 These f***ers were talking shit about you. 

119
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,930
 Saying you're a hypocrite. 

120
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,690
Father.

121
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,720
Inside us...

122
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,170
 flows blood that commands us. 

123
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,130
 My blood constantly whispers to me. 

124
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,330
As the representative of the group,

125
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,770
I will take responsibility for all the crimes committed by Woo One,

126
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,210
such as collusion, violence, and bribery

127
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,840
related to the bidding by the construction company.

128
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,070
 "Seize sovereignty over the world." 

129
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,050
 "Become a ruler of great power, 

130
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,080
 invulnerable to no one." 

131
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,520
Your blood commands you?

132
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,460
There's only one reason you're able to remain alive.

133
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,500
It's that blood.

134
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,270
You'll be found not guilty.

135
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,640
Once the trial ends,

136
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,670
someone will pick you up.

137
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,450
Don't do anything

138
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,790
and go straight to America.

139
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,020
Isn't one dinner okay?

140
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,300
Can't we all...

141
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,360
have dinner together for once?

142
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,350
 Witness Lee Cheong Kang changes testimony... will it change the trial's direction? 

143
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,600
 The murder trial of Woo One Group's eldest son, Kim Sang Hyeok, has a new twist. 

144
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,070
I have something to ask you.

145
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,850
Who is it?

146
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,730
Who are you?

147
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,960
I heard you met with Detective Jang Chae Rim.

148
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,550
Yes.

149
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,600
What did you talk about with Jang Chae Rim?

150
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,350
 If Ho Yeong turned himself in that day, 

151
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,420
 would we have fallen apart like this? 

152
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,620
 Would I have been unable to protect Ho Yeong on my own? 

153
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,550
 A well-respected judge. 

154
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,650
 I didn't want to give up that title.  
  Courthouse 

155
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,340
 A small crack led to a colossal collapse. 

156
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,370
 Restricted ID Caller 

157
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,150
 Who's this? 

158
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,640
Why won't you find a way for me to live?

159
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,530
Is there a way?

160
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,560
Do you know the way?

161
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,150
Who do you think turned my quiet life into this mess?

162
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,720
If you had just done your job, things wouldn't be this bad.

163
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,780
Judge Song,

164
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:59,420
the first thing I hear when I go to church is about original sin.

165
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,110
The original sin

166
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,010
was committed when Lee Sang Taek didn't properly discard the car.

167
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,880
Things wouldn't have gone this awry

168
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,090
if he had just properly discarded that car.

169
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,830
 That's on you, CEO Jo— 

170
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,050
Damn it!

171
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,710
Judge Song, why can't you understand what I'm trying to say?

172
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,200
 The original sin. 

173
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,290
Don't you know what "original sin" means?

174
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,030
 The original sin 

175
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,180
is your son, Song Ho Yeong.

176
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,000
What do you mean—

177
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,380
Ho Yeong.

178
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,840
An intentional car accident.

179
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,680
 A murder that was planned 

180
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,210
for six months and systematically executed.

181
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,830
 Is that something that can stay hidden? 

182
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,680
Did you give up the position of Chief of Political Affairs at the Blue House?

183
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,860
That's the only way you and I can live, Judge Song.

184
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,370
You've got to do better.

185
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,860
Believe me, I want to,

186
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,950
but it's not something I can control.

187
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,260
You have to.

188
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,500
You must do it, Judge Song.

189
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,850
We have more things to worry about.

190
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,570
 Last night, your son 

191
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,030
met up with one of our kids.

192
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,890
He was looking for a gun.

193
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,410
 I did some thinking after hearing that. 

194
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,430
Why is your son looking for a gun?

195
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,930
What else is he plotting this time?

196
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,290
 Judge Song. 

197
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:50,310
We always take lightly matters we can cover up with our hands

198
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,270
and eventually, cover them up with our lives.

199
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,650
A gun...

200
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,090
- Did he get one? 
  - Who do you think I am?

201
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,660
Who do you think I am?

202
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,480
I stopped it so he can't get one.

203
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,750
 However... 

204
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,260
a person's mind always changes.

205
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,700
You've got to do better, Judge Song. Okay?

206
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,310
The evidence material the Prosecution submitted

207
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,120
lost a lot of its effectiveness as evidence.

208
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,270
Lee Cheong Kang's reversal of testimony...

209
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,400
Isn't this complicating the trial right now?

210
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,020
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong and Detective Jang Chae Rim kept

211
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,400
the witness with them under the guise of

212
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,670
a witness protection program, which has become problematic now.

213
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,810
Regarding the witness protection program,

214
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,640
Assemblyman Jung Yi Hwa is pressing us, saying he'll publicize it.

215
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,010
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong also made a mistake, so...

216
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,730
Judge Song, why aren't you saying anything?

217
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,170
- Judge Song. 
 - Judge Song?

218
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,010
Yes?

219
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,090
Could you say something, please?

220
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,990
It's a complicated problem.

221
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,760
Let's give it some more thought and discuss it after.

222
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,050
Let's meet.

223
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,860
I'll do everything you people want, so let's meet right now.

224
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,760
This is Song Pan Ho.

225
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,210
There's a man wearing a blue jacket in the parking lot across the street.

226
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,670
He seems to be holding a grudge over a trial's results.

227
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,190
Please take care of him because he looks dangerous.

228
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,900
Excuse me.

229
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,260
What are you doing right now?

230
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,390
Come this way, please.

231
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,170
 Ho Yeong. 

232
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,970
 An intentional car accident. 

233
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,870
 A murder that was planned 

234
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,510
 for six months and systematically executed. 

235
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,240
 Is that something that can stay hidden? 

236
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,200
It's not true.

237
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,630
It can't be.

238
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,770
He's still too young.

239
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,510
It can't be.

240
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,370
It's not true.

241
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,220
What's the matter?

242
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,660
Why are you in such a hurry?

243
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,830
Don't you want to bring down Woo One Group?

244
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:20,530
Well, there's no better way to showcase the regime's power.

245
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,460
There's a way to bring down Chairman Kim Kang Heon and Woo One Group.

246
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,810
If I tell you the method, will you call me

247
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,570
into the Blue House before Kim Sang Hyeok's trial ends?

248
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,750
It's under the condition I enter the Blue House as soon as the trial ends.

249
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,370
If you'll promise me, I'll find Kim Sang Hyeok

250
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,690
guilty in the verdict.

251
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,550
This is the café where Detective Jang Chae Rim and Judge Song Pan Ho met.

252
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,880
There has been no signal since 9:28 p.m.

253
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,850
I should've gone with her then.

254
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,340
It can't be anything serious, right?

255
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,750
She went to meet no one other than

256
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,120
Judge Song Pan Ho, you know?

257
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,070
How many people can you utilize?

258
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,560
Three people? Okay.

259
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,920
Proceed unofficially for now until the trial ends.

260
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,410
Look up every CCTV and vehicle record nearby and bring them to me.

261
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,240
What brings you here?

262
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,290
How did you come in here?

263
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,420
I said there's something I must tell you regarding the trial.

264
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,780
You have something to tell the prosecutor right before the verdict hearing?

265
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,080
You're not that kind of a judge, sir.

266
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,670
Regarding Kim Sang Hyeok,

267
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,860
I plan to declare him guilty.

268
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,110
I don't know if you know, Prosecutor Kang,

269
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,370
but there's severe pressure from Woo One.

270
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,100
The witness was bought, and I'm also getting threatened right now.

271
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,540
At this rate, Kim Sang Hyeok

272
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,530
will be found not guilty.

273
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,000
We can't let that happen, can we?

274
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,860
What are you going to do?

275
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,040
I'm going to find Kim Sang Hyeok guilty

276
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,420
and become the Chief of Political Affairs at the Blue House.

277
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,740
Is that possible?

278
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,250
That's why I need your help.

279
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,100
Hand over all information you investigated

280
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,760
regarding the evil deeds Chairman Kim Kang Heon and Woo One Group committed

281
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,250
after Lee Sang Taek's hit-and-run incident.

282
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,150
I'll hand your research over to the Blue House tonight.

283
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,320
This is the case record Detective Jang Chae Rim

284
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
and I investigated so far.

285
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,150
You met Detective Jang Chae Rim two days ago, right?

286
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,810
I did, and?

287
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,090
Detective Jang Chae Rim can't be reached.

288
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,560
Well?

289
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,980
What time did you last see her?

290
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,370
We met around 9:00 p.m. and separated around 9:30 p.m.

291
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,770
What did you talk about?

292
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,240
She threatened me regarding the trial.

293
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,620
Was it because she was scared Kim Sang Hyeok would be

294
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,610
found not guilty since Lee Cheong Kang changed his testimony?

295
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,910
She threatened me with some nonsense.

296
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,090
What kind?

297
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,620
That my son is the hit-and-run culprit.

298
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,060
And so?

299
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,720
What do you mean?

300
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,730
So, how did you part ways?

301
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,980
She spoke some complete nonsense.

302
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,530
So, I got mad at her and left.

303
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,170
Is that all?

304
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,500
- Are you interrogating me right now? 
 - Yes.

305
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,040
As a prosecutor.

306
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,940
That's rude.

307
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,200
The fact that Ho Yeong is the culprit

308
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,030
and the accident was caused on purpose...

309
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,480
We have evidence to back that up.

310
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,780
You'll have to manage this.

311
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,280
Judge Song Pan Ho?

312
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,460
Chief Secretary Kang Mun Seok sent me.

313
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,900
He told me to get some documents from you.

314
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,800
Why didn't Chief Secretary Kang come in person?

315
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,390
He had to join an urgent meeting.

316
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,340
How can I trust you?

317
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,230
I said I am.

318
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,440
He's in a meeting right now.

319
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,760
He probably won't answer his phone.

320
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,790
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to—  

321
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,660
No.

322
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,200
I can't trust you.

323
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,790
Trust me.

324
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,660
It was very hard for me to come out in secret.

325
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,750
There's no time.

326
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,510
Forget it, then.

327
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,730
Lives are at stake here.

328
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,260
Please tell him to call me

329
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,150
as soon as he gets the documents.

330
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,740
Yes, I got it.

331
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,650
Give them to me.

332
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,060
Why are you here?

333
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,540
How is it going?

334
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,410
What?

335
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,890
Tomorrow's trial.

336
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,630
I'm going to find him guilty.

337
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,210
So...

338
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,520
don't do anything foolish.

339
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,900
 Chief Secretary's Office 

340
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,200
 I've reviewed the documents you sent me. 

341
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,230
They're good...

342
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,580
but not good enough.

343
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,190
What else do you need?

344
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,500
We've done investigations on our end, too.

345
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,140
Chairman Kim Kang Heon's wife had done something, hadn't she?

346
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,940
 Arson and instigated murder... 

347
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,400
 If we can add those on top, 

348
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,440
I think it'll be a good cause to oppress Woo One Group.

349
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,480
 It'll also look better when you come and take charge in person. 

350
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,450
After finding the oldest son of Woo One guilty,

351
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,490
you left the legal field, and

352
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:30,630
now use political power to punish evil.

353
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,600
 Doesn't it look great? 

354
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,070
Isn't what you have enough?

355
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,760
Chairman Kim Kang Heon has committed countless evil deeds so far.

356
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,110
I know. I know, but...

357
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,880
You need to know

358
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,800
he is just as powerful as well.

359
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,670
I'll send the documents you mentioned before sunrise.

360
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,900
I must hear a firm answer before Kim Sang Hyeok's verdict hearing tomorrow.

361
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,850
 As soon as it's confirmed that I can enter the Blue House, 

362
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,570
I plan to find Kim Sang Hyeok guilty.

363
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,220
 Hello? 

364
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,030
Let's meet.

365
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,930
- When? 
 - If possible, before sunrise.

366
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,250
Looks like you're in a hurry.

367
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,060
- Do you need something? 
 - Number one.

368
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,790
Evidence of Kim Kang Heon's wife's arson and instigated murder.

369
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,840
 Number two. 

370
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,930
I need to go meet you, CEO Jo.

371
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,770
But there's a Woo One employee spying on me right outside the door.

372
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,120
Yes, I understand.

373
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,350
You can't park here.

374
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,600
- I already told them. 
 - I didn't hear anything, though.

375
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,130
What are you agonizing over?

376
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,350
It's all about to end now.

377
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,630
You didn't give a gun to Ho Yeong, right?

378
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,230
Of course not!

379
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,400
I told them to report to me if he came to our neighborhood.

380
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,910
So, don't worry.

381
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,260
Thank you.

382
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,160
I don't need you thanking me only in words anymore.

383
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,420
Chairman Kim Kang Heon isn't the only one I have intel on.

384
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,820
Yours is even more critical.

385
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,580
I'll keep that in mind.

386
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,050
 Personal Details Report 

387
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,530
How?

388
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,160
H-How did you know?

389
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,410
Didn't the Blue House's Chief Secretary show you some pictures?

390
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,570
 There's another Chief of Political Affairs candidate. 

391
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,360
 They sent me these pictures. 

392
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,280
We're the ones who sent him those pictures.

393
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,100
Moving the world means

394
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,900
you know everything

395
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,110
that's going on, Judge Song.

396
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,530
 Personal Details Report 

397
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,680
This must've been your last-ditch effort, right?

398
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,730
Did you really believe you could bring me down with just this?

399
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,070
What on earth must I do

400
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,460
to end this?

401
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,450
That's what I want to ask.

402
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,530
Do you think everything came this far because of me?

403
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,910
My son was going to turn himself in in the first place.

404
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,280
We were in front of the police station

405
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,820
when I realized the dead boy was your son and

406
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,930
I decided to hide him.

407
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,080
Ho Yeong was going to turn himself in.

408
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,480
I hid him away.

409
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:07,510
I'm the one who manipulated and intended to conceal the case.

410
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,110
It's all my fault.

411
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,850
I-I don't mind dying.

412
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:23,350
As long as you promise you'll spare my son,

413
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,240
I'll throw everything away.

414
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,470
I'm fine with that.

415
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,120
Just promise me you'll spare my son.

416
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,130
There's nothing I can do.

417
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,140
Besides trusting you,

418
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,390
there's nothing I can do anymore.

419
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,460
You also have children, so you understand how I feel, right?

420
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,800
Please understand me.

421
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,940
Please understand.

422
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,290
I-I'm sorry.

423
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,530
You brought it upon yourself.

424
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,210
 I was in a hurry to overstep ... 

425
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,500
 I didn't kill a human being, but a principle! 

426
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,810
 So I killed the principle, 

427
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,170
 but I didn't overstep, 

428
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,560
 I stayed on this side. 

429
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,030
 "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Doestoevsky 

430
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,600
 I was only capable of killing. 

431
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,140
 And it seems I wasn't even capable of that.. 

432
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,460
 No, life is only given to me once 

433
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,790
 and I shall never have it again; 

434
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,460
 I don’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ 

435
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,100
 I want to live myself, 

436
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,210
 
  or else better not live at all. 

437
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,830
 He walked on without resting. 

438
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:11,380
 He had a terrible longing for some distraction, 

439
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,800
 but he did not know 

440
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,140
 what to do, what to attempt. 

441
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,660
 A new overwhelming sensation was gaining 

442
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:28,250
 more and more mastery over him every moment. 

443
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,160
What? What?

444
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,950
- What the f***?
 - Are you scared?

445
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,150
Are you afraid?

446
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,000
Let go!

447
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,950
 Black and grimy and spiders in every corner, 

448
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,970
 and that's all eternity is? 

449
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,050
Prosecutor, what is your sentencing demand?

450
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,370
May it please the court.

451
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,790
We're discussing a heinous crime in this court today.

452
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,500
Because of the shooting spree we're discussing, four innocent lives were lost

453
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,360
and their families and friends are in deep sorrow.

454
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,790
I request all of you today to render

455
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,590
strict punishment under the law upon the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok.

456
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,440
In view of all the evidence and testimony regarding this case,

457
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,050
the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok, is clearly guilty!

458
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,600
 You are crying, sister 

459
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,870
 but can you hold out your hand to me? 

460
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,230
 "Crime? What crime?" 

461
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:11,370
 he cried in sudden fury. 

462
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,870
I demand for the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok,

463
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,430
the maximum punishment allowed by law.

464
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,480
This will deliver a strong message that

465
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,390
our society doesn't tolerate crimes but protects the law and justice.

466
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:31,320
And I hope it's a small consolation for the victims and their families.

467
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,800
-  Was that a crime? 
 - Please render a just judgment

468
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,830
-  I am not thinking of it and 
 - on the defendant. That's all I request.

469
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,780
 I am not thinking of expiating it, 

470
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:46,210
 and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? 'A crime! a crime!' 

471
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,100
 Let me go! 

472
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,930
Let me go!

473
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,490
Kim Kang Heon... Where's Kim Kang Heon?

474
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,700
Where is he?

475
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,350
Kim Kang Heon!

476
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,020
 Now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. 

477
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,520
 It's simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me 

478
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,350
 "Brother, brother, what are you saying? 

479
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:43,510
 Why, you have shed blood?" 

480
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,140
 cried Dounia in despair. 

481
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,920
 "Which all men shed," 

482
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,120
 he put in almost frantically, 

483
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,960
The Prosecution submitted testimony Kim Sang Hyeok was at the scene

484
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,930
and a few pieces of physical evidence.

485
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:07,460
However, they are utterly inadequate in proving that Kim Sang Hyeok is the culprit.

486
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:14,880
 "which flows and has always flowed in streams, 

487
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,840
 which is spilt like champagne, ..." 

488
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,910
 "Look into it more carefully and understand it! 

489
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,500
 I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds, 

490
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:38,000
 thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity, 

491
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,090
 not stupidity even, simply clumsiness, 

492
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:47,680
 for the idea was by no means so stupid ..." 

493
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,100
The Prosecution is ignoring this important fact and

494
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,310
consistently trying to frame the defendant as the culprit.

495
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,910
Number four.

496
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,930
The intent the Prosecution suggested doesn't align with the defendant at all.

497
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:15,200
The defendant has regularly been living a diligent and peaceful life

498
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,060
along with his father, Chairman Kim Kang Heon of Woo One Group.

499
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,400
It's difficult to understand rationally that

500
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,990
the defendant would commit such an extreme crime.

501
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,590
Please make a judicious and fair decision.

502
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,390
The defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok, is not guilty.

503
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,700
 "But I... 

504
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,340
 I couldn't carry out even the first step, 

505
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,790
 because I am contemptible," 

506
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,190
 "that's what's the matter!" 

507
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,620
 "And yet I won't look at it as you do... 

508
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,540
 ...but now I'm trapped." 

509
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,670
 Judge 

510
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:23,200
Are there any other procedures you want to pursue

511
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,460
or documents you want to submit?

512
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,970
 Police Line / Do Not Cross! 

513
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,460
 "which flows and has always flowed in streams 

514
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,250
 flowed in streams. 

515
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,310
 which is spilt like champagne," 

516
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,440
I'll announce the verdict.

517
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:38,120
Regarding the shooting incident at the third pier of Daeyeon Port,

518
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,390
the witness' testimony largely contradicts

519
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:47,480
objective evidence or other victim's witnesses.

520
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,520
The evidence is also insufficient,

521
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,330
so it's difficult to say the allegations were proven.

522
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:01,370
As such, for case number 2024 F.C.* 4630...
(First trial, Criminal)

523
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,650
the prosecutor's submitted evidence are

524
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,680
insufficient to prove the allegations against the defendant as fact.

525
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:16,550
Therefore, the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok,

526
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,120
is hereby found not guilty.

527
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,250
 Defendant 

528
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,260
 Prosecutor 

529
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,540
Judge Song Pan Ho!

530
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,080
Detective Jang Chae Rim...

531
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,900
is dead.

532
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,560
Are you aware?

533
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,310
 Freedom, Equality, Justice 

534
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,830
There he comes!

535
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,110
 I'm deeply thankful for the fair trial 

536
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:45,400
 and the judge's decision that created the fair trial... 

537
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,180
What is it?

538
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,410
And the team of attorneys, who

539
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:57,670
 protected my innocence to the end. 

540
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,600
I know you killed Kim Sang Hyeon intentionally.

541
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,480
I'm not trying to do anything to you.

542
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,000
Oppa!

543
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
What's this?

544
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,140
My goodness!

545
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,450
Don't you want revenge?

546
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:33,460
Oppa, can I bring my boyfriend home this evening?

547
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,350
Do you know

548
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:38,190
how many people died because of what you did?

549
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:41,510
You must end this yourself.

550
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:45,930
 Kim Eun 

551
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,640
 Oppa, come to my house this evening 

552
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,040
and eat dinner with my dad, mom, and oldest oppa.

553
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,110
 We agreed to eat dinner before my oldest oppa goes to the U.S. 

554
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,290
 You should come, too, Oppa. Please? 

555
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,990
 Please come with me! 

556
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,270
 Dad 

557
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,990
This is nuts!

558
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,890
Why

559
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:21,270
and where all of this started...

560
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,880
Does Kim Kang Heon know?

561
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,320
He doesn't, does he?

562
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,570
 I'm sure he doesn't know... 

563
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,360
 that it wasn't an accident 

564
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,720
 but a planned murder. 

565
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:45,600
 And how far out could that brat have planned? 

566
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,420
No one would know.

567
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,050
I'm sure he'll go to the end!

568
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,200
Even to the place he mustn't go!

569
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,460
He'll end up going there.

570
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,220
Put her in.

571
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:32,070


572
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:39,650
 Your Honor 

573
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,480
♫  Your breaking down to my lord  ♫

574
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,020
♫  You can't hide it. It doesn't feel like home  ♫

575
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:58,250
♫  A wicked is born in the dark  ♫

576
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,700
♫  You never get it like that, mate  ♫

577
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:05,150
♫  Why not me? Always get it all  ♫

578
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,030
♫  It's not fair anymore  ♫

579
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,500
 He started planning it six months before the accident. 

580
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,870
 He must've approached my daughter, Eun, intentionally as well. 

581
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,520
 Does he want to avenge his dead mom? 

582
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,320
 How dare he... Against me? 

583
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,800
 I'll take him away. 

584
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,160
 Please don't do anything. 

585
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,420
 Didn't we meet somewhere before? 

586
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,380
 Please... Not my son. 

587
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,180
 H-Ho Yeong... 

588
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,660
 I'll see this to the end. 

589
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,680
 Ho Yeong! Let me go! Ho Yeong! 

590
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,620
 No, I'm already at the end.
