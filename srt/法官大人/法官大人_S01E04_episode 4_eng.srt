 Your Honor 

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,910
 This is a work of fiction. 

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,040
 Characters, places, organizations, incidents, names, ethnic groups, and settings are unrelated to reality.

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
Back off. Back off!

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll search for your son until the end.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,140
We know you got a large sum of money today.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,990
We're the ones who deposited that money.

16
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,510
F***...

17
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,210
Sang Taek, rest in peace.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,190
Who are you?

19
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,750
Are you Lee Sang Taek?

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,850
Who are you?

21
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,280
Gosh, what do I do?

22
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,980
 500 million won 

23
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,300
Did I ask you to give me money?

24
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,920
 Your Honor: Episode 4 

25
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,780
 Oh, I am the person who 

26
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,020
 accidentally witnessed something dangerous and important. 

27
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,200
 At the car center. 

28
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,740
What do you want?

29
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,280
 Money. 

30
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,210
 The problem is how much you can pay me, Judge. 

31
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,210
 Script based on series "Kvodo" by Ohad Knoller, Shlomo Moshiah and Ron Ninio 

32
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,050
 I was so curious about what happened. 

33
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,920
 Yesterday morning, Kim Sang Hyeon on his motorcycle on the coastal road of Woowon City 

34
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,590
 crashed into a car while trying to make a right turn. 

35
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,520
 Mr. Kim was quickly transported to the hospital, but he died around 8:25 a.m. 

36
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,770
 The deceased's older brother, Kim Sang Hyeok, 

37
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,830
 claimed the culprit must be punished severely. 

38
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,080
 Think about it. 

39
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
 How much money it'd take for me to keep my mouth shut. 

40
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,150

 Judge Song Pan Ho's Unprecedented Verdict 

44
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,250
Did this respected man

45
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,420
really...

46
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,170
do that to Sang Hyeon and run away?

47
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,830
Because people become fearful

48
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,100
when they have lots to protect.

49
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,850
 "Your Honor?"
 "In Front of the Law" 

50
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,930
To protect his meager reputation?

51
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,660
For his life where all he has is respect?

52
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,260
Fine.

53
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,380
Would that be enough reason to continue to live

54
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,700
like nothing happened after killing my son?

55
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm back.

56
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,400
Eun.

57
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,040
Yes?

58
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,720
Can you give Daddy a hug?

59
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,770
D-Dad, are you crying?

60
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,480
No, I'm not crying.

61
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,920
I just feel

62
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,740
so bad for you, Eun.

63
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,100
 POLICE 

64
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,070
Look through that.

65
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,530
 Jeong Hae Yong 

66
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,160
Jangbeom-dong?

67
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,860
They're punks from the Budu Gang.

68
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,340
Why'd Budu Gang's punks f*** around all the way over here?

69
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,380
 Name: Li Xiang Ze 

70
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,640
This is Lee Sang Taek.

71
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,480
- Lee Sang Taek?
 - Lee Sang Taek?

72
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,390
You know, the suspect for Woowon Group's second son's hit-and-run.

73
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,880
 Around 6:00 a.m. this morning, near the third pier of Daeyeon Port, 

74
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,140
 while on a walk Mr. Kim discovered four dead bodies and called the police. 

75
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,980
Did Hae Yong...

76
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,010
come in last night?

77
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,380
- Huh?
 -  The police stated... 

78
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,070
 the most probable suspect, Lee, is among the dead. 

79
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,150
 All victims, including illegal aliens, are foreignors. 

80
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,030
 Court 

81
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,860
The defendant, Jang Seong Tae, escaped without taking any measures

82
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,290
such as relieving the victim even after injuring people and damaging property.

83
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,970
Under Article 5 Clause 3 of the Act on Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes,

84
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,870
he is found guilty of fleeing the scene of a vehicle accident.

85
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,320
In addition, the defendant, Ju Ho Jin, who interfered with the investigation

86
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,400
and discovery of the real culprit by a false confession on behalf of Jang Seong Tae,

87
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,300
is found guilty of concealing the criminal under Article 151 Clause 1 of the Criminal Act.

88
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,980
 Oh, yes, Judge. 

89
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,650
Detective Jang, where are you right now?

90
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,140
Could I see you for a moment?

91
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,610
Lee Sang Taek

92
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,510
is dead.

93
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,760
Did you see the news?

94
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,430
I didn't get to see the news.

95
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,090
Jeong Hae Yong, the number two guy in the Budu Gang, and two of their members were shot to death.

96
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,040
Lee Sang Taek also died from a gunshot to the head.

97
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll need to go to the NFS* to get the details.
 (National Forensic Service)

98
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,740
Judge, are you okay?

99
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,710
Who killed him?

100
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,460
Who could it be?

101
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,420
The gas explosion that happened in Lee Sang Taek's house

102
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,790
and the murders that took place this time both

103
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,400
must have been by those we suspect.

104
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,430
Oh, right. You had something to tell me.

105
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,220
No, I took care of it.

106
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,140
 The dead are Lee Sang Taek, underboss Jeong Hae Yong of Budu Gang, 

107
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,120
 Christoph the Russian, and Alex the Filipino. 

108
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,010
 The cause of death is excessive bleeding from gunshot wounds for all four. 

109
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,250
 The NFS collected the shells and the bullets found at the scene 

110
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,560
 to conduct precise analysis. 

111
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,040
 That's all. 

112
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,780
 I'll contact you again. 

113
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,390
Where's Sang Hyeok right now?

114
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm sorry. I was unable to pay attention.

115
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,460
I'll bring him quickly.

116
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,460
Let's go meet Jo Mi Yeon.

117
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,460
What's the meaning of this?

118
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,890
I didn't know this would happen either.

119
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,020
Just how ruthless must I become for this matter to be resolved?

120
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,440
Just how many people must die for this to end?

121
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,510
Take a seat first.

122
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,070
I'm going to be punished by the heavens for sure.

123
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,210
I'll have to live the rest of my life

124
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,270
with the guilt of my sins on my back.

125
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,930
I shouldn't have...

126
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,450
done it in the first place.

127
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,600
But haven't you tightened your security?

128
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,970
Drink this and calm down.

129
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,730
What happened to his child?

130
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,670
I don't know, either.

131
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,790
They said he seemed to have gone with them to the scene

132
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,110
but disappeared after.

133
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,310
If you made up your mind to become ruthless at the beginning,

134
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,790
stay ruthless to the end.

135
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,280
Be more ruthless.

136
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,850
If you hesitate to be ruthless, all your plans will go up in smoke.

137
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,980
Deciding to become ruthless

138
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,690
was not me.

139
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,360
It was you.

140
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,920
Many kids in this area were abandoned by their parents or they were lost.

141
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,510
They become good assets if I raise them well.

142
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,660
Looks like you wouldn't be lonely.

143
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,220
Are you lonely?

144
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,040
I heard Lee Sang Taek died.

145
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,750
Are the ones who died with him Budu Gang members?

146
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,820
If you don't talk,

147
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm bound to imagine as I please.

148
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,730
I won't lie to you.

149
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,620
We planned to kill Lee Sang Taek

150
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,790
and we really tried to kill him.

151
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,230
Why?

152
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,260
He used to work for us from time to time.

153
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,730
But he committed a grave wrong against you, didn't he?

154
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,370
We were going to get rid of him quietly without anyone knowing.

155
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,600
If you caught Lee Sang Taek and you personally had to get rid of him,

156
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,790
do you think your sorrow would've been resolved, Chairman?

157
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,050
We need to find a way to survive as well.

158
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,740
I came to hear your honest story, but you won't talk.

159
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,430
Lying is what makes matters complicated and more serious.

160
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,720
Right.

161
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,910
Do you know who killed my men and Lee Sang Taek?

162
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,640
We almost missed the culprit as well.

163
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,730
Fortunately, the bullet found at the scene is one that we know of.

164
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,920
So, we went and beat him up.

165
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,480
The one who bought the gun was that bastard.

166
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,590
Bin.

167
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,640
Who's the one you worked with?

168
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,850
Kim Sang Hyeok.

169
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,730
Who told you to blow up Lee Sang Taek's house?

170
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,940
A-A person named Jang Hyeon Su.

171
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,300
Do you know someone named Jang Hyeon Su?

172
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,010
When we looked into it,

173
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,560
they said he's a personal secretary

174
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,250
who works for your wife.

175
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,830
We also thought it was Kim Sang Hyeok at first.

176
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,090
So it was unexpected.

177
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,170
 What brought this on? 

178
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,540
Find Sang Hyeok first before something happens to him.

179
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,300
Yes, I got it.

180
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,950
Also...

181
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,690
find out who exactly set Lee Sang Taek's house on fire.

182
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,390
Yes, sir.

183
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm Lee Sang Taek's son, Lee Cheong Gang.

184
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,290
What happened? Why won't you answer your phone?

185
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,500
Am I going to die, too?

186
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,100
Grandma, Cheong Ha, and my dad...

187
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,820
are all dead.

188
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,990
Am I going to die, too?

189
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,630
No.

190
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,730
The police will protect you.

191
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,450
In here

192
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,810
I filmed who killed my father and Jeong Hae Yong.

193
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,450
But there's a strange thing.

194
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,210
What is it?

195
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,830
 "Criminal Law Reasoning" 

196
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,050
 Hanmyeong Daily / Court 

197
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,530
 The suspect of the assault case is Kim Sang Hyeok, the oldest son of Woo One Group. 

198
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,640
 Kim Sang Hyeok was found not guilty... 

199
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,380
 He is the eldest son of the chairman of Woowon Group Kim Gang Heon. 

200
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,940
You're here?

201
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,120
Oppa, I'm sorry.

202
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,140
Why? What for?

203
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,630
Because I got here late?

204
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,530
Why were you late?

205
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,700
It's just that...

206
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,020
Mom is having a hard time.

207
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,760
So she cries every day.

208
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,870
I had to stay by my mom's side,

209
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,240
which is why I came late.

210
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,960
Because I feel sorry for Mom.

211
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,370
What about your oppa?

212
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,200
You have one more oppa.

213
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,820
You mean Sang Hyeok?

214
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,950
What kind of a person

215
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,200
is that oppa?

216
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,470
Sang Hyeok oppa is also

217
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,990
someone I feel sorry for.

218
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,130
Because his mom died when he was young.

219
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,930
 Who are you? 

220
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,340
 Are you Lee Sang Taek? 

221
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,240
 Who are you? 

222
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,690
I was reminded of that day two years ago.

223
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,830
It was painful for you and

224
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,160
agonizing for me as well.

225
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,510
I think it's time we got this punk.

226
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,010
It won't be easy.

227
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,450
Currently, there are too many authorities within the police who collude with Woo One Group.

228
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,840
It won't be easy, but...

229
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,480
I'll get Kim Sang Hyeok.

230
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,330
The son he lives with is out

231
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,800
and Judge Song Pan Ho is working at the court.

232
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,480
All the locks have been opened. You can just go inside.

233
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,320
 Zolpidem (a sleeping pill) 

234
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,370
 As he sat there motionless, staring into the darkness 

235
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,280
 he felt great pride in the fact that he had been able to provide such a life 

236
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,860
 for his parents and sister in such a fine apartment. 

237
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,560
 But what if all the quiet, the comfort, the contentment were 

238
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,850
 now to end in horror? 

239
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,610
 To keep himself from being lost in such thoughts 

240
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,620
 Gregor took refuge in movement and crawled back and forth in the room. 

241
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,780
Please enjoy your trip.

242
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,180
Hello.

243
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,870
 Kim Sang Hyeok 

244
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,750
 Departure Prohibition 

245
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,360
One moment, please. There's an issue with your passport.

246
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,960
What issue?

247
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,410
It'll be resolved quickly. I'm only going to check.

248
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,610
The travel ban individual is running away toward the East Gate!

249
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,800
Sang Hyeok almost got arrested at the airport just now.

250
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,830
He didn't know he had a travel ban and tried to go to the U.S.

251
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,370
Fortunately, he got away.

252
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,010
But he is on the fugitive list now.

253
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,970
Find him quickly before the police do.

254
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,310
Utilize all the men we can to find him!

255
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,480
Yes, I'll hurry.

256
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,860
 Ho Yeong 

257
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,980
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

258
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,610
 After the beep— 

259
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,550
Excuse me.

260
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,470
- Hey—
 - My gosh!

261
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,850
Oh, who are you?

262
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,270
Don't you remember me?

263
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,980
Not sure. Who are you?

264
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,030
I asked to see the CCTV records a few days ago.

265
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,460
CCTV?

266
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh-Oh, I remember.

267
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,830
What brings you here today?

268
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,970
I wanted to ask you something.

269
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,180
Is there

270
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:26,740
a foreigner among the people who used to work here?

271
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,600
Why do you ask?

272
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,840
Well, that fellow fixed my car.

273
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,220
So I want to thank him personally.

274
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:39,090
What are you thanking him for?

275
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,890
What is it?

276
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,110
Can't you just tell me?

277
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,320
Of course, I can.

278
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,570
If you're talking about a foreigner, are you talking about that bastard Tee Rab?

279
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,660
That bastard already quit.

280
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,150
Could you give me his phone number?

281
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,550
Well, they change their phone numbers so often.

282
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,520
Does it make sense for illegal aliens to keep phone numbers?

283
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,490
I see.

284
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,850
Oh, that's right.

285
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,070
That idiot said he'd come by to pick up some of his tools.

286
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,800
When?

287
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,300
When they say they'll come by, I don't know when.

288
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,400
I don't know why they're like that. They come when they want to.

289
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,350
I see.

290
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,870
Thank you.

291
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,020
Sure. Take care.

292
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,300
Hey, Chairman is here.

293
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm sorry, Chairman.

294
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,900
Madam was in too much pain.

295
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,440
I believed Woo One owned my life.

296
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,210
I thought I could do anything if it meant I could

297
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,920
lessen Madam's sorrow in any way.

298
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,760
Did my wife order you?

299
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,950
No, Chairman.

300
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,250
I'll ask you one more time.

301
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,060
Did my wife order you?

302
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,980
No.

303
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,060
You did it on your own accord?

304
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,130
M-Madam asked me to—

305
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,240
Let's clean up.

306
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,030
I see.

307
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,040
The auto shop owner called.

308
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,800
He was asked about a foreigner who used to work at the auto shop.

309
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,090
A foreign worker?

310
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,730
- Yes.
 - Why?

311
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,800
He wanted to thank him personally.

312
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,130
Thank him for what?

313
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,300
He said he didn't tell him that.

314
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,260
Sang Hyeok, where are you right now?

315
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,010
Why am I wanted—

316
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,690
Why did I become wanted?

317
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,610
I don't know the specifics.

318
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,870
But there's evidence you killed Lee Sang Taek and Jeong Hae Yong.

319
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,260
 Jang Chae Rim put the travel ban on you and put you on the wanted list. 

320
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,510
Both Chairman and Budu Gang are looking for you!

321
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,460
What happened?

322
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,750
I'm going to smuggle myself out.

323
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,600
Find me a ship.

324
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,800
- I'm in danger, too!
 - Why you little—

325
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,260
I'll deposit 100 million won in your account right now, so hurry.

326
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,510
Well, I'll look into it.

327
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,110
Welcome! Are you here to rent a car?

328
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,630
Yes.

329
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,770
Okay. What kind of car do you want?

330
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,100
A very ordinary one...

331
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,300
Well, 1,500 cc.

332
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,620
Is there any color you prefer?

333
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,440
Just plain old white.

334
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,840
You can take a look around here all you want.

335
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,110
I'd like one with very dark tinted windows.

336
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,560
Dark enough that you can't see inside from the outside.

337
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,580
Tinted windows?

338
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,220
That means...

339
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,800
Yeah.

340
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,030
I'm in a rush, so hurry it up.

341
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,700
To anywhere. Get one that leaves tomorrow at dawn.

342
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,490
Yeah. Yeah, okay! All right.

343
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,620
What the hell?

344
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,810
Gosh, just stay put, you punk.

345
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,270
Seonbae, I requested an arrest warrant for Kim Sang Hyeok for first-degree murder.

346
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,610
And it just got approved.

347
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,610
Hey, Jang Chae Rim.

348
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,190
So, why are you doing this to me?

349
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,060
Because I knew all along you've been handing over information to Woo One, Seonbae.

350
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,840
If I catch Kim Sang Hyeok and link you, you'll be guilty of accessory to murder.

351
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,960
Listen carefully, Seonbae.

352
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,500
My target is Kim Sang Hyeok.

353
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,780
As long as I catch Kim Sang Hyeok,

354
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,630
I can bury the crimes you committed deep down.

355
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,170
Unobtainable for the rest of your life.

356
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,030
Kim Sang Hyeok?

357
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,000
Yes.

358
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,490
Let's go.

359
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,710
Which ship am I taking?

360
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,180
Don't tell me this is the ship.

361
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,260
You paid a lot, so you'll be traveling in an expensive yacht.

362
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,660
Departure and arrival are both easier on a yacht.

363
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,090
You can think of it as a cruise trip.

364
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,380
This is the Korea Coast Guard. Stop right there.

365
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,940
This is a warning. Stop the engine.

366
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,100
Detective Bae, that motherf***er.

367
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,610
Geez...

368
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,270
Gosh, what an asshole.

369
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,230
I want to see my attorney.

370
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,970
Aigoo, we'll get you your attorney.

371
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,600
You called for the most expensive attorney two years ago, too.

372
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,610
Don't stall, and just get to it, please.

373
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,360
However, we're not at the police station.

374
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,820
This is a special investigations headquarters.

375
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,970
We'll conduct a special investigation on you.

376
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:39,210
You can call your attorney once the investigation is over. Do you understand?

377
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,770
Oh, I'm sure this is illegal.

378
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,100
I'll just be disciplined.

379
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,480
 Who are you? 

380
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,630
 Are you Lee Sang Taek? 

381
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,570
 Who are you? 

382
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,500
This isn't me.

383
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,160
Right. I knew you'd say that.

384
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,130
However,

385
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,580
there's a witness, you see.

386
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,550
I hid away...

387
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,900
that witness tightly.

388
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,230
The witness will show up when the trial begins.

389
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,060
This one will be hard to get out of.

390
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,800
 I am the person who... 

391
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,310
 accidentally witnessed something dangerous and important. 

392
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,900
 Think about it. 

393
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,150
 How much money it'd take for me to keep my mouth shut. 

394
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,000
 Jang Chae Rim 

395
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,580
 Jang Chae Rim 

396
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,500
 Hello, Judge. 

397
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,360
Yes. Did something happen?

398
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,580
We got Kim Sang Hyeok.

399
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,400
This is good news, so I've been calling you all morning to let you know first.

400
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,320
Everything is okay, right?

401
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,180
It's fine. What about that kid, Lee Cheong Gang?

402
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,960
I hid him in a safe place. Don't worry.

403
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,640
I don't know how Woo One will react.

404
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,870
So, I'm keeping Kim Sang Hyeok's arrest under maximum security.

405
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,130
I see. That's great.

406
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,540
Good job, Detective Jang.

407
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,890
- H-Huh, Tee Rab!
 - Tee Rab!

408
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,270
Man, I heard you're really leaving.

409
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,090
What will we do without you, Tee Rab?

410
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,250
I should make your coffee.

411
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,240
Tee Rab makes the best coffee.

412
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,310
- What will you do there?
 - I'll need to look.

413
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,950
You're a good worker with a great personality, so you'll be fine anywhere.

414
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,040
Let's get together for a meal before you go.

415
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,010
We need to grab a meal.

416
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,390
 Song Pan Ho left the auto shop and is on the move. 

417
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,020
What the heck?

418
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,940
Who the hell are you?

419
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,450
What are you doing here?

420
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,170
How did you know where we live?

421
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,640
- Please calm down— 
- How did you know where we live?

422
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,200
I tailed you because I wanted to talk.

423
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,180
Talk about what?

424
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,480
Let's negotiate.

425
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,430
Negotiate what?

426
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,290
How much money you want.

427
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,150
Is it on a scale I can give you?

428
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,830
I'll do whatever it takes to get you the money.

429
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,020
- Let's find a way—
 - If you're f***ing messing with me,

430
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,280
I'll tell Woo One Group everything right away.

431
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,300
I beg of you.

432
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,810
L-Let's find a way to resolve this quietly.

433
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,320
How much do you want?

434
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,790
Obviously, the more, the better.

435
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,780
One billion won.

436
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,720
With that money,

437
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,240
I can return to my country and live like a king.

438
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,070
I can't give you that much right now.

439
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:11,060
If I could, I wouldn't even have followed you here.

440
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,910
Shit!

441
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,730
Do you know what kind of person I am?

442
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,260
Am I a joke to you? You've got the balls to have tailed me!

443
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:30,060
Want me to kill your f***ing kid, too?

444
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,500
You didn't even bring the money I asked for. What bullshit is this?

445
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,600
Don't... do this...

446
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,740
Am I a joke to you?

447
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,100
Who the hell are you?

448
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,110
He turned 21 years old this year.

449
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,310
I asked him what he wanted most for his birthday,

450
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,570
and it was a motorcycle.

451
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,850
He said it could take him anywhere in the world he wanted to go.

452
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:44,980
He said it was fun and exciting wherever he went.

453
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,910
You killed...

454
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,680
a boy like that.

455
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,200
It was an accident.

456
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,060
I had no choice.

457
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:11,650
How could a judge manipulate and conceal a case?

458
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:17,870
What could be the only way for me to survive when I've killed your son?

459
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,680
This morning,

460
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,660
your son, Kim Sang Hyeok, was caught.

461
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,720
For murdering Lee Sang Taek and three members of the Budu Gang,

462
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,250
the Coast Guard caught him as he attempted to stow away.

463
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,480
There's evidence, too.

464
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,950
A video captured by Lee Sang Taek's son, Lee Cheong Gang.

465
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,560
It's not only that.

466
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,960
The explosion of Lee Sang Taek's house. Even arson....

467
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,940
Your son, Kim Sang Hyeok, did all that.

468
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,870
If his charges are revealed,

469
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,330
the death penalty would be inevitable.

470
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,960
I can...

471
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,120
get him a not-guilty verdict.

472
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,190
If you kill me now,

473
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,650
you'll also lose the chance...

474
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,740
to save your only remaining son.

475
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,010
Prove your promise.

476
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,480
Wh-Why are you doing this?

477
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,210
You're a judge!

478
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,430
H-How can a judge kill someone?

479
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,630
Until my last breath, I'll never speak of H-Ho Yeong-

480
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:08,900


481
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,740
 Your Honor 

482
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:20,150
♫  I'm breaking down to my voice  ♫

483
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,710
♫  Thank God it feels like home  ♫

484
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:26,970
♫  A wicked is born in the dark  ♫

485
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,370
♫  I never get it like that, mate  ♫

486
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:33,870
♫  Why not me? You always get it all  ♫

487
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,210
♫  It's not fair anymore  ♫

488
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:42,100
♫  What's on your mind? Where is the truth?  ♫

489
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,110
 I want him to pay for his crimes this time, no matter what. 

490
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,260
 Who are you? 

491
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,390
 I'm Kang So Yeong from Woowon District Prosecutors' Office. 

492
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,070
 The one who locked up your chairman. 

493
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,060
 The situation doesn't look good. 

494
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:56,150
 You must shake up the evidence and diversify legal interpretations. 

495
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,580
 Geez! 

496
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,230
 Jang Chae Rim didn't do anything wrong. 

497
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,080
 Why lay your hands on things you shouldn't? Why! 

498
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,090
-  There's nothing... 
 -  Do you know? 

499
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,780
 I shouldn't do.
