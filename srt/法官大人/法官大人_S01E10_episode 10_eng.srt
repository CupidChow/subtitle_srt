 Characters, places, organizations, incidents, names, ethnic groups, and settings are unrelated to reality.

 Final Episode 

20
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,580
 Don't you want revenge? 

21
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,670
 Do you know how many people died because of what you did? 

22
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,000
 Script based on series "Kvodo" by Ohad Knoller, Shlomo Moshiah and Ron Ninio 

23
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,700
 I'm sure he doesn't know 

24
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,670
 that it wasn't an accident 

25
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,440
 but a planned murder. 

26
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,190
I'm sure he'll take it all the way!

27
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,500
The one who colluded with him is named Tee Rab.

28
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,450
He's the punk Song Pan Ho shot to death that time.

29
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,600
Tee Rab's girlfriend apparently testified.

30
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,180
I'll meet that woman and verify.

31
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,050
 Woo One Group's oldest son, Kim Sang Hyeok, 

32
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,970
 was found not guilty at the first trial. 

33
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,060
 I am deeply thankful for the fair trial 

34
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,690
 and the judge's decision that created the fair trial, 

35
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,690
 and the team of attorneys who... 

36
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,990
 stood for my innocence to the end. 

37
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,980
 After the verdict hearing, as his attorney left the Woowon District Court... 

38
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,270
Until the day we die...

39
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,630
will we be able to get out of Kim Kang Heon's grasp?

40
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,350
 Kim Sang Hyeok's younger brother, the late Kim Sang Hyeon... 

41
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,250
 On this day, the Criminal Judges Panel of Woowon District Court 

42
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,450
 refused to uphold most of Kim Sang Hyeok's charges claimed by the prosecution 

43
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,500
 saying, "There is no proof of crime in all of the charges in this case." 

44
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,380
 Meanwhile, the stock price for Woo One Group, 

45
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,750
  owned by Kim Sang Hyeok's father, 

46
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,660
 Chairman Kim Kang Heon, rose more than two percent immediately after the acquittal. 

47
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,570
 Woo One Group's stock price went down to 143,000 won in early trading, 
   

48
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,850
 down about three percent from the previous session, 

49
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,410
 but rose more than two percent after the trial began in the afternoon... 

50

 Dad 

53
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,210
 Dad 

54
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,270
Oppa, do you want to take a look around this side, too?

55
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,900
Sure.

56
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Oppa, our house is pretty, right?

57
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,150
Yes, it's pretty.

58
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,710
He started planning it six months before the accident.

59
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,820
A punk named Tee Rab and a woman named Mi Ram hung around Sang Hyeon

60
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,650
and found out he'd receive a motorcycle for his birthday.

61
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,040
On his birthday, he followed Sang Hyeon.

62
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,440
And the accident happened.

63
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,000
Should I kick him out?

64
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,260
No, let him be.

65
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,600
He might threaten Eun.

66
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,860
He might do something terrible to Eun—

67
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm sorry.

68
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,810
I'll go get changed into something more comfortable. Sit here and wait a bit.

69
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,200
Okay.

70
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,090
 I didn't think... 

71
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,950
such a thing could be possible.

72
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,190
The possibility that

73
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,360
meek young kid could've murdered my child intentionally.

74
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,490
 The bastard who intentionally murdered Sang Hyeon 

75
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,160
is with my daughter right now.

76
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,150
What could he want?

77
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,720
 Does he want to avenge his dead mom? 

78
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,300
How dare he? Against me?

79
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,950
He must've approached my daughter, Eun, intentionally as well.

80
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,630
What's he trying to do?

81
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,500
I'll take him away.

82
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,390
Please don't do anything.

83
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,390
 All I wanted was... 

84
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,480
to get my eldest acquitted and

85
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,070
help the rest of my family members

86
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,080
go on peacefully as they did before Sang Hyeon's accident.

87
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,690
Were they...

88
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,430
Were they such difficult things to achieve?

89
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,160
He's still a young child.

90
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,890
I'll accept the consequences of his crimes.

91
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,080
I was planning to kill you

92
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,020
and put an end to the entire situation.

93
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,400
But that wasn't the answer.

94
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,830
Did you say your name is Ho Yeong?

95
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,830
Hello.

96
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,250
Thank you for...

97
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,520
protecting my Eun.

98
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,020
See you later.

99
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,550
Yes.

100
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,380
 Dad 

101
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,380
 Dad 

102
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,910
Who's this?

103
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,560
Are you mute?

104
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,650
Who the f*** are you?

105
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,450
Oppa!

106
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,000
- Oppa, you're home already?
 - Yes.

107
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,640
This is my oldest oppa.

108
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,540
Mom said the dinner's ready, so we should get going.

109
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,990
Okay.

110
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,790
But who's this?

111
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,380
Is he the boyfriend you mentioned last time, Eun?

112
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,680
Yes, it's Oppa Ho Yeong.

113
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,880
Nice to meet you.

114
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,130
By the way, didn't we meet somewhere?

115
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,240
Not sure.

116
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,080
Let's get going.

117
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,940
Oppa, come.

118
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
All right. Thank you.

119
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,010
You can come over.

120
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,770
Relax and be at home.

121
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,700
- And come visit often.
 - Okay.

122
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,460
Have a seat.

123
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,010

 The person you are calling is on another line. 

125
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,620
 You'll be connected to voicemail 

126
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,220
 and there will be an additional charge after the beep. 

127
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,750
 Press one to record a voice message.

 Press two to leave your phone number. 

129
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,950
 After the beep, please record your message 

130
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,330
 and press the star or pound key. 

131
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,930
If you'll ignore me to the end,

132
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,610
I'll also do what I can.

133
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,740
Please, not my son.

134
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,980
You had made... You made a promise to me!

135
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,760
You promised to spare my son!

136
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,460
I did everything you told me to do!

137
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,290
N-No, that's not it. I'm sorry.

138
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,960
There were times I deceived you to spare myself.

139
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,730
I'm so sorry.

140
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,170
I apologize, Chairman.

141
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,230
I'm sorry.

142
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,130
 I'll be the judge of my decision and action. 

143
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,590
Wait, don't hang up.

144
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,580
Don't hang up!

145
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,170
Son of a bitch...

146
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,700
How nice it would've been if Sang Hyeon were here with us.

147
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,580
It must've been tough for you all this time.

148
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,440
It wasn't that tough, really.

149
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,010
Everything was possible, just like living outside.

150
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,720
You provided for me, didn't you, Father?

151
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,760
But is he a decent guy?

152
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,710
Good enough to be invited to a dinner?

153
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,650
What do you think about Eun?

154
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,250
Isn't she a bit frustrating?

155
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,960
She talks and acts slowly.

156
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,560
No, Eun is a very kind person.

157
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,380
She's the kindest person I've met in my life.

158
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,870
 Prosecutor Kang So Yeong 

159
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,160
 Prosecutor Kang So Yeong 

160
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,500
Do you like my Eun a lot?

161
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,700
- Yes.
 - How much?

162
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,870
How much do you like her?

163
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,920
 Prosecutor Kang So Yeong 

164
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,330
Gosh, Father.

165
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,230
That's the most troublesome question for men.

166
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,220
What's the matter?

167
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,120
 Two years ago... 

168
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,490
Woo One's eldest son, Kim Sang Hyeok,

169
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,220
was investigated by the police for allegations of sexual assault.

170
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,670
You really haven't met me...

171
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,110
before?

172
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,190
I have.

173
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,720
When?

174
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,590
Precisely two years and three months ago.

175
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,100
Two years and three months ago?

176
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,090
That's quite specific.

177
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,680
Where did you see me?

178
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,790
In front of Gangam Police Station in Woowon City.

179
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,620
I saw you leaving after getting interrogated on a rape case.

180
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,250
This moron isn't normal.

181
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,680
Ho Yeong suffers from asthma.

182
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,080
He has difficulty breathing whenever he's sad or angry.

183
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,350
I'm sorry, Oppa.

184
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,250
The victim was Jo Eun Hye, Song Ho Yeong's mom.

185
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,710
As is fitting for Woo One,

186
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,600
 the case was dismissed. 

187
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,500
 Song Ho Yeong held a grudge for that and 

188
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,180
murdered your biological son, Kim Sang Hyeon.

189
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,260
 He planned the murder for six months 

190
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,580
and committed a murder disguised as a car accident.

191
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,370
 Tee Rab, who colluded with him, turned up dead. 

192
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,350
And Mi Ram, Tee Rab's girlfriend, is alive.

193
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,150
 This is what I heard from Mi Ram. 

194
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,090
He prepared meticulously to kill your son for six months.

195
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,500
That guy...

196
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,350
is probably with your daughter right now.

197
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,540
The victim was a woman named Jo Eun Hye.

198
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,030
The case was dismissed with no charges.

199
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,550
And that woman

200
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,260
took her own life a month later.

201
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,560
- That was my mom.
 - Enough.

202
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,480
This is enough?

203
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,540
Do you people have no regard for what kind of emotion

204
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,040
other people harbor as they go on?

205
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,880
Have you ever even imagined

206
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,730
the hell your victims have to live in?

207
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,470
Oppa, please don't do this. What's the matter?

208
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,500
Don't do this.

209
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,920
D-Dad, I'm sorry!

210
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,100
Get out of my house.

211
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,970
Don't ever show up in front of my Eun again.

212
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,770
Oh, f***! Jo Eun Hye...

213
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,890
Who was Jo Eun Hye?

214
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,740
Man, I have no idea who the f*** she was.

215
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,210
Lies.

216
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,770
How...

217
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,070
How can you not remember?

218
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,500
How can you not remember her?

219
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,600
How can you not even remember her?

220
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,200
Ho Yeong.

221
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Ho Yeong, Ho Yeong.

222
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,780
Please...

223
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,730
Please, Ho Yeong...

224
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,140
Stop it now.

225
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,450
Your father, Song Pan Ho, is on his way here.

226
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,840
Don't do what you'll regret and put the gun down.

227
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,790
Eun, hurry up and go to your room. Hurry.

228
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,010
I'll see this to the end.

229
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,260
No, I'm already at the end.

230
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,400
I've nowhere else to go.

231
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,920
Think of what you've done!

232
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,370
Each person's life holds different values!

233
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:06,370
My mom was more valuable than hundreds or thousands of trashy people like you!

234
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,880
Killing your entire family wouldn't be enough!

235
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,250
Oppa...

236
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,410
please don't do this. Please?

237
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,820
Please don't do this.

238
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,730
Don't do this. Please?

239
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,500
- I need to go in right now. 
 - You can't just enter. We'll search you first.

240
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,070
My son is in there. I'll just take him and leave.

241
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,440
Eun, don't.

242
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
Take your hand off the gun right now!

243
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,060
Don't do this, Oppa.

244
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,200
I'm sorry, Eun. I'm really sorry.

245
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,130
Oppa, don't do this.

246
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,160
I'm really sorry.

247
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,770
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

248
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,810
Ho Yeong!

249
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,470
- What is it?
 - There were gunshots inside—

250
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,170
Ho Yeong!

251
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,930
My Sang Hyeon was innocent.

252
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,340
It's over. That's enough now.

253
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,400
My Sang Hyeon was innocent.

254
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:12,300
My Sang Hyeon didn't do anything wrong.

255
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,740
It's all over. It's fine.

256
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,230
It's fine. It's fine now.

257
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,750
It's fine now.

258
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,670
Why the f*** would you grab there?

259
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,130
O-Oppa... Oppa...

260
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,600
O-Oppa, Oppa!

261
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,790
Oppa... Wh-Why? Oppa...

262
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,740
O-Oppa...

263
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,480
Why?

264
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,620
Oppa, wh-why? Oppa...

265
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,610
Why?

266
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,340
I'm sorry.

267
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,580
O-Oppa, you can't. Oppa!

268
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,460
- I'm sorry. 
 - Oppa...

269
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,730
No, Oppa!

270
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,740
No, Oppa, Oppa...

271
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,920
Oppa... Oppa!

272
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,140
Ho Yeong...

273
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,960
Ho Yeong...

274
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:32,340
Hey... Hey, let's go.

275
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,680
Hey.

276
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,940
Let's go.

277
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,550
Let's go.

278
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,650
Let's go.

279
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,700
Let's go...

280
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,950
Let's go.

281
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,150
Let's go.

282
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,710
 Police 

283
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,190
 Ho Yeong. 

284
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,680
 Ho Yeong. 

285
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,560
 Ho Yeong. 

286
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,200
He was shot three times and died at the scene.

287
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,000
He was already dead when he was transferred to the ambulance.

288
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,890
The perpetrator is being interrogated by the police right now.

289
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,250
Ho Yeong.

290
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,300
Let's go.

291
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,400
L-Let's go, Ho Yeong...

292
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,310
I don't know where that kid got it,

293
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,460
but he had a loaded pistol.

294
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,990
He threatened the Chairman and his family

295
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,090
and was about to shoot.

296
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,870
Because protecting them is my job,

297
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,710
I took out the gun I had and opened fire.

298
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,830
Where did you get the gun?

299
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,690
In the outskirts of this city, a gun is easier to buy than marijuana.

300
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,200
That must be how he got a gun.

301
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,400
I want to ask you now.

302
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,490
Isn't it your fault that even kids like him could get a gun and

303
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,210
attempt to kill people?

304
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,570
 KCSI Lee Jae Gyeong 

305
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,900
Yes.

306
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,710
 Yes, the fingerprint identification is done. 

307
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,800
 Out of the two guns collected at the scene, 

308
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,430
 only Song Ho Yeong's fingerprints were found on the first evidence item 

309
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,630
 and only Park Chang Hyeok's fingerprints were found on the second evidence item. 

310
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,760
I got it.

311
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,400
Shit.

312
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,020
You people will definitely pay for

313
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,270
the crimes you committed,

314
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,820
whether it's in 10 or in 100 years.

315
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,220
Shouldn't you catch the guy who sold the gun to Song Ho Yeong?

316
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,620
Shit!

317
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,980
The only way for you to live is

318
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,400
confessing to selling the gun to Song Ho Yeong. Okay?

319
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,860
Gun trafficking only gets you a few years.

320
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,450
F*** you, Woo One!

321
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,790
I killed him too quickly.

322
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,870
I should've made him suffer more than

323
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,430
my Sang Hyeon did.

324
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,100
I'm sure other people would've had no choice but to do the same.

325
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:59,210
If you hadn't done it, I would've done it.

326
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,070
Forget about it.

327
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:07,550
What's important is the lives of those left behind.

328
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,550
You'll have to go to the police as a material witness for a few days.

329
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,580
After the interrogation ends,

330
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,800
take Eun and go stay in Switzerland.

331
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,580
After things settle and emotions calm down,

332
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,900
you can come back here and

333
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,680
live on as if nothing happened.

334
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,670
We have nothing more to lose.

335
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,710
Did Ho Yeong...

336
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,380
really do that...

337
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,630
to Sang Hyeon?

338
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,500
Why?

339
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,190
Why?

340
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,040
Why?

341
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,550
Did Ho Yeong...

342
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,470
die?

343
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,610
Eun, wake up. Eun!

344
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,420
&nbsp;

345
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,160
It seems Ho Yeong bought a gun from someone named Kwon Wu Cheol

346
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,190
and sought out Kim Kang Heon.

347
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,900
There were gunshots fired inside the house.

348
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:06,020
Chairman Kim Kang Heon's secretary Park Chang Hyeok killed Ho Yeong

349
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,330
with a gun he had illegally. That's how the case is being built.

350
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,040
- Who really killed him— 
 - Enough.

351
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,040
That's enough.

352
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,050
Who really killed him

353
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,710
or if it was in self-defense...

354
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,000
None of that matters right now.

355
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,550
What matters

356
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,470
is what led us to this

357
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,240
and what have I done wrong?

358
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,090
Of course...

359
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,400
up until this point,

360
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,260
I've committed many wrongdoings.

361
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:54,700
However, if it meant I could protect Ho Yeong,

362
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,260
I believed I could do anything.

363
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,540
I gave my all in trying to save Ho Yeong.

364
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,160
"Let's just protect Ho Yeong."

365
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,000
Then, no matter what happened,

366
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,910
I thought it wouldn't matter.

367
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,850
But now,

368
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,780
Ho Yeong is dead.

369
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,750
How on earth...

370
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,850
did I lose my most precious son

371
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,530
when all I did...

372
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,760
was to try to protect him?

373
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,080
Dad.

374
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,040
Once you've recovered,

375
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,770
let's go somewhere far away with Mom

376
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,150
and quietly rest there

377
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,860
until everything has been forgotten.

378
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,400
Okay.

379
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,360
Thank you, my daughter.

380
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,020
I'm sorry, Dad.

381
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,230
Don't be, Eun.

382
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,350
You've done nothing wrong.

383
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,440
Everything is my fault.

384
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,950
I'm the one who's sorry.

385
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,440
I'm sorry.

386
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,370
 Woowon Gangam Police Station 

387
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,760
Please state what you witnessed at the scene.

388
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,460
We'll give you a separate answer to that in writing.

389
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,630
Ma Ji Yeong, who did that gun belong to?

390
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,400
- I— 
- We'll also respond to that in writing.

391
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,630
I've committed sins.

392
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,740
Thinking you were just an oblivious child.

393
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,980
Deluding myself into thinking you'd live a good life if I took care of you.

394
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,850
Believing you were oblivious,

395
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,860
you'd obediently do as I told you.

396
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,500
And...

397
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,340
Ahjeossi.

398
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:27,380
Why isn't Ho Yeong in the ossuary?

399
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,470
Oppa will disappear if you do this.

400
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,220
P-Please take him to the ossuary.

401
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,330
Why not?

402
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,380
Ho Yeong suffered so much

403
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,720
because of his mom and me.

404
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,900
I want to let Ho Yeong rest now.

405
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,110
Now that I know how much

406
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,460
Ho Yeong was hurting and suffering.

407
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,190
Then what do I do when I miss Oppa?

408
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,860
Let's hold it in.

409
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,500
Let's hold it in,

410
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,650
no matter how much we miss him.

411
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:32,710
I think that's what we should do for Ho Yeong's sake.

412
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,650
Let's let Ho Yeong rest.

413
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,100
I'm sorry.

414
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,590
You resent me, right?

415
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,160
It's all my fault.

416
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,780
I'm sorry.

417
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,320
Oppa,

418
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:17,840
I'm sorry for missing you every day.

419
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,080
From now on,

420
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,560
I'll try to hold it in by myself.

421
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,580
 You can leave now. 

422
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,030
 I'm sure Ho Yeong didn't feel lonely. 

423
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,400
 Okay. 

424
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,800
 I'm sorry, Ahjeossi. 

425
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,210
 No, you shouldn't feel sorry. 

426
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,620
 That's my burden. 

427
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,090
I thought...

428
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,690
I had the right to determine the weight

429
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:39,170
of a person's sins and punish him for that weight.

430
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,720
 That was very arrogant of me, 

431
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,440
 since a person will be appropriately punished for his crimes 

432
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,020
 in one way or another. 

433
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,920
 Through things that are caused by human relationships. 

434
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:07,150
 Even if I were to hide the crimes I've committed thus far, 

435
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:09,480
 it'd be of no use. 

436
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,460
 In the end, I reap the consequences. 

437
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,960
 No matter how much you struggle or try to run away, 

438
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,360
 you'll inevitably pay the price for your crimes. 

439
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,640
 I'm sure Sang Hyeon's death... 

440
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,750
 was the price of the crimes I committed in secret. 

441
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,910
 To hide those crimes, 

442
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,360
 I committed other crimes. 

443
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,960
 And to hide those crimes I committed, 

444
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,260
 I commit greater wrongdoings. 

445
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,620
 Human life is bound to continue like that. 

446
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,500
 All of those wrongdoings are 

447
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,170
 coming back to me in some form... 

448
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:20,060
 far more cruel than the things I've done. 

449
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,130
 It's not something you can hide even if you tried. 

450
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,230
 But when you hid it, 

451
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,510
 it's bound to come to you as a punishment far worse. 

452
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,120
 Had I realized my sins and repented,   

453
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,120
 could I have avoided the punishment? 

454
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,600
 There's serious damage to the cranial nerve... 

455
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,630
 I can't guarantee her physical function. 

456
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:04,830
 Unfortunately, the possibility of her recovery is... 

457
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,110
 When I've already committed wrongdoings, 

458
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,050
 can I avoid it just because I repent? 

459
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:20,820
 Punishment will come to you in whatever form. 

460
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,540
After Ho Yeong's accident,

461
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,530
I've done a lot of wrong things.

462
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:36,280
Actually, I think I've been living while committing countless wrongs

463
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,460
that I can't even bring myself to list from even before that.

464
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,260
I don't intend to hide anything.

465
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,900
I'll tell you everything that's happened so far.

466
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,660
No.

467
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,390
Punishment is to be served in order.

468
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,260
You're not the one who needs to be punished first.

469
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,180
It's Kim Kang Heon.

470
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,120
As for your crimes, bury them in your heart

471
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,230
until after Kim Kang Heon is caught.

472
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,290
Don't try to get out of the heavy burden of your crimes

473
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:24,540
merely by blaming yourself with your words.

474
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,640
 Can I trust him? 

475
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:03,130
I'm sure he's full of vengeance toward Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

476
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,480
Vengeance?

477
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,640
Isn't it too one-dimensional?

478
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,110
With convictions like justice or a sense of calling,

479
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,800
hasn't he already been defeated?

480
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,440
All those things have already been destroyed.

481
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,440
Let's tame him properly.

482
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,980
Since there's nothing scarier than a hunting dog raised properly.

483
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,900
I'll come meet him in person soon.

484
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,750
In the meantime...

485
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,070
have him ready.

486
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,200
We'll be seeing each other again soon.

487
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:21,170
Though your father must've protected you so far,

488
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,240
you'll have to protect your father from now on.

489
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:29,700
I came to warn you not to be too relaxed in the U.S.

490
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,370
You'll mess with my father?

491
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:36,000
Including Kim Kang Heon, you'll have to protect the entire Woo One.

492
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,800
A mere prosecutor will?

493
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,150
Using the power of law?

494
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,100
It seemed the law lost too much of its power.

495
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,540
I won't trust stuff like that anymore.

496
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:58,830
I'll have to fight using power above the law.

497
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,320
Let's meet again soon.

498
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,510
I thought I should come see you at least once.

499
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:20,900
Out of all the people I've met in the process,

500
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,870
Eun is the only one with no fault at all.

501
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,280
No matter how long I think or contemplate,

502
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,920
why was that child forced into making such a great sacrifice?

503
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,320
I don't know.

504
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,690
I'm just carrying on.

505
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,310
I don't necessarily have a purpose.

506
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,930
I'm just living on because I'm alive.

507
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,000
There's no meaning.

508
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,610
I hope you won't be able to forget it.

509
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,730
It's still not over?

510
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,530
Do you plan to get revenge?

511
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,370
With what power?

512
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,560
No.

513
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,880
It's repentance, not revenge.

514
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,800
The wrongdoings we've committed...

515
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,670
You and I must repent.

516
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,140
The wrongs we've done,

517
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:38,090
and the reason why those wrongdoings produced this result.

518
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:01,250
I thought I was someone who can and will

519
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,440
judge this terrible situation.

520
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,940
That's why I believed I could produce

521
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:14,350
the best result in the direction I wanted.

522
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,210
I was arrogant.

523
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,680
I've contemplated countless times now.

524
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,540
Why?

525
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:37,460
What exactly went wrong in the process?

526
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,750
I'm sure this was the most certain way, right?

527
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,580
The way to make us repent our sins.
