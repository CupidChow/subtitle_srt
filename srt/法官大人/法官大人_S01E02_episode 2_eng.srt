 so that I couldn't see anything.

What a mess.

51
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,820
 The police are investigating the hit-and-run case on the beltway. 

52
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,550
 They stated that they're investigating using the evidence collected at the scene. 

53
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,700
 Some say this case might be 

54
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,270
 a gang retaliation toward Chairman Kim Kang Heon of Woo One Group... 

55
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,870
Well...

56
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,200
 The police said speculation without evidence can confuse the investigation... 

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,850
- Of course, there's evidence. 
- Excuse me.

Welcome. How can I help you?

61
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,260
Would you like a document printed?

62
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,900
Well, my girlfriend...

63
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,050
Girlfriend?

64
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,930
Yes. I think she's seeing another man.

65
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,440
Girlfriend? Don't you mean your wife?

66
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,450
I mean, go ahead.

67
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,640
Yes, I happened to see my girlfriend's phone yesterday.

68
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,000
She got a text receipt for repairing a car here two days ago.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,570
So?

70
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,070
I think she came here with another man when she got the car fixed.

71
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,350
Oh, I see.

72
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,920
I'm sorry, but can I see the CCTV recording from that day?

73
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,130
I can't just show that to anyone.

74
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,620
No one can find out about it.

75
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,260
Yes, I suppose so.

76
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,660
If people find out that you showed me the recording,

77
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,810
I'd be in bigger trouble than you.

78
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,240
 Where are you? 

79
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,220
 - Cheong Ha is very sick right now.  
- Mother,

80
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,720
you can't even take care of a child at your age?

81
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,660
 Where's Cheong Gang? That SOB didn't come home last night, either, huh? 

82
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,440
He's never helpful. He takes after his mom.

83
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,780
Take her to the hospital first.

84
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,920
Play this one...

85
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,580

86
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,350
Was it the 8th, did you say? The 7th?

87
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,020
A-April...

It's the 7th.

89
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,050
The 7th.

90
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,750
There are so many.

91
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,660
What time?

92
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,860
I think it was around three in the afternoon.

93
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,400
Three o'clock...

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,900
Okay, have a look at this.

95
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,150
- I don't think I see it.
 - May I have a look at it myself?

96
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,550
Okay, go ahead.

That woman is your girlfriend?

102
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320

103
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,210
closely for five more minutes?

104
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,820
Pardon?

105
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,930
I want to find out who this bastard is.

106
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,720
I think it's someone I know.

107
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,820
Things like this happen with people you know.

108
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,170
I know.

109
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,770
Could I have a closer look?

110
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,970
Just five minutes, then.

111
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,200
 A motorcycle knocked over on the coastal highway in Woowon City. 

112
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,550
- He's screwed now.
  - There are fragments of the motorcycle. 

113
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,500
 - Kim Sang Hyeon was riding the motorcycle around 7:30.  
- You can get into a car accident once.

114
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,960
 - But while making a right turn... 
 - But the problem is...

115
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,110
- that the victim is Chairman Kim Gang Heon's son.
 - A citizen who found Kim... 

116
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,080
He's basically totally screwed. 
 CCTV_20240408_0800.mp4 

117
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,070
There's nothing more to say. There's no way out.

118
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,520
He needs to sacrifice his life to settle.

119
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,870
 The victim's brother, Mr. Kim Sang Hyeok, said the culprit needs to be severely punished. 

120
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,300
 When a wild dog mauls a man to death, 

121
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,280
 we scour the whole mountain to wipe out the pack of wild dogs. 

122
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,350
 That's justice. 

123
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:05,080
That means Woo One Group will find the culprit themselves. 
 CCTV_20240408_0800.mp4

125
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,220
That's what he means, right?

126
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,320
 but he ended up passing away. The police secured... 

127
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,500
Woo One Group is really scary.

128
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,290
If they catch the culprit, they won't send him to the police.

129
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,110
They'll kill him.

130
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,950
Even if you kill someone in a hit-and-run,

131
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,460
you only get five years in prison.

132
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,170
His precious son was killed. The mighty Chairman Kim Kang Heon

133
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,180
won't be satisfied with five years in prison. No way.

134
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,910
He'd kill him without anyone knowing.

135
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,980
The body won't be found, either.

136
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,040
They'd chop it up or burn it.

137
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,110
They'd figure it out.

138
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,970
 ...asked to refrain from it. 

139
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,730
 Yesterday, Woo One Group's Chairman Kim Kang Heon's younger son... 

140
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,860

I'm sorry.

148
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,130
 The police secured the CCTV recordings in the area... 

149
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,530
Well, cheer up, sir. Don't cry.

150
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,800
 Kim, the victim, turns out to be the son of Chairman Kim Kang Heon... 

151
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,760
Cheer up.

152
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,160
The kid who fixed the tire wouldn't know about the accident, right?

153
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,780
It looked like he talked to you briefly.

154
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,920
He said the tire seemed old.

155
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,700
He thought I should replace all four of them.

156
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,280
There was blood on your shirt.

157
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,320
He probably didn't see it.

158
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,410
I was wearing a hoodie. I zipped it up all the way, too.

159
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,910
If the repairman noticed anything weird about your car,

160
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,950
both of us will be done for. Are you certain?

161
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Yes.

162
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,150
He didn't notice anything.

163
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,640
He would've asked me about it if he did.

164
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,060
And...

165
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,920
there's one thing left.

166
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,790
What is it?

167
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,810
You.

168
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,580
Even if they find evidence and investigate you,

169
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,910
you must deny it until the end.

170
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,790
You can't do anything with that look on your face.

171
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,700
Starting now, our lives depend on your facial expressions and behavior.

172
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,090
Keep that in mind.

173
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,740
I'll have a pack of cigarettes.

174
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,660
 Dad 

175
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,490
- You're all set.
 - Okay.

176
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,090
 Dad 

177
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,400
Are you out of your mind?

178
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,180
- What's wrong?
 - When will you come home?

179
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,860
What do you care? All you do is get drunk and hit me.

180
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,300
You son of a bitch.

181
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,380
Give this money to Grandma. Tell her it's Cheong Ha's hospital bill.

182
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,420
F***. What's the point of working to death?

183
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,550
They're no help whether they're young or old.

184
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,980
I mean...

185
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,150
Chief, you can't give us the case the Traffic Department couldn't handle.

186
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,340
This is the Violent Crimes Department.

187
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,860
You know how many cases there are in Woowon City every night.

188
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,330
Yes. Even—

189
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,730
Even with the higher-up's order, we can't.

190
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,760
We won't allow it. Chief—

191
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,170
He hung up. What the f***.

192
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,580
 Jang Chae Rim 

193
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,880
Hello, Judge Song.

194
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,220
What brings you here?

195
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,800
I heard you stopped by the Traffic Department yesterday.

196
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,780
Is something going on?

197
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,710
Feel free to talk to me.

198
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,330
I'm dying to know.

199
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,120
To be honest,

200
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,700
a car got stolen.

201
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,190
Really? Your car?

202
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,260
Not mine.

203
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,630
It's Eun Hye's old car.

204
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,400
Ho Yeong obsesses over that car because he can't get over his mom.

205
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,230
I thought it was for the better at first.

206
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,510
But he's feeling down since the car is gone.

207
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,780
He won't talk much, and he won't eat, either.

208
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,100
He'll get over it since he's a grown-up.

209
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,130
But if that car turns up later by chance,

210
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,100
I think he'll feel very confused.

211
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,980
So, if you happen to find it, don't tell...

212
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,490
anyone but me.

213
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,710
I'll take care of it.

214
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,180
Okay. I'll do that.

215
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,430
 Try thinking from the kids' perspective. 

216
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,680
 That sweet kid misses her mom 

217
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,800
and cries all night, holding back.

218
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm her grandma, but I didn't know that child was hurting.

219
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,200
It's so pathetic.

220
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
 You should stop drinking and stop hitting them, too. 

221
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
For f***'s sake.

222
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,310
You think I feel good? Mom,

223
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,010
 I feel plenty stressed, too. 

224
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,160
I sent money through Cheong Gang today.

225
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,620
Take her to the hospital or whatever.

226
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,940
What?

227
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,660
F***. I told you to take her to the hospital.

228
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,840
Hey, Lee Sang Taek.

229
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,370
Director Jeong.

230
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,400
 Let's keep things clean. 

231
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,940
Go to the address I send you and just deliver the car.

232
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,450
Don't get distracted and cause trouble.

233
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,610
I'll kill you for real.

234
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,070
Okay.

235
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,000
 3878, Honors. Pull over to the right. 

236
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,620
 You ran a red light. 

237
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,840
 Pull over to the right. 

238
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,150
Is something going on these days?

239
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,100
Han is worried. He thinks something's going on.

240
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm not sure.

241
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,370
My head feels heavy these days.

242
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,690
Did you know we call you "Scale" behind your back?

243
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,010
Scale?

244
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,230
You said judges have scales in their heads

245
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,630
and what we do is balance crime and punishment.

246
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,940
You've always said that to us.

247
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,220
That's what I thought.

248
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,730
But I don't feel that these days.

249
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,680
I thought I'd been living with the strength of my brain.

250
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,450
But I guess I'm getting old.

251
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,660
I keep wanting to live with the strength of my heart.

252
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,620
You ran a red light. Show me your license, please.

253
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,000
 Name: Lee Sang Taek 

254
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,110
Please look up 28-Ro-3878, Honors.

255
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,090
Wh-What are you doing?

256
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,920
Get back in the car.

257
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,440
I hope you understand.

258
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,590
Ever since I lost my wife two years ago,

259
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,010
I'm living with my sick mother and a six-year-old girl.

260
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,790
The older kid won't go to school, and he causes trouble every day.

261
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,370
I'm so frustrated with my life.

262
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,600
Don't give me stuff like that.

263
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,610
You'll get punished more heavily for bribing.

264
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,580
I'll just let you go today.

265
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,100
Follow the traffic rules from now on.

266
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,430
Thank you! Thank you!

267
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,910
 28-Ro-3878, Honors was confirmed stolen. 

268
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,650
What?

269
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,380
Shit, I'm screwed.

270
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,250
What's wrong with you? Calm down.

271
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,460
Don't move! I'll shoot you if you move!

272
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,380
Hey, hey! Stop!

273
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,680
- Are you okay?
 - Yes.

274
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,670
8783. 8783. Stolen car. The suspect fled.

275
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,780
Assistance needed.

276
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,970
Ho Yeong!

277
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,500
Have you been home all day?

278
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,050
Yes.

279
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm sorry.

280
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,970
Because of me,

281
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,400
even you committed a crime.

282
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,030
I feel bad about that.

283
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,840
I found the vehicle.

284
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,530
I wanted to let you know quietly since you asked me to,

285
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,310
but it became a problem because the thief assaulted an officer and fled.

286
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,300
I think we should start investigating.

287
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,480
Where's the vehicle?

288
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,500
It's in our jurisdiction storage.

289
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,030
There's nothing wrong with the vehicle.

290
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,300
I searched the trunk and the glove box,

291
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,960
but it doesn't seem it was used for a crime.

292
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,300
The bumper on this side was damaged.

293
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,650
It's always been like that.

294
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,410
Do you know who stole it?

295
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,500
It's someone named Lee Sang Taek.

296
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,390
He's a man in his 40s who lives in Jangbeom-dong.

297
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,110
May I take the car?

298
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,650
We'll have to investigate it further.

299
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,920
That's the rule normally,

300
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,140
but you're Judge Song.

301
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,230
I'll let you take it with you. Just one second.

302
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,080
 Towed Vehicles Storage Office 

303
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,920
The release was approved.

304
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,460
I'll place the car here for you.

305
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,300
I said it was your car, and they approved it right away.

306
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,160
Please sign here.

307
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,110
Oh, right. The tire went flat.

308
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,250
It'd be difficult to drive it now.

309
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,070
I'll take it to the repair shop I know.

310
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,670
- I can drive there, right? 
- No.

311
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,850
That'd be dangerous. The steering wheel would veer off.

312
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,640
I think you need a tow truck.

313
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,100
- We could just replace the tire and bring it to you. 
- No.

314
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,870
I'll call a tow truck and take it with me.

315
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,920
We have a tow truck, too.

316
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,330
We can go right now, then, right?

317
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,680
Why did the tire go flat?

318
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,570
What's this? Hold on, sir!

319
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,170
What?

320
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,990
Is this why the tire went flat?

321
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,210
What's this?

322
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,850
It looks like a motorcycle part.

323
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,260
Is it a fender?

324
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,370
- Fender?
 - Yes.

325
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,940
What's the date the vehicle was stolen?

326
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,140
I think it was the night of April 7th.

327
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,800
What's the date your son drove the vehicle last?

328
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,180
The vehicle was gone when I left for work on the morning of April 8th.

329
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,750
He probably drove it until the night of April 7th.

330
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,010
He was at the library until late at night to study for the exam.

331
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,420
You said he goes to Hanguk University, right?

332
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Yes. But...

333
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,320
are you sure what you found in the vehicle is the fender of the motorcycle from the accident?

334
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,200
Well, we'll have to look into it further,

335
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,810
but the motorcycle from the accident was missing the fender.

336
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,140
Why do you ask?

337
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,270
Since my wife used to drive the car,

338
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,220
I don't want it to be involved with an unfortunate case like that.

339
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm sorry.

340
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,310
You shouldn't apologize for it.

341
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,910
This is just for formality,

342
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,630
but I'd like to talk to your son as a material witness.

343
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,630
Would that be necessary?

344
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,570
It's just for formality. We need to write the witness report.

345
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,470
When?

346
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,780
The case got bigger than expected.

347
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,120
I'd like to do it now.

348
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,340
If you kill someone in a hit-and-run and assault as an officer,

349
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,920
how long do you serve?

350
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,100
Are you asking me?

351
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,300
Yes. I thought you'd know since you're a judge.

352
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,950
How rude.

353
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,210
That's like asking me to estimate the price of an object.

354
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,830
I'm sorry, Judge Song.

355
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,020
Come on in.

356
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,270
Is he not home? Should we call him?

357
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,690
No, he's probably upstairs.

358
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,850
Have a seat here for a moment.

359
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,710
Why are the police here?

360
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,330
How did you know the police were here?

361
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,100
I saw them.

362
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,170
The car was found.

363
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,150
They found a motorcycle fender part under the bottom.

364
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,640
It was stolen for two days,

365
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,270
and the thief is on the run after assaulting an officer.

366
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:31,120
When was the last time you drove the car?

367
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,840
Two days ago.

368
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,140
Yes, that's correct.

369
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,980
Come out.

370
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,180
When was the last time you drove the vehicle?

371
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,590
The night of April 7th?

372
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,070
It's been two days.

373
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,560
I studied at the library until late and drove back home.

374
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,580
You found out it was stolen the day after?

375
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,350
Yes.

376
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,520
I went out to go to school, but it was gone.

377
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,810
I thought Dad took it to Grandma's house at first,

378
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,990
but he said he didn't when I asked him.

379
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,730
How did the culprit take the car key?

380
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,750
My grandma always kept a spare key in the glove box.

381
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,300
You can't lock new cars if there's a key inside,

382
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,670
but you can lock that one because it's old.

383
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,210
I think the culprit probably found that key.

384
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,820
To steal the vehicle, he probably needed a car key.

385
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,580
How did Lee Sang Taek know a spare key was in the glove box?

386
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,610
Maybe he didn't intend to steal the vehicle.

387
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,660
While trying to steal what's inside the car,

388
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,730
I wonder if he found the car key in the glove box by chance.

389
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,650
You're right. You're smart, Ho Yeong.

390
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,650
I'm sorry for doing this so late. We had to start investigating before tomorrow.

391
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,720
You must be tired. Rest in your room.

392
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,100
We'll just finish the coffee and go.

393
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,180
Okay.

394
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,390
 May the deceased rest in peace 

395
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,460
Sang Hyeon...

396
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,600
My Sang Hyeon. It's too hot in there.

397
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,230
Sang Hyeon is burning!

398
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,500
Stop it!

399
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,360
It must be too hot for him!

400
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,820
What do we do?

401
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,600
My Sang Hyeon!

402
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,650
Sang Hyeon!

403
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,260
Sang Hyeon!

404
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,640
 Rest in Peace Kim Sang Hyeon 

405
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,570
 Woo One Group 

406
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,960
 Rest in Peace Kim Sang Hyeon 

407
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,650
It's your baby tooth you pulled out yourself.

408
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,760
You were so scared to pull out your tooth,

409
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,150
so I slapped you on the butt.

410
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,280
You cried for about two hours,

411
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,790
but pulled it out yourself and brought it to me.

412
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,230
Since I was upset about it...

413
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:00,610
you gave it to me as a present so I wouldn't be upset.

414
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,090
I've kept it to this day

415
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,600
because I was grateful for your feelings.

416
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:16,950
Now... I'll give it back to you.

417
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,930
Rest easy.

418
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,820
Thank you...

419
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,290
for caring me...

420
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,840
all this time.

421
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,910
Here they are.

422
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,490
I heard it could be a reprisal from a rival gang. Is that true?

423
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,800
Do you have faith in the authorities?

424
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,470
I heard you're trying to find the culprit.

425
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,480
- Please respond briefly! 
- A comment, please!

426
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,940
Are you going to run the Woo One Group in the future?

427
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,330
You have four months left in your sentence.

428
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,710
Will you return to jail after the funeral?

429
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,410
- What do you plan for the Woo One Group? 
- How do you feel?

430
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,310
Please tell us about the future plans!

431
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,610
I'll find the bastard who killed Sang Hyeon and take revenge.

432
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,460
Go back to the US.

433
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,290
If it were Grandpa...

434
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,260
What do you think Grandpa would've done?

435
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,990
Shit...

436
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,210
All the bones in his body were broken

437
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,450
and he was left there for thirty minutes.

438
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,890
He must've been in...

439
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,620
so much pain until he died.

440
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,620
Even a splinter in the fingertip hurts so much.

441
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,350
But his bones were broken.

442
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,990
Why are you...

443
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,660
not doing anything?

444
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,790
Catch the bastard who did that to Sang Hyeon and make him suffer the same way.

445
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,500
That way, Sang Hyeon can close his eyes.

446
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,930
What kind of dad are you?

447
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,480
Did you even love our son?

448
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,070
How could you do this?

449
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,350
At least for me,

450
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:34,720
you should catch him and pay him back.

451
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,910
How could you not even get angry?

452
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,880
How?

453
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,610
How could you do this?

454
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,690
Dear, I'm not angry.

455
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,860
What?

456
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,030
Are you really Sang Hyeon's dad?

457
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,130
You bought him the motorcycle.

458
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,870
He died because of you.

459
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,070
You should take responsibility. How...

460
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,190
How could you say you're not angry?

461
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
I'm not angry...

462
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,440
because it hurts too much.

463
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,240
I'm too sad that...

464
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,230
I don't have a moment to feel angry.

465
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,190
I don't even remember how to get angry.

466
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,060
I'd like Chang Hyeok to come.

467
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,550
He's the most trustworthy one, anyway.

468
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,910
Make sure I can see him tomorrow morning.

469
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,580
The audio recording.

470
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,830
 Woowon Fire Station Recording 

471
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,870
 Hello, this is 119. What's your emergency? 

472
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,260
 Woowon Fire Station Recording 

473
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,560
 Excuse me, are you all right? 

474
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,720
Isn't it painful to listen to your son breathe?

475
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,730
It's not Sang Hyeon's breathing.

476
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,050
It's the breathing of someone with asthma.

477
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,040
The vehicle was reported stolen.

478
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,660
While being given a ticket by our officer,

479
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,970
the thief assaulted the officer and ran.

480
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,140
It's a man named Lee Sang Taek.

481
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,740
He used to live in Jangbeom-dong.

482
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,900
He works for Jo Mi Yeon of Budu Gang.

483
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:03,450
And on the bottom of the vehicle, a Fastervik Kiruna motorcycle's fender was found.

484
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,400
It looked like the one your younger son was driving.

485
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:16,530
And the headlight cover that was found at the scene belonged to a 2007 Honors.

486
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,460
Chairman,

487
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,840
you can tell the headlight cover was replaced if you look at this.

488
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,310
This is also a 2007 model.

489
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,970
I'm certain Lee Sang Taek is the culprit.

490
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Do you have a child, Team Leader Bae?

491
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,790
I have two elementary schoolers.

492
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,360
I'll do my best to catch Lee Sang Taek quickly, Chairman.

493
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm not telling you to catch him quickly.

494
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,830
There are a few things the police haven't discovered yet.

495
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,990
What are they?

496
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,640
All the information on Lee Sang Taek.

497
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,140
I'd like to see it by tomorrow morning.

498
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,150
I'll get it ready, sir.

499
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,660
Yes, he left just now.

500
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,220
He left just like that?

501
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,740
Okay.

502
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,280
Got it.

503
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,150
Did a trivial guy like him...

504
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,910
Did a trivial guy like him kill my Sang Hyeon?

505
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,990
Someone so pathetic...

506
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,380
killed my Sang Hyeon?

507
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,680
How could that be?

508
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,810
How could someone so pathetic...

509
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,000
kill my Sang Hyeon?

510
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,590
His life isn't worth as much.

511
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,610
It doesn't even compare!

512
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,140
Please give me room to sit.

513
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
I have bad knees.

514
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,250
I'll keep it short. Listen while standing.

515
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,480
Does Lee Sang Taek work for you?

516
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,920
The Jangbeom-dong residents sometimes work for us and sometimes don't.

517
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,070
If we call them, they become ours

518
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,440
and if we don't, they aren't ours.

519
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,870
Lee Sang Taek...

520
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,920
isn't someone we contacted.

521
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:01,210
I don't think anyone planned to murder my son.

522
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,220
You had no reason to provoke us.

523
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:11,230
But if it turns out you dared try to hide the truth,

524
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,610
I can no longer sit still.

525
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,820
Applying fake ointment to my wound

526
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,650
would be unforgivable.

527
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,920
We'll help you as much as we can.

528
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,090
As much as you can?

529
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,870
We're a bit flustered by this, too.

530
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,160
I'll get going since my knees are bad.

531
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,690
Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa's people called.

532
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,160
What for?

533
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,570
They asked us to take care of a car.

534
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,790
It turns out it was the car from the accident.

535
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,410
When?

536
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:24,240
Jeong Yi Hwa called me and asked me to get rid of it on the evening of the 8th.

537
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,020
The hit-and-run happened on the morning of the 8th.

538
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,300
The problem is the car belongs to Judge Song Pan Ho's mother-in-law.

539
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,650
Isn't it obvious?

540
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,310
Call Jeong Yi Hwa.

541
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,600
I told you not to call me during the day.

542
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,990
What?

543
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,140
What are you talking about?

544
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,440
How does that make sense?

545
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,650
Is it true?

546
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,820
 Jeong Yi Hwa 

547
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,340
Who is it?

548
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,070
What happened?

549
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,240
I was just about to call you.

550
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,780
Do you have a cigarette?

551
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:58,590
What happened? Say something.

552
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:03,090
You asked me to get rid of the car

553
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,680
after the Woo One chairman's son was killed in the hit-and-run.

554
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,880
Tell me.

555
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,940
There are no secrets between us.

556
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,120
I did it.

557
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,880
I went to the police to turn myself in,

558
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,470
but when I heard the victim was Chairman Kim Gang Heon's younger son,

559
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,500
I turned around.

560
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,160
It became something the law can't fix.

561
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,230
If the law were to punish me,

562
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:49,150
I'd have to pay for my sin, but...

563
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,630
the one I'm facing is Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

564
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,410
Chairman Kim Kang Heon is looking everywhere

565
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,570
for someone named Lee Sang Taek.

566
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,970
If they end up finding him,

567
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:15,180
I'll be in danger, too. Not only you.

568
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,050
Lee Sang Taek?

569
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,410
He apparently lives in Jangbeom-dong.

570
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,630
Lee Sang Taek?

571
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,740
That sounds familiar.

572
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,750
Have a seat.

573
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,310
There is one way.

574
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,850
Tell me. I'll do anything.

575
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,280
I'll have to risk my life, too.

576
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,060
I need to survive first.

577
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,870
There's nothing I won't do if I can.

578
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,300
Send Lee Sang Taek to Southeast Asia.

579
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,470
So, he never gets caught.

580
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:27,590
If we pay him handsomely and make sure he never returns here,

581
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,870
he'll be responsible for the accident.

582
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:37,140
You'll be able to distance yourself from the case forever, then.

583
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,800
P-Please make that happen.

584
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,430
We're finally in the same boat.

585
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,820
 Woowon District Court 

586
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,850
Lee Sang Taek.

587
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,480
I've definitely heard of that name.

588
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,820
Lee Sang Taek...

589
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,340
Lee Sang Taek...

590
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:34,440
284, Pyeonghwa-ro, Deogwang-gu...
 Lee Sang Taek, Children: Lee Cheong Gang, Lee Cheong Ha, Mother: Kim Mi Yeong 

591
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,000
Are you busy?

592
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,990
Pardon?

593
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,940
The trial result for Case No. 4536.

594
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,160
There's something strange about it.

595
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,140
Please write up a summary and leave it on my desk.

596
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,060
Is something going on these days?

597
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,530
Why do you ask?

598
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:59,550
You're asking me to write a summary again.

599
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,940
Doesn't everyone do that?

600
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,270
They do.

601
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:09,070
But you're Judge Song Pan Ho.

602
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,540
You read trial material more thoroughly than anyone in the world.

603
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:18,440
People change as they age.

604
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:58,370
It was on your desk, and I brought it here.

605
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,310
It's something you like, Oppa.

606
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:09,970
I thought having it near you would make you happy.

607
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,120
Thank you.

608
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,410
Oppa!

609
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,450
Oppa!

610
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,820
Oppa!

611
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,410
Oppa!

612
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,830
Oppa!

613
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,500
 Hyoan Nursing Hospital 

614
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,210
Cheong Ha.

615
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,720
Did you pee your pants again today?

616
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,680
Did you go to the restroom okay?

617
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,040
Yes.

618
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,260
You didn't cry, either?

619
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,410
No.

620
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:47,760
Gosh, you're so good. Why did you cause trouble all this time?

621
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,660
I'm sorry, Grandma.

622
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,110
Let's do this.

623
01:01:56,110 --> 01:02:00,930
Let's get your favorite fried chicken tonight.

624
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,590
Wow!

625
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,130
Aigoo. Wait for me.

626
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,380
Aigoo.

627
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,620
Are we really eating fried chicken?

628
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,550
Of course.

629
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:41,390
 Thank you. 

630
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:45,360
 Thank you for your thoughtful judgment. 

631
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,180
 Please... 

632
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,530
 give her time to finish her snack. 

633
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,940
 You are truly a great judge. 

634
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:31,520
What's this?

635
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,460
Is it leaking again?

636
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:11,100
Cheong Ha... Cheong...

637
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:23,760


638
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,540
 Your Honor 

639
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,650
♫  Ash  ♫

640
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:40,240
♫  It's burned to ashes, without a trace  ♫

641
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:46,560
♫  Disperse.  You become yesterday like smoke.  ♫

642
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,690
♫  Deep down to the bottom  ♫

643
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,800
 His old mother and a young daughter were killed. 

644
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,600
 You don't know what he'd do if he found out his house burnt down. 

645
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,170
 I can't just let this one slide. 

646
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:04,780
 Is Lee Sang Taek the culprit who killed my son and ran? 

647
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,650
 I assume so. 

648
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:10,010
 I'll find the culprit who killed Sang Hyeon. 

649
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,660
 The father who lost his child will go to the edge of hell. 

650
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,740
