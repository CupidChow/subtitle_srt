00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,170
 Son Hyun Joo  
 ♫  Just a look across the sidewalk.  ♫

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,700
 Kim Myung Min

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,010
♫  Love.  ♫ 
  ♫  That's your little life hug.  ♫

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,910
 Kim Do Hoon

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,010
 Heo Nam Joon

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,710
♫  Someday we'll come when this makes sense  ♫

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,470
♫  But for now, it's time to rest  ♫

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,100
 Your Honor 

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,830
 This is a work of fiction. 

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,080
 Characters, places, organizations, incidents, names, ethnic groups, and settings are unrelated to reality. 

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,470
If we mess with him recklessly,

13
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,870
I'll end up losing everything.

14
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,280
If we have Budu Gang's intel and Song Pan Ho's power,

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,770
don't we have a chance against Woo One?

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,240
Our intel?

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,470
Lee Sang Taek's family.

18
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,250
The gas explosion that happened in their home.

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,500
Woo One killed Jo Bin, too.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,610
You people know what happened.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,760
This is Song Pan Ho's plan.

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,610
Have faith and come along.

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,250
 Aren't you trying to get Chairman Kim Kang Heon? 

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,730
After Kim Sang Hyeon, the second son of Woo One died,

25
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,900
a lot happened.

26
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,580
And we're the biggest victims of all those happenings.

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,590
The suspect of Kim Sang Hyeon's hit-and-run death, Lee Sang Taek...

28
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,180
Do you know who killed his mother and daughter?

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,770
Why?

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,390
Is there another suspect besides Kim Sang Hyeok?

31
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,370
The madam of Woo One.

32
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,060
Did you secure any evidence?

33
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,590
Would I have asked to see you without evidence?

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,680
Judge Song Pan Ho, Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa, CEO Jo Mi Yeon,

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,970
and Prosecutor Kang So Yeong.

36
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,970
What were they trying to do?

37
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,880
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong was investigating the fire incident in Jangbeom-dong.

38
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,800
If you look at just the pictures,

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,280
it seems she got the idea from you.

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,340
Explain.

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,230
I'm Prosecutor Kang So Yeong of Woowon District Prosecutors' Office.

42
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,560
Ma Ji Yeong.

43
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,370
You're under arrest for instigated murder and arson.

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,830
 Chairman, Madam has just been... 

45
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,720
Stand up.

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,350
Do you dare to mess with my family?

47
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,310
What do you mean? Mess with your family?

48
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,190
Whatever you do, wherever you are in this world,

49
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,860
I'll know everything.

50
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,560
And you'll pay for it.

51
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,140
 Your Honor: Episode 6 

52
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,190
 Script based on series "Kvodo" by Ohad Knoller, Shlomo Moshiah and Ron Ninio 

53
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,540
Got a cigarette?

54
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,760
I guess you have absolutely no interest in what impression you make on people

55
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,690
or what they think of you at all, huh?

56
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,330
Where do you people get your complacent attitudes from?

57
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,150
Does it seem too unimaginable that you were arrested with a warrant?

58
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,770
I wonder which judge approved my arrest warrant.

59
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,630
If the law says you're wrong, please let's get a little scared.

60
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,340
You're f***ed.

61
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,150
 Yes, Madam. 

62
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,600
 As I told you last time, he's good at this kind of job.  

63
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,670
Lee Sang Taek isn't home right now because he's on the run.

64
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,950
Yes, his old mother and young daughter are the only ones home.

65
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,590
His son rarely comes home, apparently.

66
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes, I'll get it done tomorrow evening.

67
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,760
The one on the phone is Jang Hyeon Soo, right?

68
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,040
When I looked up his call history around the time this video was taken,

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,620
his phone was connected to a phone under Woo One's madam's name.

70
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,030
As proof of  Woo One's participation,

71
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,220
isn't it too sloppy?

72
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,260
Since Jang Hyeon Soo has been missing for about nine days now

73
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,540
and Jo Bin's murder, disguised as a suicide, was a few days ago,

74
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,580
it's hard to prove it directly.

75
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,520
As expected, it was a work worthy of the Woo One Group.

76
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,640
However, various things that happened after Kim Sang Hyeon's death in a car accident...

77
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,090
All those incidents are pointing at Woo One.

78
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,050
Are you saying you want to arm wrestle with us?

79
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,340
Gosh, going head-to-head would be difficult.

80
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:38,770
That's why I brought our noble madam of Woo One here.

81
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,590
Because I always start with the weakness like a hyena.

82
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,510
I'm the weakness?

83
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,080
The most frightening weakness for a head of a household...

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,940
is his family.

85
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,990
Eun, were you scared?

86
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,510
Mom will be back soon.

87
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,440
Don't worry.

88
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,780
When?

89
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,160
As soon as possible.

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,570
I will bring your mom home as soon as possible.

91
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,270
 Whatever you do, wherever you are in this world, 

92
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,000
   
I'll know everything. 

93
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,760
 And you'll pay for it. 

94
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,980
 Whoa! To what do I owe this pleasure? 

95
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,510
A way to escape Chairman Kim Kang Heon's grasp.

96
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,120
What you've wanted from me for a long time.

97
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,730
 That's right. 

98
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,800
 We might be able to overcome Chairman Kim Kang Heon with that. 

99
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,930
 Let's discuss this in person. 

100
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,700
- Why aren't you picking up?
 - I don't know this number.

101
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,550
This situation will bring more bad news than good news.

102
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,700
I think Chairman Kim Gang Heon's people are trying to call me.

103
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,830
There will be big trouble soon.

104
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,070
You're relaxed now only because you've never suffered at Chairman Kim Kang Heon's hands.

105
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,720
Song Pan Ho took the bait.

106
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,720
- He agreed to it? 
 - The Blue House (President of Korea's office).

107
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,590
I'll put Song Pan Ho in the Blue House.

108
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,460
You and I...

109
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,170
will jump on that bus and ride it all the way. Got it?

110
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,190
I'll meet up with Song Pan Ho soon and come up with a plan.

111
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,340
You just stay low and wait.

112
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,410
No. I'll have to meet him myself.

113
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,810
Who do you think got me in this situation?

114
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,490
All right, all right. I'll be in touch.

115
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,940
Right. You need a whip to get a horse to move.

116
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,880
My goodness...

117
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,440
I reviewed all the evidence that Prosecutor Kang So Yeong submitted yesterday.

118
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,780
But it's lacking quite a bit to warrant an arrest.

119
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,350
Even without taking into account that the suspect is Ms. Ma Ji Yeong of Woo One Group,

120
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,800
the arrest requirements are insufficient.

121
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,990
An arrest is inappropriate.

122
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,190
Yes, I agree.

123
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,240
What do you think, Judge Song?

124
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,300
I'd like to contemplate further regarding whether

125
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,980
- Ma Ji Yeong's arrest was appropriate or not. 
- Sorry?

126
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,400
- But—
 - I'm not talking about whether an arrest was appropriate.

127
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,120
I'm saying I'll put the judgment on hold.

128
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,570
Please give me a day.

129
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,000
Compared to last year's annual sales of 8.4095 trillion won 
  Woo One Group 

130
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,110
and operating profit of 562.7 billion won,

131
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,330
the fourth quarter of this year...

132
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:48,440
is expected to decline by 54.7% and 94.3%, respectively.

133
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,330
Chairman, in addition to the global economic downturn,

134
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,740
the domestic situation is now declining further.

135
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,390
Affiliates with no track record should either stop their business

136
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,910
or pursue a merger!

137
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:12,450
Woo One Group arose from Woo One Construction.

138
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,640
Founded on construction, subsidiaries such as shipping, hotels, distribution,

139
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,400
pharmaceuticals, etcetera, have expanded with synergy.

140
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,150
If you eliminate affiliates just because the economy has a decline,

141
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,770
there will be confusion among the personnel.

142
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,110
Ultimately, the synergy effect will be lost.

143
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,220
In that case,

144
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,100
we'll try to cut costs by halting new hires and recommending retirement

145
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,510
among those in managerial positions.

146
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,170
No.

147
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,300
Rather than that,

148
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,620
reduce new executive quota by about 13%,

149
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,880
limit president promotions to two people,

150
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,980
or consider freezing the salaries of executives of affiliates with poor performance.

151
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,450
Consider methods along those lines.

152
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,920
Don't force powerless employees to sacrifice and

153
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,450
carry out voluntary sacrifice

154
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,110
among the executives.

155
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,230
Keep a low profile for now.

156
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,610
Let's not anger the Chairman for no good reason.

157
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,090
A review of detainment legality took place this morning,

158
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,840
but Judge Song Pan Ho didn't approve the release from custody.

159
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,830
Could he still be rebelling against me?

160
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,020
 Kim Kang Heon 

161
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,590
 Kim Kang Heon 

162
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,850
 Kim Kang Heon 

163
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,360
 Become a strong man at Good Man Gym! Recruiting new members! 

164
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,010
 Good Man Gym 

165
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,180
But still, you got a lot better.

166
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,570
You're keeping up with the meal plan, right?

167
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,510
You're doing great.

168
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,220
- Hello! Is this your first time? 
 - Yes.

169
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,440
These machines are mostly for your legs and these are mostly for your biceps.

170
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,820
They didn't put the weights on here.

171
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,140
I believe I told you it won't be good if you don't answer your phone.

172
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,200
It's painful to answer that phone call.

173
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,850
Just listen. I'm telling you this for your sake.

174
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,300
Let go of me.

175
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,040
I'll be the one presiding over Kim Sang Hyeok's trial.

176
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,090
If I appear favorable to Chairman Kim Kang Heon

177
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,760
and then try to release Kim Sang Hyeok with a not-guilty verdict,

178
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,070
what would the court and the prosecution will think?

179
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,540
There's even a video of Kim Sang Hyeok shooting the gun.

180
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,750
Lee Sang Taek's son, Lee Cheong Gang, is there, too.

181
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,960
There are so many hurdles right now.

182
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,910
And you're telling me to look like Chairman Kim Gang Heon's pawn?

183
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:17,550
The evidence used to detain Chairman Kim's wife is too sloppy to be used in the trial.

184
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,390
She'll be released anyway.

185
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,940
Are you saying we mess up what we need to do over something so simple?

186
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,040
Even if he's the chairman of Woo One,

187
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,660
there are things he can't do.

188
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,590
If he...

189
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,170
If he can really do anything,

190
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,710
tell him to kill me and do it himself.

191
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,310
When you're at my age,

192
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,460
hanging onto my life doesn't matter that much.

193
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,430
Things like pride and conviction become even more important.

194
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,620
Though I should drag you to Chairman right now,

195
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,380
let's wrap things up here. Instead...

196
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,410
be there tomorrow morning. If you don't...

197
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,150
you'll die.

198
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,420
 Good Man Gym 

199
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,520
Hey, it's me. Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

200
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,060
The location is a restaurant called Cheongwoo House at the outer beach of Woowon City.

201
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,090
I'll see you there.

202
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,650
Did you say you don't care if you die?

203
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,630
Yes, just kill me.

204
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,250
Rather, I can also turn myself in as

205
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,330
the hit-and-run incident's real culprit.

206
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,830
Because you'll lose the trial anyway if you keep this up.

207
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,710
If that happens, I'm a dead man anyway.

208
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,900
So, it'd be better to die proudly than to die shamefully.

209
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,050
I-If I die, you can't get your son out.

210
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,100
It doesn't matter.

211
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,000
Just as you take life lightly, I take it lightly as well.

212
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,200
So, your ego was bruised?

213
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,220
You have the luxury to say your ego was bruised?

214
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,200
Do you want me to give you the same pain I feel?

215
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,950
Will you still be talking about your ego?

216
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,150
Do you think you can?

217
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,930
As of now, I've determined that the evidence

218
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,230
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong submitted isn't enough to prove

219
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,090
Ma Ji Yeong's instigated murder and arson charges.

220
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,160
As such, an arrest seems unnecessary to me.

221
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,330
Yes, you made the right determination.

222
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,550
It's all good.

223
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,410
I'll send it to the prosecution and take care of it today.

224
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,670
 Chairman Kim Kang Heon 

225
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,610
It was resolved.

226
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,550
The detention center said they'll let her go once the paperwork is completed.

227
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,210
All right.

228
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,700
 Case number 1673. 

229
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,220
What time is Ms. Ma Ji Yeong getting released?

230
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,350
1:30 p.m.?

231
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,250
Got it. Yes, thank you.

232
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,250
Hello, Judge Song.

233
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,080
Are you going somewhere?

234
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm going to the gym.

235
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,810
We've got exactly 30 minutes.

236
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,410
After we talk, I'll go back to my office right away.

237
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,230
Yes, I'll see you there.

238
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,410
 Jeong Yi Hwa 

239
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,840
Let's go to Sang Hyeon.

240
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,340
 Late Kim Sang Hyeon 

241
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,490
If Sang Hyeon weres alive,

242
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,330
we'd be arguing about how Sang Hyeon dresses,

243
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,700
how he doesn't study,

244
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,060
and how he doesn't eat onions.

245
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,290
That's what we'd be doing.

246
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,600
When Sang Hyeon was alive, they were my concerns and sources of stress.

247
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,340
When I thought about it in there,

248
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,940
those were our best days.

249
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,140
I started thinking...

250
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,500
you took away that happiness from me.

251
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,970
I resented you...

252
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,690
the entire time I was in there.

253
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,650
After the old woman and the child died,

254
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,770
were you at peace?

255
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm sure you weren't.

256
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,180
There's nothing in this world...

257
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,010
that can console your heart right now.

258
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,960
Just let me do what I can.

259
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:02,240
Don't complicate things any more.

260
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,660
 Cheongwu House 

261
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,160
- Did you make a reservation?
 - Yes.

262
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,480
Why are you here?

263
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,930
Hello.

264
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,060
Assemblyman Jeong is on his way.

265
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,700
There's something I must tell you before that.

266
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,210
My boys are dead.

267
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,540
Lee Sang Taek, Lee Sang Taek's mother and daughter,

268
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,240
Jeong Hae Yong, a few underlings, and Jo Bin.

269
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,260
Do you know what else?

270
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,940
I have to live in fear of Chairman Kim Kang Heon coming after me every day.

271
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,080
Why do I have to live like that?

272
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,250
Whose fault is this?

273
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,640
If you turn a blind eye on us, Judge Song,

274
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,990
we also can't help but hold a grudge against you.

275
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,080
What do you need me to do?

276
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,240
I don't know what your plan is,

277
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,450
but you have to guarantee our survival in the future.

278
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,000
Damn it.

279
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,890
Judge Song is here. Why aren't you here yet?

280
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,950
Oh, I'm so sorry! The event ended so late.

281
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,130
Yes, you two have a talk.

282
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,710
Yes. I'm almost there.

283
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,440
Okay.

284
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,930
He said he'll be here soon.

285
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,910
Man!

286
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,210
Fifty years of hard work was almost destroyed!

287
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,790
Geez!

288
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,060
 Judge Song, 

289
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,960
please tell me your plan, too.

290
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,640
I must know as well.

291
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:54,040
Since last year, Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa has been making a recommendation to me.

292
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,430
There was an order from the regime formed two years ago saying they needed me.

293
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,900
I plan to enter the Blue House.

294
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,610
With the Blue House's support,

295
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,110
I'll be freed from Chairman Kim Gang Heon's threats.

296
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,420
Is there anything we can do to help?

297
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,690
Jeong Yi Hwa and I will take care of getting me in there.

298
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,330
However, there's one thing that concerns me.

299
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,770
Is the child named Lee Cheong Gang alive?

300
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,620
Should I find out?

301
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,000
Before Chairman Kim Kang Heon finds him,

302
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,340
please find him first and protect him.

303
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,940
What's the reason?

304
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:52,380
All of his family members were killed because of me.

305
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,360
You want to protect your human conscience at this point?

306
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,840
First off, your life and mine...

307
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,250
Protect the lives that can be killed right now.

308
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,670
Ta-da.

309
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,290
Gosh, it's so funny.

310
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,880
- What are you doing? 
 - It's a joke.  Just kidding.

311
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,270
If there weren't a tail on you, Pan Ho,

312
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,370
who would know the three of us are meeting here?

313
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,070
 Eat before you go. 

314
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,600
The really important talk begins now.

315
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,270
Let's eat first. Take a seat.

316
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,310
- Let's eat. 
 - Talk about what?

317
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,710
Do you know who I met before coming here?

318
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,030
That's why I came late.

319
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,760
The VIP's (President's) Chief Secretary.

320
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,530
We stalled for more than a year, you know.

321
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,720
Do you know how anxious I was,

322
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,050
thinking they might've changed their minds?

323
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,580
I told him about you,

324
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,330
and he put a cigarette in his mouth with a grin.

325
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,400
He looked relieved.

326
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,860
At the same time, he said the current regime's motto

327
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,660
from the elections two years ago was "novelty."

328
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,020
It's called novelty if you put it nicely. You can also say

329
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,800
it means they lack the background. Right?

330
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:50,410
But the one additional topping they want to add on

331
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,780
is respect.

332
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,340
If you become the Chief of Political Affairs,

333
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:02,520
this regime will gain dignity because you're flawless from any angle.

334
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,700
Damn, this was Judge Song's only mistake!

335
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,660
Sure.

336
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,010
Let's say he's right.

337
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,780
What?

338
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,340
He said they'll let us know the time and location.

339
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,540
So, let's meet them first and see.

340
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:29,280
What kind of influence will Kim Sang Hyeok's trial have?

341
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,260
He's guilty.

342
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,920
The exemplary judge who destroyed Woo One.

343
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,910
The last icon of justice left in our age

344
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,480
who fights against an enormous corrupt force.

345
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,150
If you become the Chief of Political Affairs,

346
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,890
even Kim Kang Heon can't have his way with you.

347
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,270
Assemblyman Jeong is at a restaurant called

348
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,570
Cheongwu House on the outskirts of Woowon City.

349
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,220
Three people are in the room.

350
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,490
Judging by her car parked nearby, one of them is Jo Mi Yeon.

351
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,010
But I can't tell who the other person is.

352
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,450
I just texted you a photo of their shoes.

353
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,830
 Woo One, Yu Tae Geun 

354
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,670
Identify Judge Song Pan Ho's current location.

355
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,750
 All right. 

356
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,730
He's not at the gym. I'll search the nearby area.

357
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,590
There's no time to think about it.

358
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,540
If Chairman Kim finds out about this, all three of us

359
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,800
will die without a trace.

360
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,830
Once I get word from them,

361
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,110
I'll arrange a meeting for that time.

362
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,140
You just do as I say. Deal?

363
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,860
Let's eat.

364
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,790
I'll get going first.

365
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,970
You should eat!

366
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,990
Is that someone you know?

367
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,430
Who was here with you?

368
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,680
There were three of you. Where did one go?

369
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,540
Is he talking about Wu Cheol?

370
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,110
What are you doing here, Assemblyman?

371
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,250
Who are you?

372
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,240
- Search every corner. 
 - Yes, sir!

373
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,920
I feel this every time I come here,

374
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,700
but your house is very clean.

375
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,160
I wonder what you think about while cleaning around the house.

376
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,770
When I look around your house,

377
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,570
it doesn't seem like you carry an ounce of guilt for killing two people.

378
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,210
Where did you go?

379
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,470
Tell me.

380
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,450
If you can't tell me about it, something inconceivable will happen.

381
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,300
 Budu Gang Turf 

382
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,630
Run away.

383
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,120
Who are you people?

384
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,990
You should've just managed your district and prepared for retirement.

385
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,640
What more do you have to gain by entering dangerous territory?

386
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,450
I'm an assemblyman.

387
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,760
Are you prepared to face the consequences of your actions?

388
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,540
Assemblyman, don't you know who we are?

389
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,790
Your family is still unharmed, right?

390
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,160
You should be thankful.

391
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,470
Judge Song, did you sleep well?

392
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,180
What is it at this hour?

393
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,000
Yi Hwa...

394
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,340
Yi Hwa! Yi Hwa!

395
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,150
Just what happened to you?

396
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,180
 Do not enter - Police Line - Investigation in progress 

397
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,390
Most of them are being transferred to Woowon Hospital.

398
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,080
Oh, Prosecutor Kang! Hello.

399
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,370
- Report the state of damages. 
 - Yes, we're still trying to figure things out.

400
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,940
The injured are currently being transferred to Woowon Hospital.

401
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,060
Are you in your right mind?

402
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,640
Don't you know who did this?

403
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,030
The poor people in this area can't pay the hospital bills.

404
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,730
The police station asked for the hospital's cooperation.

405
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,640
Woowon Hospital replied they'd provide free medical treatment to everyone.

406
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,530
And there's no evidence Woo One is responsible for this.

407
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,860
It's Kim Kang Heon's doing from every angle!

408
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,010
Well...

409
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:45,450
some people got arrested early this morning.

410
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,080
What's all this about?

411
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,900
They're the leaders of a violent organization

412
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,920
who started the assault on Woowon Pyeonghwa-ro early this morning.

413
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,050
Yes, I'm aware of that. But they're not from Woo One?

414
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:08,520
They're members of the Seobu Gang, mainly located in the Southwestern areas of Gyeonggi

415
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,800
such as Pyeongchu and Songtaek.

416
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,530
- Why? 
 - Why, what?

417
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,090
Why did Seobu Gang suddenly attack Budu Gang?

418
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:22,270
I mean, how should I know why they were fighting amongst—

419
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,730
Today's violence—

420
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,680
Chairman Kim Kang Heon put you up to this, didn't he?

421
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,440
- Who are you to speak down to us in our first meeting? 
 - Spit it out!

422
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,590
- Prosecutor Kang!
 - Kim Kang Heon ordered you to do this!

423
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,320
Chairman Kim Kang Heon of Woo One Group?

424
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,460
Ordered us?

425
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,340
Why would he?

426
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,170
 Specialist Jeong Yi Yeob 

427
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,390
It doesn't look so good.

428
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:14,890
He'll have to go to a bigger hospital to be treated properly.

429
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,070
No, treat me here.

430
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,560
No one must find out about this.

431
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,020
- Will you be okay? 
 - I'm not doing this for you.

432
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:30,100
I'm doing this because of my family and me.

433
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:35,140
That guy... He'll do anything...

434
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,630
if he puts his mind to it.

435
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,730
Excuse me. The two of us have something to discuss.

436
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,060
Please give us some privacy.

437
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,390
Why do you think it turned out like this?

438
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,650
Because Jo Mi Yeon handed over information to Kang So Yeong?

439
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,580
Or because Jo Mi Yeon, you,

440
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:15,870
and I met in secret?

441
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,460
What did we get caught doing?

442
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,700
What do you think happened to Jo Mi Yeon?

443
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,340
The body was found around 7 a.m. this morning

444
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,360
near Route 38 at Haeyang-ro.

445
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,510
We've confirmed the identity. It's Amate Tee Rab.

446
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,520
He was a 21-year-old male from Egypt.

447
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,830
He was identified this quickly?

448
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,880
His passport was inside the pocket of his jacket.

449
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,830
- There was also an expired work visa. 
 - An illegal immigrant?

450
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,590
But...

451
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:07,060
there was something odd.

452
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:11,410
When we got the corpse, its temperature was -1°C.

453
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,410
Usually, in the spring and summer, it begins to decay from inside,

454
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:18,450
- and it turns above 18°C due to the external temperature. 
 - That's right.

455
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:22,610
But I took the temperature because it was so cold and it was -1°C.

456
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,960
I believe someone had stored the corpse in a freezer.

457
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,660
A freezer?

458
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,200
The time of death is currently impossible to estimate.

459
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,040
F***.

460
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,030
- Who is she? 
 - She said she's Tee Rab's girlfriend.

461
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,850
We asked her to come for identification purposes.

462
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,980
What a f***ing moron.

463
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:59,200
You said we'd go to Egypt together.

464
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,150
I was waiting for you.

465
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,040
What kind of bullshit is this?

466
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:09,920
Excuse me. I'm from the police.

467
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:15,440
When did he say you'll go to Egypt?

468
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,330
Last month.

469
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:21,910
- Oh, was it for a trip? 
 - No.

470
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:29,700
We promised to go to Egypt and get married.

471
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,380
I think he was stored in a freezer unit and

472
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,060
was abandoned at the beach last night,

473
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,840
- so people can see. 
 - F***...

474
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,800
I heard you two were going to get married.

475
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,430
Yes...

476
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,690
Wouldn't you know who might've done this to your boyfriend?

477
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,890
F-F***...

478
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:04,760
Those sons of bitches...

479
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,300
What did Tee Rab do wrong?

480
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,680
Tee Rab!

481
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,190
 They wanted to speak but could not. 

482
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,250
 Tears stood in their eyes. 

483

 They were both pale and thin. 

484
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:54,170
 But those sick pale faces were 

485
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,870
 bright with the dawn of a new future, 

486
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:02,210
 of a full resurrection into a new life.

 You're a judge! 

497
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,830
 H-How can a judge kill someone?

♫  At a familiar stop,  ♫

♫   you and I realized   ♫

504
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:57,500
♫   we're not we're not that naive  ♫

505
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,010
♫  What is in your mind?   ♫

♫  Come across the line  ♫

♫  Our eyes already decided.  ♫

 I ask you to give an accurate verdict with objective reasoning 

509
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,700
 and a warm heart towards the victim. 

510

 I'll bring down Woo One. 

511
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,950
 Sentence him guilty.

 If you find Kim Sang Hyeok not guilty, I'll turn myself in. 

514
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,220
 That's enough! 

515
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:35,240
 Is revenge the answer, or is credibility the answer? 

516
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,320
 I can't think of anything. 

517
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,730
 I don't know what I should do.

♫ I hate you for raising me like this ♫
