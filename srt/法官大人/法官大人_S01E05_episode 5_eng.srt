 Son Hyun Joo 
 ♫  Just a look across the sidewalk.  ♫

♫  Love.  ♫

♫  Someday we'll come when this makes sense  ♫

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,500
♫  But for now, it's time to rest  ♫

00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,060
 Your Honor 

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,040
 This is a work of fiction. 

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,070
 Characters, places, organizations, incidents, names, ethnic groups, and settings are unrelated to reality. 

12
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,590
 There's been a big accident. 

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,210
  
 You must take care of it before the police arrive. 

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,620
 Sang Hyeok didn't get along with Madam all this time and felt out of place. 

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,340
 I'm sorry to tell you, but he's also had many complaints about you, Chairman. 

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,560
 I heard he repeatedly said 

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,700
 that Woo One should be run the way his grandfather did. 

18
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,880
 After Mom passed away, 

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,060
 you were the only person I could depend on, Father. 

20
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,380
 But you've never once approved of me. 

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,880
 What can I do... 

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,340
 to become your beloved son? 

23
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,690
Father.

24
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,760
These f***ers were talking shit about you.

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,950
Saying you're a hypocrite.

26
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,850
 Your Honor: Episode 5 

27
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,700
Prove your promise.

28
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,990
Wh-Why are you doing this?

29
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,850
You're a judge!

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,230
H-How can a judge kill someone?

31
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,300
Until my last breath, I'll never speak of H-Ho Yeong—

32
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,610
Did you struggle this much when my child died, too?

33
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,540
We need to continue our talk.

34
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,420
What do I need to do?

35
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,970
Pull yourself together.

36
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,310
From police investigations to indictment,

37
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,960
it can take as little as a week to a month

38
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,940
if the case becomes complicated.

39
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,780
There are gray areas,

40
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,960
but there's video evidence showing

41
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,650
Kim Sang Hyeok killing people at the scene.

42
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,870
So the police will prove 100%

43
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,210
the man in the video is Kim Sang Hyeok.

44
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,610
Once that is proven,

45
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,520
there's no room to move the trial.

46
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,400
By the time the case is in front of me,

47
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,830
there must be enough room for interpretation.

48
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,940
This is a losing battle.

49
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm sure it is. I'm sure it's not an easy fight.

50
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,400
Since you need to commit an evil deed as a respected man.

51
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,460
I'm sure it's hard.

52
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,100
However,

53
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,310
it's easy for me to kill you.

54
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,030
You must do a very difficult job

55
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,180
and I must hold myself back from doing the easiest job in the world.

56
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,030
 Script based on series "Kvodo" by Ohad Knoller, Shlomo Moshiah and Ron Ninio 

57
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,910
Update the chairman on the status once a week.

58
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,510
Also, contact me if there's anything you need.

59
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,760
 Park Chang Hyeok 

60
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,670
Things I need?

61
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,690
Like reporting to the chairman and when you need to meet him...

62
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,920
Go through me.

63
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,900
Hey, Detective Jang.

64
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes. I wanted to see you.

65
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,790
Yes.

66
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,210
Shall we have dinner together?

67
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,280
- Number one. Look into Jang Chae Rim, who arrested Sang Hyeok. 
 - Yes.

68
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,090
Number two.

69
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,590
How Sang Hyeok's case will be interpreted and processed within the Prosecution...

70
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,800
- I'm sure Kang So Yeong will be the prosecutor in charge. 
 - Yes.

71
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,540
Number three.

72
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,580
Starting now, check every single thing Song Pan Ho does and says 24/7 more meticulously.

73
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,600
Number four.

74
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,020
Manage the prison Sang Hyeok will be put in,

75
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,620
so he won't be uncomfortable.

76
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,670
Yes, Chairman.

77
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,330
What's the occasion?

78
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,570
Well, I was just curious how it's going.

79
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,040
Do you remember when your wife passed away two years ago?

80
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:22,450
I can't forget Ho Yeong's eyes from back then.

81
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,180
 How can he be so completely sad? 

82
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,500
How can he be so beautifully sad?

83
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,780
I wanted to catch the culprit who saddened a beautiful child.

84
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,690
However, the laws couldn't wipe away Ho Yeong's tears, nor could I.

85
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,180
The laws aren't to blame.

86
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,690
If the verdict came out that way, then it's the truth.

87
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,780
No.

88
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,850
The law was incorrectly applied.

89
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,070
If you had judged it, the verdict would've been accurate.

90
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,150
It's something I shouldn't do.

91
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,540
Because personal emotions could cause me to lose my legal judgment.

92
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,530
Even if it were incorrectly applied,

93
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,500
it's still the law.

94
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,800
And that will be the situation in the future.

95
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,600
That's right.

96
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,740
Because you're a judge, Judge Song.

97
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,450
But I'm different.

98
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm not the least interested  in the deaths of Jeong Hae Yong and the Budu Gang members.

99
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,670
The bastard I couldn't catch two years ago. I want to make sure he pays for it this time.

100
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,350
I can't make him pay for that crime due to double jeopardy.

101
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,930
But I'll make him... pay as much as he should.

102
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,360
What happened to that child Cheong Gang?

103
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,980
I hid him where no one knows.

104
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,570
I plan to hide him completely until the trial begins.

105
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,470
Chairman Kim Kang Heon is a scary man, as you know.

106
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,330
Could I...

107
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,870
see that child?

108
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,350
Sorry?

109
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,370
I don't really know.

110
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,080
What are your current charges as a suspect?

111
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,820
I don't really know.

112
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,800
"I don't really know."

113
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,830
I'm home.

114
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,480
Ho Yeong.

115
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,160
 Jang Chae Rim 

116
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,360
 Hi, Judge Song. This is Detective Jang. 

117
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,750
I'm heading back after interrogating the suspect.

118
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,160
I plan to secure a few more items of evidence and transfer him to the prosecution.

119
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,900
- Who's the prosecutor in charge? 
 - Prosecutor Kang So Yeong of Woowon District.

120
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,930
You know her, right? She blew the whistle on the prosecution's internal corruption five years ago

121
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,460
and she even got Chairman Kim Kang Heon locked up three years ago.

122
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,740
As you know, the prosecution is also widely influenced by Woo One.

123
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,670
I felt Prosecutor Kang would stay faithful to the laws and principles.

124
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,390
If Prosecutor Kang indicts, and you're the judge,

125
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,800
 this case will be properly handled. 

126
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,300
Did you get the suspect's testimony?

127
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,930
Gosh, no. He's standing his ground.

128
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,720
I think we'll have to go with physical evidence.

129
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,990
Physical evidence? Did you secure any?

130
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,790
 First off, the video evidence I showed you last time. 

131
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,380
Lee Cheong Gang, the witness.

132
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,810
I'll have to find the gun used for the crime and his location at the time of the incident.

133
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,860
 Since the victim's son witnessed it 

134
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,860
 and there's even video evidence, there shouldn't be any major problems. 

135
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,950
 Yes. I'll be counting on you from here on. 

136
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,980
How do you feel, Kim Sang Hyeok?

137
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,380
Don't you feel things are pretty much screwed up for you?

138
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,940
I have to discuss something with the chairman.

139
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,350
I have some work at the court in the afternoon.

140
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,500
I'd like to see him before noon.

141
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,250
 Look out your living room window. 

142
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,130
Were you on standby in front of my house?

143
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,910
What did you need to talk about?

144
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,110
There's a total of three pieces of evidence that Detective Jang Chae Rim can secure.

145
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,100
First, the video evidence of the scene and the witness, Lee Cheong Gang.

146
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,860
Second, the gun used for the crime.

147
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,550
Third, the evidence that the suspect was present at the scene.

148
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,680
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong of Woowon District Prosecutors' Office will be taking the case.

149
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,830
She's unaffected by authorities and connections.

150
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:10,470
Five years ago, she drew attention for blowing the whistle on internal corruption within the prosecution.

151
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,220
The situation doesn't look good.

152
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,140
You must shake up the evidence and diversify legal interpretations.

153
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,950
It seems you couldn't even sleep a wink...

154
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,110
because you killed a person.

155
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,720
Is it from a guilty conscience, or

156
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,730
is it from the fear you might die if you don't pull this off?

157
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,500
That's not it.

158
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,010
There's no way you have any sense of guilt.

159
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,110
You already committed murder twice.

160
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:54,380
That means you couldn't sleep because you wanted to live.

161
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,020
Right.

162
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,890
People are supposed to be honest with primal desires.

163
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,800
 Woowon Gangheung Police Station 

164
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,290
Excuse me!

165
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,750
- I'm here to make a report. 
 - A report on what?

166
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,050
People died at Daeyeon Port two days ago, you know.

167
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,000
There were gunshots, too.

168
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,320
Let's go inside first.

169
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,020
 Shit. 

170
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,330
I can't really tell.

171
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,010
It was too dark back then.

172
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,320
He might not be the one.

173
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,830
Hey...

174
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,820
who sent you?

175
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,330
Hey!

176
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,500
You!

177
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,290
Stay put.

178
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,150
You sold the gun to Kim Sang Hyeok, right?

179
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,910
Who's Kim Sang Hyeok?

180
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,820
Woo One Group's oldest son! Stop acting like you don't know.

181
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,770
I don't know anyone like that.

182
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,450
The latest one who bought a gun from me was Jo Bin.

183
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,330
Jo Bin?

184
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,140
Did you make an appointment?

185
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,890
I'm looking for a guy named Jo Bin.

186
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,140
Why are you looking for Bin?

187
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,160
Do I have to tell you the reason to see him?

188
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,670
Will three days be enough?

189
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,200
Actually, I'd like to see him tomorrow morning.

190
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,160
It hasn't even been a week since I lost a friend who was like my own brother.

191
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,080
And he was...

192
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,510
killed by your son, Chairman.

193
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,560
When my second son died,

194
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,730
you concealed and fabricated the accident, CEO Jo.

195
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,480
You probably didn't even think about how much pain the victim was in.

196
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,690
I should've killed everyone here, to be frank.

197
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,410
Why did I hold back?

198
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,390
For what?

199
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:26,510
Did I want to become the chairman of Woo One, who's respected by people?

200
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,610
Or could it be...

201
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:36,580
that I wanted to believe justice existed in this world?

202
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,960
There's no reason to see you again.

203
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,880
I won't have the need to come see you or

204
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,470
you'll no longer be around to be seen.

205
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,570
If you're trying to do something big, you need to move in an organized manner.

206
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,040
If you arrest and interrogate a suspect, write up an interrogation report on the suspect,

207
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,150
and transfer him to the Prosecution as you please, you make your superiors look bad.

208
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,010
I'll just be disciplined.

209
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,810
Hey, that's like saying you'll just be punished after killing someone!

210
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,180
Chief, are you that afraid of Woo One Group?

211
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,640
Could the dignity of the police, maintained for 80 years since our nation's independence

212
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,990
be destroyed by outer pressure from a gang—

213
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,620
What a load of crap, punk!

214
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,650
When does it start?

215
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,210
- What do you mean?
 - My disciplinary measures.

216
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,850
The disciplinary process is almost complete.

217
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,530
- Keep a low profile. 
- No.

218
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,850
I have investigative rights until the disciplinary duration and extent are decided.

219
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,030
I'll do my best until then.

220
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,710
Also, I'm not a kid.

221
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,530
Quit your nagging.

222
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,690
Damn it.

223
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,350
How did it go? Did you find out where he's at?

224
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,900
 Yes, Team Leader. 

225
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,370
We found out where Jo Bin is hiding, and we're on our way right now.

226
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,870
Yes, I'll let you know as soon as we get him.

227
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,360
What? Geez!

228
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,130
F***!

229
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,610
F*** those sons of bitches...

230
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,060
Gosh, I'm sorry.

231
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,160
I'm just...

232
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,990
furious today.

233
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,750
You're the only one I can talk to about these things, Judge. I'm sorry.

234
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,530
No, I understand.

235
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,320
How can they...

236
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,110
take a person's life so lightly?

237
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,990
Just how many people must die for this to end?

238
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,350
After Kim Sang Hyeon's hit-and-run incident, seven people died.

239
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,010
And there's only one suspect for all seven.

240
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,880
I-If...

241
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,350
If I had done a good job,

242
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,990
they'd all still be alive.

243
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,360
I'll go to Prosecutor Kang So Yeong in the morning and

244
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,750
transfer the murders Kim Sang Hyeok committed to the Prosecution.

245
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,130
We've got video evidence

246
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,970
and we've got a witness.

247
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,460
We'll try our best to get him a life sentence.

248
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,650
Even if they're Woo One,

249
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,860
they need to be punished in the name of justice.

250
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,150
That's common sense. That's right!

251
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:55,060
The reason I respect you, Judge Song...

252
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:07,170
is because you'd never waver in the face of Woo One's pressure.

253
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,370
Judge Song... you see...

254
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,550
I'm embarrassed.

255
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,270
Of what?

256
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:44,770
When people call me, they say, "Detective Jang."

257
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,400
But whenever things like today happen,

258
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,440
I'm so embarrassed by the fact that I'm a detective.

259
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,620
- Hi. You called for a driver, right?
 - Yes.

260
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,250
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

261
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,170
 You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

262
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,360
Please give me a call when you get home, just to be safe.

263
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,580
 Late Kim Sang Hyeon 

264
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,700
As expected, Kang So Yeong became the prosecutor in charge.

265
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,200
She'll come to see me.

266
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,840
 Jang Chae Rim 

267
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,300
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

268
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,350
 After the beep, there will be an additional charge. 

269
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,870
 Your Honor, 

270
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:08,270
even if the victim demanded a high interest payment on a loan and threatened his family,

271
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,780
this is clearly a murder with intent.

272
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,150
Please give the maximum sentence allowed by law for the defendant, Kim Taek Soo.

273
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,720
 You're a judge! H-How can a judge kill someone? 

274
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,710
Your Honor.

275
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,320
Your Honor!

276
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,100
Yes, thank you.

277
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,620
On May 1st, which is two weeks from now, we'll hold a sentencing hearing.

278
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,390
 Violent Crimes Department 

279
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,270
Geez, just rewrite it.

280
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,130
Okay, I'll rewrite it.

281
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,340
Judge Song, hello.

282
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,190
Hello.

283
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,060
Where's Detective Jang Chae Rim?

284
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,960
Detective Jang didn't come in today.

285
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,370
She doesn't answer her phone, either.

286
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,650
Can you tell me where Detective Jang lives?

287
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,540
Detective Jang!

288
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,080
Team Leader!

289
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,570
I don't think she's home.

290
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,690
She hasn't contacted you either since last night?

291
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,370
Yes.

292
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,070
Can we call a locksmith to open the door?

293
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,510
Do we have to go that far?

294
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,130
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

295
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,450
Huh?

296
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,850
Shit...

297
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:02,170
Hey, I'm at the Team Leader's house right now.

298
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,190
I think they got Team Leader.

299
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,170
Geez, who else? There's only one person we're investigating!

300
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,040
Get over here quickly!

301
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,390
I apologize.

302
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,920
Open. Open up.

303
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,930
Open up. Open up!

304
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,840
What's the meaning of this? I told you I'll take care of it!

305
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,640
Jang Chae Rim didn't do anything wrong.

306
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,550
She was just doing what she had to do!

307
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,550
Let go!

308
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,140
Does this world look so easy to you?

309
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,740
Things you can do. Things you can't do.

310
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,070
Things you should do. Things you shouldn't do.

311
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,330
The world runs based on those distinctions.

312
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,190
Why? Why?

313
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,160
Why lay your hands on things you shouldn't? Why!

314
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:19,180
In the future, set up meetings through Park Chang Hyeok.

315
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,850
There's nothing I shouldn't do.

316
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:43,560
Do you think the world or the laws... can protect you, Judge?

317
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,240
That might be the case for other people.

318
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,410
However, that's not the case for me.

319
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,580
I can just kill you and go to jail or

320
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,110
I can die.

321
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:18,530
You see, the laws work only for people who live by common sense.

322
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:26,260
Did you really do that today, thinking the laws...

323
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,580
can protect you?

324
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:24,320
I-It's a very important matter.

325
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,140
I must see you.

326
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,080
 Woowon City Legal Professionals' Night 

327
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,280
Oh, how nice.

328
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,320
Judge Song, nice to meet you.

329
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,910
How are you, Judge Song?

330
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,880
There are many quiet and secret locations.  Why here, of all places?

331
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,550
- You don't look good. 
 - Someone placed...

332
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,280
a tail on me.

333
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,830
Who did?

334
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,770
One moment.

335
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,330
I met Kim Kang Heon recently.

336
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,960
He knows I'm the culprit.

337
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,340
Wait, how?

338
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,860
It's my fault for taking the situation too lightly.

339
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,580
What about me? Does he know about me, too?

340
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,110
I'm sorry. So?

341
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,960
Fortunately, his oldest son, Kim Sang Hyeok,

342
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,200
is being held by the police on allegations

343
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,800
of killing Jo Mi Yeon's Budu Gang members and Lee Sang Taek.

344
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,000
I begged for my life under the conditions

345
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
of letting him go with a not-guilty verdict.

346
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,340
If the evidence is tampered with and a favorable sentence is rendered,

347
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,710
he probably could get what he wants.

348
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,750
But the problem is, even if I take care of this matter,

349
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,920
there's no guarantee he'll let me live.

350
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,410
That's true.

351
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,100
We're talking about Chairman Kim Kang Heon here.

352
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:28,420
I need to find a way to survive once this job is done.

353
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,540
Assemblyman, Chairman Kim Kang Heon came to see me two days ago.

354
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,690
So? Are you going to quit?

355
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:01,300
Assemblyman. You never had Kim Kang Heon come after you, did you?

356
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,750
It won't end with just me dying.

357
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,180
He has the power to get rid of this entire city.

358
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,800
So, you're going to spend the rest of your life in this sewer?

359
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,180
While wiping Kim Kang Heon's ass?

360
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:21,710
CEO Jo, a scared dog always barks louder. Okay?

361
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,990
This is an opportunity for us.

362
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,980
Looks like an opportunity to die to me.

363
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,160
This is the opportunity...

364
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,600
to have Song Pan Ho enter the Blue House*. 
   (* President of Korea's Office) 

365
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,550
 WOO ONE 

366
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,510
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong, hello!

367
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,190
Hello.

368
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,150
I thought I sent you all the files. What brings you here?

369
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,160
It's lacking some things.

370
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,580
I don't think so. I sent you everything Detective Jang Chae Rim had prepared.

371
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,050
No. I meant the things that happened during the investigation.

372
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,880
Information on them seemed to be missing.

373
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,510
Follow me.

374
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,800
- Okay. I'll simply explain only once, so listen up. 
 - Yes.

375
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,820
Kim Sang Hyeon died in a car accident on April 8th at the beltway.

376
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,510
- Correct?
 - Yes.

377
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,920
On April 11th, the family of the hit-and-run suspect, Lee Sang Taek,

378
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,370
Kim Mi Yeong, age 71, and Lee Cheong Ha, age 7, died from a gas explosion.

379
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,850
- Correct?
 - Yes.

380
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,620
On April 12th, while trying to smuggle himself out of the country, Lee Sang Taek

381
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,830
and Budu Gang's Jeong Hae Yong and his two men assisting the smuggle, died.

382
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,760
The suspect is Kim Sang Hyeok, the oldest son of Woo One Group. I have a report on him.

383
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,930
- Correct?
 - Yes, you're right.

384
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:08,070
On April 16th, Jo Bin, who gave a gun to Kim Sang Hyeok, commits suicide, suspiciously.

385
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,150
- Correct?
 - Yes.

386
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,020
So, why did I only get a report on Kim Sang Hyeok?

387
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,350
The thing is, we were assigned only his case—

388
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,320
How about other cases?

389
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,220
Are you saying we'll just let them slide?

390
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,270
- That's not what we're saying.
 - No.

391
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,340
Gosh, the police...

392
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,330
This is why civil servants shouldn't receive a salary.

393
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:42,720
If you got paid per case, you'd be working ever so quickly.

394
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:10,080
Eun, it looks like you lost some weight.

395
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,590
Are you on a diet?

396
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,670
No, I'm not.

397
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,460
But I like it when you're plump, Eun.

398
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,310
Did Eun get a boyfriend?

399
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,200
Th-That's not it!

400
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,270
Who are you?

401
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,330
Where did you guys come from?

402
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,420
How odd.

403
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,590
- Are you ninjas? 
  - I said who are you?

404
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,580
I'm Kang So Yeong from the Woowon District Prosecutors' Office.

405
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,040
The one who locked up your chairman.

406
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,440
Do I need to bring a warrant to let me in?

407
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,760
What a happy dinner.

408
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,450
You seem to smile at times lately.

409
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,700
Is Sang Hyeon already forgotten?

410
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,090
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong is here.

411
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,710
Yes, tell her to wait in the study.

412
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,200
Yes, sir.

413
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,080
You took my oldest son's case, huh?

414
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,860
Yes, you knew already, right?

415
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,770
I wasn't curious about whom would be taking my son's case.

416
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:02,340
I was curious about the next case you would be taking on, Prosecutor Kang.

417
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,330
Oh, that's right.

418
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:12,700
I'm very sorry about what happened to your youngest son.

419
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,880
You're just as rude as always.

420
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,080
A lot has happened since that incident.

421
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,940
The hit-and-run suspect Lee Sang Taek's mother and daughter died from a fire.

422
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,900
Lee Sang Taek, who was trying to smuggle himself out, and Budu Gang members died.

423
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,680
Also, Jo Bin, who gave a gun to Kim Sang Hyeok, died two days ago.

424
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,990
And Jang Chae Rim, who was investigating Kim Sang Hyeok, went missing.

425
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:50,110
The reason I came all the way here, despite being rude...

426
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,530
is because I think I should tell you in advance.

427
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:02,290
The unsavory events that took place after your youngest son's death...

428
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,630
I'll be digging into every single one.

429
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,140
You'd better be prepared.

430
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,600
How much of the world do you think you could move?

431
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,620
I'm a prosecutor, you know.

432
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,110
I guess as far as justice allows.

433
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,440
How much could justice protect the world?

434
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,370
If that's how the world has worked so far,

435
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,150
I wouldn't be sitting where I am right now.

436
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,510
What a f***ing narcissist.

437
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,180
Ma'am.

438
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,730
You're Prosecutor Kang So Yeong, right?

439
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,780
- Who are you?
 - There's someone...

440
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,300
who desperately wants to meet you.

441
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,370
They said the meeting would be beneficial for both of you.

442
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,840
They have some good information.

443
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,710
I had my doubts, but I was right.

444
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,460
You have something to say to me?

445
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,420
Didn't my guy tell you?

446
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,060
This will be of help to you.

447
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,060
This case really is a filthy one, isn't it?

448
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,610
Seeing how dung flies and gnats are involved.

449
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,770
Isn't the police enough to deal with someone like Jo Mi Yeon?

450
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:15,100
It's a bit unpleasant for you to want to see me in person.

451
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:20,160
Isn't Chairman Kim Kang Heon the one you're trying to get?

452
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,910
If it's about getting Chairman Kim Gang Heon,

453
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:26,480
isn't it helpful to you under any circumstance?

454
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,570
- Excuse me. 
 - My goodness.

455
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,420
Y-You see, Bin killed himself two days ago, right?

456
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,620
But it's not suicide.

457
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,710
It was a murder.

458
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:50,400
I don't know who killed him.

459
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,350
But I do know why he was killed.

460
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,020
So, Jo Bin gave a gun to Kim Sang Hyeok, right?

461
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,440
I don't know about that.

462
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,780
Then, what did you come here to report?

463
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,950
The gas explosion at Lee Sang Taek's house killed his mother, Kim Mi Yeong, and his daughter, Cheong Ha.

464
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,180
I think I might know who did it.

465
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,150
Shouldn't you arrest those bastards?

466
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,620
Stop there!

467
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,280
Hey!

468
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,750
Come here!

469
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,900
Let go! Let me go!

470
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,840
I know it's you. Stay put!

471
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,760
All right. You broke into Lee Sang Taek's house and...

472
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,460
What do you call it? It's the pipe you cut.

473
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:54,010
 You two injected thinner into the light bulbs and placed them back. 

474
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

475
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,810
We don't know anything. Please just let us go home.

476
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:03,420
What the hell? You two got caught for illegal entry and murder! How dare you pretend not to know?

477
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,450
I really don't know what you're saying. Please have mercy on us.

478
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:10,070
 This is nuts— I know you speak Korean, all right? 

479
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,280
 We really don't know! 

480
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,190
 There are many who saw you two run errands for the Budu Gang! 

481
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,070
 Is this how you want to play? Should I get an interpreter? 

482
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,570
I really don't understand you.

483
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,460
You're laugh— Is this funny? Are you laughing?

484
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,640
 Gosh, this won't do. Just get an interpreter. 

485
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,460
Hello, Prosecutor. Long time no see.

486
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,700
Gosh, those punks are the ones, huh? Evil bastards.

487
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,910
What's all this commotion because of those punks?

488
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,730
Why do you think they did it?

489
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,410
Prosecutor, please let me know if you need anything.

490
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,370
I'll help you out.

491
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,970
Sure.

492
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,140
Is Detective Lee doing his job right?

493
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,120
Seriously.

494
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:18,470
Friends, let's get out of here.

495
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,930
There are too many rats inside the police station.

496
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,960
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong is conducting an investigation.

497
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,940
From what I heard, it seems she caught the punks 
  Chief of Police: Choi Myeong Ho 

498
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,180
who set Lee Sang Taek's home on fire.

499
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,470
I think you'll have to make a big move this time.

500
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,380
Besides how Sang Hyeok killed the Budu Gang's men,

501
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:46,240
you'll also have to prepare how he set Lee Sang Taek's home on fire.

502
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,400
Whether it's the district prosecutors' office or the police station,

503
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,640
there's not a place where Woo One's Kim Kang Heon can't reach.

504
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,920
That's also why I insisted on bringing you detectives here for our plan.

505
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,490
Until the job is done, we'll keep things among ourselves and move by ourselves.

506
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,670
You got that?

507
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,470
Yes. Yes.

508
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,970
 I'm Prosecutor Kang So Yeong of Woowon District Prosecutors' Office. 

509
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,980
One moment, please.

510
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,760
It's the Prosecution.

511
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,140
Sure.

512
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,740
Ma Ji Yeong.

513
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,670
You're under arrest for instigated murder and arson.

514
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:21,570
You have the right to remain silent and appoint an attorney.

515
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:25,000
Anything you say can be used against you in court.

516
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,880
We brought the arrest warrant with us.

517
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,180
Because we have clear evidence.

518
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,970
 Arrest Warrant 

519
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:57,550
Judge Song Pan Ho, Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa, CEO Jo Mi Yeon, and Prosecutor Kang So Yeong.

520
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,380
What were they trying to do?

521
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:07,200
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong was investigating the fire incident in Jangbeom-dong.

522
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,790
If you look at just the pictures, it seems she got the idea from you.

523
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,850
Explain.

524
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,280
- Yes. 
  - Chairman, Madam has just been... 

525
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:52,000


526
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:59,420
 Your Honor 

527
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,530
♫  I'll be burnt to ashes without a trace, yeah  ♫

528
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:12,880
♫  Dispersing like the smoke, you and I become yesterday  ♫

529
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,970
♫  Sink even deeper, to the rock bottom  ♫

530
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,050
♫  Going voluntarily in front of the teeth ready to devour me  ♫

531
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:24,550
♫  An expression like dawn, turning deathly pale and cold  ♫

532
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,640
♫  I remember everything like a tattoo  ♫

533
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,280
 Where do you people get your complacent attitudes from? 

534
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,180
 Are you saying you will arm wrestle with us? 

535
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,280
 Do you know whom I met just now? 

536
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,840
 Whatever you do, wherever you are in this world, 

537
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,330
 I'll know everything. 

538
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,310
 And you'll pay for it. 

539
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:49,130
 Let's see this to the end. 

540
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,440
 I plan to enter the Blue House. 

541
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,840
 Because I'll be freed from Chairman Kim Kang Heon's threats.
