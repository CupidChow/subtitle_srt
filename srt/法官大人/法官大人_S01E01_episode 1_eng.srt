Thanks. Thank you.

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,830
Chairman Kim, while serving you here for 2 years and 8 months,

20
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,510
I have enjoyed working as a civil servant without any problems,

21
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,380
only having to diligently come to work.

22
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,260
From the moment I came into work until I left for the day,

23
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,220
without any incidents...

24
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,840
Especially at the most troublesome Woowon Prison.

25
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,040
I marveled at how quiet the prison was for the first time in my 25 years here...

26
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,960
You're absolutely incredible.

27
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,330
You look like you're in your twenties.

28
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,320
I'm very grateful to you for resolving my family matter,

29
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,600
but you even got me a promotion after three years without any incidents.

30
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
I don't know how to thank you enough.

31
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,130
I'll serve you faithfully while you're here—

32
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,740
Warden, you're a good person.

33
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,230
Sorry?

34
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,560
Oh, yes. I'm doing my best to live as a good person.

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,220
Hey, son!

36
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,710
Dad, I just arrived in Korea.

37
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,600
It's really a Kiruna!

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
Whoa, the design is so sexy.

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,260
The color is exactly what I wanted, too.

40
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,090
Dad, thank you so much.

41
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,090
 I thank you. I love you! 

42
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,590
 And as he sat there motionless staring into the darkness  
 

43
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,440
 he felt great pride in the fact that he had been able to provide such a life 

44
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,390
 for his parents and sister in such a fine apartment.  
    

45
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,050
 But what if all the quiet, the comfort, the contentment 

46
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,220
 were now to end in horror? 

47
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,120
 To keep himself from being lost in such thoughts, 

48
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,060
 Gregor took refuge in movement and crawled up and down the room. 

49
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,410
 Once during the long evening, one of the side doors 

50
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,650
 was opened a little and quickly shut again, later the other side door too; 

51
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,900
 someone had apparently wanted to come in and then thought better of it. 

52
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,150
 Gregor now stationed himself immediately before the living room door, 

53
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,020
 determined to persuade any hesitating visitor to come in 

54
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,430
 or at least to discover who it might be. 

55
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,720
 but the door was not opened again, and he waited in vain. 

56
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,060
 - In the early morning, when the doors were locked— 
- Is she still sleeping?

57
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,000
 they had all wanted to come in, 

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
 now that he opened one door 

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,180
 and the other had apparently been opened during the day, 

60
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,170
 no one came in...

please make your closing argument.

100
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,470
The defendant, CEO Hwang Man Ik of Woo One Future Construction,

101
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,900
was trying to supply low-cost, high-quality apartments for the public good

102
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,310
and economically marginalized citizens.

103
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,330
The collapse was—

104
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,890
Yes, it was quite an unfortunate accident.

105
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,190
However, I'd like to make clear that despite this unfortunate accident

106
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,870
Woo One Future Construction's intention

107
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,190
was to fight for the public good.

108
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,520
Prior to my rendering the verdict,

109
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,510
there's something I'd like to convey.

110
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,930
Whatever the case,

111
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,820
the verdict varies greatly depending on which perspective the accident is viewed from.

112
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,780
There were various perspectives regarding the collapse of the apartment.

113
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,020
The perspective of the construction company about structural issues.

114
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,510
The perspective of victims who couldn't move in on their financial damages.

115
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,780
The subcontractor's perspective on the corporate ethics of the company that repeatedly subcontracted the work.

116
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,370
Our court's biggest concern was

117
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,120
determining which perspective to view the case from.

118
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,930
These are the photos of the accident site I took this morning.

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,480

Their hope is what the Department of Justice strives to defend.

125
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:31,150
Six laborers died from the apartment construction accident.

126
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,620
In the face of their deaths,

127
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,520
I believe we need to reflect deeply

128
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,330
on what our society was truly killing.

129
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,440

What kind of accident?

137
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,570
I was driving...

138
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,720
and rammed into a motorcycle.

139
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,030
I was so scared, I ran away.

140
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,710
When was that?

141
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,630
Two hours ago.

142
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,170
He's probably dead, right?

143
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,830
The guy?

144
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,070
Go get changed so we can turn you in.

145

No matter what the problem is, you must not avoid it.

146
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,840
Facing it head-on is the swiftest and most efficient solution.

147
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,550
Do you want to wait here?

148
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,100

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,690
Please excuse me.

166
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,760
What is it?

167
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,420
Hey. Turn on the TV.

168
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,740
 At 7:30 a.m. this morning on an outlying beach road, 

169
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,320
  21-year-old Kim Sang Hyeon was killed in a hit-and-run accident. 

170
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,340
 Kim Sang Hyeon, who was killed in an accident this morning, 

171
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,060
 was left on the road after having sustained severe injuries. 

172
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,500
 The citizen who discovered Kim reported the situation to 119 this morning at 8:00 a.m. 

173
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,090
 Kim was swiftly transferred to the hospital at 8:05 a.m., 

174
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,860
 but he died at 8:25 a.m. 

175
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,110
 The police began an investigation 

176
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,700
 after determining the accident was caused by speeding and the perpetrator 

177
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,500
 fled without taking follow-up measures. 

178
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,410
 The victim, Kim Sang Hyeon, is the second son of Chairman Kim Kang Heon, 

179
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,710
 who's currently serving his sentence in Woowon Prison. 

180
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,180
 Chairman Kim has been serving 2 years and 8 months since he was sentenced 

181
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,990
 to 3 years in prison on charges of assault, bid rigging, 

182
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,280
 and stock price manipulation during the 

183
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,970
 bidding process of Woo One Future Construction. 

184
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,230
 At the time of the trial, Chairman Kim admitted to all charges 

185
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,440
 and declared that he would pay for all crimes on behalf of Woo One Group. 

186
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,730
 For his symbolic act of being a chaebol chairman who doesn't avoid punishment, 

187
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,120
 he had received support from the people. 

188
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,870
Get out and find me some evidence!

189
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,470
The victim is Chairman Kim Kang Heon's second son!

190
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,440
Do I turn myself in now?

191
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,030
Why—

192
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,890
You're telling me...

193
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,180
this is Sang Hyeon?

194
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,400
No. It can't be.

195
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,790
This isn't my dear Sang Hyeon.

196
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,440
His face is...

197
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,970
How?

198
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,140
How did his face get so damaged?

199
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,880
This isn't my Sang Hyeon's face!

200
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,160
His son passed away?

201
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,900
Yes.

202
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,160
Who did it?

203
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,530
Just stay quiet.

204
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,030
Hey, what if we all get screwed over this?

205
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,480
Shut your trap, will you?

206
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,450
I swiftly requested a temporary release

207
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:51,000
so you can meet your son.

208
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,610
How could this happen with just four months left until your release?

209
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,520
I'll hurry and get the approval from my superiors.

210
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,650
It won't be temporary.

211
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
Prepare for my release.

212
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,180
Attorney Jo will be in touch with you.

213
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,780
Don't leave a single detail out, and write down what happened after the accident.

214
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,500
Why?

215
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,960
Just do as I tell you.

216
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,260
 Judge Song, is something wrong? 

217
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,160
 You weren't in your office. 

218
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,810
 - Did you go somewhere?  
- Yeah.

219
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,040
Judge Han, I forgot it was my wife's memorial day today.

220
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,710
I'll head back in the late afternoon after taking care of some things.

221
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,690
Get it together.

222
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,750
Someone died because of your mistake.

223
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,750
Feeling tormented with guilt and self-pity...

224
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,330
None of that is helpful right now.

225
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,290
 Was this purely a hit-and-run accident? 

226
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,190
 Or was there a gang power struggle involved? 

227
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,790
 The reason this case has emerged as an issue 

228
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,660
 is because the deceased is the second son of Woo One Group's Chairman, Kim Kang Heon. 

229
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,280
 Chairman Kim Kang Heon of Woo One Group is a legendary figure. 

230
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,830
 In the 1960's, a corrupt political force... 

231
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,520
Judge Song?

232
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,990
You must've left work early today.

233
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,840
Yes.

234
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,230
You must have the day off.

235
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,880
I took the morning off. I had an errand to run this morning.

236
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,940
I see.

237
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,250
Okay.

238
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,700
Well, then...

239
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,420
 Chairman Kim Wu Won 

240
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,520
  inherited the business from his father, the founder, Kim Ju Han. 

241
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,770
 Kim Wu Won created the Woo One faction and established Woo One Future Construction. 

242
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,700
 For 60 years, for two generations, Kim Wu Won maintained his reputation 

243
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,980
 as the leader of a violent crime organization. 

244
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,620
 When Kim Kang Heon succeeded to the chairman's position, he declared  

245
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,710
 "I will no longer run an underground business." 

246
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,070
 The internal opposition from the group was quite heavy. 

247
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,860
 There was a bloodbath within Woo One Group. 

248
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,950
  The leaders of five other gangs went missing or died mysteriously. 

249
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,340
 That's right. 

250
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,850
 The most likely suspect at that time was Chairman Kim Kang Heon... 

251
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,130
 There he comes! 

252
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,930
 Block the reporters. Block them! 

253
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,230
 Block the reporters! 

254
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,250
 Stop taking pictures! 

255
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,100
 Stop! 

256
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:55,080
 Please stop taking pictures! 

257
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,790
 - Excuse me! 
- Grab him! 

258
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,470
There's Chairman Kim Kang Heon!

259
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,430
No filming!

260
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,770
Block them off!

261
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,930
Get in the car!

262
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,900
Judge Song! What brings you here?

263
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,720
I'd like to ask you something.

264
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,570
Yes, go ahead.

265
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,270
The scrapped cars record from Park Sin Yeong's case...

266
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,930
You handed it over to the prosecution, right?

267
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,030
That's right.

268
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,820
I think there's missing information.

269
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,390
The perpetrator's lawyer was talking about the possibility of evidence tampering.

270
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,430
Sorry? No way. What are you saying?

271
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,540
I have nothing to do with the victim whatsoever.

272
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,860
Why would I tamper with the scrapped cars record?

273
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm not good with computers, so I wrote it by hand.

274
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,300
Other than that, I have no shame under heaven.

275
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,420
Is that so?

276
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,870
Can I have a look at this?

277
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
Yes.

278
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,080
 Hello, this is Master of Parts Repair. 

279
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,370
 I'll be showing you the removal and assembly of the Honors' headlights. 

280
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,810
 Open the Honors hood and remove the bolts connected to the grill. 

281
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,400
 Next, unscrew a bolt attached to the headlight, 

282
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,600
 and another inside the hole. 

283
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,230
 Once you remove the pin under the bumper's lower part, 

284
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,200
 you can take it out easily like this. 

285
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,780
 Insert the connector again and align them back together nicely. 

286
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,690
 And it's done after you screw the bolts back in. 

287
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:07,060
 After that, neatly align the bumper back with the seams and give it a nice push. 

288
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,120
 Woo One 
  To give a brief explanation of Woo One Group here, 

289
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,070
 Woo One Group's name doesn't come from the name of the city it's in, Woowon. 

290
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,100
 That's right. 

291
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,530
 They bought the reclaimed land from the government ten years ago, 

292
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:44,220
built residential and commercial areas, and created a city.

293
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
It's a city made by Woo One Group,

294
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,330
which is why it got its name from the government, Woowon City.

295
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:54,170
It's the first corporation to have a city named after it in the history of Korea.

296
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,780
- That's right.
 - And the person who made this possible is

297
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,500
Chairman Kim Kang Heon. That's what I'm saying.

298
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:20,580
The estimated time of the accident was around 7:30 a.m. today.

299
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,300
He was riding the motorcycle, Fasterbik Kiruna,

300
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,490
when he collided with an unidentified vehicle

301
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,010
and was left in negligence for thirty minutes.

302
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,960
The vehicle's driver took off right after.

303
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,490
He was found by a 21-year-old woman named Kang Mi Gyeong, who was jogging at 8 a.m.

304
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:49,710
Around 8:05 a.m., the EMT rescued Kim Sang Hyeon and transported him to a hospital.

305
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,510
He was alive when he was found.

306
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,940
They arrived at the hospital around 8:20 a.m.

307
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,610
and attempted an emergency operation,

308
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,170
but he passed away.

309
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,610
If he was...

310
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:22,170
transported to the hospital right after the accident, would he have lived?

311
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,430
They said that would've been highly likely.

312
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,200
And the sentence?

313
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,790
If there were a clear intent to murder, he'd get at least ten years.

314
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:41,280
But if that's not the case, it's a fatal car accident and a hit-and-run combined,

315
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,050
which is five years at most.

316
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,280
That's...

317
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,050
- Pardon? 
- Is that all?

318
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,760
Oh, well...

319
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,200
There is a recording of the call made to 119 on your son's phone at the time of the accident.

320
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,190
I'll take my leave.

321
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,950
 Hello, this is 119. What's your emergency? 

322
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,990
 Excuse me, are you all right? 

323
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,390
 Are you feeling unwell? 

324
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,760
 Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment? 

325
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,230
 Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors? 

326
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,720
 Police investigation, Woo One Group investigation 

327
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,520
 Destroy vehicle evidence 

328
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,000
Judge Song...

329
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,010
I've been telling her she can't for the past thirty minutes.

330
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,050
But she just won't take no for an answer.

331
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,360
Ma'am!

332
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,990
Hello!

333
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,290
I'm allowed to meet with you now that the trial is over, right?

334
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,320
I'm sorry.

335
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,750
I have nothing to say to you regarding the ruling.

336
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm not here to make a complaint.

337
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,230
I once read what you wrote in the newspaper.

338
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,870
"Life After Sin and Trial."

339
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,780
I felt so wronged after the trial ended.

340
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,100
So, I went to the perpetrator's house to confront him.

341
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,330
A mere two-year sentence when he killed someone?

342
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,620
Isn't that absurd?

343
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:06,880
But those people live the same sad lives as we do.

344
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,980
Struggling people can recognize the struggles of others.

345
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:17,120
I went to lash out at him but returned without saying a word.

346
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,070
Drink it.

347
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,940
You should thank him.

348
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,880
Thank you.

349
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,420
I couldn't help but think this last night.

350
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,340
Two years.

351
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:04,830
In two years, I'll be able to heal the pain of our children's loss of their mother.

352
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:11,400
The time it'll take for the man who killed my daughter-in-law to repent for his sin.

353
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,110
The time it'll take for our rage to be appeased.

354
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,420
The "life after trial" you spoke about...

355
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:30,150
I thought perhaps that could take precedence over the crime that was committed.

356
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,870
Say, "Thank you."

357
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,670
Thank you.

358
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,990
I'm ashamed, but I came empty-handed

359
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,470
because I heard you won't accept even a single cookie.

360
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,760
Please just accept my gratitude.

361
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,280
Thank you for your thoughtful judgment.

362
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,280
Please...

363
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,560
give her time to finish her snack.

364
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,270
You are truly a great judge.

365
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,710
What will you do?

366
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,850
If our Sang Hyeon had been immediately transported to the hospital,

367
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,780
they said he could've survived.

368
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,280
Someone...

369
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,630
had the intention to kill Sang Hyeon.

370
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,930
 Rest in peace Kim Sang Hyeon 

371
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,800
What do you plan to do?

372
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,790
Do you still wish to remain a well-respected Chairman?

373
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,420
You hated Sang Hyeon the most.

374
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,810
When Sang Hyeon died,

375
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,510
you were the first person I thought of.

376
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,830
Are you sure you didn't do it?

377
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:24,790
Can you prove you didn't do it?

378
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,720
Eun.

379
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,780
This is hard on you, isn't it?

380
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,920
I'll take care of things once the funeral is over.

381
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,190
You just return to America.

382
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,920
Give it to me.

383
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:48,440
Why do we always want a drink poured by someone else?

384
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,330
It's convenient to pour it ourselves.

385
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:55,100
However much we want and when we want it.

386
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,530
That's because it makes us look shabby.

387
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,690
We spend all day picking up after other people

388
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,620
and we finally get some time to ourselves at night.

389
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,810
It feels good to have someone pour a drink for you.

390
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,690
It looks good to other people, too.

391
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,080
Goodness. This is a first.

392
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,050
Should I call someone to pour your drinks?

393
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,320
At this rate,

394
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,960
I won't even get a taste.

395
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,430
Tell me.

396
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,660
Gosh, this is frustrating. Go on and tell me.

397
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,420
You're such a...

398
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,460
Today was Eun Hye's memorial day.

399
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,200
It feels like forever ago,

400
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,360
but it's only been two years.

401
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,640
When a person dies, they leave behind many things.

402
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,630
Most of them are here.

403
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,420
No matter how hard I try to forget, I just can't.

404
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,160
Terrible, right?

405
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,600
At least I have a lot of experience, so it's bearable.

406
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,780
What to do when I'm hurting, and what to do when I feel sad.

407
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,550
You get seasoned as you get older.

408
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,560
But Ho Yeong doesn't know how.

409
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,540
He has no way of knowing.

410
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,340
Since he has yet to know...

411
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,430
the world or people.

412
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,500
When Eun Hye was alive, we used to leave her car in her mother's garage.

413
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,960
At 3:00 p.m. today, her mother left it in front of our house.

414
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,560
It probably holds a lot of memories of her.

415
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,820
Eun Hye took Ho Yeong on a lot of trips in that car.

416
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:25,210
He must've sat in the car crying.

417
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,620
He was probably hurting a lot.

418
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,100
Well, Ho Yeong is kind.

419
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,760
Kind people usually hurt more.

420
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,460
I want to...

421
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,590
get rid of that side for him...

422
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,780
without me, Ho Yeong,

423
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,410
or my mother-in-law knowing.

424
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,190
Without anyone knowing.

425
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,300
I understand what you mean.

426
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,030
Your stomach will be hurting in the morning.

427
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,260
Have some food.

428
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,600
Get home safely.

429
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,210
 Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa 

430
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,860
Aigoo, what do I owe the pleasure?

431
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,970
I almost forgot your voice.

432
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,920
Pardon?

433
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,680
Oh, yes.

434
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,820
Yes, I understand.

435
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,270
Yes.

436
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,690
Where are you?

437
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,900
What the hell are you up to? I haven't seen you around at all.

438
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,640
Let's do a job together.

439
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,550
- You.
 - Yes?

440
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,590
You.

441
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:31,930
Yes.

442
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,770
Why is it so empty?

443
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:38,270
Chairman Kim said not to let anyone in.

444
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,080
- He came out!
 - He came out! He's out!

445
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,180
A word, please!

446
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,440
How's Chairman Kim Kang Heon's condition?

447
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,350
Some view this accident as a warning from a rival gang.

448
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,870
What are your thoughts?

449
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,950
This must've caused a shift in succession.

450
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,600
What's the gang's— I mean, the group's reaction?

451
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,850
Life's worth.

452
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,500
Everyone's worth is different.

453
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,600
How much do you think the bastard who killed Sang Hyeon and fled was worth?

454
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,500
I'm sure you all know how much Woo One Group's second son, Kim Sang Hyeon, was worth.

455
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:52,810
Just how much was the guy who killed Sang Hyeon and ran off worth?

456
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,440
The law will probably view this as a fatal hit-and-run case.

457
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,880
Just an ordinary hit-and-run case.

458
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,790
But I think otherwise.

459
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,990
When a wild dog mauls a man to death,

460
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:17,060
we scour the whole mountain to wipe out the pack of wild dogs.

461
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,730
That's...

462
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,190
That's justice.

463
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:31,100
Do you believe someone was behind Kim Sang Hyeon's death?

464
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,390
How do you feel?

465
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,750
How do you think this will affect the line of succession?

466
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,040
Is there a reason for denying entry to the mortuary?

467
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,810
What is Chairman Kim Gang Heon's condition right now?

468
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,220
Who will be the next chairman...

469
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,820
Did you check everything?

470
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:37,550
When I found out the dead boy was the son of Kim Kang Heon,

471
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,820
my mind went blank.

472
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,350
My only thought

473
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,940
was that I had to save you.

474
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,880
Even now.

475
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:33,420
 Lee Sang Taek, quietly get rid of a car. 

476
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,940
 7:00 a.m. Woowon Memorial Hall - Left flowers at his mom's ossuary. 

477
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,870
 7:10 a.m. - Left the memorial hall. 

478
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:01,320
  Jo Eun Hye 

479
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,680
- What are you working on?
 - What?

480
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,740
Oh, this?

481
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,080
We're replacing the CCTV cameras.

482
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,830
Since when?

483
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,050
Sorry?

484
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,840
When did you start replacing them?

485
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,650
Four days ago.

486
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:02,370
We're replacing all CCTV cameras in all public institutions in this area.

487
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,890
May I ask who you are?

488
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,150
Thank you.

489
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,030
Aigoo, Judge.

490
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:15,090
This is for confirmation of evidence.

491
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:20,520
Would it be possible to check all cars that visited the ossuary in the last three days?

492
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,290
The thing is, we need to replace the cameras and match the frequency with the server.

493
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:30,230
So, they don't work until the construction is done once it begins.

494
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:34,500
Are you saying there's no record?

495
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,170
Yes.

496
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,710
Isn't there a way?

497
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:44,440
Well, this is an open parking lot, which means there's no record of entrance...

498
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,050
I see. I understand.

499
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:12,530
Hey, hurry up.

500
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,100
Didn't they say you were expelled to the US?

501
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,630
Expelled?

502
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,340
There's no way you'd go on your own.

503
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,300
Did you go on your own?

504
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,410
Because you wanted to study?

505
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,210
Didn't you see the news this morning?

506
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,430
I talked about you last night.

507
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:18,310
 He claimed the driver who killed his younger brother must be severely punished. 

508
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,820
 When a wild dog mauls a man to death, 

509
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:26,800
 we scour the whole mountain to wipe out the pack of wild dogs. 

510
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
 That's justice. 

511
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,020
It came out when I turned the TV on.

512
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,530
I'm sure it'll come out all day.

513
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,370
I didn't know you were talking about us.

514
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:44,180
Could it be you're suspecting us?

515
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,030
If Woo One is gone...

516
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:59,630
aren't you the people who will rejoice the most?

517
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,180
If we mess with Chairman Kim Kang Heon,

518
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:13,920
we also know our territory will be wiped out.

519
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,650
We also know that I'm not that stupid, for a fact.

520
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,180
Bring me the bastard who killed Sang Hyeon and ran off.

521
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,410
If that bastard is nowhere to be found in this world,

522
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,240
it means it was your doing.

523
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:07,030
 Funeral Center 

524
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:10,900
 Hello, this is 119. What's your emergency? 

525
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,930
 Excuse me, are you all right? 

526
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,540
 Are you feeling unwell? 

527
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:31,880
 Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment? 

528
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,580
 Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors? 

529
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,970
 Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment? 

530
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,700
 Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors? 

531
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:27,980

 Your Honor 

533
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,600
♫  A wicked is born in the dark  ♫

534
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,960
♫  I never get it like that, mate  ♫

535
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:46,410
♫  Why not me? You always get it all  ♫

536
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,800
♫  It's not fair anymore  ♫

537
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:54,130
♫  What's on your mind? Where is the truth?  ♫

♫  Whenever it feels like never  ♫

539
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,940
 I'll find Sang Hyeon's killer and make him pay. 

540
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,840
 It's a guy named Lee Sang Taek. 

541
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,730
 He works for Jo Mi Yeon of the Budu Gang. 

542
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,750
 Exactly what date was your car stolen? 

543
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,670
 I'd like your son to be a material witness, too. 

544
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,040
 Is there a need for that? 

545
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,360
 Even if they find evidence and investigate you, 

546
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,170
 you must deny it until the end. 

547
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:24,410
 The one I'm facing is Chairman Kim Kang Heon. 

548
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,070
♫  It doesn't feel like home long ago  ♫
