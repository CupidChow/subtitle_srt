 Your Honor 

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,840
 This is a work of fiction. 

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,980
 Characters, places, organizations, incidents, names, ethnic groups, and settings are not related to reality. 

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,050
 I think the power of respect is really something else. 

13
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,470
 But you're Judge Song. 

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,770
 Is it a fender? 

15
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,890
 Fender? 

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,030
 Do you know who stole it? 

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,700
 Someone named Lee Sang Taek. 

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,470
 He's a man in his 40s who lives in Jangbeom-dong. 

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,960
 Lee Sang Taek is dead. 

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,940
 I filmed the person 

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,890
 who killed my father and Jeong Hae Yong in here. 

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,940
 But something is strange. 

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,120
 My father isn't the hit-and-run culprit. 

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,930
 What do you mean? 

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,890
 One time, I was furious because 

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,660
 my father hit Grandmother. 

27
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,620
 I said I'll bring it back later! 

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,140
 You're a failure of a human being. 

29
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,680
 G-Grandmother, are you okay? 

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,840
 But the time my father hit my grandmother was around the time 

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,700
 that guy Kim Sang Hyeon got into the accident. 

32
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,780
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,770
Lee Sang Taek might not be the hit-and-run culprit.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
At the time of Kim Sang Hyeon's accident,

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,450
Lee Sang Taek apparently assaulted his mother, Kim Mi Yeong.

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,300
And the gas explosion happened when he was about to report this to the police.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,940
Does that mean the car's owner is the culprit?

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,320
At that time, Judge Song Pan Ho was in a trial.

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,920
There's someone who drove that car from time to time.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,110
- Who?
 - Judge Song Pan Ho's son.

41
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,910
Song Ho Yeong.

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,630
Should we start this case after Kim Sang Hyeok's case is over?

43
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,500
Judge Song is concealing a case?

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,300
But we're not trying to catch the hit-and-run culprit right now.

45
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,680
 Bastard... 

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,480
 I'll go to Prosecutor Kang So Yeong in the morning and 

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,780
 transfer the murders Kim Sang Hyeok committed to the Prosecution. 

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,780
 - You called for a driver, right?
 - Yes. 

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,490
Get out!

50
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,780
Get out!

51
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,130
Detective Jang, are you okay?

52
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,840
Bastard!

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,580
Freeze.

54
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,500
Detective, are you okay?

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,950
Hey!

56
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,370
Our target is Kim Kang Heon.

57
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,430
I don't know your name,

58
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,480
where you live, or what you do for a living.

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,510
Jo Bin died this morning, right?

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,980
Kim Kang Heon isn't the only one who can do that.

61
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,990
I can do it, too.

62
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,880
You killed Detective Jang Chae Rim today.

63
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,730
 Your Honor: Episode 8 

64
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,520
I'd like you to be by Eun's side until she gets better.

65
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,740
Something that you can't refuse

66
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,690
isn't a favor, but a threat.

67
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,700
If I refuse,

68
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,890
my father and I

69
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,990
won't be safe.

70
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,820
You're...

71
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,850
that kind of a person, Ahjussi.

72
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,910
 Excuse me, are you all right? 

73
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,280
 Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment? 

74
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,840
 Script based on series "Kvodo" by Ohad Knoller, Shlomo Moshiah and Ron Ninio 

75
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,230
- Hello?
-  Ho Yeong, where are you? Where? 

76
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,660
I'm home.

77
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,940
 That's good. Good. 

78
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,570
 I'm coming home right now. 

79
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,950
 Don't go anywhere and stay home. 

80
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,140
Detective Jang Chae Rim is...

81
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,450
being suspicious.

82
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,980
About what?

83
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,600
That you might be the culprit of the hit-and-run incident

84
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,660
where Kim Sang Hyeon died,

85
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,730
not Lee Sang Taek.

86
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,120
I can stop it. I will.

87
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,410
Go stay in the U.S. for a while.

88
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,240
You need to go before the trial ends.

89
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,910
I just met Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

90
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,660
Why would you meet that man?

91
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,540
I didn't go to meet him.

92
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,640
They took me.

93
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,680
He told me to start seeing Eun again.

94
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
No, you can't.

95
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,690
You can't get involved with those people.

96
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,220
Is there a way, then?

97
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,490
"When a person commits a crime,

98
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,400
he's bound to get punished in one way or the other."

99
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,250
That's what you told me when I was little.

100
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,910
And it's true.

101
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,230
Did you do it on purpose?

102
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,530
The hit-and-run incident...

103
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,240
The victim, Kim Sang Hyeon...

104
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,310
was the half-brother of Kim Sang Hyeok, whom you despised.

105
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,500
Did you do it on purpose to avenge your mom?

106
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,030
You didn't.

107
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,180
It was purely an accident, right?

108
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,310
The reason I fabricated the evidence and concealed the case that day was

109
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,680
because you won't get an appropriate punishment for a hit-and-run accident...

110
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,460
You can't get an appropriate punishment for it

111
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,380
because Chairman Kim Gang Heon will take it out on you.

112
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,780
If appropriate punishment by the law were possible,

113
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,500
I would've made you turn yourself in.

114
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,150
- However?
 - However...

115
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,890
if you committed an intentional murder to avenge your mom,

116
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,030
I become an accomplice to a murder.

117
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,810
That's...

118
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,110
something I cannot accept.

119
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,810
Now that it's come to this,  do you want to protect your principles as a judge?

120
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,740
Stop it. Please stop.

121
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,850
The law you tried to protect even in the wake of Mom's death...

122
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,270
You'll protect it again this time, right?

123
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,910
I trust you will.

124
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,330
If the law is enforced correctly,

125
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,710
what kind of punishment will Kim Sang Hyeok,

126
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,510
who drove Mom to death, receive?

127
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,510
 Witness 

128
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,890
 Judge 

129
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,320
 Defendant 

130
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,350
Yes.

131
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,270
He's the person

132
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,970
who was at the scene.

133
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,990
That man killed...

134
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,300
my father, Uncle Hae Yong...

135
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,600
and other foreigners as well...

136
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,500
with a gun.

137
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,070
Why were you there that day, Witness?

138
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:52,170
Jeong Hae Yong said he'd smuggle my father and me to Cambodia.

139
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,780
We were going to go live in Cambodia.

140
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,850
My father had been in hiding and showed up for the first time.

141
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,790
 - Who are you? 
  - Are you Lee Sang Taek? 

142
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,880
 Who are you? 

143
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,110
Did you film that video?

144
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,600
Yes, I-I filmed it.

145
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,830
That's all.

146
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,290
&nbsp;

147
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,150
Defense, you may question the witness.

148
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,660
At the time, there was no streetlight.

149
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,740
The moonlight was probably the only source of light.

150
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,650
Based on what

151
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,580
do you say the man who shot the gun is my client sitting here?

152
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,820
When the trigger was pulled, there was a combustion

153
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,560
and that allowed me to see his face.

154
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,280
Are you saying the face you saw in a split second is accurate?

155
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,380
Based on what?

156
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,280
My father was never kind

157
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,490
and beat up my sister and me whenever.

158
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,310
However...

159
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,990
still...

160
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,160
he was my father.

161
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,230
The one who gave birth to me.

162
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,950
It was the moment that my father was shot to death.

163
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,210
How can I forget it?

164

 010-0795-7969: Blue House's Chief Secretary Kang Mun Seok

 Judge Song Pan Ho? 

166
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,000
Wait...

167
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
how did you know?

168
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,520
We're the Blue House.

169
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,200
We have all the numbers we feel we might need.

170
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,770
What's the occasion?

171
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,560
I'd like to meet with you.

172
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,310
I have something to say to you.

173
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,930
Judge Song, we're always...

174
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,320
 ready to welcome you. 

175
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,960
Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa recommended you last time,

176
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,150
so we're reviewing in a very positive and enthusiastic direction.

177
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,430
When will the appointment decision be made?

178
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,290
Judge Song?

179
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,310
But weren't you negative about politics?

180
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,020
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

181
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,990
Because I felt the limitations of being a judge.

182
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,580
The things the law can do in this world...

183
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,540
had their limits in the end.

184
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,440
After the Woo One's trial ends,

185
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,570
I'll get the approval from the VIP.*
 (*the president of Korea)

186
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,990
After the trial ends?

187
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,770
The trial result needs to become an issue.

188
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,730
Competency and integrity are like water and fire.

189
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,210
Money follows competent people.

190
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,320
But there's no way such money can be clean.

191
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,270
So, please show us that competency and integrity

192
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,090
can be combined.

193
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:58,500
We plan to symbolize your competency and integrity

194
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,080
as the motto of our regime.

195
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,100
What does integrity mean for you?

196
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,090
An appropriate verdict for the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok.

197
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,210
The maximum sentence.

198
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,740
Please be symbolic.

199
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,260
How much later after the trial can I enter the Blue House?

200
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,520
We'll first create an issue in the media.

201
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,970
Woo One Group is only a violent criminal organization.

202
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,010
But it grew too much.

203
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,210
The countless incidents that followed the death of Kim Kang Heon's second son.

204
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,000
Kim Kang Heon is holding and shaking the world too much, as he pleases.

205
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,690
After Kim Sang Hyeok's trial ends,

206
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,960
our regime plans to teach him a lesson.

207
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,170
In that case, when will I...

208
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,820
Wouldn't two months be...

209
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,970
enough to make an issue out of it?

210
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,820
 Woowon District Prosecutors' Office 

211
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Hang in there until the witness testimony ends, even if it's uncomfortable.

212
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,560
Oh, I'm fine.

213
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,470
What I hate the most in this world are

214
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,550
bastards who rule the world with money.

215
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,270
Because their behavior is ruining the world.

216
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,140
You can trust Detective Jang and me and stay strong, right?

217
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,330
I also have to...

218
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,160
exact revenge for my personal reasons.

219
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,700
My Cheong Ha... and Grandmother...

220
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,320
Stuff like this isn't tough at all.

221
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,620
Please don't worry.

222
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,100
It's snack time.

223
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,770
You're a good eater. Good eater.

224
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,730
It's delicious.

225
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:39,370
 How much later after the trial can I enter the Blue House? 

226
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,490
 Wouldn't two months be enough to make an issue out of it? 

227
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,970
Two months after the trial...

228
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,410
Is he telling me to die?

229
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,250
Are you confident?

230
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,260
You only have one chance.

231
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,240
If you fail, we'll all die.

232
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,980
Oppa?

233
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,380
Are you okay?

234
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,730
D-Did my dad force you...

235
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,100
to stay here?

236
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,110
I'm sorry, Oppa.

237
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,560
I was just too worried...

238
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,430
because you seemed to be

239
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,810
in so much pain.

240
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,130
You smile whenever you look at me.

241
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,740
But you're always sad

242
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,520
when you look elsewhere.

243
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,670
That's why...

244
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,050
That's why I wanted to be by your side.

245
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,830
Oppa...

246
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,600
p-please don't hate me too much.

247
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm sorry.

248
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm sorry, Eun.

249
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,750
 Excuse me, are you all right? 

250
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,630
 Are you feeling unwell? 

251
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,990
 Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment? 

252
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,600
 Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors? 

253
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,650
 Song Pan Ho 

254
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,870
 - Are you suffering from respiratory distress? 
 - There was... 

255
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,710
Lee Cheong Gang's testimony during yesterday's trial.

256
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,990
I know. I heard.

257
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,740
There's one last method.

258
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,700
I'll tell you in person.

259
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,870
 Sir, you must pull it together. 

260
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,190
 Please tap the phone once, even if it's difficult. 

261
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,750
 In the current situation, 

262
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,530
there's nothing to stop Lee Cheong Kang from testifying.

263
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,990
We must bring Lee Cheong Kang to join our side.

264
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,730
Before that,

265
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,410
there's something I need to tell you.

266
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,390
About what?

267
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,290
 Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors? 

268
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,480
 Are you suffering from respiratory distress? 

269
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,130
 Sir, it's hard to confirm your location right now,  

270
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,260
 - we'll check your phone's— 

271
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,110
The sound you hear at the end is the flat tire alert.

272
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,060
Using that as a clue, I found a nearby auto shop and

273
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,520
I learned you stopped by the auto shop and deleted the CCTV records.

274
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,360
That's why...

275
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,280
I thought you were the culprit.

276
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,620
However,

277
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,970
a sound kept bothering me.

278
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,600
The raspy breathing you hear from the phone call with 119.

279
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,880
An asthma patient's breathing.

280
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,300
I saw your son...

281
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,670
use a nebulizer.

282
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,610
You're not the culprit.

283
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,230
The boy who killed Sang Hyeon

284
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,550
is next to Eun right now.

285
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,450
Could it be intentional?

286
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,610
If it was intentional,

287
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,810
what does he want?

288
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,620
I-It's by coincidence.

289
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,530
He doesn't want anything. Nothing at all.

290
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,700
You must think you can do as you wish

291
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,860
with my child's life with that shallow authority of a judge.

292
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,410
But... I also have that much power.

293
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,520
Your oldest son, Kim Sang Hyeok...

294
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,020
raped my wife.

295
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,640
His case was dismissed as he was acquitted.

296
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,610
But my wife was living with a horrific memory.

297
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,320
Two years ago, my wife killed herself and

298
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,190
my son has been

299
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,610
living hellish days

300
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,020
after losing his mother.

301
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,330
Of course...

302
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,950
Of course, my son couldn't have caused the accident intentionally.

303
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,030
He just happened to run into your son on that road

304
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,400
at that particular time... by ch-chance—

305
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Enough!

306
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,060
You lost your son and

307
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,020
my child lost his mother.

308
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,820
Losing something more precious than your own life...

309
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,590
I'm sure you know how painful that is.

310
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,390
Since you're experiencing it now.

311
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,280
A-Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa...

312
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,440
Tell him to meet Lee Cheong Kang.

313
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,220
Tell Lee Cheong Kang that Judge Song Pan Ho is the real culprit.

314
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,280
Tell him that Detective Jang Chae Rim knows that the hit-and-run culprit is Judge Song

315
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,360
but she used him to get Chairman Kim Kang Heon and Kim Sang Hyeok of Woo One.

316
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,620
If you tell him that, Lee Cheong Kang will turn his back on them.

317
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,100
If Lee Cheong Kang changes his testimony,

318
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,060
the trial can end with not guilty.

319
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,490
After that,

320
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,610
I'll come to you. And...

321
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,100
I'll accept the consequences.

322
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,160
So, not my son. Please...

323
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,480
Just understand how much pain and agony my son has been experiencing.

324
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,840
N-No. No.

325
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,450
 If you lure Chairman Kim Kang Heon, 

326
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,610
 we'll ambush him on his way back. 

327
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,320
No.

328
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,640
No.

329
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,760
- What was he talking about? 
 - Pardon?

330
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,410
Sang Hyeok raped Song Pan Ho's wife?

331
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,230
I didn't know about it, either.

332
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,530
Sang Hyeok has caused way too many problems.

333
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,690
Look into the details.

334
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,230
Yes, sir.

335
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,370
No. No.

336
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,160
- Chairman! 
 - Stay put.

337
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,590
You can't do it. Just go back.

338
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,170
Don't lay a finger on him!

339
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,630
You might end up in danger, too.

340
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,160
I'll earn some time.

341
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,430
Right now!

342
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,040
Run away if you want to live.

343
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,470
Yes, I understand.

344
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,190
- Let's go back. 
 - Let's go back!

345
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,880
Hey, get back!

346
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,510
Shit, I said to get back!

347
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,280
- Stuffy, huh? 
- Huh?

348
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,580
No, I'm fine.

349
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,150
Go and get some fresh air in the garden in the front.

350
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,800
Hang in there until the trial ends.

351
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,260
Even if we win the trial,

352
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,330
will I be safe?

353
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,620
Will you also be...

354
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,540
safe, Detective?

355
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,020
Yes.

356
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,470
I'll defend you.

357
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,170
This country isn't that sloppy.

358
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,620
Grandmother...

359
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,990
Cheong Ha...

360
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,990
You're Lee Cheong Kang, right?

361
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,690
Who are you?

362
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,490
 Jeong Yi Hwa  
I'm an assemblyman.

363
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,160
If they find out the witness stayed with the prosecutor and the detective in charge,

364
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,330
it will be disadvantageous for you during the trial.

365
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,450
Did you know that?

366
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,740
The most important thing is that your father's not the hit-and-run culprit.

367
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,340
In that case, who could be the culprit?

368
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,350
Whose doing is it that your grandmother, sister,

369
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,000
and your father passed away?

370
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,440
Making your father steal that car and

371
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,360
junk the car without anyone knowing

372
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,000
was an order from Jo Mi Yeon of Budu Gang.

373
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,320
And I asked her to do it.

374
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,490
Then, who exactly asked me for this favor?

375
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,530
This is Song Pan Ho.

376
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,040
Are you available for a phone call right now?

377
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,700
Let's meet briefly.

378
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,670
Who is it?

379
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,510
Song Pan Ho.

380
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,320
He's the judge in charge of Kim Sang Hyeok's trial right now.

381
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,840
Song Pan Ho, Prosecutor Kang So Yeong, and Detective Jang Chae Rim

382
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,130
are all in this together.

383
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,020
But can you trust them?

384
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,190
Stop lying to me.

385
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,240
Here.

386
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,710
What about now?

387
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,530
What are you doing?

388
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,680
Assemblyman.

389
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,700
What brings you here?

390
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,060
We're from the Internal Affairs.

391
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,490
We got a report.

392
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,190
Is the prosecutor on the case allowed to stay with a witness

393
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,100
who can influence the trial greatly?

394
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,740
Wouldn't it be possible to fabricate evidence?

395
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,700
It's a witness protection program.

396
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,670
We can't help it.

397
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,950
You should've reported it to your higher-ups first.

398
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,150
Because it's dangerous!

399
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,080
We're up against Woo One! Whom can we trust?

400
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,690
Detective Jang...

401
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,780
is this true?

402
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,560
Is Judge Song Pan Ho...

403
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,380
on your side?

404
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,110
I will protect this child from now on.

405
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,040
He wishes to be with us.

406
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,630
Really?

407
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,980
Do you wish to stay with Detective Jang or Prosecutor Kang?

408
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,390
Or do you want to go with me?

409
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,180
I can give you what you want.

410
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,330
The thing that's more brutal than killing your father...

411
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,870
Let's catch the bastard who framed all of this on your father.

412
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,720
You and I will, that is.

413
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,430
Can you guarantee my safety?

414
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,610
That's not all.

415
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,970
Shouldn't you think about the rest of your life as well?

416
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,290
Detective Jang...

417
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,520
did you try to use me...

418
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,870
so you can get Chairman Kim Kang Heon?

419
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,270
Hold on.

420
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,940
This is nuts, seriously.

421
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,780
I was in the middle of work, so I only have about 10 minutes.

422
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,770
I'm getting pressured because of the trial.

423
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,230
You wouldn't know Woo One Group's power since you're in there.

424
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,850
If I sentence Kim Sang Hyeok guilty,

425
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,610
I don't know what will happen to me.

426
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,430
What do you need us to do?

427
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:14,000
I'll enter the Blue House as soon as the trial ends.

428
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,030
If that's not possible,

429
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,650
I can't give Kim Sang Hyeok a guilty verdict.

430
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,190
What we want is...

431
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
a judge who sets the standard for law and principles, never giving in to pressure.

432
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,440
And that firm standard will become the cornerstone that supports the world.

433
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,600
That's...

434
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,890
That's the same thing.

435
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,560
I'm saying I can protect the law and the principles

436
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,370
if you promise my entrance as soon as the trial ends.

437
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,710
There's another Chief of Political Affairs candidate.

438
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,450
We thought you were the best fit for the job.

439
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,230
But they sent me these pictures.

440
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,350
Taking pictures around Chairman Kim Gang Heon must've been difficult.

441
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,150
But they somehow managed to take pictures.

442
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,010
Anyhow, I understand what you mean, Judge Song.

443
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,030
I'll go and report to the VIP.

444
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,680
If he gives the word, I'll call you before the trial ends.

445
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,920
I didn't know you and Assemblyman Jeong

446
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,500
were connected like this, Chairman Kim.

447
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,000
I can grant you all your wishes until the day you die.

448
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,990
The hit-and-run culprit...

449
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,130
Is it really Judge Song Pan Ho?

450
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,620
If Judge Song Pan Ho is really the culprit,

451
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,370
can you make sure...

452
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,680
he's punished justly for his crime?

453
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,360
That was my job, to begin with.

454
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,320
Anything else you want?

455
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,060
No.

456
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,700
In fact, I'm not certain.

457
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:57,310
I just assumed that the man must be Kim Sang Hyeok.

458
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:06,050
- Why?
 - My grandmother and...

459
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,840
younger sister, Cheong Ha, died from a gas explosion.

460
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,190
Back then,

461
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,220
people said it was Woo One Group's doing.

462
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,780
I also thought so.

463
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,780
So, I thought that man must be Kim Sang Hyeok.

464
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,940
At the time, I wanted to kill everyone in Woo One Group.

465
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,340
By chance, do you have evidence that the deaths of your grandmother

466
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,400
and sister were caused by Woo One Group?

467
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,080
That's what people were saying.

468
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,380
Of those people, did anyone say that to you a lot?

469
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,740
Yes.

470
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,940
Would that be Detective Jang Chae Rim?

471
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,730
Yes.

472
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,910
Is there anyone else?

473
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,310
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong.

474
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,020
 Prosecutor 

475
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,160
Your Honor,

476
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,310
Before the trial began, Witness Lee Cheong Gang met Detective Jang Chae Rim

477
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,400
with the video footage he recorded.

478
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,310
He gave her the video and communicated with her for about a month.

479
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,790
Of course, while staying at a place she arranged for him.

480
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,870
And when the trial began and stood on the witness stand,

481
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,460
he stayed in Prosecutor Kang So Yeong's office.

482
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,120
Under the reason of witness protection, those two have been

483
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,030
gaslighting Witness Lee Cheong Gang

484
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,340
throughout their time together.

485
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,690
Those two have been madly engaged in catching Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

486
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,820
Two years ago, Detective Jang Chae Rim

487
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,530
tried and failed to arrest Kim Sang Hyeok, sitting in the defendant's seat.

488
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,120
And three years ago, Prosecutor Kang So Yeong

489
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,060
gave Chairman Kim Kang Heon a three-year sentence.

490
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,610
Although the reason eludes me, Your Honor,

491
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:46,850
this trial is being manipulated by a detective and prosecutor who abhor Woo One.

492
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,560
Your Honor!

493
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,760
This sacred court

494
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,950
was being controlled by their personal ambition.

495
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,560
That is all.

496
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,610
With that...

497
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,910
the court is adjourned.

498
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,710
The verdict hearing will take place in three days

499
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,120
on May 17th at 2 p.m.

500
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,190
Yes, Chairman.

501
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,810
The final hearing ended without a hitch.

502
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,980
- Continue. 
 - Yes.

503
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,620
Two years ago in 2022, your oldest son—

504
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,920
Kim Sang Hyeok forced drugs on Jo Eun Hye, who was already high...

505
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,940
Well, Jo Eun Hye was volunteering in a slum outside of Woowon City.

506
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,390
Sang Hyeok was accused of...

507
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,880
forcibly administering drugs to Jo Eun Hye.

508
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,580
And...

509
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,140
it seems he also sexually assaulted her.

510
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:45,020
At the time, the investigation was led by Detective Jang Chae Rim.

511
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,430
The investigation of the forced drug use was closed without pressing charges

512
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,560
and the sexual assault case was buried.

513
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,410
Why wasn't I informed about all this?

514
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,880
Yes, well, you were in prison at the time.

515
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,160
And this was only one of many small incidents.

516
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,830
After the investigation concluded,

517
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:12,040
we sent him to America right away.

518
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,780
Ever since then, Jang Chae Rim became very resentful

519
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,860
and she wouldn't listen to me.

520
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,250
She kept tracking Sang Hyeok, saying she'd catch him somehow.

521
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,080
She's been a thorn in my side.

522
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,620
She's so obsessively persistent.

523
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,400
I'll manage her so she doesn't become a nuisance to you.

524
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,650
We'll probably lose again.

525
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,600
Probably.

526
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,660
Is it utterly impossible to beat him?

527
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,210
Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

528
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,590
This was probably the best opportunity of our lifetime.

529
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,900
If we fail again this time,

530
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,840
it means he's an invincible being.

531
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,580
How can the world function like this?

532
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,880
No, it's probably because we're not competent enough.

533
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,100
Don't blame the world like an idiot.

534
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,060
Judge Song...

535
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,820
How could Judge Song do that?

536
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,930
We can't end it here.

537
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,300
There's still more we can do.

538
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,800
I can't help it, even if I have to play dirty.

539
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,470
Call Jo Mi Yeon.

540
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,110
Wh-What's the matter?

541
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,940
Do you think you can hide it forever?

542
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,270
Judge Song, lies have many flaws.

543
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,430
In order to hide the flaws, you must tell another lie.

544
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,740
Then, you end up with more flaws.

545
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,340
Do you know what happens then?

546
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,260
You get caught in the end.

547
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,130
What could've ended with a slap on the wrist will turn into a death sentence.

548
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,190
- I-I don't know what you're saying—
 - Song Pan Ho!

549
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,580
If I find Jo Mi Yeon,

550
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,790
I'll kill you even without Chairman Kim's permission.

551
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,560
I'm letting you live only until the trial ends.

552
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,310
After that...

553
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,660
I'll give unimaginable pain to you.

554
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,760
I don't know, either.

555
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,590
I don't know what to do...

556
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,000
from here, either.

557
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,640
 Jang Chae Rim 

558
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,860
Detective Jang, what is it?

559
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,560
Are you free right now?

560
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,200
 Isn't it too late? 

561
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,560
You have to meet me tonight.

562
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,610
What is this regarding?

563
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,800
It's about Ho Yeong.

564
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,230
What about him?

565
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,670
 I'll tell you in person. 

566
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,950
If it's about Ho Yeong, I become impatient. Tell me now.

567
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,240
No, I can't tell you right now.

568
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,880
I'll text you a location. Meet me there within the hour.

569
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,780
 It's not difficult or complicated. 

570
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,640
 It's simple. 

571
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,570
 I just need to save Ho Yeong. 

572
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,860
What do you have to tell me?

573
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,730
Ho Yeong's accident...

574
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,670
wasn't by chance.

575
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,760
It was a crime he prepared for a long time.

576
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,660
As to his motive,

577
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,760
you and I can both guess why.

578
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,180
To avenge his mom.

579
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:57,400
He prepared for at least six months and committed the crime on the day he set.

580
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,390
No. There's no way.

581
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,690
I've obtained both witness and evidence.

582
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,030
He will be tried as a criminal, not for a car accident.

583
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,240
However,

584
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,450
I also want revenge.

585
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,570
Just like Ho Yeong.

586
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,010
If Kim Sang Hyeok receives the punishment he deserves for his crimes,

587
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,110
I'm willing to bury the truth I know.

588
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,620
If you grant Kim Sang Hyeok a not-guilty verdict

589
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,280
when you're aware he's the culprit...

590
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,590
I'll have to let the world know the incident I tracked down.

591
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,180
- How dirty of you.
 - The dirtiest person...

592
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,930
is you, Judge Song.

593
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,200
- Must I give you an answer today?
 - Yes, you do.

594
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,180
After today,

595
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,940
I don't know what I might do.

596
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,990
Can you give me a cigarette?

597
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,220
 Park Chang Hyeok 

598
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,230
 What is it? 

599
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,190
Let me ask you for a difficult favor.

600
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,260
I'll be honest.

601
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,930
If Kim Sang Hyeok is ruled guilty,

602
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,950
Chairman Kim Kang Heon won't leave Ho Yeong and me unscathed.

603
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,280
I also must find a way to survive.

604
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,090
We'll protect you.

605
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:54,340
No. There's no one in this world who can protect us

606
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,680
from Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

607
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,640
Which leads to the question,

608
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,100
after the trial ends,

609
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,060
is there any way

610
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,950
you can stow us away without anyone noticing?

611
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,180
Yes, I can help you do that.

612
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,390
After that accident,

613
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,080
everything fell apart.

614
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,940
It feels like the world is going insane.

615
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,990
A lot has happened.

616
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:53,920
I hope we never see each other after today.

617
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,210
Chairman.

618
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,790
How should I proceed?

619
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:06,990
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the ⚖️Crossed Paths🔗 Team @ Viki.com  

620
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,190
You're home?

621
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,490
Was it intentional?

622
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,050
To avenge Mom?

623
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:36,950
Why can't you think about the people who remain alive?

624
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:44,780
Can't you see why I gave in to the trial?

625
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,480
It was for you, who are still alive.

626
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,440
I didn't care if I became a cowardly

627
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,820
and shabby man who lost his beloved wife like that.

628
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,050
As long as you're safe,

629
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,860
I don't care if this entire world collapses.

630
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,320
That was the best I could do.

631
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,000
The best you could do?

632
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,330
You did that for yourself.

633
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:32,040
You forced me to live a life

634
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,360
that was worse than dying.

635
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,610
Ho Yeong...

636
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,350
Why...

637
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,800
Why do you think I killed Kim Sang Hyeon?

638
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:50,340
A life that's worse than dying.

639
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,860
I wanted to gift that kind of life to Chairman Kim Kang Heon.

640
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:02,750
But you're just trying to save me because that's what you're afraid of.

641
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,420
Do you wish for me

642
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,660
to leave you to die?

643
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,160
Yes.

644
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,960
No.

645
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,290
You must live.

646
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:33,550
I'll keep you alive, no matter what.

647
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,570
 Your Honor 

648
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:46,760
♫  At a familiar stop,  ♫

649
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,120
♫   you and I realized  ♫

650
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,150
♫  We're not that naive  ♫

651
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,600
♫  What is in your mind?  ♫

652
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,970
♫  Come across the line  ♫

653
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,800
♫  Our eyes, already decide  ♫

654
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,910
 You'll be found not guilty. 

655
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,950
 I'm going to find him guilty. 

656
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,010
 Moving the world means you know 

657
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:19,620
 everything that's going on! 

658
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,050
 I'll get your revenge. 

659
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:25,870
 What's your son plotting this time and why? 

660
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,640
 That's the only way for survival. 

661
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,650
 You've got to be prudent. 

662
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,910
 What on earth must I do to end this? 

663
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:37,160
 I'll announce the verdict.
