Cheong Ha... Cheong...

Call 119! Hurry!

15
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,830
There's a fire! A fire!

16
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,850
Get the fire extinguisher!

17
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,240
Get the fire extinguisher!

18
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,790
Hurry! Fire!

19
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,700
Call 119!

20
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,170
Goodness! Cheong Ha must be in there.

21
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,320
No!

22
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,160
 Your Honor: Episode 3 

23
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,160
That's something we should take care of!

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,590
You're all so frustrating.

25
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,340
Chairman Kim isn't in a state of mind to deal with these things right now.

26
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,570
Showing a silent but certain power at times like this is Woo One's way!

27
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,280
So what are you suggesting we do?

28
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,810
That we go to war with those people?

29
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,400
Woo One is no longer a violent organization!

30
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
So, are you saying we should turn a blind eye?

31
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,170
Aren't you angry?

32
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,260
Vice Chairman, why don't you say something about this?

33
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,250
Do you think the Vice Chairman is in the right state of mind?

34
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,340
- Get it together!
 - Get it together?

35
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,210
- Lee Jeong Min, you son of a bitch!
 - What?

36
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,550
Are you a thug?

37
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,020
What do you all think you're doing—

38
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,470
 Woo One Group 

39
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,960
When you have a difficult and complicated situation,

40
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,490
the one who can resolve the situation should move alone.

41
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,480
It'll only confuse the person trying to handle things

42
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,570
if every Tom, Dick, and Harry offers to help

43
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,120
without even having a grasp of the situation.

44
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,370
I'd like every one of you...

45
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,910
to focus on your duties at work.

46
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,040
Dumbasses.

47
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,730
Excuse me, coming through. We're from Woowon Police Station.

48
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,170
What's the victim's condition?

49
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,450
Clear the site, and let me know when you're done with the inspection.

50
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,040
Okay.

51
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,890
Where were you, Cheong Gang?

52
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,500
Wh-Where are Grandma and Cheong Ha?

53
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,530
Aigoo... Ask the police over there.

54
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,060
- Aigoo, poor boy.
 - Hold on.

55
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,470
Are you related to the victims?

56
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,810
Yes. Wh-What happened?

57
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,340
Yes, understood.

58
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,360
There was a fire at Lee Sang Taek's residence.

59
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,080
His old mother and young daughter died.

60
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,650
I heard the news.

61
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,660
I heard there was an explosion.

62
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,200
It's Kim Gang Heon's doing.

63
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,920
The father who lost his child will go to the edge of hell.

64
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,680
Even so. How could he do such a thing?

65
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,210
Today's...

66
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,930
gas explosion will be on the news.

67
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,450
No, even if it doesn't appear on the news,

68
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,840
Lee Sang Taek will find out.

69
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,150
He won't just sit back after losing his mother and daughter.

70
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,900
On top of that, he was even framed for a crime he didn't commit.

71
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,640
What Kim Gang Heon is after isn't revenge.

72
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,000
Bait.

73
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,860
It's bait.

74
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,970
Yes, Ma'am. I handled things as you ordered.

75
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,600
Yes, all right.

76
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,410
Please don't worry.

77
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,700
I'll call you back.

78
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,750
Bad deeds should be done discreetly.

79
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,500
But I caught you.

80
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,340
I heard you know a few Budu Gang mutts who take care of dirty jobs.

81
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,910
- I don't know what you mean— 
- This bastard.

82
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,870
I already know everything.

83
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,270
Introduce me to the most obedient mutt out of them.

84
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll keep my mouth shut

85
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,080
about what I know, then.

86
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,270
Shit!

87
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,270
How did you know I was here?

88
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,080
What's the problem?

89
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,360
Chairman wants to see you.

90
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,590
Gosh.

91
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
What if I won't go?

92
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,570
I said

93
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,910
the chairman wants to see you.

94
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,920
At the moment,

95
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,460
no one knows where Lee Sang Taek is.

96
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,870
That bastard is hopeless.

97
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,300
You don't know what he'd do if he found out his house was torched.

98
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,410
All right, let's lay things out

99
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,460
Lee Sang Taek took the car in front of Judge Song Pan Ho's house

100
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,070
on April 9th at 5:00 a.m.

101
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,820
Woo One Group's second son was in the hit-and-run accident

102
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,610
on April 8th at around 7:30 a.m.

103
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,850
Lee Sang Taek is currently being

104
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,270
hunted down as the perpetrator in Kim Sang Hyeon's accident—

105
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,650
Song Pan Ho is the culprit.

106
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,050
This could've all been avoided if we had just quietly junked the car.

107
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,530
Do you think we wouldn't have been caught

108
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,990
if we junked the car?

109
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,700
Is that right?

110
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,160
So what's your plan?

111
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,510
Whether we did it knowingly or not,

112
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,370
if Chairman Kim Gang Heon finds out we set up the case,

113
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,840
all of our members,

114
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,120
including ourselves, would be wiped out.

115
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,870
If we go to Chairman Kim Gang Heon

116
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,990
and tell him the truth about what happened,

117
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,970
do you think he'll spare us?

118
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,950
Since the situation already turned out like this,

119
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,090
we shouldn't nitpick who did wrong.

120
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,560
We should go about settling this accident. That's important.

121
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,600
The more dangerous the situation,

122
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,900
the more money it'll cost to settle it.

123
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,010
In a couple of years, Song Pan Ho is bound to become the Constitutional Court Justice,

124
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,860
Chief Justice of the High Court,

125
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,890
or the Minister of Justice Department. Okay?

126
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,830
He's got nothing to hide in any way

127
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,380
except for this incident.

128
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,230
If the Budu Gang, who only runs errands for Woo One,

129
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,560
holds this over Song Pan Ho's head,

130
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,700
what will it be able to do?

131
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,700
Are you certain?

132
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,300
There's nothing certain in this world.

133
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,970
I'm just betting my all on the highest odds.

134
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,840
How dare a mere thug challenge an assemblyman?

135
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,510
My apologies.

136
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,070
You must keep your word.

137
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,890
CEO Jo.

138
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,190
This situation is a one-way road.

139
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,560
We can't afford to turn back around.

140
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,990
Make sure you handle this.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,710
Lee Sang Taek's child will come to us looking for his dad.

142
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,060
You have to identify the victims to begin the investigation, right?

143
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,680
Yes, we can only start the investigation once we identify the deceased.

144
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,420
That's going to take some time.

145
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,720
He keeps insisting it's not them.

146
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,770
Can I go to the restroom?

147
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,130
- Isn't this almost certain? 
- Right.

148
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,360
Look at the items and traces found at the house that burnt down.

149
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,150
No other tenants were registered. There's no way it could be anyone else.

150
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,030
- That's right.
 - Let's wrap this up.

151
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,590
Gosh, my head.

152
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,800
What did you want—

153
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,690
Get up.

154
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,000
Why are you doing this?

155
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,810
I'm going to find the culprit who killed Sang Hyeon.

156
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll punish him accordingly.

157
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,420
It's not your place to butt in.

158
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,720
F***.

159
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,340
I'm aware of the thoughts and emotions in your head.

160
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,540
If you want to grumble to me,

161
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,090
it won't be too late to do so once this whole situation is over.

162
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,440
Now is not the time.

163
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,450
Return to America.

164
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,670
What is it?

165
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,380
Tell Chang Hyeok to come.

166
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,400
I want to see Uncle Hae Yong.

167
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,610
Who are you?

168
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,620
Lee Sang Taek's son.

169
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,410
Wait here for a moment.

170
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,490
Around 6:10 p.m. this evening, a fire from a gas explosion started at a container house

171
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,770
located at 284 Pyeonghwa-ro, Deokgwang-gu, Woowon Special Borough.

172
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:09,830
 71-year-old Kim and 7-year-old granddaughter Lee, who were in the house, died. 

173
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,520
- There's something a bit too odd 
- Yes.

174
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,640
to presume it was a simple fire.

175
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,690
The owner of this container house is closely related

176
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,720
 to the death of Kim Sang Hyeon from April 8th, the second son of Woo One Group. 

177
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,430
 Yes, I see. 

178
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,370
 The video you're about to watch was reported to us by a nearby resident 

179
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,090
 at the time of the fire. 

180
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,170
 Restricted Caller ID 

181
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
 Restricted Caller ID 

182
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
 Woo One Group's Second Son, Kim Sang Hyeon, Killed In A Hit-and-Run Accident. 

183
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,840
 The culprit who ran away ... 

184
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,930
 Continuing His Family's Legal Profession. 
 Son Ho Yeong, the son of Judge Song Pan Ho 

185
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,280
 also plans to go to law school. 

186
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,700
 Restricted Caller ID 

187
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,630
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

188
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,400
 Please check and dial again. 

189
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,230
 Is your father also scary, Oppa? 

190
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,470
No.

191
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,700
He is very kind.

192
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,170
He's so kind

193
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,240
that it's frustrating.

194
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,190
Oh, I see.

195
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,320
Oppa, are you busy right now?

196
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,690
 No. Why? 

197
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,090
I want to see you right now.

198
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,660
Really?

199
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,070
In that case, should we meet right now?

200
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,080
But won't you get in trouble with your parents if you come out so late?

201
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,950
No, it's fine.

202
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,260
Mom and Dad are both too busy to care about me.

203
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,060
Okay.

204
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,950
The money?

205
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,580
Hey, are you going to open it up here?

206
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,000
Take it easy, or your bones will waste away!

207
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,740
Hey.

208
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,660
Who is it?

209
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,000
I heard you take jobs from Woo One from time to time.

210
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,580
Woo One?

211
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,120
You're the oldest son, huh?

212
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,350
- What brings you here?
 - I need to catch Lee Sang Taek.

213
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,480
I was wondering if you knew.

214
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,980
I don't know.

215
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,060
I'm not telling you to tell me right now.

216
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,460
 Hello, this is 119. What's your emergency? 

217
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,300
 Excuse me, are you all right? 

218
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,850
 Wellness Check Result: Lee Sang Taek 

219
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,120
 Are you feeling unwell? 

220
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,470
 Caller, are you unable to... 

221
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,250
Lee Sang Taek isn't the culprit.

222
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,580
This is the sound of an asthma patient breathing.

223
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,550
Lee Sang Taek doesn't have asthma.

224
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,540
The alarm sound at the end of the recording file...

225
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,440
It's the alarm for a flat tire.

226
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,200
It sounds like an old vehicle model.

227
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,620
I'll first search the auto shops near the accident site.

228
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,430
Whoa, it's pretty.

229
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,930
You can't.

230
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,520
Why?

231
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,760
This ... don't drink this. It's alcohol.

232
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,480
You can drink this.

233
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,710
You two look so great together.

234
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,870
Thank you.

235
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,420
L-Look at this!

236
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,170
Whoa, it's so pretty.

237
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,450
We're closed for the day!

238
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,440
You can come back tomorrow.

239
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,290
- Come here.
 - Don't touch me!

240
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,690
What are you doing?

241
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,110
You can't ...

242
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,370
The CCTV data from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. on April 8th, the day of the accident, is gone.

243
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,930
He said someone came by on April 9th in the morning and asked to see the video.

244
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,190
And the data was deleted after that person left.

245
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,150
N-No— Wh-Why—

246
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,940
 CCTV_20240409_0900.mp4 

247
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,060
Who is this person?

248
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,020
I-I really don't know.

249
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,530
He looked pretty respectable, but he said he was dating a young girl.

250
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,440
- A young girl?
 - Yes.

251
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
He seemed to be over 50 years old,

252
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,150
but his girlfriend was in her 20s. He was crying alone.

253
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,620
I-I don't need the money.

254
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,910
I'll contact you the moment I remember.

255
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,330
Please just give me your business card.

256
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,060
I should accept it if you insist. Thank you.

257
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,980
Whoa.

258
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,900
No one needs to know.

259
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,840
No one needs to know.

260
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,650
 10 million won 

261
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,730
You said that car was stolen, right?

262
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,480
Yes.

263
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,810
Who'd be the owner of the car?

264
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,010
I'll look into it.

265
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,640
I've been looking at the surface of the problem.

266
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,890
But the answer to every problem is always at its core.

267
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,490
How foolish.

268
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,010
 You crazy bastard!  

269
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,130
  Why would you go there? 

270
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,360
What? What do you want to do?

271
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,450
 Grandma and Cheong Ha were burnt to ashes. 

272
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,100
 When I think about 

273
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,020
how hot it must've been for that little girl, it drives me crazy.

274
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,200
How will I go on with this rage and injustice, huh?

275
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,240
I don't know who's responsible for this.

276
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,570
But I'll get my revenge.

277
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,890
You crazy bastard!

278
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,180
I'm going to kill them all.

279
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,290
Wh-What did Cheong Ha...

280
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,310
What did Cheong Ha do to deserve that?

281
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,150
 Shut your mouth, bastard! 

282
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,440
Let me talk to an adult if anyone's there.

283
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,010
 Give them the phone! 

284
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,030
Talk.

285
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,110
 CEO. 

286
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,710
It's too unfair to let things end like this.

287
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,280
What are you going to do?

288
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,600
 Don't I have the advantage here? 

289
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,950
Even if you're Jo Mi Yeon of Budu Gang,

290
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,880
 I know what no one knows. 

291
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,780
And I also know who wants to know what I know.

292
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,230
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

293
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,880
 I've lost too much, you know. 

294
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,850
My one and only mother.

295
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,080
My one and only daughter.

296
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,140
What about your son?

297
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,800
 Do whatever you want. 

298
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,980
 If anything happens to that idiot, 

299
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,090
I'll go to Chairman Kim Gang Heon right away.

300
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,530
 I'll call you back, so don't do a thing. 

301
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,470
 Employment Agency 
 Welcome 

302
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,830
 Jo Bin 

303
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,810
 Yes, it's me. 

304
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,300
 Lee Sang Taek's son is with Budu Gang's Jo Mi Yeon right now. 

305
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,690
 It seems they'll meet up with Lee Sang Taek around tomorrow evening. 

306
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,320
Where?

307
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,890
I don't know that yet.

308
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,360
I'll contact you if anything seems off.

309
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,390
There's one more job for you.

310
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,020
What is it?

311
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,750
A gun.

312
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,390
A gun?

313
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,130
That's not even a job. Just wait a bit.

314
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,680
Who's there?

315
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,490
 I'm Lee Sang Taek. 

316
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,720
 I'm not that easy of a guy. 

317
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,420
 I didn't come to give you bad news. 

318
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,390
 I came to give you good news, so open the door. 

319
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,900
You live quite the good life, huh?

320
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,830
It's not luxurious, but it's neat.

321
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,510
As expected, a respected judge lives differently.

322
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,170
I saw how reputable you are.

323
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,680
But a man like you shouldn't live like that.

324
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,080
Because of you,

325
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,630
I lost my one and only mother,

326
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,950
and my precious daughter.

327
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,220
It's my account number.

328
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,630
We'll do it this way.

329
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,620
You're a judge, right?

330
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:04,130
The one who marks the price of people's crimes.

331
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,630
Mark the price of your crime in my account.

332
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:11,850
If you give a good verdict,

333
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,880
I'll take my son and go to Cambodia.

334
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,660
However,

335
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,350
if you fail to mark the price properly,

336
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,840
I'll go see Chairman Kim Gang Heon right away.

337
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,450
Wait, by the way...

338
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,280
Th-This...

339
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,410
 Lee Sang Taek's account number 

340
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,140
This way.

341
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,400
This is such an odd case.

342
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,840
Please take a look inside first.

343
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,440
Look at the ceiling here.

344
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,010
The initial point of combustion was here.

345
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,530
It then spread in all directions from where the light bulb socket was.

346
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,150
At the same time,

347
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,970
if you look here,

348
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,930
this gas line was cut.

349
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,860
It wasn't broken from the explosion. It was sharply cut with a knife.

350
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,730
It's arson.

351
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,680
Listen to me here. The gas from the gas line leaked and

352
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,080
filled up the entire place here.

353
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,900
And when the resident came home, she turned on the lights first thing.

354
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,920
As the connected light bulb exploded,

355
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,050
the gas line also exploded.

356
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,910
How do light bulbs explode?

357
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,850
It's like this.

358
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,400
Here.

359
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,420
Inside this,

360
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,440
you inject paint thinner or gasoline using a syringe.

361
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,650
If you inject gasoline and put it in the socket,

362
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,180
the moment you turn on the switch,

363
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,710
boom!

364
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,500
Baek Yoon Ju, 82 years old.

365
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,030
She's the real owner of the Honors accident vehicle.

366
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,740
Baek Yoon Ju currently lives alone.

367
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,080
So, I looked into her family relations.

368
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,570
There's a special note, so I'll report to you in person.

369
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,110
What's the special note?

370
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:23,590
If you look at the next page, Jo Eun Hye is her daughter in family relations

371
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,810
and she died two years ago.

372
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,960
Jo Eun Hye?

373
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,880
Her husband

374
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,210
was Judge Song Pan Ho.

375
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,860
Judge Song Pan Ho?

376
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,880
 Woo One Group 

377
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,490
Chairman, Detective Jang Chae Rim from Gangam Police Station is here.

378
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,580
Gangam Police Station?

379
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,040
Send her in.

380
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,220
Hello. I'm Jang Chae Rim from the Gangam Police Violent Crimes Department.

381
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,820
Nice to meet you.

382
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,060
What's this about?

383
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,330
I came because of the fire that broke out in Jangbeom-dong last night.

384
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,730
I think I should speak with the chairman alone.

385
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,640
Should I continue?

386
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,140
You can continue.

387
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,040
The investigations on the site concluded that it was an intentional explosion.

388
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,260
Is there anything you know?

389
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,910
How would I know about that?

390
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,990
Coincidentally, the victims were

391
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,380
the family of the most probable suspect in your son's hit-and-run accident.

392
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,980
So, we inevitably must conduct an investigation

393
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,290
- I see. Right now?
 - Gosh, no.

394
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,500
Not right now. After further investigation,

395
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,910
I'll contact you

396
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,320
if I need to.

397
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,270
Did you catch Lee Sang Taek?

398
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,730
We're tracking him down right now.

399
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,380
Is Lee Sang Taek

400
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,070
the culprit who killed my son and ran?

401
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,530
I assume so.

402
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,220
Are you sure?

403
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,440
Seonbaenim, did you get to locate Lee Cheong Gang?

404
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,170
 No, I'm still looking. 

405
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,510
He could've gone into the foreign residents' area last night.

406
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,170
I understand. I'll look for him.

407
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,790
Detective Jang, why are you so obsessed with Lee Cheong Gang?

408
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,270
Last night's incident was Woo One's doing.

409
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,630
Cheong Gang's in danger, too.

410
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,350
 Lee Cheong Gang 

411
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,810
You sleeping?

412
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,430
Did you get a call?

413
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:52,410
No, I didn't get it yet.

414
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,310
We'll smuggle you and Lee Sang Taek

415
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:03,800
out to Cambodia this evening.

416
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,010
Who will avenge Cheong Ha, then?

417
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,270
Avenge?

418
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,870
As if you can even avenge her.

419
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,930
Just eat that and wait for your dad's call.

420
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,250
 Missed Call: Detective Jang Chae Rim 

421
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:50,510
I think they'll meet up with Lee Sang Taek tonight. 
  Jangheung Inn 

422
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,750
Yes,

423
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,130
Jeong Hae Yong and Lee Cheong Gang are inside the inn right now.

424
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,370
Yes, I'll let you know.

425
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,680
Shit...

426
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,510
What brings you here first thing in the morning?

427
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,080
Today's Friday! There aren't any trials today.

428
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,830
I want to give this to Lee Sang Taek.

429
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,670
How much is this?

430
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,320
Five hundred million won.

431
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,500
Please send this money

432
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,490
to this account number.

433
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,360
It's the account number Lee Sang Taek gave to me in person.

434
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,270
I heard the Budu Gang, you know, takes care of these things.

435
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,090
I'm counting on you.

436
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,760
A mistake a person can hardly commit once in a lifetime. I've done it twice.

437
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,410
It feels like I became the worst human being.

438
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:40,250
If I can lighten my sins even a bit with this money,

439
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,920
my heart will be a bit at ease.

440
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,290
I'm counting on you.

441
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,490
Welcome—

442
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:05,080
I haven't got a clear memory yet!

443
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,130
Chairman, if you'll give me a bit more time,

444
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:13,090
I'll explain all the fine details somehow—

445
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,990
Is it this man?

446
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,460
Yes, it's this man.

447
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,300
Wait, a judge— How can a judge, with such a young girl—

448
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,730
Are you sure?

449
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,250
Yes, I'm sure. He said he was dating a young girl.

450
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,240
So, to be honest, I was jealous of him and—

451
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,940
That bastard is the one!

452
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,270
They said the accident vehicle's left headlight was changed.

453
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:54,100
I think he found a similar one at the junkyard and did it himself.

454
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,830
If Song Pan Ho erased the CCTV data,

455
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:02,250
wouldn't he have found it at a junkyard near his house?

456
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,840
Yes, I'll check.

457
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,560
 Did you get the money?  
  

458
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,580
I just confirmed that it was deposited.

459
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,700
But how would I trust you?

460
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,320
Can you leave the country without our help?

461
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,170
Smuggling out a person isn't an easy job.

462
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,780
It costs a lot of money.

463
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,310
I'm saying I'll help you. What's with this bullshit!

464
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:39,350
The only way for you to live right now is

465
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,520
to trust people.

466
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,510
Don't look down on me.

467
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,690
I've been through hell while working for you.

468
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:50,030
Tonight at 11:00 p.m.

469
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,960
Come to the third pier at Daeyeon Port.

470
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,800
 Don't be late. 

471
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,930
 Tonight at 11:00 p.m. 

472
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,290
I told him I'd smuggle him out at Daeyeon Port.

473
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,590
 What about the money? 

474
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,510
Did you send him the money?

475
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,980
You didn't steal it in the middle, did you?

476
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,750
He won't show up if I didn't send the money.

477
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,030
Right.

478
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,500
Good job.

479
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,980
By the way,

480
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,900
I've covered quite a lot of the cost.

481
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,580
I'm anxious because I keep spending my money without any written promise.

482
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,120
 Just wait a bit. 

483
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,420
 No one knows 

484
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,430
how your hard work this time will be rewarded in the future. Okay?

485
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,960
By the way,

486
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,520
are you really going to smuggle him out?

487
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,930
Oppa,

488
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,830
I'm here.

489
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,020
Have you been well?

490
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,780
 Judge Song Pan Ho 

491
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,690
I can't exactly remember

492
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,220
if that day was the 8th

493
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,480
or the 9th.

494
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,610
Judge Song Pan Ho came and

495
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:08,350
said he came because of evidence for a trial.

496
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:12,130
He took the headlight cover for an old Honors

497
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,690
that was parked there.

498
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:20,130
I don't know what he was going to use it for.

499
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,070
An old Honors...

500
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,630
He said it was Judge Song Pan Ho.

501
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,320
 Judge Song Pan Ho, I thank you as a resident of Woowon City and a citizen of this country. 

502
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,690
 I got teary reading the news article. I felt Judge Song Pan Ho's kindness. 

503
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,890
 Judge Song Pan Ho, I respect you. I'm deeply moved 

504
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,440
Do you know what kind of person your father is?

505
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,660
No.

506
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,620
He's an evil son of a bitch.

507
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,280
Your father.

508
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,710
It's only the four of you, right?

509
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,590
Where are you?

510
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:09,790
I'll trust you one last time.

511
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,330
Don't, you bastard!

512
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,190
Do as you wish!

513
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,060
Do you know how much we spent to save your life?

514
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,280
Do as you wish!

515
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,430
You dumbass.

516
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,570
Cheong Gang, come here.

517
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,770
Go on.

518
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,470
You rascal!

519
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,550
Where do you think you walked into?

520
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,680
Do you know how much you cost me?

521
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,030
What about the boat?

522
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,930
Boat?

523
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,740
Come here

524
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,750
if you want to ride the boat.

525
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,070
I'll hold your hand and take you there.

526
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,320
Have you ever killed anyone?

527
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,840
- You haven't, have you?
 - It doesn't require experience.

528
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,230
You just do it if you have to.

529
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,920
Hey. Take this bag and run for your life.

530
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,880
- F-Father...
 - I'm not going to die, you punk.

531
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,320
Go!

532
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,620
- F-Father...
 - I said, go!

533
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,000
If I don't come, run far away with that money.

534
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,660
It'll be enough to last you until you become an adult.

535
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,210
You sons of bitches!

536
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:19,730
Cheong Gang! There's no use in running away!

537
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,080
I'll find you in three days! Don't waste your energy!

538
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,220
Keep talking after you kill me, you bastard!

539
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,940
Back off. Back off!

540
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:20,100
I'll search for your son until the end.

541
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,130
We know you got a large sum of money today.

542
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,670
We're the ones

543
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,040
who deposited that money.

544
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,000
F***...

545
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,150
Sang Taek, rest in peace.

546
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,190
Who are you?

547
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,820
Are you Lee Sang Taek?

548
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,780
Who are you?

549
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,910
You're home?

550
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,300
Yeah.

551
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,800
Did you have dinner?

552
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,450
I did.

No.

556
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,770
Hey.

557
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,360
Did anyone look for me while I was away

558
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,670
or call me?

559
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,290
Not at all.

560
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,980
Get some rest.

561
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,250
Okay.

 Oh,  I am... 

569
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:52,660
 the person who coincidentally witnessed something dangerous and important. 

570
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:59,300
 At the car center on April 8th at 7:55 a.m. 

571
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,690
 The car was in pretty bad shape. 

572
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,890
 As if it were in an accident.

 Do you know who killed our members along with Lee Sang Taek? 

582
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:51,430
 Find Sang Hyeok first. Before the police do. 

583
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,240
 It won't be easy, but I'll catch Kim Sang Hyeok. 

584
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,960
 He has evidence Sang Hyeok killed Lee Sang Taek and Jeong Hae Yong!

 What do you want?

 Think about it.

 How much money it'd take for me to keep my mouth shut. 

588

 Did this respectable man  

589
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,970
 really do that to Sang Hyeon and run away?
