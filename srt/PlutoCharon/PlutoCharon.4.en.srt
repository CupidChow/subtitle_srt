1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,433
Hey

2
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,433
Where is everyone?

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,400
Xu Yinxi said she ordered some equipment

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,633
They went to help with it

5
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:14,633
Ordered equipment?

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,400
Yeah

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,133
What for?

8
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,233
I guess you weren't listening during the meeting at all

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
She said it was to prepare

10
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,866
for the next total lunar eclipse observation

11
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:29,933
Oh, right

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,133
I remember now

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:33,833
But

14
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,000
what do we do now?

15
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,366
We're supposed to be recording a video, right?

16
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,933
How can we record without any help?

17
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:41,266
Am I supporter？

18
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,933
Stop drinking

19
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,400
Stop drinking!

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,033
Hurry up and record so we can go home

21
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:57,533
Give me that

22
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:58,133
Hey!

23
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:04,333
It's all gone

24
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,266
Go record

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,433
Hello everyone

26
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm Charon

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,933
Today, I'll be sharing astronomical knowledge with you

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,033
Tidal Locking

29
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,333
this amazing phenomenon

30
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,300
It refers to

31
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:03,166
uh

32
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,833
celestial bodies whose

33
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,800
long-term gravitational interaction

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,033
causes their rotation period...

35
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,066
I forgot

36
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,000
It's when it always faces...

37
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,033
Wrong again

38
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,033
What's wrong with me today?

39
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:32,866
3

40
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,100
2

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,166
1

42
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,066
Hello everyone, I'm Charon

43
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:45,000
Today, I'll be sharing astronomical knowledge with you

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
Tidal Locking

45
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,133
This amazing phenomenon

46
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,366
refers to celestial bodies whose

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
long-term gravitational interaction

48
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,000
causes their rotation period

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,733
to synchronize with their orbital period

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,900
Uh

51
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,533
this makes the celestial body always

52
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,400
face the same side

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,900
towards the central body it orbits

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,633
The Earth and the Moon

55
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,533
are a classic pair

56
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,333
of two celestial bodies experiencing

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,566
tidal locking

58
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,000
In addition

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
the Sun and Mercury are too

60
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,933
But these

61
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,433
tidally locked bodies

62
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,300
are generally larger bodies

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,566
locking the smaller one

64
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:24,933
It's the smaller one

65
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,400
that is forever

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,300
only able

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,933
to face

68
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:28,666
its partner with the same side

69
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:29,833
Therefore

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
tidal locking

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
is also referred to as captured rotation

72
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,300
Most of the time, one side is

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,333
passively influenced

74
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,633
Sister Yinxi, seriously

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Why does she insist on winging it?

76
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:50,833
It's not a presentation or anything

77
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,900
And the videos we record always look so goofy

78
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,400
You didn't study the script

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,900
and snuck out for a drink

80
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,166
And you're still complaining?

81
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,233
Hey

82
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,000
can you hold my phone for a sec

83
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,300
I need to see if my hair's messy

84
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,766
Isn't there a mirror outside?

85
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,800
The mirror outside makes my face look huge

86
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,800
Hold it higher

87
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,400
This isn't good

88
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,066
Okay. Don't move, all right?

89
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:18,700
Shorty

90
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,366
high demands

91
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,933
It's too dry

92
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,400
Good thing I bought this lip balm to keep here

93
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,033
Wait for me, I'll put some on

94
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,033
There's a hair

95
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:52,233
Let's go

96
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:55,933
Chen Shi

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,600
Hmm?

98
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,266
Do you really not like women

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,033
Mhm

100
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:00,633
What about it

101
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,733
Then have you ever had a boyfriend

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,866
Silence

103
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,133
So you have

104
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:14,466
Why are you asking

105
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm different from you

106
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,700
So

107
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,666
Actually

108
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,800
I have so much to want to tell you

109
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,800
You should know

110
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,733
who the person you took in

111
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:26,833
and have constantly been helping

112
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,000
really is

113
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
But I honestly don't know

114
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:31,533
where to begin

115
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,600
You might not believe what I'm about to say

116
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:37,733
but I truly...

117
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,733
I believe you

118
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:39,833
I mean to ask

119
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,233
regardless of whether you've had a boyfriend before

120
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,800
would you mind

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,733
having a boyfriend starting now?

122
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:51,633
It's too late

123
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's go home

124
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,133
Did I just

125
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,133
get turned down?

126
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,100
I had too much to drink just now

127
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,300
My head wasn't clear

128
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,466
Just forget it

129
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,900
Pretend I never said anything

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,433
You might not believe me

131
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,133
but I can't stay angry at you

132
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:37,366
Due to certain reasons

133
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,033
I really can't leave you

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,766
So

135
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:41,866
did you ask that question

136
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,033
because you can't leave me

137
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,666
or did it really come from your heart

138
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,933
Do you even know yourself

139
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,700
Chen Shi

140
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,500
you say I don't know my own feelings

141
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,333
but what about you

142
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,233
Do you understand your heart

143
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,433
You like me

144
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,666
But I don't get it

145
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,766
Why do you keep running away from me

146
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,566
You reject me every time

147
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,500
yet you always give in in the end

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,366
I didn't

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,300
Still denying it

150
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,833
Stop lying to me

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,066
I can feel it

152
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,233
Even if

153
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:42,166
you can't hear my heart pounding when I stand in front of you

154
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,033
surely

155
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,166
you can feel your own heartbeat

156
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,933
can't you

157
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,100
Chen Shi

158
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,166
your mouth is lying

159
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:53,733
but

160
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,533
you forgot to tell your body to cooperate

161
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,333
See

162
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,500
You want me too, don't you

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,133
If you don't want to, forget it

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,866
I'm going back to my room

165
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,800
You touch me and then just leave

166
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,466
I won't let you

167
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,533
Besides

168
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,266
I don't think we're that close

169
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,733
to be so casual, are we

170
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,166
I have to touch you back

171
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,533
Just touching me back is all you want

172
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,133
I can do other things too

173
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,233
I only touched you just now

174
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,333
and you wouldn't even agree to that

175
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,033
What's wrong

176
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,900
You ever said

177
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,966
we weren't close enough for that kind of thing

178
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Hello

179
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:13,766
What is it

180
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm so annoyed

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,900
You're so unenthusiastic

182
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,833
What did you just say

183
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,533
I said the numbers for our account

184
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,600
aren't very good

185
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,233
Maybe the content is too boring

186
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
People might only be watching for your face now

187
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,766
Should we have a meeting

188
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,000
to discuss a redesign

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,033
Let's just leave it for now

190
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,233
I'm telling you, you're

191
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,333
acting weird.

192
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:43,966
Tell me

193
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,266
what's going on

194
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,766
You won't get it

195
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,166
Oh, really

196
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,900
I won't get it

197
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,833
Tell me, what is it I won't get

198
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,666
You've never been in a relationship

199
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,166
What do you know

200
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,966
I call this independence

201
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,733
Boyfriends and all that

202
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:03,866
I don't need them

203
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,666
I need to make money

204
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,466
and have my own career

205
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Besides

206
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,666
I am a flower that blooms from the heart

207
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't need anyone to give me nourishment

208
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,100
I have my own photosynthesis

209
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,433
Are you writing poetry

210
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,266
No way

211
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:25,766
What does that mean

212
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,266
You have a boyfriend

213
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,600
Who

214
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,133
Yang You

215
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:36,933
I knew it

216
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,266
You really like him

217
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:40,766
So

218
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,433
when did you two

219
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,533
start seeing each other behind my back

220
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,133
Mind your own business

221
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,200
Don't be so small-minded

222
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,133
Just tell me

223
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,533
If you won't

224
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,233
I will

225
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,366
I just remembered something

226
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,233
The person I saw at your house half a year ago...

227
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,633
Was that him

228
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,433
I should have known

229
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,433
Yang You looked so familiar the first time I saw him

230
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:10,700
Damn

231
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,833
Good for you, buddy

232
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,600
You're playing the secret admirer thing

233
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,833
Yang You said you met two months ago

234
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:20,700
And he said

235
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,366
it was because he had a problem

236
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,000
that you let him stay. Seriously

237
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,333
Impressive

238
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,100
You spin a good yarn

239
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,833
I've known you for over twenty years

240
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,866
and I've never seen you let anyone stay the night at your place

241
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,233
Don't tell him any of that nonsense

242
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,133
So

243
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,633
what's the real story

244
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:46,733
Let's go

245
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:47,700
Time to go home

246
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm leaving

247
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,233
Sister Yinxi

248
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:57,966
we're leaving

249
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:58,733
Mhm

250
00:11:58,766 --> 00:11:59,533
Go on

251
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,533
Let's go

252
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:16,733
Was that him

253
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,500
I should have known Yang You looked familiar the first time I saw him

254
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,566
Yang You said you met two months ago

255
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,200
So

256
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,433
what's the real story

257
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,833
So

258
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:30,933
is it me you like

259
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,266
or is it someone else

260
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,333
What's wrong

261
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,200
Are you feeling unwell

262
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,500
Or did something happen

263
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,333
I'm fine

264
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:42,933
I...

265
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Are you alright?

266
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:47,633
What is it

267
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:49,600
Let's go eat something

268
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
He's not Duan Jinghua, that cat abuser trash

269
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,266
Hmm

270
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:54,933
No, thanks

271
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,333
I'm tired today

272
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,266
I want to go back and sleep

273
00:12:58,366 --> 00:12:59,066
Alright

274
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:01,933
Are you sure you're okay

275
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,733
I'm fine

276
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
Just a little tired

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,866
I'll be better after a nap

278
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,633
He is Wu Feiwan

279
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:12,233
Just like Xu Yinxi

280
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,100
he's only a person in this world

281
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:17,266
Chen Shi

282
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:18,700
Chen Shi

283
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,200
Chen Shi

284
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,200
Chen

285
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,633
What are you going for over there

286
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,000
Looking for something

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,266
You must be hungry, right

288
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,466
I'm not

289
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:34,433
But if you are

290
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,566
I can eat something with you

291
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,733
Then go sit over there for a bit

292
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:44,033
I'll go get something ready

293
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:50,800
Hey

294
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,833
does the housekeeper you hire

295
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,466
not do any cooking

296
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,733
Because I don't like having strangers in the house

297
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:57,933
No wonder

298
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,733
She only comes when we're not home

299
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,533
But

300
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:02,633
though

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,666
why did you agree to let me stay

302
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:06,766
What's wrong

303
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,733
Are you too shy to say you fell for me at first sight

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,866
Won't you praise how handsome

305
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:11,633
and cute I am

306
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,400
and then confess your feelings

307
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,866
Yes, yes, yes

308
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,200
You are the cutest

309
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,033
And the best-looking

310
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:20,966
Go sit over there now

311
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,033
Oh

312
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:24,866
right

313
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,366
Sister Yinxi told me something the other day

314
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,500
Our codenames match so well, you know

315
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,266
I knew nothing about astronomy before

316
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,766
and I wasn't even interested

317
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,366
I only found out yesterday

318
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,133
that your name is Pluto

319
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,266
and my name is

320
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,633
Charon

321
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,066
Pluto is the star farthest from the sun

322
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:50,600
Mhm

323
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,000
And throughout its 5.9 billion kilometer journey

324
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,200
sunlight barely reaches it

325
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,433
The environment there is extremely harsh and dangerous

326
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,633
But there's one moon that's an exception

327
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:00,666
That is Charon

328
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,766
It stays by Pluto's side constantly

329
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,733
Romantic, right

330
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,866
I never thought the name I just picked randomly

331
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,733
would end up being a couple's name with you today

332
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,233
So that's why you stayed up so late

333
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,433
last night, huh

334
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,866
Cramming all night on astronomy

335
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:23,800
How did you know I stayed up late last night

336
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:25,966
Wait

337
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,033
No

338
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,333
You didn't seem surprised

339
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,200
You knew

340
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,933
Mhm

341
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,600
Hey

342
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,433
do you remember

343
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,366
the tidal locking we recorded the video about

344
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:42,666
Generally speaking

345
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,366
it's the larger body locking the smaller one

346
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:45,866
But

347
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,433
Pluto and Charon

348
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,666
are mutually tidally locked

349
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,466
Which means

350
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,800
they always maintain the same speed as they orbit

351
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:01,333
They always face the same side towards each other

352
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,766
They are each other's protector

353
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:07,366
just like a love where both sides give

354
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,166
Why aren't you talking

355
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:14,900
Don't you find it romantic

356
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:16,800
Oh, right

357
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,766
You were there when we recorded the video that day

358
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,466
Do you know about the Roche Limit

359
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,000
The Roche Limit

360
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,200
What is that

361
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
It's the distance between two celestial bodies

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,766
where due to tidal forces

363
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:44,700
the smaller body

364
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,133
will be ripped apart by the larger body

365
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,466
So

366
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,600
they are destined never to meet

367
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,666
They can only be two parallel lines forever

368
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,933
They can never get close to each other

369
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,566
Still romantic

370
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:09,333
Uh

371
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,366
you...

372
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,733
you...

373
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,400
Why are you suddenly so serious

374
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,333
Are you afraid

375
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:40,866
Are you afraid

376
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,700
that I will be the smaller body that gets torn apart

377
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:51,100
No

378
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,066
You...

379
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:53,433
What kind of logic is that

380
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't even follow

381
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,833
Besides

382
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,433
you're the one who dragged the topic to a tragic ending

383
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,000
That's not on me

384
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,566
Hey

385
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,766
You're really so stubborn

386
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:07,833
I'll make it up to you then

387
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:40,933
There

388
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,833
What if

389
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,233
the person you know isn't me

390
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,400
but someone with a different identity

391
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,566
Would you still like me

392
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,666
Even if your identity is fake

393
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,666
my feelings for you are real

394
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,700
Are your feelings meant for me

395
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,700
or for someone else

396
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,733
When you look at me

397
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:20,766
are you really seeing me

398
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,700
And what's the deal with the 'half a year ago' that Xu Yinxi mentioned

399
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,100
What exactly happened

400
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:33,766
Mmm

401
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:34,566
Delicious

402
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:38,133
Okay, here

403
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,233
Go sit over there and eat

404
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,833
Don't be in the way here

405
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:42,966
Hurry up and make it

406
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm starving now

407
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Who was the one who said

409
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,766
they weren't hungry

410
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,400
Well, that's your fault

411
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:50,133
Who told you to keep feeding me

412
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,566
You just sparked my appetite

413
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,533
You're shameless

414
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm going to talk to Xu Yinxi about something

415
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,766
You go inside first

416
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:05,266
Mhm

417
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,833
Did I unknowingly offend you

418
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,733
You misunderstood, sir

419
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:36,366
I was just

420
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,066
kidding

421
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,433
Don't take it to heart

422
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,433
I haven't had a chance to get to know you

423
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,700
Were you a broadcaster before

424
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,566
Uh

425
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:46,500
no

426
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,933
I guess you could say I switched careers

427
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,366
What is your relationship with Chen Shi

428
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,100
Roommates

429
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,433
I'm staying at his place

430
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:58,433
Staying

431
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,933
He lets people stay with him

432
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:03,733
It seems like you two are very close

433
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,633
He's a good person

434
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,333
Even though

435
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,133
he appears cold on the outside

436
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,266
But actually

437
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,233
he's considerate

438
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,600
and warm

439
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,600
He's like

440
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:28,633
a sunflower encased in ice

441
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,033
The Chen Shi you talk about

442
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:34,933
seems like

443
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,466
a different person who I know

444
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:39,466
Is that so

445
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:48,866
Hey
