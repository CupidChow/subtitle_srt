1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,419
The Astronomical Office announced the news that

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,219
The most amazing celestial phenomena of this year

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,980
There will be a total lunar eclipse tonight.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,339
People all over the country can see it all.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,699
You can say that you have seen it. "Dog Eats the Moon" in its entirety.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,220
As predicted by the Astronomical Center

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,879
This lunar eclipse will last all of its time.

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,859
Approximately 1 hour 43 minutes

9
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:20,480
It's close to the theoretical limit.

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:21,899
The following

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,019
Let's take a look at the weather forecast for next week.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,980
From the Meteorological Department announced that

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,079
During China's National Day Golden Week in 2024

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:36,859
Younger sister

15
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:37,700
Do you want to buy a necklace?

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,899
This one suits you.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,719
Do you want me to wrap it for you?

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,159
sibling

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,520
sibling

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,079
sibling

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,560
Ah!

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,359
I don't like this one.

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,679
I've been sitting here all day.

24
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,799
Haven't sold anything yet.

25
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,880
The shop will also be closed.

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,840
Please take a necklace.

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,280
It really suits her.

28
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:11,599
My younger sister doesn't take it anywhere.

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,359
I have a boyfriend who almost died.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,159
Now I'm the only one left.

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,480
Finding money is also difficult.

32
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,760
Just take it, just one necklace.

33
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:19,920
It really suits her.

34
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,060
boss

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,560
The necklace just now

36
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,859
It doesn't suit me

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,540
These are the ones.

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,140
Please help me wrap it up.

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,120
Here.

40
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,959
The price is the same.

41
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,500
what?

42
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,859
One hundred and ninety six yuan four Mao

43
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:30,340
stop

44
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,680
Please stop.

45
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,080
Don't run away!

46
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,719
Please stop.

47
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,860
Please stop.

48
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,759
Is this Kuan Yin placed on the wrong side?

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,659
Why is it facing north?

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,520
This is a watch shop.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,199
It's this dark.

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,879
Hello, Uncle.

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,659
Please help me.

54
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,560
How did you get here?

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,479
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,560
Someone was chasing me, so...

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,580
You've come to the wrong place.

58
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,419
You have to go find him.

59
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,939
Why did you come to me?

60
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,759
he...

61
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,280
Who is he?

62
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,879
Do you know me?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,020
This is the last time.

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,099
This is the last time.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,379
Remember

66
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,879
If you could put everything down

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,659
Life will be comfortable in everything.

68
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,240
Shouldn't she find a solution for herself?

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,479
Why cling to it?

70
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,099
Are you talking to me?

71
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,540
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,620
It's time now.

73
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,560
It's about to start spinning.

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,939
They couldn't escape.

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,360
When the game has started

76
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,000
Whether you die or not, you must continue playing.

77
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,040
Ouch!

78
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,139
Yang You

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
Have you gone crazy? Do you want to die or what?

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
I dare to go alone.

81
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
Chase and catch those cat thieves.

82
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,480
What are you thinking?

83
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,339
If something happens to you

84
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:10,160
Brother Ning

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,480
Brother Ning

86
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:12,500
calm down

87
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,680
I'm nothing like this, right?

88
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,839
I'll tell you

89
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,540
Some risks are worth taking.

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,360
I can take a photo.

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
That bastard

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,439
Since stealing the cat

93
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,139
Until the time I sold it -- I took pictures of it all.

94
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,360
The important thing is

95
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:25,459
Still able to take photos

96
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,720
The people who bought them were illegal animal traders.

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Complete evidence

98
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,680
Can she really take pictures?

99
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:30,699
So is she safe?

100
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,120
No one is following.

101
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,720
Don't worry.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,420
I shook them off a long time ago.

103
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,259
Then take this.

104
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,220
Today I will arrange the documents first.

105
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,220
and also roughly drafted the news

106
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,259
Tomorrow when I go to the company

107
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,660
I'll take it for you.

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm home now.

109
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,959
That's all for now.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,540
Okay, bye.

111
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,199
As explained by experts from the National Observatory

112
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,500
The conditions for this total lunar eclipse are very special.

113
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,379
You have to give the moon, the earth, and the sun.

114
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,680
Aligned in the same line precisely.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,319
With the earth in the middle blocking the sunlight.

116
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,339
When the moon completely enters the Earth's shadow.

117
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,240
Light refracted by the Earth's atmosphere.

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,600
It will turn the moon a mysterious crimson color.

119
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,459
which we affectionately call "Blood Moon" that is.

120
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,740
picture

121
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,259
What did you take a photo of?

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
The face was completely blank.

123
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,959
Our city observatory

124
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,659
The night sky viewing zone will be opened as a special case.

125
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:34,840
for everyone to see

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,519
with this extremely rare phenomenon tonight

127
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,539
Experts also recommend that

128
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,080
Stargazers should not miss this opportunity.

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,919
Our reporter has already reached the observation point.

130
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,139
Next, we will connect to the live signal.

131
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,740
The time is near.

132
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,259
You should go now.

133
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,419
Remember what I told you.

134
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,360
This is really crazy.

135
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,879
Or did I get something in there?

136
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,559
I think I must have gone crazy.

137
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,879
I'm fooling myself.

138
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,799
This one suits her.

139
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,679
She's leaving. What are you doing here?

140
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,120
Uh...

141
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you want me to stand here and speak?

142
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,659
I only gave her five minutes.

143
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:39,440
I have an urgent matter.

144
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,500
What's such a hurry?

145
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,559
I haven't been to her house for over half a year.

146
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,700
The last time I came, the renovations weren't finished yet.

147
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,320
Let me see how it looks when it's finished.

148
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,879
Don't hire a designer either.

149
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,259
Do it all yourself

150
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,580
Her home decoration style

151
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,700
It doesn't suit her at all.

152
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,320
Why did you redecorate it?

153
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:06,679
um

154
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,539
Promise of our friendship

155
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,460
I've signed my name.

156
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,940
You're the only one left.

157
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,840
Please sign for me.

158
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,320
He came by himself.

159
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,039
Just to send a contract?

160
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,220
How is that possible?

161
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,639
I'm not her secretary.

162
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,220
I just wanted to ask her.

163
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,759
How do we find people to be MCs?

164
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,220
Will the recruitment be announced openly?

165
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,679
I think we should

166
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,100
Find a master of ceremonies first.

167
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,259
You can call and tell me.

168
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,019
I've been texting her all morning.

169
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,480
Please answer me.

170
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,039
I've looked and there are quite a few people who are okay.

171
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,460
If you don't want to reveal

172
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,139
We can secretly talk privately first.

173
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,639
calm down

174
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,399
It's better to set the topic first.

175
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,820
Please.

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,940
Let's do it to make an account.

177
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,059
There must be a master of ceremonies first.

178
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Then let's think of a topic together, right?

179
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,399
This week I still have a problem.

180
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,259
It's next week.

181
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,600
Um, all right.

182
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,980
Yesterday, Fei Wan contacted me and said that he wanted to join.

183
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,700
Listen to what he means: I want to be a master of ceremonies.

184
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,639
But before that he was an actor, wasn't he?

185
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,840
It is now very difficult for new actors to find work.

186
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,360
Or not

187
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,100
I still haven't found the role I like.

188
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,000
do not know

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,700
He did not explain the details.

190
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,179
um

191
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,240
Oh, that's right.

192
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,539
Our workplace is very good.

193
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,100
Tell her, she probably won't believe it.

194
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,019
It's very warm.

195
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:38,860
oh

196
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,220
oh

197
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,419
There's just the word oh?

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
So what?

199
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,639
Sigh

200
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,299
Suddenly, she decided to redecorate it.

201
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:50,019
The room used to be like a morgue. It has become a warm home.

202
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,460
I think she likes that.

203
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,000
Does she have any other issues?

204
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:01,779
What are you rushing for?

205
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,279
I'm gone.

206
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,279
Oh, it hurts.

207
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,179
It really hurts.

208
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,299
It's daytime.

209
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,399
Or am I being neglectful?

210
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,820
Do you still have it?

211
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,139
Is this ok?

212
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,100
There's no injury, right?

213
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,000
it is nothing

214
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,580
It looks like I'm sleepwalking.

215
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,639
May I ask where this is?

216
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:00,059
Yongcheng

217
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,240
Yongcheng

218
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Is something wrong?

219
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,319
I sleepwalked from Nanwan to Yongcheng?

220
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,380
So she really was sleepwalking for a long time.

221
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,240
Are you okay?

222
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,539
This is my business card.

223
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,880
If you have a problem, contact me anytime.

224
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm fine, no injuries.

225
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,599
There's nothing at all.

226
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:56,940
Year 2023

227
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,859
Year 2023

228
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:03,900
hello

229
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,039
Hello, customer. What do you want?

230
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,400
Sorry for asking.

231
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,819
What time is it now?

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
It's almost noon already.

233
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,259
I mean that

234
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,220
What day is it today? What month and year?

235
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,140
May 26, 2023.

236
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,039
Year 2023...

237
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,079
That's right, sir.

238
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,240
Is there anything else I can help with?

239
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,319
do not have

240
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:27,880
thank you

241
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,579
okay

242
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,559
Please scan the QR Code to order food at the counter.

243
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,460
Year 2023...

244
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:37,900
How can it be like this?

245
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,019
Or...

246
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:46,980
It's a trip back in time.

247
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,079
Eh, no, no.

248
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:50,940
It's not like I'm filming a drama.

249
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,480
How was it possible that something so strange had happened?

250
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,460
If it's really going back in time

251
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,000
So I have to record it well.

252
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,019
I might win this year's best reporter award.

253
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,200
It's possible.

254
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,599
How much driving force must this have?

255
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,299
towards scientific research

256
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:18,440
Eat first.

257
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,779
I have to think carefully first.

258
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:22,700
What should we do so we can get evidence that

259
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,319
I am now in 2023.

260
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,400
Sigh

261
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,940
I don't have a mobile phone.

262
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:35,819
hello

263
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,220
Why did I suddenly become a ghost?

264
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,900
Or I'm dead

265
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,059
So how do I die?

266
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,720
It's not.

267
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:07,380
The man drove a motorcycle just now.

268
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,059
and employees in the restaurant

269
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,279
They can see me.

270
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,380
And then

271
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,480
Even though I was in Nanwan

272
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,380
How did you come to Yongchen now?

273
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,859
I've never been here before.

274
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,220
Am I dead?

275
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,000
It's about to float.

276
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,960
But it shouldn't be floating here.

277
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,259
To float

278
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,299
Had to float back to my hometown

279
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,079
The fallen leaves must return to their roots to float.

280
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,440
Needless to say, the award for best new reporter no longer exists.

281
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,099
Right now I still don't know what happened.

282
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,640
um

283
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,640
Sigh

284
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,779
Must find a solution.

285
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
Save your strength first.

286
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,359
Mobile phone

287
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,319
do not have

288
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,039
Find someone to help.

289
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,420
No one can see me.

290
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,000
There's no money.

291
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,819
Even if you have it, you can't use it.

292
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,599
When I'm dead

293
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,180
There should be an ambassador of death coming to receive me.

294
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,299
If I wake up and find this was just a dream, that's fine.

295
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,420
Why am I still here?

296
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,880
Even though the ambassador of death didn't come to receive me

297
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,720
My parents should come pick me up.

298
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,519
What is this?

299
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,339
What should I do?

300
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,180
lump...

301
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,420
Pebbles

302
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,359
I can catch pebbles.

303
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,079
Can you see me?

304
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,059
I caught her

305
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,140
Who is this? Crazy?

306
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm not a crazy person.

307
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
I want to borrow your mobile phone.

308
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,380
The man drove a motorcycle just now.

309
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,579
Hey!

310
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:45,980
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

311
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:34,400
What's wrong with her?

312
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,480
she is with me

313
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,940
can?
