1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:00,933
So...

2
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,500
So that's their story

3
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:03,566
Hmm

4
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:05,666
Did they tell you

5
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,166
how we could...

6
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,633
how we can actually get out of here

7
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,466
Haven't I already told you

8
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:18,766
You just have to let go

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,333
You can only find true peace

10
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,700
by breaking free from this situation

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,533
And return to your own world

12
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:25,966
But if I go back

13
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:27,266
then we'll never

14
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,400
for countless lifetimes

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,700
be together again

16
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,166
What if I don't go back

17
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,133
What if I just die in this timeline

18
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,966
Wouldn't I just return to my original timeline

19
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,700
If you still refuse to return this time

20
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,933
you will cease to exist in "any"timeline

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,500
What about him

22
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,100
He only has this one timeline left

23
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,900
All his other timelines were replaced because of his journey

24
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,733
So, to me, he...

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,466
he killed millions of versions of himself across different timelines

26
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,033
You could say that

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,866
So, are you willing to let go of your obsession? I can—

28
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:09,500
Thank you

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,366
but I'm not willing

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,500
Sigh

31
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,166
In my last life

32
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,133
I wasn't him

33
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,966
The World-Honored One once said that all living beings

34
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,033
who are not yet liberated

35
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,333
have unsettled natures and minds

36
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,533
Bad habits create negative karma

37
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,933
good habits bring positive outcomes

38
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:24,966
Acts of good and evil

39
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,300
arise from circumstances

40
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,566
spinning through the five realms

41
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:28,900
never ceasing

42
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,033
Through countless eons

43
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,500
lost and obstructed

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,266
like a fish caught in a net

45
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,500
it flows endlessly

46
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:35,733
escaping for a moment, only to be caught again

47
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,233
Caught again

48
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:38,966
The cycle of karma

49
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,366
You can't take anything from this world with you

50
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,333
Only karma follows

51
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,366
That is your karma

52
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,433
So

53
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,166
I suppose I must bear my karma

54
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,900
All sentient beings

55
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,433
possess the wisdom and virtue of the Tathagata

56
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,233
It is only due to delusive thoughts and attachments

57
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,766
that they fail to realize it

58
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:02,466
Sigh

59
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,333
You shouldn't interfere in mortal affairs

60
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,633
But you already have

61
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,866
What happened

62
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:11,833
Nothing

63
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,266
This time, I didn't get to ask much

64
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,466
before I woke up

65
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,133
I'll ask again

66
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,266
See if there's another way

67
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,166
Tomorrow

68
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,033
our country will witness a spectacular total lunar eclipse

69
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,333
Since the weather is expected to be clear tomorrow

70
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,766
viewing conditions will be ideal

71
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,266
The partial eclipse will begin around 8:08 PM

72
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,066
That's when the moon will begin to appear notched

73
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,433
Nearly two hours later

74
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,633
the moon's shadow will recede,

75
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,766
and the full moon will reappear in the sky

76
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:28,100
I fell asleep

77
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,033
Want to sleep a little more

78
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,500
No, I'm fine

79
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,500
I just feel so tired

80
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,033
Drowsy in spring, weary in autumn, napping in summer

81
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,533
It's all summer's fault

82
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,633
You just won't admit you're lazy

83
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,566
you little lazy cat

84
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,466
Just admit you're lazy

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,066
Poor, innocent summer

86
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,166
Mm, I really wasn't lying

87
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,066
I've been feeling especially tired lately

88
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,533
Can't seem to get enough sleep

89
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,666
Summer's not so innocent

90
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,466
And you're definitely not innocent

91
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,233
If it weren't for you last night—

92
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:22,933
Hey!

93
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:25,500
Get up already

94
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,066
Aren't you going to the studio today

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,533
I told Sister Yin Xi today

96
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,466
that I'm not going

97
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,433
What's wrong

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,166
I want to talk to her about terminating my contract

99
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,666
After all, my identity...

100
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,133
it can't be exposed to the public

101
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:09,033
If netizens dig up who I really am

102
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,533
that would be a problem

103
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,166
Mmm

104
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,666
Because initially

105
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,100
all I wanted was to get the necklace

106
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
and go back in time

107
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,833
Thinking about it now

108
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,933
it was pretty irresponsible

109
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,033
Have you really thought this through

110
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,066
I want

111
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,833
to just live here with you forever

112
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,300
Even if I have to find a job

113
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,500
this isn't what I want

114
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,266
Alright

115
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,266
I'll listen to you

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,866
You'll listen to everything I say

117
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,900
Yep

118
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,966
Then...

119
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,533
let's go to the beach and watch the sunset

120
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,300
Sound good

121
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,233
You don't mind the heat anymore

122
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,466
Some sacrifices are still worth it

123
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,366
Okay

124
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,900
How do you have this

125
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:49,633
Oh

126
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:50,933
the casting director for this show

127
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,166
came across our videos while browsing

128
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:54,833
So they contacted me

129
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,966
asking if Yang You would be interested

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,300
What's wrong

131
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,633
Why are you so worked up

132
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,566
Yang You isn't a professional actor

133
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:04,866
or trained in acting

134
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,233
How could they offer him

135
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,366
a lead role

136
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,033
I think they said

137
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:09,866
it's a low-budget

138
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:10,866
production, so they're short on funds

139
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,800
They want to find a good-looking newcomer

140
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,900
to cut costs, I suppose

141
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,166
Okay

142
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:18,933
Oh, right

143
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,533
Didn't you say you went to audition for a good script the other day

144
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,666
How did it go

145
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,366
Well

146
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,133
Hello

147
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
Why are you spacing out

148
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,133
Nothing, what did you just say

149
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,900
I asked, didn't you go for an audition the other day

150
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,866
How did it go

151
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,300
Good

152
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:36,666
Pretty good

153
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,066
This dress...

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,500
that red is too bold

155
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,900
Hm, you're here

156
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,300
Where's Old Chen

157
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,100
Oh

158
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,333
he went out to buy some things

159
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,166
He'll be back soon

160
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,100
Oh, perfect timing

161
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,333
I have something for you

162
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,966
A few days ago, I was out with a friend

163
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,333
and he happened to have a

164
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,633
small web series project

165
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,033
small web series project

166
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,333
and thought you'd be perfect for the male lead

167
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,433
He asked if you'd be interested

168
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,533
So he sent me the audition details

169
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,566
If you're interested, we can talk

170
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,433
No thanks, I'm not interested

171
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,100
I actually came today because I wanted to talk to you about something

172
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,733
Hmm

173
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,233
This streaming job...

174
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,433
I probably won't be able to continue

175
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,100
I suddenly have other plans

176
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,433
So

177
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,200
this...

178
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:51,966
after this

179
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,933
I might not be coming here anymore

180
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,333
Oh, I just remembered something

181
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,166
I have to go

182
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Hm

183
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,666
Where were we

184
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:02,866
Oh, right

185
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,733
Why so sudden

186
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:07,366
Hm

187
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,866
Some other things came up suddenly

188
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,633
So

189
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,500
I'll keep doing it for now

190
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,700
I'll leave once you find a suitable replacement

191
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:20,766
Alright

192
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,466
Then I'll just look for a new streamer

193
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,966
Sorry, Sister Yin Xi

194
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,166
If you ever

195
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,366
need my help with anything

196
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,233
just tell me

197
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,333
I'll do everything I can

198
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,100
You said that, remember

199
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,466
Mm

200
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,900
Didn't you say you were going to take a call

201
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,733
Why aren't you back yet

202
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,533
It's already this late

203
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,933
If it gets any later, we'll miss the sunset

204
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,300
Chen Shi!

205
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:31,700
Hey!

206
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,833
Where's the belt for this dress?

207
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,700
Where's Yang You

208
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,133
He said he was waiting for you downstairs

209
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,233
You didn't see him

210
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,933
He said you two were going to the beach to watch the sunset

211
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,033
I'll go look for him

212
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,566
Why don't you just call him

213
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,300
You looking for him, him looking for you...

214
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,966
you'll just miss each other

215
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,500
If you want to be Chen Shi

216
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,033
then act more like him

217
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:01,566
He wouldn't be so...

218
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,733
flustered

219
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,033
You figured it out

220
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:11,700
I knew I couldn't hide it from you

221
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,300
It's always been this way before

222
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:17,833
Exactly

223
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,433
Who are you

224
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,266
Where is Chen Shi

225
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,300
What do you mean "before"?

226
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,433
I “am“ him

227
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,833
To be precise

228
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,833
I traveled here from another timeline

229
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:35,333
I replaced the original Chen Shi in this timeline

230
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,900
Time travel

231
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,266
But you...

232
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:39,733
I don't have time to explain right now

233
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,933
The reason I came to this timeline

234
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:42,966
was for Yang You

235
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,666
I'm not feeling well right now

236
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,666
I'm worried he's in danger

237
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:48,933
We'll talk later

238
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,033
Surveillance shows he took him to a car

239
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:27,933
in the alley behind the company

240
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,166
After that, it wasn't caught on camera

241
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,366
We should call the police right away

242
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,366
Please, help me track this car

243
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,533
I'm begging you

244
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:37,766
My uncle found it

245
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,766
The car was last seen heading to the city outskirts

246
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,500
I'll send you the exact location

247
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:43,333
He's already on his way with the police

248
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay

249
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:44,833
Thank you

250
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,533
Cough, cough

251
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:55,566
Damn it

252
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,366
I've been kidnapped

253
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,300
Well, well

254
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,233
Awake, are we

255
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,133
No wonder so many people fawn over you

256
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,500
For a man, you're pretty pathetic

257
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,866
So weak

258
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,666
I only gave you a tiny, tiny bit

259
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,333
of the drug

260
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,766
And you passed out just like that

261
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,700
Sigh

262
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,100
If I hadn't checked your pulse

263
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:32,300
I would've thought you died in my house

264
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,133
What bad luck

265
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,100
What is going on

266
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,933
How did I get into this mess

267
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,100
Am I time-traveling

268
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,933
or did I just walk into a TV drama

269
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,700
This is too ridiculous

270
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,933
It would've been better if I'd just turned into a ghost after leaving Chen Shi before

271
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,300
You don't have to look at me like that

272
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,066
I told you

273
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,666
blame yourself for all of this

274
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:02,033
This whole situation

275
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,466
You're the one who caused it

276
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,466
Aren't you?

277
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,866
You quit being a streamer

278
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:09,966
Fine

279
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,733
Then you wouldn't even audition for the lead role

280
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,033
What kind of person are you, huh

281
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,800
Are you being arrogant

282
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,333
Or are you trying to humiliate me

283
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,966
What are you trying to prove

284
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,266
What you get so easily

285
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,666
I can't even dream of achieving

286
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,200
Hahahahaha

287
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:31,633
You...

288
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:32,433
Chen Shi!

289
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,533
What right do you have to look down on me

290
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,633
I never wanted it to come to this

291
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,233
It's you!

292
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,833
You forced my hand!

293
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,900
I really didn't want to make such a big deal out of it

294
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,500
I didn't

295
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,166
You...

296
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:51,900
Come on

297
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,200
tell me

298
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:54,733
Besides your pretty face

299
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,033
what else do you have going for you

300
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,233
Hey

301
00:14:59,233 --> 00:14:59,966
Speak up

302
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:01,900
No

303
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,066
this person is insane

304
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:05,633
Talking to herself and getting herself worked up

305
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,266
Now you can talk

306
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,366
I think I actually

307
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,666
have a pretty good talent for acting

308
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,900
Maybe I could play some villain roles, hahahahaha

309
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,500
Hahahahaha

310
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,633
He must be really crazy

311
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,233
What did you say

312
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,933
Are you mocking me

313
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,466
Whatever, it doesn't matter

314
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:42,100
I don't need the approval of clueless people like you

315
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,533
If you hadn't messed up my plans...

316
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,033
You're really beyond hope

317
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,333
What did you say?

318
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:56,866
I said

319
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,033
what are your thoughts

320
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,266
We can talk about this calmly

321
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,333
What's the point of kidnapping me

322
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,233
You're going about this all wrong

323
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:09,533
Hahahahahahaha

324
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,766
Wrong

325
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,566
My wrong

326
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,633
It's clearly your fault!

327
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,533
What did I do wrong

328
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,300
It's your fault

329
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,266
You and Chen Shi

330
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,300
It's this society's fault

331
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,666
This society is just unfair, it always has been!

332
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,766
Wrong

333
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,466
Wrong

334
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,233
What did I do wrong

335
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,133
You guys wronged me

336
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,100
I didn't do anything wrong

337
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,033
Hahaha

338
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:35,833
You're finished

339
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:37,933
Chen Shi

340
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:39,833
Chen Shi

341
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,066
Chen Shi

342
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:43,466
Stop hitting him

343
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,066
Chen Shi

344
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:45,766
Chen Shi

345
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,366
Stop hitting him

346
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:49,266
Chen Shi

347
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,933
Stop it

348
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,233
I'm okay

349
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:53,866
Chen Shi

350
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,233
You're alive

351
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:07,733
I'm fine

352
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,266
I'm fine

353
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,633
Are you hurt anywhere

354
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,066
Does anything hurt

355
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,533
No

356
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,033
Nothing at all

357
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:35,866
The alarm

358
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,633
Why did you set an alarm

359
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,233
For this one time

360
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,666
I traveled here half a year early

361
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,233
I counted every second

362
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,300
Preparing

363
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,266
Eagerly waiting for you to arrive

364
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,100
But once you actually came

365
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,966
every second felt like a countdown

366
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,500
What

367
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,466
There was another time I traveled

368
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,933
You said...

369
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,266
you felt like we were both trying to get closer to each other

370
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,766
What are you talking about

371
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:19,966
But I feel like

372
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,366
every step we take towards each other

373
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,933
is killing us

374
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,700
Killing each other

375
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,433
Maybe from the very beginning

376
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:38,533
this was all wrong

377
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:40,733
What exactly...

378
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,133
Yang You

379
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,566
I really want to have a home with you

380
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,166
The necklace

381
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,566
The mirror

382
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,700
Not the date

383
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,233
It's the eclipse

384
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,266
I love you

385
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:37,566
I'm back

386
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,033
Chen Shi

387
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,500
Chen Shi

388
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,966
I really hate you

389
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,166
How could this happen

390
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,566
Where's that watch shop

391
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,166
Where's that watch shop

392
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:03,866
Where are you

393
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,366
Come out

394
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,566
Where are you?!

395
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,566
Can you please help me

396
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:19,366
Didn't you say you could help me

397
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,333
Please, help me again, okay

398
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,933
I'm begging you

399
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,933
What do I need to do to see you again

400
00:23:46,566 --> 00:23:48,233
Beginnings and endings

401
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,666
He's already let go

402
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,466
What are you still holding onto

403
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,366
Didn't you say that person was me

404
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:57,966
Okay

405
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,233
I admit it

406
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,633
I am him

407
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,166
This all started from my curse, right

408
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,433
Then I'm willing to let go of the hatred

409
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,166
Can the curse be taken back then

410
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:15,333
Really

411
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,733
I don't hate him anymore

412
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,166
Tell me

413
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,566
How can I undo the curse I made before

414
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,233
Please answer me

415
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,933
Can you just answer me?!

416
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:40,366
Please!

417
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:45,166
Just one more time...

418
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:49,066
Please help me

419
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,833
Who can help me?

420
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:27,233
Why don't you see him?

421
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,966
I shouldn't meddle in mortal affairs

422
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:32,766
But you already did

423
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,166
Chen Shi!

424
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:38,266
What

425
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,566
Stunned

426
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,233
I thought you'd give me a big hug

427
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:45,033
when you saw me

428
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,233
Don't...

429
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,033
touch me

430
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,033
You'll disappear

431
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:55,766
Just let me see you again

432
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,166
Okay

433
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:01,566
Say something to me

434
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,566
Anything

435
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,633
Thank you

436
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:08,466
For loving me with your life

437
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:16,366
I'm sorry. I broke my promise

438
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,366
I lied to you

439
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:22,566
Yang You

440
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:29,566
Quick, hug me

441
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:51,966
What's up with you

442
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:55,833
You've been so out of it ever since you came back from vacation

443
00:27:57,366 --> 00:27:59,933
Didn't you take a week off to travel to Hecheng?

444
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:01,933
How come you come back

445
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,966
and you're completely unfocused at work

446
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,433
Maybe you should

447
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,933
go back and rest for another couple of days

448
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,933
Come back to work when you're feeling better

449
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:14,933
Where's that server from before

450
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:16,400
I don't know, actually

451
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,133
It's always just been me here

452
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,466
You're the owner here

453
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,933
Hey, just sit anywhere

454
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,166
Come sit here

455
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,733
You've always been here

456
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:26,266
Always

457
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:27,800
I've been here since I was a kid

458
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:31,533
This is home

459
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,466
Just sit, sit wherever

460
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:23,833
What's there to hold onto

461
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,966
Even casting curses

462
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,866
What's the point

463
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,866
If I got another chance

464
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:39,066
I wouldn't hold grudges anymore

465
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,233
Yang You
