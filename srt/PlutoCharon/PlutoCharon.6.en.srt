1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,200
Come have some fruit first

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,233
Dinner will still be a while

3
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:04,266
Coming

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:09,433
Here you go

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,133
Yinxi mentioned to me

6
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,866
she's planning to go live in a couple of days

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
to change how she manages her account

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,600
Ugh

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,733
Just thinking about it makes me nervous

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,633
What are you nervous about

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,400
It's a live stream! It's live

12
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,233
What if I panic and say something wrong

13
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:38,466
and someone posts it online

14
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,500
I'd be torn to pieces

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,833
Even if I don't say anything wrong

16
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:42,866
if people misunderstand,

17
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,533
wouldn't I be leading them astray

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,833
That doesn't make sense

19
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,700
You're a social news reporter

20
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,033
Why would you be scared of a little live stream

21
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,500
Shouldn't you be facing cameras every day

22
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,233
I'm a reporter

23
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,933
not a news anchor

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,833
I don't get much screen time

25
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:01,833
My job

26
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,866
usually involves

27
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,366
chasing stories

28
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:05,666
writing articles

29
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,033
conducting interviews

30
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,666
Even when there's interview footage, I don't need to appear

31
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,000
You have a really outdated view of my job

32
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,466
I just think your boss is clueless

33
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,833
With a face like yours

34
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,133
it's a crime not to put you on camera

35
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:19,933
Hmph

36
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,766
You sound just like Yinxi

37
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,466
You really are childhood friends

38
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,333
Ah

39
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,700
If Sister Ning heard that...

40
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:29,933
What is it

41
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,500
How did you know

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,233
I cover social issues

43
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,300
I never told you

44
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,100
I have another question

45
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,033
I've been meaning to ask you

46
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,000
The day I crossed over

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
I begged you to take me home

48
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,533
Thinking back now

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,733
the excuse I made up was pretty weak

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,466
Your place...

51
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:17,400
even the cleaner has to come when you're out

52
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,300
And Xu Yinxi, who grew up with you

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,800
you're not exactly warm to her

54
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,800
You're distant with acquaintances

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,433
You practically ignore strangers

56
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,033
But you only met me twice

57
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,400
and you agreed to take me in

58
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,466
What are you implying

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,433
You couldn't just be thinking with your hormones, right

60
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,700
So

61
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,433
no matter what I said that day

62
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:53,666
you would have brought me back

63
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,866
Isn't that right

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,800
Or am I caught in some scam

65
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,233
Is the fraud business this competitive now

66
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,666
I've heard of international fraud

67
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,300
but now it's cross-temporal fraud

68
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,333
Ugh

69
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:19,533
What could I possibly have that you'd want

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Go on

71
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,500
I have no money

72
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,400
and you're wealthy

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,833
So clearly, you're not after money

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,900
Xu Yinxi said she saw someone who looked like me six months ago

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,733
But I'm certain

76
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,633
I'd never seen you before coming here

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,433
So

78
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,266
is it because of my face

79
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,300
Who are you seeing when you look at me

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,700
Or am I

81
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:13,600
replacing someone

82
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,100
Someone who happened to also be a reporter

83
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,433
So, are you willing to be a replacement

84
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,633
If not

85
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,033
then get out

86
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,800
You're serious

87
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,100
What

88
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,100
Do you think

89
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,200
I can't find a better replacement than you

90
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,100
Or maybe

91
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,866
you're physically dependent on me now

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,266
Or how about this

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,433
You don't want to leave this comfortable life with me

94
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,600
Afraid you won't survive without me

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
and you'll turn back into a spirit

96
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,800
It couldn't be that

97
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,466
you've actually fallen for me

98
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,600
That would be ridiculous

99
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,600
Ridiculous

100
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,500
Hmph

101
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,566
What about you, looking for a replacement

102
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:43,100
Huh

103
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,533
He left you, didn't he

104
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,733
Forcing you to find a substitute

105
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,233
I'm ridiculous

106
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,633
but aren't you even more pathetic

107
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:34,900
I'd rather you were the one who didn't want me

108
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,833
Let's go

109
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,700
Once we go

110
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,933
just go straight home

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Let's go

112
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,033
Let's watch the sunset at the beach

113
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,666
Hey

114
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,033
you were up all night

115
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,000
Let me drive

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,400
You rest in the passenger seat

117
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
It's fine

118
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,866
Come on

119
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,033
It's a bit early for sunset at the beach

120
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's get something to eat first

121
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,033
No

122
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:17,066
Some waiting is actually nice

123
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,800
And some time wasted is definitely worth it

124
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,366
I've been renovating the house lately

125
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:24,433
I'm exhausted

126
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,233
And I've always wanted to go to the beach with you

127
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:27,666
You've been too busy

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,666
It's nice to steal a moment

129
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,766
and just relax

130
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,966
You could have left it to the designer

131
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,133
You insisted on supervising everything yourself

132
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,233
Look at you these past two days

133
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,500
you look pale

134
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
And you still want to go to the beach

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,100
I couldn't do that

136
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,166
This is our home

137
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,566
The construction crew was just too slow

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,533
A month's work

139
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,766
dragged out for over three months

140
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:09,933
Yang You

141
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:19,866
Yang You

142
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,300
Yang You

143
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,633
So soon...

144
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,533
is it

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,933
time already

146
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,000
Forget me

147
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,533
I won't

148
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,933
As usual

149
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,166
Losing now...

150
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,233
You always

151
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,000
used to

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,533
choose paper

153
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,833
I always lost

154
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,633
I only won this once

155
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,533
Please don't leave

156
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,533
That's all I'm asking

157
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,733
Please don't leave me

158
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,200
Yang You

159
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,533
Then

160
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,300
hold me

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,766
Yang You

162
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,933
Yang You

163
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,700
Yang You

164
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:53,133
I'm here

165
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,033
Who are you

166
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,233
Where is this

167
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,166
Did you see the person I was with

168
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:09,700
He's dead

169
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,133
Have you forgotten

170
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,766
Yang You

171
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:17,633
Who are you

172
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,200
Where are we

173
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,633
I'm here to help you

174
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:25,133
Don't you want to save him

175
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:27,366
How

176
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,166
Don't you want to hear the terms first

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,333
No

178
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,200
I just need him alive

179
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:34,966
I'll give up everything I have

180
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,233
even trade my life for his

181
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,300
Hmph

182
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:39,800
Fools rush in

183
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:43,300
You will use all your lives

184
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,000
to buy him one life

185
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,733
All your lives.

186
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,200
Countless timelines have countless versions of you

187
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,900
but only one of him

188
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
A timeline with you

189
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,600
shouldn't have him

190
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,766
Yet because of your obsession

191
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,366
he entered your world

192
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,733
and foolishly refused to leave

193
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,933
marching toward a destined death

194
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,233
What does that mean

195
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Those who cannot see the gods

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,200
think the gods cannot see

197
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,133
The karmic cycle of this human world

198
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,700
can't you let it go

199
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,633
He can't let go

200
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,100
and neither can you

201
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,966
If you both remain fixated

202
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,733
unable to see through or let go

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,800
neither of you can escape

204
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,933
You will be endlessly

205
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,400
trapped by love, trapped here

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Let go

207
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:43,566
Let go of what

208
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,733
I have no time for this

209
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,933
Just tell me if you'll save him

210
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,400
Even if everything you do is futile

211
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,500
You might give your all

212
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,533
but end up disappearing

213
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,733
from all timelines with him

214
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,333
I don't care

215
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,600
I just need him to live

216
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,366
I don't care if the timeline has me

217
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,400
or doesn't have me

218
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
I truly don't care

219
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,566
Obsessed fool

220
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,700
Go

221
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,233
Didn't you want to save him

222
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:24,866
Right

223
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:25,600
Remember

224
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,800
you cannot alter any of his decisions

225
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,033
If you force a change in his choice

226
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,500
it will only hasten his death

227
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,033
Also, in each timeline

228
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:39,400
you can only change one thing unrelated to his choices

229
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,766
One last reminder

230
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,766
when you cross into other timelines

231
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,400
you will replace the you in that timeline

232
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,700
As your timeline changes

233
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:55,133
even if you

234
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,500
fail to save him

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,800
you will cease to exist in that timeline

236
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:09,766
Chen Shi

237
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,400
You're back

238
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,833
Didn't you say you'd be right back

239
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,200
You took forever

240
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,800
I've been sketching all day

241
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,266
and even changed the renovation plans

242
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,366
You should really get a designer to come look at the house

243
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,166
I think we need professional advice

244
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,033
Otherwise, if the renovation's done

245
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,733
and you complain, what do I do

246
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,500
Seriously

247
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,366
Hey

248
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,200
What's wrong

249
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,066
What happened

250
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,933
How did you fall

251
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,600
You're a grown adult

252
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,200
How do you fall in your own home

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,100
Huh

254
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:08,700
Aren't you getting up

255
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,233
Trying to flirt with me

256
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,500
Your hands are so cold

257
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,000
Did something happen

258
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,533
What's wrong

259
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,066
Is something going on

260
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,700
Don't leave me

261
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,933
I'm begging you

262
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,100
Please don't leave me, okay

263
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm right here.

264
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,066
Where would I go

265
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
Did you have a bad dream

266
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,533
Just so you know

267
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,533
I have no design experience

268
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,633
You wouldn't listen when I said to call a designer

269
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:21,866
Even with my sketches

270
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,400
you didn't give any feedback

271
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,566
If it doesn't turn out well

272
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:25,466
don't blame me

273
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:26,533
Fine, fine

274
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,233
No peeking

275
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,766
Give me your hand

276
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:33,700
I'll lead you in

277
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,400
Let's go

278
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,233
Don't peek

279
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:39,933
Come

280
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,766
Slowly

281
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:42,933
Stop

282
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:44,766
Good

283
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:45,233
Go

284
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,133
Good

285
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:49,933
Stop

286
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:52,566
Open your eyes

287
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,300
surprise

288
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,200
Look

289
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,366
What do you think

290
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,733
My design's not bad, right

291
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,200
The design's pretty good, isn't it

292
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,333
Oh, right

293
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,833
I'll show you our bedroom

294
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:09,700
I'm telling you

295
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,933
I designed our room perfectly

296
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:12,733
Quick

297
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,366
Come on

298
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,766
Ta-da

299
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,333
How is it

300
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,233
Not bad, huh

301
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,000
And this painting

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,333
is one I painted

303
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,933
I called it

304
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,700
Chen Shi AND Yang You

305
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,200
Doesn't it

306
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,533
look as good as a wedding photo

307
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,500
How did you know what I was going to say

308
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,300
How is it

309
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,266
This is way more meaningful than a photo

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh, right

311
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:50,900
Are you free next week

312
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,766
I'm not

313
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,133
I have work next week

314
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,000
It'll be really busy

315
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,533
Stay home

316
00:18:58,566 --> 00:18:59,500
Don't go anywhere

317
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,033
But I...

318
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:02,133
Don't go anywhere

319
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,566
Just stay home

320
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,400
What's wrong

321
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,766
Just listen to me this once, okay

322
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:10,433
Please

323
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,400
Okay

324
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,733
I promise

325
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,333
Oh, come on

326
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,633
I just wanted to take you

327
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,233
to buy a suit

328
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:21,500
In a few days

329
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,533
I have a very important meeting

330
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,933
Your clothes are too big on me

331
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,733
Sorry

332
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,633
I didn't think it through

333
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:34,933
How about this

334
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,066
Next week

335
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,400
I'll take you to the tailor

336
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,366
to get one custom-made

337
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,133
How about that

338
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,533
I want to go out and buy one

339
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,200
We can go out after you finish work

340
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,333
We can go out after you finish work

341
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,066
We haven't been out together in ages

342
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,233
Okay

343
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh, right

344
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll show you the study

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,766
I'm telling you

346
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,300
I put a

347
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,433
super comfortable sofa in the study

348
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,633
That way

349
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,700
I can be with you while you work

350
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,500
Come on, come on

351
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,033
Quick

352
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,333
Yang You

353
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,766
Yang You

354
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Yang You

355
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:17,933
Yang You

356
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:24,400
Yang You

357
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,766
Yang You

358
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,566
Yang You

359
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:43,933
Oh, right

360
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:44,733
Remember

361
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,066
you cannot alter any of his decisions

362
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,333
If you force a change in his choice

363
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,833
it will only hasten his death

364
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,400
Also, in each timeline

365
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,733
you can only change one thing unrelated to his choices

366
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,466
Hey

367
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,033
Is your company's annual trip this time

368
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,366
to Snow City

369
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,133
Can I come along

370
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,033
I want to go too

371
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,566
Then ask me nicely

372
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,900
Ask nicely

373
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm begging you

374
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,333
Where's your pride

375
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,733
In front of you

376
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,666
what do I need pride for

377
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,633
You've been sick for so long, why aren't you better

378
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,733
You've been to the hospital several times

379
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,833
You've had all the necessary tests

380
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,400
All your levels are normal

381
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,400
Why do you keep getting weaker

382
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,066
I'm fine

383
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,566
Maybe I haven't been sleeping well lately

384
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,400
Not sleeping well

385
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,400
You sleep 15 hours a day combined

386
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,066
And you're not sleeping well

387
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:18,200
Are you calling me lazy

388
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,333
In your condition

389
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,833
skip the annual meeting

390
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,766
I'll stay home with you

391
00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:23,766
Once you're better

392
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:24,666
I'll take you

393
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,466
No!

394
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,200
I want to go

395
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:29,833
I'm fine

396
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:32,266
Hey

397
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:33,766
Let me teach you

398
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:35,633
some Snow City dialect

399
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:36,766
How about that

400
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:38,866
Okay

401
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:42,533
First, I'll teach you the most important one

402
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,433
Yang You

403
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,966
Say it

404
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,533
Yang You

405
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:55,000
What does that mean in Snow City

406
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,266
It means

407
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,400
I

408
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,733
love

409
00:23:58,733 --> 00:23:59,566
you

410
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:01,600
You need to practice well

411
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Everyone in Snow City

412
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
knows it

413
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,166
Mr. Yang You

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,833
What's wrong with you

415
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:14,733
Why are you bleeding again

416
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,200
Come on

417
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
It's nothing

418
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:23,733
Let's just stay here

419
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:26,566
I'm a bit dizzy

420
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:28,633
What's wrong

421
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:29,733
You know

422
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:30,533
don't you

423
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,433
You're hiding something from me

424
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,700
I don't think

425
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,766
I can make it to Snow City with you

426
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:40,733
I still wanted to go back and see it

427
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,200
What is it

428
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,266
I'll take you to the hospital

429
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,000
Don't bother

430
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:51,933
There's no time left

431
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Let me say a few more things to you

432
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,666
I want you to hug me

433
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,033
I'm sorry

434
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,200
I don't belong in this timeline

435
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:17,033
I promised I wouldn't leave you

436
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:20,233
I didn't go back

437
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,400
but it seems I can't stay either

438
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,433
I'm breaking my promise

439
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,866
This time, there was no accident

440
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,866
I didn't change any of your decisions either

441
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,333
Why is it still like this

442
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,533
I haven't even had time

443
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,633
to change anything

444
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:44,933
How is this possible

445
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,333
You knew already

446
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,566
knew I would die

447
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,266
didn't you

448
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,266
Why did you still do this

449
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:02,766
You don't belong in this timeline

450
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,133
You didn't leave

451
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,033
So

452
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,466
you knew staying in this timeline would kill you

453
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,200
but you stayed anyway

454
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,266
Why

455
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:32,433
Yang You

456
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,566
Ah

457
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:34,500
What's wrong

458
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:35,333
I'm here

459
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,133
Hey

460
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:38,533
What's wrong

461
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm here

462
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:40,533
I'm begging you

463
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,666
don't leave me

464
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,466
I won't

465
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:43,466
I'm staying here with you

466
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:44,633
Mhm

467
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,533
There, there, don't be scared

468
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:52,466
Because of me...

469
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,166
Why is it like this

470
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,166
You shouldn't have stayed for me

471
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
It's okay

472
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,133
Even if being with you

473
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,833
means certain death

474
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,233
I want to stay by your side

475
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:11,400
Don't push me away

476
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:13,566
Please

477
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:24,266
Yang You

478
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:27,700
Yang You

479
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:37,800
What's wrong

480
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,233
What's wrong

481
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,000
What's wrong

482
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,866
Did you have a nightmare

483
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,533
Silly

484
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,166
Dreams are the opposite

485
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:07,700
No way

486
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,366
You're really crying

487
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:15,166
Oh, dear

488
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,000
There, there. Don't be scared

489
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,666
Scared my dear

490
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,466
There, there. Don't be scared, okay

491
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,800
There, there, don't be scared

492
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,266
When I got scared as a child

493
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,833
my mom comforted me like this

494
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:31,466
Then you won't be afraid

495
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:36,500
There, there, don't be scared

496
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,400
It's still early, sleep a bit more

497
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:45,600
How about

498
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,233
I sing you a lullaby

499
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,166
Mhm

500
00:28:57,033 --> 00:29:02,033
Clouds drift and turn

501
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:06,866
becoming little sails

502
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:11,466
Rocking, rocking, where to go

503
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:17,100
rocking into Dream Bay

504
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:24,400
The spinning wheel turns and turns

505
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,733
spinning silver threads

506
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:34,900
Moonlight dyes and dyes

507
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:39,900
Moonlight dyes and dyes

508
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:45,033
Wind counts petals

509
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:50,133
one piece, two pieces

510
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,066
Stars blink their eyes

511
00:29:55,266 --> 00:30:00,000
three times, four times, then sleep

512
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,300
Like a child

513
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,733
I wonder what nightmare

514
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,766
scared you so much
