1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,740
I have to say

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,879
I didn't think you'd say yes so quickly

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,360
We're a startup

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,740
Our main focus is an astronomy-themed channel

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,960
As our main host

6
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,919
you'll be working with us on everything

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:12,820
choosing topics

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,580
content

9
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,939
and all the planning

10
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,420
About the contract term

11
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,519
we've changed it to one year, just like you asked

12
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,660
As for your ID card

13
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,420
Didn't you say you lost it

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,800
It's fine. Chen is vouching for you

15
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,199
when you get a new one

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,179
just bring it in so we can scan it

17
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,420
for our records

18
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,259
Being a streamer means you have to be on camera

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,539
But I guess I have to risk it

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,399
Who knows, maybe getting the necklace

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,299
I can go back

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:39,799
Hey

23
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,640
What's on your mind

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,719
You're not backing out, are you

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,740
Are you really going to lend me the necklace

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,939
Of course

27
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,380
It's yours as soon as you sign

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,420
Let me show you

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,519
where we'll be working

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,579
You...

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll wait for you right here

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,000
We can go home together later

33
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:21,840
What's the matter

34
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,239
You want me to ask Chen

35
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,700
to keep you on a leash

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,680
Oh, right

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
I forgot to tell you.

38
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,579
When you're done with the necklace

39
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:31,439
you don't need to return it to me

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,079
No, no, that's not right

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,359
I'm only borrowing it

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,920
Besides, if the necklace is the key to getting back

43
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,519
I might not be able to take it with me anyway

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,200
Why else would I sign my life away

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,280
About the necklace...

46
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:41,900
What I meant was

47
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,480
just give it back to Chen Shi directly

48
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,459
It's his necklace, after all

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,539
Where's Feiwan

50
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:25,780
She was here just a second ago

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,400
We have another content planner at the studio

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,300
Wu Feiwan

53
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,479
Her codename is BSS

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,439
Not sure where

55
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,919
He's wandered off to

56
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,199
Codename

57
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,819
We all use an astronomy-related

58
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,840
English name as a codename

59
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,659
Mine is Kepler

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,819
See if there are any you like

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,539
Then...

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,699
I'll pick this one

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,759
What is it

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,319
Chen Shi's codename...

65
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,960
Pluto

66
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,000
What does that have to do with anything

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,080
You should ask Chen Shi to explain that one.

68
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,500
From now on, this will be

69
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,780
our workspace

70
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:18,719
Next door is our recording and live-show room

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,900
Feel free to look around

72
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,599
Get a feel for the place

73
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,340
I've got some work to finish up

74
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,419
so I'll leave you to it

75
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,439
Okay

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,879
I have no idea

77
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,439
how far I need to stay from Chen Shi

78
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,360
to stop turning into a soul

79
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,439
And my phone's dead

80
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,060
Forget it

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,860
I should just go back

82
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,360
Wait a minute

83
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,500
What am I running for

84
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,759
For all I know, he's just like Sister Ning

85
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,420
a normal person from this world

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,740
Are you insane

87
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,100
So stupid

88
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,740
Chen Shi

89
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm done for

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,379
Chen Shi

91
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,819
I was in such a hurry to run that I didn't pay attention to the path

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
Where am I

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,100
My phone's dead

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,300
I wonder if Chen Shi

95
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,379
will come looking for me

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
When I got this phone

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,339
I didn't even save his number

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Even if I had his number, what's the use now

99
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't tell me I'm going

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,040
to die here

101
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,300
This is all my fault

102
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,620
I can't even handle one simple thing

103
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,000
Everything...

104
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,600
from the moment I crossed over

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,399
has been a mess

106
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,819
Time travel is one thing

107
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,639
but I'm a field journalist

108
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,519
how could I possibly get lost? It's pathetic

109
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,759
I promised my parents

110
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,540
I would live my life to the fullest

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,779
I don't want to die

112
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,899
And especially not like this

113
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,600
just vanishing without a trace

114
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,980
Chen Shi...

115
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:22,860
Chen Shi

116
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,740
You are here

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,960
There, there

118
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,100
It's okay

119
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm not a little kid

120
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,600
You seem just like my mom

121
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,500
That's what she always used to do

122
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,059
Alright, then how about a more grown-up approach

123
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,039
Care for a drink

124
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,679
Slow down

125
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,500
The Myth of Sisyphus

126
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,120
Is this what you're reading

127
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,299
Yeah

128
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,320
What's it about

129
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,580
If I remember right, it's a book of philosophical essays

130
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,720
I could never get into books like this

131
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm much more suited to reading things like

132
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,159
novels and fiction

133
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,480
I can't make it through a page of this stuff

134
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,879
That's impressive.

135
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,519
This book uses the myth of Sisyphus

136
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,360
to explore the philosophy of absurdism

137
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,279
The myth of Sisyphus

138
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,759
Absurdism

139
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,159
Let me put it this way

140
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,539
What if one day

141
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,539
someone told you that

142
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,019
everything you do is destined to fail

143
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:04,980
That all of your efforts

144
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,980
are meaningless

145
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,700
What would you do

146
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,759
I wouldn't care what they said

147
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,019
If I don't work for it

148
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,960
if I don't even try

149
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
how would I know if I'm going to fail

150
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,580
or whether it's meaningless

151
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,080
Alright, then tell me...

152
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,120
what is Sisyphus

153
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,740
And what is this "absurdism" you're talking about

154
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,179
Sisyphus was a king

155
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,840
He angered the gods

156
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:39,799
So, as punishment

157
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,259
they forced him to push a giant boulder up a hill

158
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,720
Only then could he return to the world of mortals

159
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,139
But every time he almost reached

160
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,480
the top of the hill

161
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,320
the giant boulder

162
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,460
would roll all the way back down

163
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,019
He was forced to do this over and over, day after day

164
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:01,860
An infinite loop

165
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,460
That must have been torture for him

166
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,080
Torture

167
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,639
yes. But it also proves

168
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,779
that he was still holding onto hope

169
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,399
don't you think

170
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:22,940
yes

171
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,820
I guess you have a point

172
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,919
The world is absurd

173
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,620
It's empty

174
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,139
It's meaningless

175
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
But what does that matter

176
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,379
To defy the gods' curse

177
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,259
to push that boulder

178
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:44,980
day after day...

179
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,799
Isn't that, in itself

180
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,179
an act of defiance against the gods

181
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,039
Who cares if it will roll back down

182
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,860
After all...

183
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
the moment you're at the bottom of the hill

184
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,500
is when you're happiest

185
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,120
Isn't it

186
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,179
Ugh...

187
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
My position must be wrong

188
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,200
That's it

189
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,779
How can this be happening

190
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,759
Is it because the necklace isn't glowing

191
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:41,299
I don't want to be stuck here forever

192
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,360
This is so annoying

193
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,259
Are you going out today

194
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,380
Where to

195
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,339
When are you coming back

196
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:15,039
Can I come with you

197
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,819
As I recall, you signed an employment contract

198
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,000
with Xu Yinxi

199
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,980
Not a contract to be my personal bodyguard

200
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,119
Oh, come on, just take me with you

201
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,480
I actually need to buy a few things today

202
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:30,539
How about this

203
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,279
Rock, Paper, Scissors

204
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,099
If I win, you take me with you

205
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,220
I'll be your bodyguard

206
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:35,940
Deal

207
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:38,720
Rock

208
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,420
Paper

209
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:39,839
Scissors

210
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,019
Give me 15 minutes to wash my hair and change

211
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,839
I'll be right back

212
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,859
You promised! No take-backs

213
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,180
Bodyguards aren't supposed to stare like that

214
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,599
I was just coming to tell you

215
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,539
I'm heading to the restroom

216
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,700
And

217
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,880
You need me to come hold

218
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,920
You have to report to me before you use the restroom now

219
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,960
Hey, can I borrow your phone

220
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,420
Thanks

221
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,319
I just saw in the news...

222
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,240
there's going to be a total lunar eclipse in three months

223
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,059
Thinking back, it's been almost a year

224
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,319
since that last amazing one

225
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,660
we missed the blood moon last time

226
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:25,619
Everyone

227
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,140
let's all watch it together this time

228
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,859
I hear this eclipse

229
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,079
is supposed to be even more spectacular.

230
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,019
We...

231
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,880
We're probably...

232
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,119
less than 200 meters apart

233
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,160
Why aren't you building this model kit

234
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,740
If you want to, you can build it

235
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,140
Clever

236
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,680
How did you know exactly what I was thinking

237
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,759
Build it on the table

238
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,539
The floor is cold

239
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,619
It's okay

240
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,619
I'm not that fragile

241
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,579
Sit on this

242
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,799
Here

243
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:52,920
Mint

244
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,019
Sore throat

245
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,619
I'm fine

246
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,740
Hey, look over there

247
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:17,359
Scissors...

248
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,799
Rock

249
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,319
Paper

250
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,819
Let's go

251
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,940
Coming

252
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,619
Hurry up

253
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:33,920
Hey

254
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,339
I got paid

255
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,339
Let's go out to eat tonight

256
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,059
Nope

257
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,740
The usual rules

258
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:47,539
Rock, Paper, Scissors

259
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,440
Hehe

260
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,339
Let's go

261
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,779
Yang You

262
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,839
Come here

263
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,259
Take a look at the topics for the next video

264
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,180
Do you have any thoughts

265
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,599
Yang You

266
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:18,680
Yang You

267
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,980
Yang You

268
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,279
What's wrong

269
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,759
Why are you zoning out

270
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,039
I've been calling your name

271
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,339
It's nothing

272
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,859
What did you need

273
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,339
No

274
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:35,859
something is definitely on your mind

275
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,500
Spill it

276
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Maybe I can help

277
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,480
Well...

278
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,799
It's me...

279
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,940
I mean, it's a friend of mine

280
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,400
Oh

281
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,420
A "friend," is it

282
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,960
No, it really is a friend

283
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,200
Okay, okay

284
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
A friend

285
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,039
So, what's going on with this friend

286
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,140
My friend told me that...

287
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,000
he gets the feeling that another friend of his likes him

288
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,740
He's tried testing the waters a few times

289
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,359
but the other person has never given him a clear signal

290
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,700
So, what do you thinkv

291
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,720
What does his friend's silence mean

292
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,059
Does she like him back

293
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,119
or does she only think of him as a friend

294
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,539
Why do you care so much if someone else likes him

295
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,460
What do you mean

296
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,839
What about you

297
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,900
Do you like him

298
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Me

299
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,799
I...

300
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,140
I don't know

301
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:54,500
How could you not know

302
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,900
Of course you know

303
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,859
Huh

304
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,500
If you're constantly trying to test

305
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,980
whether someone likes you

306
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,579
that means

307
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,319
you've already fallen in him

308
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,960
Because...

309
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,299
you're either looking for confirmation...

310
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,859
or...

311
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:12,880
you're waiting for them to make a move

312
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,660
Confirmation...

313
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,539
A move

314
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,039
So...

315
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,119
who is he

316
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,299
It's not me

317
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,640
I told you

318
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,940
it's a friend of mine

319
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,079
Right

320
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,400
Stop letting your mind run wild

321
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,519
It really is just a friend of mine

322
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,759
Sure

323
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm done talking to you

324
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:41,960
I'm going to the bathroom

325
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,720
Hello, Chen Shi

326
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,440
You like Yang You

327
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,380
so why won't you give him a straight answer

328
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,019
Why are you leading him on

329
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:01,779
That's the kind of thing a jerk does

330
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:02,500
you know that

331
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,119
Hello

332
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,519
Hello

333
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:12,480
Why are you so quiet

334
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,259
Ugh

335
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,019
hung up on me

336
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,059
Jerk

337
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,000
Where did you go

338
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,140
I did not see you

339
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,779
you say you were craving something sweet

340
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:24,839
I was getting coffee anyway

341
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,759
so I grabbed you some dessert

342
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,420
Thanks

343
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,859
I thought you had trouble sleeping

344
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,380
Why are you drinking coffee this late

345
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,059
How did you know I have trouble sleeping

346
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,359
Come on, my dear brother

347
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,279
Take a look at the panda eyes

348
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,140
How do you think I know

349
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,240
Here, lucky you.

350
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,500
Have some cake with me
