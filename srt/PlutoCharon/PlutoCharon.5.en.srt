1
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:06,833
You smoke

2
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:08,966
I've never seen you do that before

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,333
Just occasionally

4
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,566
I smoke when I'm stressed

5
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,433
So

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,633
are you really stressed right now

7
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,866
We're roommates

8
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:41,766
so

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,600
you're smoking now

10
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,600
is it because of me

11
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,466
You're jealous

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,366
aren't you

13
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:51,100
It's because of me

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,533
right

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,366
You sound so pleased with yourself

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,733
Not really

17
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,233
It's just

18
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,633
why are you jealous of him

19
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,133
To me

20
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,900
no one is more important than you

21
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,666
He

22
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:11,700
just

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,966
looks very much like some trash

24
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,033
I ran into before

25
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:15,966
I simply felt

26
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,666
there was no need to tell him

27
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,400
about our relationship

28
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,733
First love

29
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,100
How could that be

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,233
You

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,900
you are my first love

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,833
He

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,766
is just a very, very bad person

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,566
I ran into when I was working some time ago

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,633
So

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,533
do you want to be with me

37
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,433
or are you with me

38
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,333
just because you desire me

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,066
I'm sorry

40
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,466
It must be because I'm inadequate

41
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,700
that I made you

42
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:57,133
ask such an insecure question

43
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,233
I like you

44
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,700
I love you

45
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,100
As for

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,166
not being able to live without you

47
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,633
it's physica

48
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,700
and psychological

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,900
and emotional

50
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,833
As for

51
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,433
the physiological aspect

52
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,133
I can give you an additional answer

53
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:16,900
after we've had a chance to try

54
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,133
Not angry anymore

55
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,500
You are so difficult sometimes

56
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,066
It takes me

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,300
If it were anyone else

58
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,333
they definitely couldn't put up with you

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tell me

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,266
a partner like me

61
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,033
isn't it hard to find even with a lamp

62
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,900
You bighead

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,166
Hey

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,666
teach me how to smoke

65
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,600
I don't know how

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why learn that

67
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,433
I want to

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Before

69
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,133
I thought

70
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,233
people who smoke smell bad

71
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,633
But

72
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,800
seeing you smoke

73
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:50,833
I think it's really cool

74
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,133
Still want to learn

75
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,300
Go smoke by yourself then

76
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,833
Hey

77
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,666
You go to sleep first

78
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,733
I still have two documents to look over here

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,133
Mmm

80
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,333
Hurry up then

81
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,166
Don't mess around

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,166
There's a book there, you can look at it first

83
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,333
to pass the time

84
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:23,833
I'll

85
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,733
take you to bed soon

86
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,133
This photo

87
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,033
is it yours

88
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:46,600
No

89
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,500
This photo and that necklace

90
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
are my great-uncle's belongings

91
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,933
Great-uncle

92
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,500
He was my grandfather's elder brother

93
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:57,166
His relics

94
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,433
why are they in your house

95
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,300
He never married in his life

96
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,100
so his relics

97
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,500
were kept by my grandfather

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
I have an identical photo

99
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,100
And this

100
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,300
this necklace

101
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:19,600
I have one exactly like it

102
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,400
Exactly the same

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,166
Yeah

104
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,266
This story

105
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,033
it might sound unbelievable

106
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,100
but I truly didn't mean to keep it from you

107
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I actually...

108
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,166
am not from your world

109
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,800
To be precise

110
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:46,900
I crossed over

111
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,633
from another timeline

112
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't belong

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,100
in the space-time you are in

114
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,133
Crossing over

115
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:54,800
Timeline

116
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:55,566
Mmm

117
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,633
It might challenge your understanding

118
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,300
but I'm really not lying to you

119
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,466
I was originally an intern journalist

120
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,133
living in 2024

121
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,666
in Nanwan

122
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,133
I'd never been here

123
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,133
But I don't know how

124
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,533
I ended up here

125
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,666
I originally thought

126
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,100
it was vertical time travel

127
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,066
but later I found out

128
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,500
everything that happened in this timeline

129
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,400
is completely different

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,300
from the one I came from

131
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:28,700
And

132
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,300
even people who look exactly the same

133
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:31,466
have different identities

134
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,500
So

135
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:34,700
that's how I was certain

136
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,800
this wasn't vertical time travel

137
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:40,533
but horizontal space-time crossing

138
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,033
You don't believe me, do you

139
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,300
Even if you don't believe me

140
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,000
can you please

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,300
not treat me like a lunatic

142
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:00,766
I really...

143
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,133
I believe you

144
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,033
You believe

145
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,400
You believe what I'm saying

146
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,866
You don't think I'm crazy

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,133
I've always been afraid to tell you

148
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,500
I was afraid you'd think I was crazy

149
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,833
or mentally ill

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,633
At best, I'd be locked in a sanatorium for treatment

151
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,000
At worst, handed over to the police

152
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,666
Then I'd have a thousand mouths

153
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,000
but still couldn't explain myself

154
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:37,866
Everything you said

155
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,200
I believe all of it

156
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:40,800
Really

157
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,933
Hey

158
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,233
What is this notebook about

159
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,700
It seems your great-uncle's handwriting

160
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,533
wasn't so great either

161
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,166
Do you know the story behind this notebook

162
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,100
Maybe this way

163
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,633
we can figure out

164
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,866
the reason I came here

165
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,200
So if we figure out

166
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,166
the reason you came here

167
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,666
you can return to your original world

168
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,366
Return to my original world

169
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:32,766
Mmm

170
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,400
Didn't you say you crossed over

171
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,266
So if you figure out

172
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:40,133
the reason you crossed over

173
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,133
you can cross back

174
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,866
Go back...

175
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,000
Chen Shi

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,066
Mmm

177
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,400
I've never been able to figure out

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,966
how I crossed over

179
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:06,900
I just remember

180
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,900
that the necklace glowed

181
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,533
and when I opened my eyes

182
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:12,866
I was already here

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,866
So maybe

184
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,866
I might, without knowing it

185
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,700
suddenly cross back again

186
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,033
You don't want to go back

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,433
I'm a Xuedu native.

188
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,766
During my sophomore year

189
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,400
my parents passed away in an accident

190
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,500
I no longer have

191
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,700
any family left in that world

192
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,333
But now I have you

193
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,900
So I feel

194
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,033
like this is pretty good, too

195
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,133
That's why

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,833
I want to find

197
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,233
the reason why I crossed over

198
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,366
That way

199
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,800
I can prevent the risk of going back

200
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,033
Chen Shi

201
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,433
let me stay here

202
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:01,633
and turn into an old grandpa with you

203
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,133
okay

204
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,366
My great-uncle

205
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,633
was my grandpa's half-brother

206
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,133
Mmm

207
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,600
When I was little

208
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,833
I heard the elders chatting

209
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:20,866
and talking about

210
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,766
his mother's

211
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,566
previous husband

212
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,366
who was a drunken gambler

213
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,300
When my great-uncle

214
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,533
was less than a year old

215
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,600
he sent him away

216
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,366
to settle gambling debts

217
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,233
But my great-grandmother

218
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,633
never gave up

219
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:38,366
looking for him

220
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,433
But by the time they found him

221
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,500
he had already passed away

222
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:46,933
He only left behind that

223
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,600
notebook with the photo inside

224
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,866
and a necklace

225
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,266
Passed away

226
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,033
Did something happen

227
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,533
I don't know all the details

228
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,733
I just heard

229
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:01,766
the debt he was sent to repay

230
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,866
belonged to the boss of a gang

231
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,200
He was raised to be a killer

232
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,033
since he was a child

233
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:08,900
Ah

234
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,500
And then

235
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,866
They say he later

236
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,233
became the most formidable killer

237
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,400
in the entire organization

238
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,000
Once there was an internal conflict

239
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,000
and he took the opportunity to kill the boss

240
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,133
He set a fire

241
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,133
and escaped

242
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,266
Later he was hunted by the organization's men

243
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,966
During the chase

244
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,200
he was seriously injured

245
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,633
With his right ear having completely

246
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:42,800
lost its hearing

247
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,933
he hid in a sanatorium

248
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,366
It was a private sanatorium

249
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,166
so private that

250
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,366
it only had one patient

251
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,333
A rich young master

252
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,500
This rich young master's family was very wealthy

253
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,500
His parents died young

254
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:00,500
and he was frail

255
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,366
To protect his grandson, his grandfather

256
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,333
specifically built this sanatorium

257
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,400
He also hired

258
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,466
a dedicated medical team

259
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,200
to treat him

260
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,933
daily

261
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,266
He practically grew up

262
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,766
under house arrest in this sanatorium

263
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,200
Innocent of the world

264
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,866
Very kind

265
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,766
But just kind in a vacuum

266
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,633
So

267
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,300
it was this rich young master

268
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,200
who saved the injured killer

269
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,200
He hid the killer

270
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,333
in the sanatorium for over a year

271
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,333
without anyone knowing

272
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,700
Not only that

273
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:48,033
a pampered, naive

274
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,133
young master

275
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't know how he did it

276
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,600
but while his grandfather was working abroad

277
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,266
he managed to implant an artificial cochlea in the killer

278
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,066
He taught him

279
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,433
to read and write

280
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,133
and told him about the outside world

281
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,800
It sounds like

282
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
a romantic love story

283
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,066
So

284
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,033
they ended up together

285
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,766
But he killed the rich young master himself

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,633
Huh

287
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,733
How did this turn into a horror story

288
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,966
There was no buildup

289
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,100
Why

290
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,100
Apparently, he was later

291
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,333
discovered by the organization's men

292
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:25,200
and captured

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
He was tortured relentlessly,

294
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,500
but somehow managed to become

295
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,533
the new boss of the organization

296
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:34,033
After he became the boss,

297
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,266
he killed many people

298
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,600
and that included

299
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,900
the rich young master

300
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,233
They say he went completely mad afterwards

301
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,200
He even killed people

302
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,633
who only slightly resembled the young master

303
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,966
They were all killed by him

304
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:53,700
Later, he was locked up

305
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,633
in a sanatorium

306
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,200
When the nurse wasn't paying attention

307
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,100
he took an overdose of sleeping pills

308
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:00,100
So

309
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,766
he killed the rich young master himself

310
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,833
Could it have been love turned into hate

311
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:08,600
I don't know

312
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:10,833
That's all I know

313
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,300
What about that notebook and photo

314
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,700
and that necklace

315
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,933
The necklace must have been a pledge of love between them

316
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,433
A token of love

317
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,366
The photo is a picture of the two of them

318
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
The notebook

319
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,133
is my great-uncle's diary

320
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,433
I read through it

321
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,300
and also heard some things

322
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,933
from the elders in my family

323
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,333
and then pieced together this story

324
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,233
For the former lovers

325
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,033
to end up like this

326
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:47,533
it's truly a pity

327
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,133
Hey

328
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,033
wait a minute

329
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,400
Couple's necklace

330
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:53,333
photo

331
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,733
Why do I have them in my timeline

332
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,166
Can we still find anyone from the young master's family

333
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,733
Or anyone who knows the details

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,200
After the young master died

335
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,466
his grandfather also passed away

336
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,866
And so many years have passed

337
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,666
even if there were people who knew the truth

338
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:09,733
they wouldn't be alive anymore

339
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,100
Fine

340
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:13,933
I feel like

341
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,533
my crossing

342
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,233
they might truly be the key

343
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,633
But why would they be connected to me

344
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,500
Do you think the young master

345
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,266
regretted saving the killer

346
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,766
I think he should have just let the killer

347
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,633
be hunted down and die

348
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,733
That way, many later tragedies

349
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,533
wouldn't have happened

350
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,733
If one day

351
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,266
you knew that I would cause you

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,600
any harm

353
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,566
disadvantage

354
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,433
or injury

355
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,333
even if it means sacrificing me

356
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,700
you must protect yourself

357
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,200
Why are you suddenly reacting so strongly

358
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,666
It's nothing

359
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:07,500
If...

360
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,300
I mean, if...

361
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,566
if you had taken me in back then

362
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,800
knowing that later some things would happen

363
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,733
that you couldn't face

364
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,566
or couldn't accept

365
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,733
would you still have taken me in

366
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,233
We...

367
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:26,133
We are "us."

368
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,533
Yes

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,433
So

370
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,000
don't be upset

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
over their story

372
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,700
It has nothing to do with us

373
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,133
You've drunk too much

374
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,400
Let's go back

375
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,233
No

376
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,400
I want to stay for a bit longer

377
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:04,433
You once said

378
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,233
you were in pain

379
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,533
so you wanted me to be in pain too

380
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,366
You were hurt

381
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,466
so I should be hurt too

382
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,400
You succeeded

383
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,566
Since you still refuse to let me go

384
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,766
you should try to experience my feelings

385
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:18,733
for a change

386
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,966
I...

387
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,000
We...

388
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,933
I hope we never see each other

389
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,000
again for all eternity

390
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:27,533
No

391
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,066
No

392
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,400
No

393
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,433
Yang You

394
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:34,766
Yang You

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,233
Yang You

396
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,066
Did you have a nightmare

397
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,400
It's okay.

398
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:50,366
It's okay, it's okay

399
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,033
I'm here

400
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:58,900
I'm right here

401
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,700
I think I dreamed about the young master and the killer

402
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:17,333
How is that possible

403
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,333
You just listened to their story before bed

404
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,733
and it influenced you

405
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:22,433
No

406
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,633
It really was them

407
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,666
Could my crossing over

408
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,600
truly be related to them

409
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,766
Whatever

410
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,300
More than them and the crossing

411
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,733
I just want to

412
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,200
live my life with you

413
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,800
You don't want to find the reason for your crossing anymore

414
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,833
Mmm

415
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:02,766
I feel

416
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,666
like they were so miserable

417
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,766
I just felt it for a moment

418
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,300
and it already felt unbearable

419
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:14,933
I don't want to uncover something so heavy

420
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,900
Let's go out and eat after work today

421
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay

422
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:32,233
Oh

423
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,000
by the way

424
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,266
I want to wear

425
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,266
the new shirt I bought a few days ago

426
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,400
I might need to borrow something from you

427
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,166
What is it?

428
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,433
It's a secret

429
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,400
Hello, everyone

430
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,433
I'm Charon

431
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,166
Today we're going to explain the astronomy concepts of

432
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,833
Tidal Force and the Roche Limit

433
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,433
Since every celestial body with mass

434
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,500
exerts gravity on other bodies

435
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:16,266
and gravity diminishes as the distance

436
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,233
between the two bodies increases

437
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,366
Therefore, from the perspective of the affected body

438
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,433
the gravitational force on a unit mass on its surface

439
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,733
and one at its center of mass

440
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,200
will be different

441
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,800
because they are different distances from the source of gravity

442
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,533
There will be a slight difference

443
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,333
We call this difference

444
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,966
the tidal force

445
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,733
For the affected body

446
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,433
the tidal force stretches it

447
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,933
along the line connecting its center of mass

448
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,833
and the force-exerting body

449
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,033
And the closer the two bodies are

450
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,133
the greater the tidal force

451
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,766
The body will then be more easily torn apart

452
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,066
Mmm

453
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:56,666
And the Roche limit is the distance at which a body's own gravity

454
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,000
is equal to the tidal force

455
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,900
exerted on it

456
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,033
by an adjacent body

457
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,533
It's the distance of equality

458
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:07,333
Therefore, when two bodies are within the Roche limit

459
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,333
due to the tidal force

460
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,400
the smaller body

461
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,233
will break up

462
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,766
and subsequently form a ring around the larger body

463
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:14,833
Alright

464
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,533
That concludes our astronomy knowledge sharing for today

465
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,633
See you next time

466
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:24,733
What were you talking about

467
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,133
the other day

468
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,733
We're working right now

469
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,433
Mind the place

470
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,266
The recording is over now

471
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,333
Go be lovey-dovey somewhere else

472
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:36,866
Don't be an eyesore here

473
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:40,900
Let's go then

474
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,933
Let's go

475
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:49,633
Seriously

476
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,433
when people fall in love

477
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,100
they all act the same

478
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,700
The Roche limit you mentioned before

479
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:25,000
I finally understand what it is

480
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,400
So you chose this topic on purpose

481
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,233
I can break through the Roche limit

482
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,333
I'm not scared

483
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,233
and I don't care

484
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,066
Because even if the large body tears the small body apart

485
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,066
it will turn into countless fragments

486
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
orbiting the large body

487
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,866
becoming a beautiful planetary ring

488
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:03,900
Yang You

489
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,333
with me

490
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:09,200
that day will never come

491
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,733
So this is what you borrowed from me

492
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,900
When do you plan to return it

493
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,733
I didn't say I wouldn't return it

494
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,833
How about

495
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:30,700
I pay you back with something else first

496
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:31,500
Chen Shi

497
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:33,700
I said before

498
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,566
that I like you

499
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,700
I love you

500
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,366
Physically

501
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:39,833
psychologically

502
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,333
and emotionally

503
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,766
I can't be without you

504
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:44,133
As for the physiological part

505
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,666
I'll know after I've tried

506
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,533
Stop it

507
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:39,133
It tickles

508
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,533
I'm genuinely exhausted

509
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,300
Are you okay

510
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:06,233
Hey

511
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,500
We have a meeting soon

512
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,333
Shut up

513
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:08,833
I just think

514
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,233
your account concept has problems

515
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:11,933
You're running a content business

516
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,533
not playing house with little kids.

517
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:14,566
You hire a bunch of friends

518
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,533
without even checking if they can do the job

519
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,566
and just bring them in

520
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,566
Look

521
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:19,333
the company account data

522
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,333
is a disaster

523
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,633
You calm down

524
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:23,400
I have my plans

525
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,233
I am calm

526
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,133
I've been biting my tongue about this for too long

527
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,766
And that streamer you hired, Yang You

528
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:30,833
he only has good looks, doesn't he

529
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,200
What else is there to him

530
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:33,100
It's only because

531
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,033
Chen Shi likes him

532
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,200
Are you running a content channel

533
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:36,266
or a dating show

534
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,200
or a dating show

535
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,533
All you do is act as a matchmaker

536
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,300
Fei Wan

537
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,900
I think...

538
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't care what you think

539
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:44,733
In short

540
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,100
I won't accept these arrangements

541
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:54,833
Chen Shi

542
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,566
You've been an extra in a few mediocre roles

543
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,266
and now you're giving orders

544
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,233
See if you're even qualified

545
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:07,633
Ultimately

546
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,733
just because you're joining

547
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,900
you think the streamer spot is yours

548
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,733
But at least he has good looks

549
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:18,933
What about you

550
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:21,833
Are you trying to blind the audience

551
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,266
You...

552
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:22,633
And

553
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,033
if you want to compete

554
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,500
win with your actual ability

555
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,233
One moment mocking others' qualifications

556
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,366
the next moment envying their looks

557
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Instead of exhausting yourself

558
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,500
trying to step on others to get ahead

559
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,933
you should reflect on yourself.

560
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:33,600
Enough

561
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:34,633
Stop talking
