1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,780
What did you say

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,439
If I remember correctly

3
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,139
This is the second time we've met

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,019
You still remember me

5
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:09,640
What do you mean

6
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,359
What do you mean, "be with you"

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,380
Besides, I didn't even run into you this morning

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,219
Are you asking me to pledge myself to you

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,379
Pledge myself to you

10
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,460
No, no

11
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:19,960
What I mean is

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,899
Could you take me in

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,920
Take you in

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,140
It's like this

15
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm an adult

16
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,019
My dad always forces me to do

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:31,899
jobs I don't like

18
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,899
So I ran away from home

19
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,740
But now I'm penniless

20
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,399
no phone

21
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,719
and nowhere to live

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,219
You're the only person I know

23
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,520
Could you

24
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,079
help me

25
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,380
We "know" each other

26
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,759
I don't even know who you are

27
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,859
How can that count as knowing each other

28
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,479
Chen Shi

29
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,520
Content Planner at Jiuwu Culture Media

30
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,479
Hello, Chen Shi

31
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,219
I'm Yang You

32
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,200
Twenty-two years old

33
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,179
I'm a journal

34
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:58,920
Uh

35
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,840
unemployed

36
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,399
I don't even know how old you are

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,640
Chen Shi

38
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,539
Twenty-three

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,340
So you're older than me

40
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,359
Chen Shi

41
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,140
Brother

42
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,480
Now we know each other, right

43
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,340
So can you

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,280
take me in now

45
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,680
I remember

46
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,239
You said you were sleepwalking

47
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,200
I wasn't fully awake then

48
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,219
I was talking nonsense

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
You really weren't awake

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,900
Don't tell me you went out

51
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,879
in these pajamas

52
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,540
and wandered around here all day

53
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,099
It's a long story

54
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,599
Let's be clear upfront

55
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,700
I won't let you stay for too long

56
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,560
I don't like living with others

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,079
Find a place to live quickly

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,859
and leave as soon as possible

59
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,540
Okay

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,979
Dressed like that, you'll catch a cold

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,439
Thanks

62
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,500
How are you like Doraemon

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,500
You have everything

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,000
Alright

65
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,280
Let's go

66
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,759
Forgot to tell you

67
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,800
I

68
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,360
don't like girls

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,080
Huh

70
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:41,539
So

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,199
still want to come home with me

72
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
Wow

73
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,719
Your home's decor is so beautiful

74
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,479
Can I take a look around

75
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,520
Mm-hmm

76
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,460
Didn't expect his taste to be so in line with mine

77
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,759
Your home's renovation is seriously amazing

78
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,019
It's literally my dream house

79
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,620
So, which room do I get

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,740
The room right behind you

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,379
Really

82
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:45,139
Hey

83
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,199
What's this room for

84
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,339
Storage room

85
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,819
It's full of stuff that hasn't been used for years

86
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,560
Very dirty

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,439
Then I won't go in

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,240
Thank you

89
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,519
Thank you again for taking me in

90
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,680
And for letting me stay in such a nice room

91
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,839
I didn't "let" you have it

92
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,860
It's just an ordinary guest room

93
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,399
I'm still grateful

94
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,259
You don't know

95
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,899
how much you've helped me

96
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,620
What did you say just now

97
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,259
Nothing

98
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,480
Are you composing a symphony

99
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,160
next to me

100
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,019
Sorry

101
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,699
On the table

102
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,379
there's some late-night snacks I brought back from the restauran

103
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:17,879
If you don't mind

104
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,720
I don't mind at all

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,819
Not at all

106
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,560
Then I'll

107
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,759
thank you

108
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,519
Aren't you having some

109
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,139
Then I won't stand on ceremony

110
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,339
Hey

111
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,240
Where are you going

112
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,040
Are you coming back

113
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Should I come with you

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm getting you some clean clothes

115
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,180
And putting the contract back in the study

116
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,600
Want to tag along

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,220
Then come back quickly

118
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,720
For me

119
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:54,500
Thanks

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,120
Why aren't you eating

121
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,879
I'm full

122
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:57,820
No

123
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:58,940
I was waiting for you to come back

124
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:00,820
Thank you

125
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,100
I'm full

126
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,220
I'm alive again

127
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,559
Full now

128
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,559
Mm-hmm

129
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,299
Your room has a bathroom

130
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,240
Wash up and get some rest early

131
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:44,919
Okay

132
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:47,820
Hey

133
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,580
Hmm

134
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,799
I

135
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,100
saw that the bed in my room is pretty big

136
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,820
So

137
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,000
How about

138
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,279
I give you half

139
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,700
I just thought, since your place is so big

140
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,879
you might be scared sleeping alone

141
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,759
We could chat too

142
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,559
So

143
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,840
You're using the room I lent you

144
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,480
You're using the room I lent you

145
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,639
I just ran away from home

146
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm afraid

147
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,940
what if while I'm sleeping

148
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,980
someone kidnaps me

149
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,220
Hey

150
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,860
Chen Shi

151
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,080
What

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,399
Want to join me for a shower too

153
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,419
You agreed

154
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,799
Then protect me

155
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,940
Don't let your family kidnap the wrong person

156
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:42,720
Yes

157
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,559
Hey

158
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,240
Uh

159
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,840
can I borrow your phone

160
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:49,379
Sure

161
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,080
No password

162
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,259
Oh

163
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,019
By the way

164
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,740
No need to clean up the stuff on the table

165
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,620
Auntie will come to clean tomorrow

166
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,580
Hello, the number you have dialed is not in service

167
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,860
Please check the number and dial again

168
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,379
Not in service

169
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,960
How could my number be out of service

170
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,759
Weird

171
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,679
How is that possible

172
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,539
Hello, the number you have dialed is not in service

173
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:51,980
Sister Ning's number is out of service too

174
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,480
Hello, the number you have dialed is not in service

175
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,799
Please check

176
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,460
Hello, the number you have dialed is not in service

177
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,860
Please check

178
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,879
Hello

179
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,500
by the way what are you busy with?

180
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:22,659
Hello, may I speak with Brother Yuan

181
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,279
Wrong number

182
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,340
How could this be

183
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,019
Oh, right

184
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:38,980
Check the news

185
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,740
How is this possible

186
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,100
Can't find anything

187
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,799
Nothing about the past at all

188
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,059
Not even major domestic and international news

189
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,159
This world

190
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,059
and the world I'm from

191
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,960
are the same

192
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,480
but not entirely the same

193
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,240
What's going on

194
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,080
This world.

195
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,840
and the world I'm from

196
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,720
aren't the same world

197
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,320
I lost that contract

198
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,659
I'll find you to re-sign it in a couple of days

199
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,419
Alright, alright

200
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm busy

201
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,720
Got to go

202
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:32,379
This is the last time

203
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,159
None of you have any more chances

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,360
Remember

205
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:36,740
Let go of one thought

206
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,080
and find immense freedom

207
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:49,980
This isn't a dream

208
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,639
I'm still here

209
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,259
That voice just now

210
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,539
was the clock shop owner

211
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,600
But why would I dream of him

212
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,399
So bizarre

213
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,940
He's been up for a while, right

214
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,179
He didn't already leave, did he

215
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,000
He's not home

216
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,539
Am I

217
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,639
better now

218
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,919
The last two times I came

219
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,700
you seemed a bit off

220
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,059
What

221
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,259
Don't tell me you've got a secret lover stashed away

222
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,779
So he is home

223
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,799
What did you need to see me about

224
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,840
I'll watch you sign it

225
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,139
So it doesn't get lost again

226
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,320
What's the rush

227
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,000
Did you have to come all this way

228
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,580
I better not go out

229
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,679
It would be hard to explain

230
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,340
Hey

231
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,519
So I'm running errands for you

232
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,340
acting as your secretary

233
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,039
and I'm in the wrong

234
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,899
I didn't mean that

235
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,419
You're not in a hurry

236
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,779
Only signing the equity holding agreement now

237
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,899
everything at the company

238
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,740
you handle it

239
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,879
these days

240
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:55,980
i have other things to deal with

241
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,080
thoes monthes i can manage it first

242
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,860
Early-stage operations

243
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,679
aren't too busy anyway

244
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,759
wait until you done

245
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,460
and what are you busy with

246
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,160
when will you done

247
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,460
I

248
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,900
I'll finish as soon as possible

249
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,680
ahh

250
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,079
Living like a caveman

251
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,819
How can I live without a phone

252
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,880
And how did I get here

253
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,079
No wonder things are like this now

254
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,759
Should've watched more time-travel shows

255
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,579
Then I wouldn't be so clueless about the theory

256
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,819
Hairdryer

257
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,819
Hairdryer

258
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,980
No sound

259
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,720
I'll go ask to borrow his hairdryer

260
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,859
Shouldn't be bothering him

261
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,859
要不然感冒了还得麻烦他

262
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,140
Don't want to catch a cold and trouble him

263
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,240
Fine then

264
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,539
I'll get going now

265
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,279
Oh, right

266
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,700
I've scheduled interviews for hosts next week

267
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,019
No matter how busy you are, you must be there

268
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,519
I just told you

269
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:50,920
Hey

270
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,980
Hey

271
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,380
Is this your necklace

272
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,779
You wear accessories

273
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,440
Mm

274
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,779
I've never seen it before

275
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,079
This accessory

276
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,700
doesn't really suit you

277
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,920
But it goes well with my outfit today

278
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,819
Mm

279
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,240
Who said I'm giving it to you

280
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:20,900
Hand it over

281
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,839
Mm

282
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,640
Um, excuse me

283
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,599
sorry to interrupt

284
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,200
Hey

285
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,759
You really were hiding a beauty

286
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:34,720
Sister Ning

287
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,099
Why are you here

288
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,920
Hey, beautiful

289
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,400
You must have the wrong person

290
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,319
My face isn't that common

291
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,160
You don't know me

292
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,099
Hmm

293
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:47,740
Sorry

294
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,079
have we met

295
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,299
Think again

296
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,579
You really don't know me

297
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:55,680
Hmm

298
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,180
You do look familiar

299
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,259
But

300
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm sure we haven't met

301
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,160
Otherwise, with your looks

302
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,759
if I'd flirted with you, sister

303
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:11,900
how could I not remember

304
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,660
It's not Sister Ning

305
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:14,920
but she looks

306
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,039
exactly like Sister Ning

307
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,420
But why do you look so familiar

308
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,140
There are actually two people

309
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,440
who look so alike

310
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,900
This necklace

311
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
This necklace

312
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,480
This necklace is yours

313
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,079
Mm

314
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,359
What about this necklace

315
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,059
Can you let me take a closer look

316
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,819
Of course

317
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,079
This necklace is indeed identical to ours

318
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,299
the same

319
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,619
Could it really be such a coincidence

320
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:57,839
Hey

321
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Are you okay

322
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,099
This necklace, could you

323
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,420
lend it to me for a while

324
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,599
Uh

325
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,319
Is that okay

326
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,059
It's not impossible

327
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:21,940
but I can't just lend it to you for free, right

328
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,539
Due to some reasons

329
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,900
I don't have much money right now

330
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,859
or anything valuable

331
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,000
You have

332
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:32,779
yourself

333
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,180
Huh, don't you

334
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,319
Huh

335
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:36,460
hey

336
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,460
don't be nervous

337
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,539
I'm from Jiuwu Culture Media Co., Ltd

338
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,559
Our company is just starting out

339
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,339
We're currently building an astronomy account

340
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,579
We need a host

341
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,400
I think you'd be perfect for it

342
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,339
Want to work with me

343
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,900
You're something else

344
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,160
Just started and already offended a big shot

345
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,759
Sorry

346
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:04,019
I

347
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,940
But I actually admire that about you

348
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,319
What

349
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,759
Your determination to expose the truth, even if it means offending people

350
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:13,059
and your persistence in uncovering the facts despite obstacles

351
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,700
to give the public an answer

352
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,180
That's the spirit a social reporter should have

353
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,960
Let me reintroduce myself

354
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,359
I'm Sun Ning

355
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,779
You can call me Sister Ning

356
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Want to work with me

357
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,380
Okay

358
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,380
You agree

359
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,940
No, no!

360
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:38,660
I

361
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,859
I mean

362
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,500
can I think about it

363
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,880
Of course

364
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,599
Take your time

365
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,880
We can talk about the necklace

366
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,319
after you've decided

367
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,339
Mm

368
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,559
I'm leaving now

369
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,279
Hey

370
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,200
Hey

371
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,900
What did you need

372
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,779
I wanted to borrow your hairdryer

373
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,480
but my hair is probably almost dry now

374
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,579
There's a hairdryer in the bedside table in your room

375
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,160
Thank you

376
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,420
The necklace

377
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,019
could it be the key to going back

378
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,259
Chen Shi probably won't kick me out for now

379
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:05,660
The housing problem is solved

380
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,940
Seems I was right to stick with him

381
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,859
At least I won't turn into a spirit

382
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,619
But

383
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,200
if I keep relying on Chen Shi,

384
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
for food, clothes, and shelter

385
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,579
isn't it just a matter of time

386
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,180
before I get thrown outisn't

387
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,140
That Xu Yinxi's proposal

388
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,039
That Xu Yinxi's proposal

389
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,359
could solve my urgent living needs

390
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,720
But if I'm not mistaken

391
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,799
if I leave Chen Shi

392
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,460
I'll turn back into a spirit, right

393
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,420
Mm

394
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,079
Xu Yinxi

395
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,180
Jiuwu

396
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,500
Jiuwu Culture Media

397
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,299
Chen Shi

398
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,680
works for this company too, right

399
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,960
So that means

400
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,660
I can both get a job

401
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,160
and stick close to him

402
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:57,920
That way

403
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,819
I can slowly find

404
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,380
a way back

405
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,819
I'll ask Chen Shi first

406
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,559
see what this host job Xu Yinxi mentioned

407
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,180
what does it do

408
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:11,380
Mm

409
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:16,059
Got a minute to talk

410
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:17,880
Go ahead

411
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:20,059
that ning

412
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,019
xu yinxi

413
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,660
what is the relationship she and you

414
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,339
Don't get me wrong

415
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm not prying into your privacy

416
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:29,880
I saw from the business card

417
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,940
you're from the same company

418
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,160
And

419
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,619
judging by the positions

420
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,619
she's your boss

421
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,440
But your relationship doesn't seem like superior and subordinate

422
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,019
I wanted to ask

423
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,960
what does that signed host position

424
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,079
she mentioned involve

425
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,559
A sister I grew up with

426
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,440
She's starting a business now

427
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:52,640
I'm just helping out and killing time

428
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,339
She recently started a new account

429
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,839
about astronomy knowledge and research

430
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,619
The team should already be fully staffed

431
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,019
They're recruiting hosts now

432
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,380
Oh

433
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:05,500
Is she

434
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:06,940
your girlfriend

435
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,599
How could that be

436
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,200
Alright then

437
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,420
She's very pretty

438
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,920
Hey

439
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,759
You didn't try to get close while you had the chance

440
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,259
Aren't you the same

441
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:16,880
What

442
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,740
Nothing

443
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,819
Should I like someone just because they're pretty

444
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,980
There are so many beautiful people in the world

445
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,180
Am I really that shallow

446
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,359
Stop trying to set people up

447
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,839
If you're really that bored

448
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,079
go outside and count ants

449
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:33,980
Hmm

450
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,799
You're angry

451
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,599
Not angry

452
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,559
And I already told you

453
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,420
I don't like girls

454
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:50,900
Instead of worrying about others

455
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,539
you should worry about yourself

456
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,200
Hey

457
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,180
What did I say

458
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:02,779
I just asked a question

459
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,099
Why did he get angry

460
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,819
Hmm

461
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,619
Hey

462
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,740
I

463
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,700
just now

464
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,240
did I say something wrong

465
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,420
that upset you

466
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,480
No

467
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,059
If not, let's go eat

468
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,099
Do you have money

469
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:31,960
No

470
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,240
Lend me some first

471
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,319
When I get a job and my salary

472
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,420
I'll pay you back

473
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,359
How generous of you

474
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,059
You

475
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:38,880
borrowing money to treat someone

476
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:40,859
That depends on who it is

477
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,440
You're my creditor

478
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:45,819
He smiled

479
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,920
So you're not angry anymore

480
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:47,420
Let's go

481
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:47,980
Hey

482
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,799
Huh

483
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,720
Wait a second

484
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,440
This phone

485
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,039
you can use it for now

486
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,880
A phone

487
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:01,240
For me

488
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,839
Don't you have no phone to use

489
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,740
Really

490
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:04,920
his is great

491
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,640
Chen Shi

492
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,799
A new phone

493
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,180
Uh

494
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,579
Mm

495
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,759
There are also some clothes in your room's wardrobe

496
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,240
You can wear them for now

497
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:20,980
Mm

498
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:21,779
What

499
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:22,799
Don't like them

500
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,460
These

501
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,259
are actually my size

502
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,980
All brawn, no brains

503
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,599
Hey

504
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,259
Why are you angry again

505
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,720
Ouch

506
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,299
I'm really hungry

507
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,079
Eat out or order in

508
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,960
There are desserts on the table

509
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:43,660
Have some first

510
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,240
Mm

511
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,539
Okay

512
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,579
You can cook too

513
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:17,079
Mm

514
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:21,759
Mm

515
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,619
This pastry is delicious
