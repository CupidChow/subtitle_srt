1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:01,800
It's always been me

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,500
There never was a double

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,100
It's just been me

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,066
Right

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,600
What the hell is going on

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,333
You've known my situation all along

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
You even guided me

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,866
step by step

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,200
right into the trap you set

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,133
Did I guess right

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Why haven't you left yet

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,433
Why did you come back

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,533
What's up

14
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,633
I needed to see you

15
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,033
What are you doing

16
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,033
Moving

17
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,433
No

18
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,533
Renovating

19
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:33,466
Oh

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,766
What's this

21
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:35,833
A portrait

22
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,333
Don't touch

23
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,600
Who is it? Why so nervous

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,533
Hey, he's actually pretty handsome

25
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,433
How come I've never seen him before

26
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:45,233
Drop it

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,800
Why were you looking for me

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,333
Ah

29
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,366
Uh...

30
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,066
Uncle called me

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,266
He said you need to go back for a visit

32
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,333
Not going

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,266
I knew it

34
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,933
So I told him I couldn't reach you either

35
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,100
If you do go back

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,233
don't sell me out

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,933
I'm busy renovating the house

38
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:07,833
I can't go anywhere

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,100
What are you looking at

40
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,033
Nothing, it's just...

41
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,633
I feel like you're acting weird

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,566
Also

43
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:24,800
can't you just hire a designer for this

44
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,033
Why are you doing it all yourself

45
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,633
Okay, okay, okay

46
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:36,466
I'm going

47
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:37,466
Take your time with it

48
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:08,300
Hello, delivery

49
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:10,833
Hi

50
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,266
Here's your package. Thanks

51
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:28,200
Hello? You got the package

52
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,400
Yeah. It's the sizes and styles you asked for

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I had a friend in the clothing business

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,866
pick them from a contact's shop

55
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:34,800
See if they work

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Hold on

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
Hello

58
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,133
Why'd you go quiet

59
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,833
Hello? Hello?

60
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:16,733
They work

61
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,466
Help me buy a few more pairs of shoes

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,166
Wait a minute

63
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,466
You're really strange

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Who are these clothes for

65
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,233
It's not your style at all

66
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:26,833
And they don't look like your size

67
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,400
By the way

68
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,933
the business card I asked for...

69
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:29,566
is it done

70
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,500
When will it be ready

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,466
It's right in the box

72
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,233
There's an envelope

73
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,033
Did you see it

74
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:38,600
Oh

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,133
Found it

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,833
Does this need to connect to an app or...

77
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,066
I'll email you the user manual

78
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,933
Take a look

79
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:50,800
It's pretty simple

80
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,366
Thanks

81
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,800
How much for the card and clothes

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,566
Let me know later

83
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,500
I'll transfer it all at once

84
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,800
No rush on the money

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,633
But why do you need a business card

86
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,700
Didn't we just...

87
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,133
open the company together

88
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,300
What Content Planner at a media company

89
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,666
even needs a business card

90
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
And if that wasn't enough

91
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,033
you only printed one

92
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,833
A custom-made one

93
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:13,300
with a GPS tracking chip inside

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,266
What exactly are you up to

95
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,233
Nothing. Gotta go

96
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,833
This is my last chance

97
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,833
I thought I was the architect of this journey

98
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,566
I didn't expect

99
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,066
to end up just a bystander

100
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,000
I watched myself fall deeper in love

101
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,533
and I watched you fall for me again and again

102
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,833
loving me

103
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,733
But I can still only silently walk you to your death

104
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,100
Just for that one moment of change

105
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,733
This time

106
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,433
I must get you home safely

107
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,966
Are you okay

108
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,133
You alright

109
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,600
You aren't hurt, are you

110
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,633
No, I'm fine

111
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:39,666
Go to a world without me

112
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:29,900
What did you say

113
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,733
Can I stay with you

114
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,933
Let me be clear

115
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,166
I won't keep you for long

116
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,300
I don't like living with people

117
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,366
Find a place to live, quickly

118
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,333
And leave as soon as possible

119
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,466
Okay

120
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,666
Thanks

121
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:37,233
Thanks again for taking me in

122
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,366
And for letting me have the nice room

123
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,366
I didn't "let" you have it

124
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,166
It's just a standard guest room

125
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,033
Still, thank you very much

126
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,866
You have no idea...

127
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,366
what a huge favor this is

128
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,033
I lost that contract

129
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,466
I'll find you in a couple of days to re-sign

130
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,333
If one day

131
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:57,233
someone suddenly told you

132
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,733
that everything you do will fail

133
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:02,966
that all your efforts

134
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,666
are meaningless...

135
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,400
what would you do

136
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,133
Hmm

137
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,233
Who cares what they say

138
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,733
If I don't work hard

139
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:15,866
if I don't try

140
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,366
how will I know if I'll fail

141
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:19,333
Or if it matters

142
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:27,366
(Laughing)

143
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:31,866
Look at us

144
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,833
Laughing until we cry

145
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,066
No more laughing

146
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:44,733
I know

147
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:46,933
I know

148
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:49,866
I'm not leaving

149
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,866
I'm not going anywhere

150
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:57,966
That means...

151
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,333
I will die

152
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,133
You have to go

153
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:05,866
I'm begging you

154
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:07,833
Leave  Now

155
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,133
No

156
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,433
I told you, Chen Shi

157
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,533
I don't have a home anymore

158
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,833
Here

159
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,933
there is you

160
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,866
You are my home

161
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,633
You are my reason for being

162
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,933
It doesn't matter, I don't care

163
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:46,866
So

164
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,533
don't push me away, okay

165
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,333
Instead of chasing me away

166
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:06,666
why not tell me

167
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:07,933
what's going to happen

168
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,433
Let's face it together

169
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:11,766
Please

170
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:14,633
I hate you so much

171
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,733
I love you

172
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,266
So

173
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,566
can you tell me

174
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,566
what you know

175
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:32,366
Okay

176
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,733
Which means

177
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,566
this isn't my first time crossing over

178
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,766
But these marks on the wall...

179
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,566
why don't I have any memory of them

180
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:05,133
It seems that every previous time...

181
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,466
I died

182
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:13,666
You shouldn't be here

183
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,466
I said I'm not leaving

184
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:20,900
Besides

185
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,233
do you know how I can go back

186
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,666
If you don't tell me, how can I leave

187
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:26,833
Ah

188
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,233
I don't know how to return to my original world

189
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,233
This trick...

190
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,533
you've used it before

191
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,933
Huh

192
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,466
One time before

193
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,433
you tried to trap me with words like this

194
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,033
Knowing clearly the way to travel back

195
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,433
you dodged the question

196
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,233
and eventually missed

197
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:04,366
the window to return

198
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,033
The necklace

199
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,633
The mirror

200
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,533
August 8th

201
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:16,533
I guessed the necklace and the mirror

202
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,633
August 8th...

203
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,133
is the date

204
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,233
No wonder previously...

205
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,233
Stop making me guess

206
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,566
Tell me everything you know

207
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,133
You don't belong to this spacetime

208
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,033
If you forcefully stay

209
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,566
and form ties with this world

210
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,166
you will...

211
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,666
I've traveled back countless times before

212
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,366
trying to change your decision

213
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:13,633
But every single time

214
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,266
I couldn't change you

215
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,266
The ending was always the same

216
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:25,833
In countless timelines

217
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,566
I couldn't sway your decision

218
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,833
That would only accelerate your...

219
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:37,700
And you

220
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,333
even if I told you...

221
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,433
if you continued to stay

222
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,033
it would only...

223
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,133
You never left me in those past attempts

224
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,433
But every time, the ending was the same

225
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,933
Even if you asked me

226
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,633
and I told you

227
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,633
it would only...

228
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,633
You never left me before

229
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,966
But every time, the ending was the same

230
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,966
So that necklace...

231
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,966
was something you showed me on purpose

232
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,533
I intended to leave it on the table

233
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:22,766
for you to find yourself

234
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,433
But Xu Yinxi asked to borrow it the moment she arrived

235
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,266
Before I could refuse

236
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,633
you showed up and saw it

237
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,466
It made me think of a previous timeline...

238
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,433
where you didn't interact with Xu Yinxi

239
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,966
so you kept misunderstanding us...

240
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,133
getting blindly jealous

241
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,533
It eventually led to unpleasantness

242
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,333
and a bad ending

243
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,333
So this time I thought

244
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,433
if you interacted with her

245
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:51,866
it shouldn't be a bad thing

246
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:53,866
Yeah

247
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,233
This time

248
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,500
just go

249
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,233
When the date comes

250
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,233
you leave

251
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,566
So starting now

252
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,233
I just live a countdown with you

253
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,833
If you don't leave

254
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,866
isn't it still a countdown

255
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,733
Every time, the ending is the same

256
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,333
I've said it before

257
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,366
If I don't try

258
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,466
if I don't give it my all

259
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:16,966
how will I know if I'll fail

260
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,033
But the good thing is

261
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,766
I'm not a substitute

262
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:29,366
So before...

263
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,633
was I just jealous of myself

264
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,233
Then why did I travel here

265
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:44,833
Is it...

266
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,633
related to the rich heir and the assassin

267
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,666
And the necklace and the notebook

268
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,233
were also things you showed me on purpose

269
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,233
What connection do they have to me

270
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,666
Their story...

271
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,633
is there anything else you haven't told me

272
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,866
If I guessed correctly

273
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:10,833
they must be our past lives

274
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:18,566
I really only know

275
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:23,833
that much about the rich heir

276
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,166
Before, you used some unknown method to gather information

277
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,233
I followed your lead

278
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:27,666
and found some things

279
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,433
but not much

280
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,833
There is one thing

281
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,833
I haven't told you

282
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:35,900
Your arrival

283
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,233
is because of the assassin's obsession

284
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,633
Obsession

285
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,333
One time before, you told me

286
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,966
that the heir used blood as a catalyst

287
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:52,433
At the cost of vanishing from thousands of parallel universes

288
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,133
he cast a curse

289
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,633
As long as he died at the hands of the assassin

290
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:01,066
they would never see each other again in future lives

291
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,033
Which means

292
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,633
my timeline is destined not to have you

293
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,433
And your timeline

294
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:10,933
will not have me either

295
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,766
And the assassin's obsession was...

296
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,433
he wanted to see you one last time

297
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,733
Then you still want to chase me away

298
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,366
But I am not the assassin

299
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,633
I want you to live even more

300
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,066
I've said it

301
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,833
I can't be without you

302
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,533
Physically

303
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,366
psychologically

304
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,066
emotionally

305
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:43,766
and of course

306
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,833
physiologically

307
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:06,966
Chen Shi

308
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:10,233
No matter which world it is

309
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:13,566
I only have you left

310
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:17,933
Don't send me away

311
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:19,933
Promise me

312
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,133
Okay

313
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:32,566
Answer me first

314
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,133
I want a promise from you

315
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:37,866
Okay

316
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,433
I promise you

317
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,433
If we don't succeed this time

318
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,466
it will be the end for you

319
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,033
and the end for me

320
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,066
What's up

321
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,100
Did you wash up

322
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:31,466
Go wash up

323
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:46,966
You washed up and you're still this sleepy

324
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,033
Yeah

325
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:56,433
Here

326
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,366
Go sit over there and eat

327
00:25:58,733 --> 00:25:59,766
I'm holding a knife

328
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:00,766
Don't want to hurt you

329
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:04,633
I'd rather stand here and eat

330
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,533
Then behave

331
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,633
Keep your hands still

332
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,233
Stay away from the cutting board

333
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:11,166
Okay

334
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:19,233
Hey

335
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:20,633
Yeah

336
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,066
Before I crossed over

337
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:24,833
I was tracking a news story

338
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,533
and accidentally entered a watch shop

339
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:29,833
I met an old man there

340
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:31,333
Hmm

341
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:34,066
I didn't think much of it at first

342
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,266
Later

343
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,133
the day I came here

344
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,266
I heard his voice in my dream

345
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,066
and I woke up scared

346
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,366
Then suddenly I realized

347
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:47,233
before I came here

348
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,833
I had also heard his voice in a dream

349
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,733
And after being startled awake

350
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,033
I crossed over here

351
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:58,266
Because that old man spoke so cryptically

352
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,266
and was weird

353
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,333
I didn't take it to heart

354
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,166
I just assumed he was senile

355
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,733
But yesterday

356
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:12,866
I dreamt of him again

357
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:19,866
And

358
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:24,433
He...

359
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,433
He told me some things

360
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:36,166
You've come

361
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,166
It is you

362
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:40,066
I didn't expect you to still be so obstinate

363
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,833
This is the last chance for salvation

364
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,733
For both you and him

365
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:46,866
What do you mean

366
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,633
The ill-fated connection of your past lives...

367
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,333
when the fate ended, it should have ceased

368
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:53,266
The entanglement of this life...

369
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,866
once the debt is paid

370
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,100
and the karma cleared

371
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:57,866
it should have been enough

372
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,766
But due to my momentary oversight

373
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,866
I interfered with the causality

374
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:04,966
causing matters to become twisted

375
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,866
Alas

376
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:09,966
In the past life, I wandered the mortal realm

377
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,433
Because I received your offerings

378
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,233
I granted you a wish

379
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,066
But unexpectedly

380
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:19,133
it inadvertently fueled your curse

381
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,233
Ending up trapping me in this karma as well

382
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:23,966
I...

383
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:25,166
Listen to me

384
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,266
Your fortune was naturally thin

385
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:29,333
born with weak ties to your kin

386
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,466
frail and sickly

387
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,500
Fortunately, your kindness

388
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,633
accumulated blessings

389
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,933
that made up for your physical frailty

390
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:38,266
Originally, it was you who owed him

391
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,766
That cursed fate from the last life was yours to repay

392
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,166
But because of my intervention

393
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,266
it forcibly interrupted

394
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,533
the debt you hadn't finished paying

395
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:49,833
And an inherited curse is absolutely unsolvable

396
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,033
Yet he was obsessed with this

397
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:55,133
and forcefully wrested a brief time with you

398
00:28:56,966 --> 00:29:00,033
Instead, it doomed you both to a tragic end

399
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,066
I want to know

400
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,566
what exactly happened in the past life

401
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:04,633
Sigh

402
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:10,033
What is the point of agonizing over past causes and effects

403
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,633
It was merely stolen time

404
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,233
happiness obtained through deceit

405
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,033
It is destined not to last

406
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:19,533
But he didn't know when to stop

407
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,166
and revealed his hand

408
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,033
You, on the other hand, were unyielding

409
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,166
directly casting a curse

410
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,533
designing your death at his hands

411
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,966
Since the debt was not cleared

412
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:31,666
and his obsession was heavy

413
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:35,133
it dragged out the entanglement of your current lives

414
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,366
Then what should we do

415
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:39,666
to break this cycle

416
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,766
Oh right

417
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,866
I forgot to tell you

418
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:50,466
Now, if I leave you by more than 200 meters

419
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:51,833
I am no longer in spirit form

420
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,266
I have a solid body

421
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,266
It's just that I can't seem to feel my own heartbeat

422
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,333
But even without a heartbeat

423
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,766
my body is fine

424
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,633
However, when I get close to you again

425
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,666
I can feel my heartbeat

426
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,933
Don't worry

427
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,033
It was like this the previous times too

428
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:13,866
My guess is...

429
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:16,533
when your connection to this spacetime becomes strong

430
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,433
you start to develop a physical form

431
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,433
That's good

432
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,366
Made me worry for nothing

433
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:22,533
In that case

434
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:24,433
I don't have to keep sticking to you

435
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,533
Is sticking to me bad

436
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,666
Of course

437
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:29,266
Yeah

438
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,866
Avoids people saying

439
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,166
that I'm just reluctant to leave the good life here

440
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,633
or afraid that I can't survive

441
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,133
without you

442
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,366
or turn into a ghost again or whatever

443
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:38,333
Hey

444
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,633
Hey, stop that

445
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,066
Don't come over
