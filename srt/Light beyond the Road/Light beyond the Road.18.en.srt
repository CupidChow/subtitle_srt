(This folder is empty.)

8
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,450
Looking for something?

9
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
Are you looking

10
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,380
for the videos
of the girls you violated?

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,540
You watched them?

12
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,130
Yes.

13
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,890
The folder is empty.

14
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,100
Did you delete

15
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,980
or copy

16
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,820
the videos?

17
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,450
I deleted them.

18
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,540
I copied them, too.

19
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,220
Where are the videos?

20
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,890
Where are they?

21
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,380
Where did you put them?

22
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,500
I gave them to the police.

23
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,380
Even if you choke me to death,

24
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,500
you can't escape!

25
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,730
You really are...

26
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,570
You really are...

27
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,450
killing me.

28
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,580
That's great.

29
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,580
I know.

30
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,250
Okay, I'm on my way.

31
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,100
Alright.

32
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,980
Master.

33
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,020
Master.

34
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,490
Cut to the chase. I have good news.

35
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,660
I have to rush over.

36
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,220
Yours won't beat mine.

37
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,290
What is it?

38
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,800
Chuchu just called me.

39
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
She admitted that she had given
perjured testimony during the first trial.

40
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,980
She'll be here soon.

41
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,420
Really?

42
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,290
And you? What's your news?

43
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,170
Zhao Shuhui gave evidence
of Fan Jiancheng's crimes.

44
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,140
That's great, Master.

45
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,410
We can finally bring

46
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,340
this scumbag to justice.

47
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,490
Can't you be gentle?

48
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,100
Master.

49
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,050
Sibei.

50
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,540
I'll drop you off here.

51
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,020
I have to drive later.

52
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,650
Nianwen.

53
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,610
Don't give up your career

54
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,290
because of me.

55
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,220
Hello, Officer Lin?

56
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,340
Hello, Sibei?

57
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,780
I got good news.

58
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,780
There's new progress in your case.

59
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,540
I can't disclose

60
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,020
the details,

61
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,930
but your case

62
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,730
can be retried.

63
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,650
Thank you.

64
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,650
You're welcome.

65
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,250
Sibei.

66
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,810
What is it?

67
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,490
Officer Lin said

68
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,930
my case can be retried.

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,860
Really?

70
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,250
That's great.

71
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,730
That's great.

72
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,610
Then,

73
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,610
did the police find new evidence?

74
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,220
Maybe it was Chuchu.

75
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,290
Go on.

76
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,490
Alright. Sibei, I...

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,140
(Police)

78
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,930
That's what happened.

79
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,660
That's why I committed perjury and lied

80
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,460
in the first trial.

81
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
You can go home now.

82
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,610
Don't leave Nancheng for now.

83
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,030
(Guantian Police Station)

84
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,890
Chuchu.

85
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,980
Let me take you home.

86
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,220
No need.

87
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,140
I can go home by myself.

88
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
It's going to rain soon.

89
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,780
Take an umbrella.

90
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,730
Why are the police here again?

91
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,370
Just take it.

92
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,940
You're Tao Jie, right?

93
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,380
(Police)

94
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,370
We need your help with a case.

95
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,220
Come with us.

96
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,730
Hello, are you Ms. Ye Sibei?

97
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,460
Yes.

98
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,250
I'm the owner of Yazhi Boutique.

99
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,180
Mr. Qin

100
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,770
ordered a custom dress from us.

101
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,060
I'm delivering it now.

102
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,610
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

103
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,580
Please forgive me.

104
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,420
Thank you.

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,100
(Jinxiu Residential Area, Fuyang Street)

106
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,420
How about wearing a dress?

107
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,220
No.

108
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,180
Then promise me.

109
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,060
If we win today,

110
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,010
I'll buy you a dress.

111
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,530
(Linjiang City Intermediate People's Court)
April 2018.

112
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,250
The sexual assault case in Nancheng

113
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,850
finally entered a new trial.

114
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,100
Is it workplace assault

115
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,700
or a scandal of sex for favors?

116
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,060
Today, the court will give us an answer.

117
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,250
Since the case began,

118
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,220
(Feiyue News)
the story has kept having twists.

119
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,890
More and more netizens
joined the debate.

120
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,650
They cursed the victim,
then the accused.

121
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,300
It makes us wonder

122
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,180
whether public involvement

123
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,580
in private cases

124
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,890
causes deeper secondary harm
to those involved.

125
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,460
Sibei, you can do it.

126
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Don't be afraid, Sibei.

127
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,890

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,650
Sibei, you're the best.

132
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,820

133

We support you.

134
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,770
(You're the best.)
Ye Sibei, we'll always support you.

135
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,530
We support you.

136
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,420
- Good luck, Sibei.
- - Good luck, Sibei.

137
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,650
Good luck.

138

- You can win this.
- Good luck, Sibei.

139
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,100
Sibei.

140
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,530
You can do it.

141
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,530
Go, Sibei.

142
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,010
Go.

143
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,300
(I know who they are.)

144
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
(They were once victims)

145

(who had remained silent)

146
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,300
(as if they never existed.)

147
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,540
(Good Luck, Ye Sibei.)

149
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,580
Good luck, Sibei.

- Good luck.

154
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,340
I heard you're a lawyer again.

155
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,820
Congratulations.

156
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,850
Thank you.

157
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,130
I'll keep working hard

158
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,340
to become a good lawyer.

159
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,060
Ms. Ye.

160
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,130
Everyone has the right to defense,

161
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,850
but truth won't be buried

162
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,100
because of my defense.

163
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,460
I hope you understand.

164
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
I'm scared.

165
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,460
Because I left Ye Sibei in the car.

166
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,730
Suddenly, all the criticism online
turned toward me.

167
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,980
They tried to dig up

168
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,850
every flaw in my past,

169
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,980
constantly proving

170
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,010
that I'm a terrible person.

171
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
(Witness)
They said I left her on purpose.

172
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
(Prosecutor)
My clothes,

173
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,370
my behavior,

174
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,370
even my past relationships...

175
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,580
Everything about me

176
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,340
that didn't fit their "good girl" ideal

177
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,130
became their target.

178
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,220
During that period,

179
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,130
I fell into anxiety and depression.

180
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,490
I scrolled through the internet daily,

181
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,010
every day, again and again.

182
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,490
I desperately wanted to prove

183
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,580
that I was a good person.

184
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,490
I hoped they would stop cursing me,

185
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,010
so I lied in court.

186
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,340
But after that,

187
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,250
I lived each day in guilt and regret.

188
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,220
Standing here today,

189
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,490
I just want to prove

190
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,220
that the condom Ye Sibei had
was from me.

191
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,010
I asked her to keep it with her.

192
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,010
It had nothing to do with her.

193
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,140
(Judge)

194
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,250
I always thought

195
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,770
Fan Jiancheng

196
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,340
was a good father

197
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,940
and a good husband.

198
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,580
So when he made mistakes,

199
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,770
I instinctively stood up

200
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,010
to protect his image.

201
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,850
I even believed his wrongdoing

202
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,850
was just a moment of weakness.

203
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,340
But sadly,

204
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,490
I found more evidence.

205
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,010
As I discovered

206
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:43,370
more evidence that he hurt
other innocent women,

207
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,980
(Witness)
his image in my mind

208
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,770
completely collapsed.

209
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,010
He's also a father to a daughter.

210
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,460
How could he do such things?

211
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,220
I'm so disappointed.

212
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,580
I was too naive.

213
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,890
My protection of him

214
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,220
and everything I did for him

215
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,220
were all wrong.

216
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,220
If I don't stand up bravely,

217
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,220
more innocent women

218
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,130
will be hurt.

219
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,460
So...

220
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,850
So I must stop him.

221
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,770
I want to seek justice.

222
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,980
I want to protect the innocent.

223
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,770
I've submitted all the evidence

224
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,580
to the police.

225
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,010
I hope the court,

226
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,890
will show leniency

227
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,010
for my past mistakes

228
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,610
for the sake of my daughter.

229
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,460
Thank you.

230
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,500
(Defense Lawyer)

231
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,140
(Witness)

232
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,530
I'm a staff member
from Fuqiang Real Estate.

233
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,370
Tao Jie.

234
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,380
(Legal Representative)

235
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,770
I was also one of Fan Jiancheng's prey.

236
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,300
(Legal Representative)

237
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,730
When I first joined the company,

238
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,380
Mr. Fan was kind

239
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,220
and very caring toward me.

240
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,010
At first,

241
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,755
I thought he treated everyone like that.

242
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,490
So deep down,

243
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,490
I admired
such a superior like him greatly.

244
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,590
Until one gathering,

245
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,090
where he drank heavily,

246
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,490
crying as he told me

247
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,420
his life was miserable.

248
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,530
He was unhappy.

249
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,810
Seeing him drunk,

250
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,290
I offered to take him home.

251
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,530
He told me

252
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,250
to send him alone to a hotel
for one night.

253
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,220
I trusted him.

254
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,980
I thought I could leave that room,

255
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,530
but I never expected...

256
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,490
He strangled my neck,

257
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,380
pulled my hair,

258
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,620
and kept slamming my head
against the wall.

259
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,810
I cried and begged him.

260
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,650
I said...

261
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,010
I said, "Please let me go."

262
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,380
But he didn't seem to hear.

263
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,490
I thought I would die.

264
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,490
Then I realized...

265
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,660
I...

266
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,220
was completely wrong.

267
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,980
The next day, I ran away.

268
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,180
I thought of going to the police,

269
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,860
but I was too afraid.

270
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,860
(Defendant)
I couldn't even tell my parents.

271
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,220
(Defense Lawyer)
I couldn't explain

272
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,530
why I drank with him

273
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,330
and why I took

274
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,420
a drunk man to a hotel.

275
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,530
I couldn't understand it myself.

276
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,290
So I thought

277
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,220
I deserved it all.

278
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,250
After that incident,

279
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,660
he promoted me.

280
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,330
My salary doubled.

281
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,260
And

282
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,250
he treated me even better.

283
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,090
So I trusted him again.

284
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,530
(Legal Representative)

285
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,570
And I kept

286
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,330
an illicit relationship with him.

287
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,050
Until Ye Sibei's case happened,

288
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,980
I realized

289
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,860
his old habits had returned.

290
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,090
At first, I wanted to help him

291
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,250
cover things up.

292
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,570
But then I understood

293
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,810
I wasn't helping you.

294
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,860
I was hurting you!

295
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,220
You're adding insult to injury!

296
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,733
(Defense Lawyer)
Don't you feel shame?

297
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:04,220
You jerk.

298
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,290
(Judge)
Maintain courtroom order!

299
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,488
Your Honor, don't believe her!

300
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,530
We were just ordinary lovers.

301
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,220
Who said she liked me
and wanted to be with me forever?

302
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,810
Defendant, control your emotions.

303
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,090
Sorry.

304
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,460
(Defense Lawyer)

305
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,260
(Legal Representative)

306
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,290
Victim.

307
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,250
You insist it was not voluntary.

308
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,490
At first,

309
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,810
you had no private contact with him.

310
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,180
(Presiding Judge)
Can you tell me

311
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,420
why you first stayed silent,

312
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,290
then suddenly chose to accuse

313
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,250
after such a major trauma?

314
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,180
Why didn't you
report to the police at the start?

315
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
I had never faced such a thing.

316
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,980
My family told me

317
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:05,420
that the wound would reopen again

318
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,900
if I reported it.

319
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,180
I was afraid,

320
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,730
but it was normal.

321
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,290
Everyone fears the unknown.

322
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,380
I thought of giving up,

323
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,140
but a voice inside asked me,

324
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,660
"Is this really the end?

325
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,620
Can I really pretend nothing happened?"

326
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,420
The answer is no.

327
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,330
When I finally took that step,

328
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,180
I faced many hardships.

329
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,940
They were so heavy
that they could crush me.

330
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,220
But I did not give up,

331
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,380
nor did I fall.

332
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,010
Many people supported me

333
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,220
and encouraged me.

334
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,180
With their greatest kindness,

335
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,420
they protected and defended me.

336
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,180
All rise.

337
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,090
Linjiang Province Linjiang City
Intermediate People's Court's

338
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,940
(Presiding Judge)
criminal verdict.

339
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,420
The court believes

340
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,040
(Detention House of Linjiang)
(the original defendant,)

341
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:15,980
(Fan Jiancheng,)

342
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,180
(used violence and threats)

343
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,290
(and administered drugs,)

344
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,010
(forcing sexual relations
with the victim)

345
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,220
(against her will.)

346
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,940
(The facts are clear,)

347
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,330
(and the evidence is sufficient.)

348
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,570
(He shall be held criminally liable
for the crime of rape.)

349
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,620
(Presiding Judge)
Fan Jiancheng raped multiple victims,

350
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,420
which is a serious offense.

351
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,570
He should be severely punished.

352
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,940
To evade punishment, Fan Jiancheng

353
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,290
instructed his spouse,

354
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,420
Zhao Shuhui, a third party,

355
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,490
to conceal and forge evidence

356
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,900
during the first trial,

357
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,660
causing the first court
to declare him not guilty.

358
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,860
This shows he feels no remorse

359
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,570
for his criminal behavior.

360
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,420
His intent was extremely malicious.

361
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,400
His crime poses great danger to society.

362
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,860

case no. 201800335

defendant Fan Jiancheng

after being taken into custody,)

- I'll take it.

447

Making dumplings?

448
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:13,711
You're here.

449
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:14,940
Just make dumplings together.

450
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,730
Wash your hands and help.
Close the door.

451
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,570
What's the filling?

452
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,530
- Beef.
- Beef.

453
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,140
Nianwen, you mixed it?

454
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,860
- Must be good.
- Nice job, Nianwen.

455
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:25,155
- How is it?
- Smells good.

456
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,620
I'll hide 50 cent.

457
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,050
Let's see who gets it.

458
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,050
Qin Nan, did you find a house?

459
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,130
Yes.

460
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,090
We're both quite happy with it.

461
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,290
It's close to home.

462
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,460
The transport's convenient.

463
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,610
Okay.

464
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,330
When are you leaving?

465
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,570
After Chinese New Year.

466
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,290
Right after Chinese New Year?

467
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,860
That's too soon.

468
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,810
Can't bear to part?

469
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,940
Have you got your work
settled over there?

470
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,900
Don't worry. It's all arranged.

471
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,570
Once we settle in,

472
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,090
we'll invite you to visit.

473
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,090
Still opening a car repair shop?

474
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,130
Not sure yet.

475
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,300
I haven't decided.

476
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm still young anyway.

477
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,940
I can learn new things.

478
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,980
Yes.

479
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,090
That's good.

480
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,130
Good.

481
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,090
Good.

482
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,460
Leaving's a good thing.

483
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,900
If you ever miss them,

484
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,090
let Nianwen drive.

485
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,250
I can come pick you up too.

486
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,090
Yeah.

487
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,250
I won't go.

488
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,250
Who wants to visit anyway?

489
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,250
Mom, how's my dumpling?

490
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,860
- Yours...
- It's fine.

491
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,444
- You made it sit.
- There's improvement.

492
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,090
Too big.

493
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,530
- Wrapper's too thick.
- Too much meat.

494
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,380
Yours is sitting.

495
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,770
- Mine's...
- Look here.

496
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:47,220
Compared to ours...

497
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,900
Eat your own later.

498
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,250
Mine lies down nicely.

499
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,380
Mine's face down.

500
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:52,290
Looks good, right?

501
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,130
It's fine.

502
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,290
They'll all look good once cooked.

503
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,860
Yes, all that matters
is that they're edible.

504
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,700
Yes.

505
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,940
Mr. Chen, I just sent
my sister and brother-in-law off.

506
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,530
I'll meet the client soon.

507
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,490
Okay, don't worry.

508
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,000
I'll make sure to ask clearly. Okay.

509
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,170
Okay.

510
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,490
Dad, I'll be right back.

511
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm already at the entrance.

512

513
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,090
Long time no see.

514
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,460
Long time no see.

515
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,090
You...

516
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,659
How have you been?

517
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,533
Still driving
for a ride-hailing service lately?

518
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,370
Not anymore.

519
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,050
I'm back at the law firm.

520
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,770
I got a case today.

521
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,290
I'm meeting the client here.

522
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,860
Congratulations.

523
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,860
You're back to being a lawyer.

524
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,940
Congratulations to you, too.

525
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,220
You look like you're doing well.

526
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,620
My dad's waiting at home.

527
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,090
I'll head back now.

528
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,050
Okay.

529
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,180
Chuchu!

530
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,940
Chuchu!

531
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,860
Chuchu.

532
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,330
If you're free lately,

533
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,380
can we have a meal together?

534
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,770
Sure.

535
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,530
Mom, I'm leaving.

536
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,940
If anything happens there,

537
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,220
you must let me know.

538
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,010
Take good care of yourself.

539
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,930
Dad.

540
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,460
Mom.

541
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,380
Please take care of Sibei for me.

542
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,770
Alright.

543
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,290
Sibei can be stubborn.

544
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,460
Be patient with her.

545
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,860
Don't worry.

546
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,050
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

547
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,890
Nianwen.

548
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,130
We're leaving.

549
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,530
Dad.

550
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,370
We're leaving.

551
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,170
Go on.

552
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,460
Call us when you arrive.

553
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,940
Don't worry.

554
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,530
Dad, Mom, we're off.

555
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,140
Drive safe, Nan.

556
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,610
(My mom and I know)

557
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,940
(this departure marks my rebirth.)

558
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,820
(This life will never
be like the past again,)

559

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,610
(that cannot be explained,)

561
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,530
(binding me down.)

562
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,300
Why are you holding that photo?

563
00:34:58,177 --> 00:35:00,400
(Nancheng No.2 High School Year 1 Photo)
Just reminiscing.

564
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,970
Qin Nan.

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,300
Why is your repair shop called Xuehua?

566
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,900
Because your name is Ye Sibei.

567
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,130
I thought you must love snow.

568
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,210
Not me.

569
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,740
It's actually my mom.

570
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,780
She's a girl from the north.

571
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,050
It snowed when I was born.

572
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,780
It reminded her of home.

573
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,130
Do you like the north?

574
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,460
Not sure.

575
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,210
Maybe I'll go someday.

576
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,460
Come with me.

577
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,930
Sure.

578
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,130
Wherever you go from now on,

579
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,260
I'll be there with you.

580
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,420
(Qin Nan, Sibei, No Questions Asked.)

581
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,260
(All Road Ends, Light Beyond the Reed.)

582
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:44,980
(Qin Nan, Sibei, Light Beyond the Reed)

583
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,540
(Zhen Sea)

584
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,100
Nan.

585
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,530
Is that Sibei?

586
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,060
Sibei!

587
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,380
I'm back.

588
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,530
Sibei, I caught lots of fish for you

589
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,530
to make fish soup.

590
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,740
Nan, you and Sibei go home first.

591
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,820
I'll handle here.

592
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,780
You've been standing in the sun.

593
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,210
Why wait for me here?

594
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,300
It's fine.

595
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,570
I needed a walk anyway. Let's go.

596
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,410
Let's go.

597
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,300
Jun.

598
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,610
Come home to eat later.

599
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,260
Okay.

600
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,340
Sibei, you two go first.

601
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,610
Was today smooth?

602
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,650
Why are you home later than usual?

603
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,490
It went well.

604
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,900
Fishing moratorium's coming soon,

605
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,380
so I wanted to stock up more.

606
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,170
Don't. My hands smell like fish.

607
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,210
Hungry?

608
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,700
A little.

609
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,650
Food's ready for you.

610
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,300
It might be a bit cold now.

611
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,900
- I'll reheat them.
- It's fine.

612
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Is the shop busy today?

613
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,780
Pretty good. We had some regulars.

614
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,050
Tourist season's coming soon.

615
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,380
It'll only get better.

616
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,780
Then I'll come home earlier

617
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
to give you a hand.

618
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,420
Granny, have you eaten?

619
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,460
- I have.
- You have?

620
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,570
Granny's cooking smells so good.

621
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,860
Is this okay?

622
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,940
Good, one more shot.

623
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,210
Lemon tea for you two.

624
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,210
All our seafood is caught today.

625
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,420
Okay, I'll check.

626
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,444
Prepare the food faster.

627
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,010
Coming up.

628
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,050
Miss,

629
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,610
can I ask something?

630
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,260
We've been here for over a week.

631
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,340
Your food is especially delicious.

632
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,820
Thanks.

633
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,170
What's your secret?

634
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,340
Our seafood
is all caught fresh on the day.

635
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,300
My husband goes to sea himself.

636
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,820
- No wonder.
- Qin Nan?

637
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,170
Is Qin Nan the owner here?

638
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,210
Yes, my husband.

639
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:17,169
Enjoy your meal.

640
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,860
If you enjoy the food,
leave a good review.

641
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,940
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

642
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,420
There is no pain you can't overcome

643
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,170
and despair you can't endure, Ye Sibei.

644
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,460
May I take a look?

645
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,860
Is Ye Sibei a celebrity?

646
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,050
No.

647
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,820
- Heard of her?
- No.

648
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,980
Ye Sibei

649
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,860
is my wife.

650
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,210
So he uses your words
as his motto.

651
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,940
You two are so sweet.

652
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,860
So sweet.

653
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,050
How about this?

654
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,300
I'll take a photo for you.

655
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,650
I'll also help promote you.

656
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,570
- Sure.
- Okay.

657
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,740
Stand right here.

658
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,740
Take a few more for them.

659
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,420
One, two, three.

660
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,260
(Ordinary World)

661
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,490
Have you thought of a name for the baby?

662
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,050
What name do you like? I'll follow you.

663
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
Nuannuan.

664
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,340
Nuannuan?

665
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,130
She kicked me.

666
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,740
She must have heard it.

667
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,300
Nuannuan, did you hear me?

668
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,340
Nuannuan, keep going strong.

669
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,860
