4
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,490
But this...

5
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,820
It must be a mistake.

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,570
Whether there's a mistake or not,

7
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,930
we just have to investigate it.

8
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,570
I know Commissioner Wang.

9
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,330
Why don't I

10
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,980
call him and ask him about this?

11
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,044
If you don't cooperate with us,

12
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,710
we have no choice
but to summon you to cooperate with us.

13
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,260
I'll cooperate with you.

14
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,170
Of course, I will.

15
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,570
However,

16
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,780
I have

17
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,890
a few important documents to work on.

18
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,500
I must sign them.

19
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,340
It's all right.

20
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,570
It'll just take a bit of time.

21
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,340
Sure.

22
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,660
You are busy. We'll wait for you.

23
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,410
All right.

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,170
Thank you.

25
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,260
Please sit down.

26
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,130
We'll wait for you.

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,620
In that case,

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,660
suit yourselves.

29
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
Mr. Fan,

30
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,260
do you like panthers?

31
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:06,970
It's just an accessory.

32
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,660
An accessory.

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,500
Not bad.

34
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,580
(Law and Morals, Crimes and Punishment)

35
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,220
You have

36
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,340
so many books about law here.

37
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,100
You know the law.

38
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,540
Law is a weapon.

39
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,340
It's tough doing business.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,780
We need to use the law as a weapon

41
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,610
to protect ourselves,

42
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,380
right?

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,610
That's absolutely right.

44
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,666
We should all know the law.

45
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,290
We can only obey the law by knowing it.

46
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,290
Yes.

47
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:32,940
If all the common people like us

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,980
know, understand, and obey the law,

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,380
won't that make our jobs easier

50
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,610
as police officers?

51
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,780
Yes.

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,100
Fuqiang

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,980
is quite famous in Nancheng.

54
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,540
Our company

55
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,780
is just a small company

56
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,980
with only 30 people.

57
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,690
Tao Jie.

58
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,690
Mr. Fan.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,980
I just signed these few documents.

60
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,980
They are very important.

61
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,500
Deal with them immediately.

62
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,450
Yes.

63
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,250
Thank you.

64
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,140
All right.

65
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,050
You're done?

66
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,900
Let's go.

67
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,980
Let's go.

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,860
This way, please.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,820
Let's go.

70
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,220
Everything's fine.

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,020
Just complete your tasks.

72
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,836
- Sure.
- Sure.

73
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,060
Mom.

74
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,330
Where are you going?

75
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,580
I'm just going to take a stroll.

76
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,370
Have you heard?

77
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,100
Fuqiang Real Estate is in trouble.

78
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,580
I heard.

79
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,490
I also heard

80
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,170
their superior was taken away
by the police.

81
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,730
What? Did someone die?

82
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,410
Not really.

83
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,370
However, I heard

84
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,100
a woman

85
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,730
was...

86
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,410
What do you mean?

87
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,220
What else? It's that.

88
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,170
You are so stupid.

89
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,660
It's that thing.

90
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,980
I get it.

91
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,490
You should go back to the ward.

92
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,810
I'll go and find the doctor.

93
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,540
You're awake?

94
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,770
Sibei,

95
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,100
where were you?

96
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,220
I went downstairs to take a stroll.

97
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,330
Are you hungry?

98
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,660
Let me buy you some food.

99
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,370
It's fine. My mother sent me food.

100
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,250
You can go to work.

101
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,490
She went to see the doctor

102
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,340
and will be back soon.

103
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,500
All right.

104
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,780
I'll go to the shop.

105
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,100
Call me if you need anything.

106
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,850
Officer,

107
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,770
this...

108
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,650
I'm sure this isn't necessary.

109
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,940
Didn't you ask me
to assist in your investigation?

110
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,810
Why did you...

111
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,460
This is just a normal procedure.

112
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,370
On the night of 9th April,

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,577
a rape case happened
at the rapeseed flower field

114
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:44,422
on the outskirts.

115
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,770
The victim was Ye Sibei.

116
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,770
Did you do it?

117
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,370
Tell us honestly.

118
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,370
Ye Sibei?

119
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,820
Rape?

120
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,330
No.

121
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,060
Well...

122
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,370
I don't know about it.

123
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,220
You must have made a mistake.

124
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,980
Stop acting clueless.

125
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,220
Since we've summoned you here,

126
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,940
we must have required some evidence.

127
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,980
Officer,

128
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,530
what's your surname?

129
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,330
Lin.

130
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,730
Officer Lin,

131
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,300
I believe
there must be a mistake in this.

132
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,770
This is ridiculous.

133
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,490
I will never...

134
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,980
Why don't you

135
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,420
call Ye Sibei here?

136
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,980
I'll talk to her. How about that?

137
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,644
What's your relationship with Ye Sibei?

138
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,220
We are colleagues.

139
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,770
I thought Ye Sibei
had quite a difficult time.

140
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,490
Usually,

141
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,530
I would try to help her out
as much as I could.

142
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,890
I didn't expect
it would turn out this way.

143
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,820
What do you mean
she had quite a difficult time?

144
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,130
Ye Sibei

145
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,220
is unsociable.

146
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,577
She doesn't like to speak much.

147
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,220
Someone with her personality

148
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,300
isn't suitable

149
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,530
for our line of work.

150
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,610
I mean the work of a salesperson.

151
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,300
In the beginning,

152
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,060
the company did not plan to hire her.

153
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,650
When I saw her,

154
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,420
it felt like
the world was ending for her.

155
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,533
Out of kindness, I asked her

156
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,770
and she told me
she came from the provincial capital.

157
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,890
She couldn't find work here

158
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,300
and her family background is bad.

159
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,370
I was worried
that she might do something foolish,

160
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,220
so

161
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,300
I discussed with the company

162
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,610
and hired her.

163
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
After all, she's a university graduate.

164
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,370
What happened next?

165
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,980
She's a serious worker,

166
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,370
but she hasn't been

167
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,980
getting along well

168
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,610
with her colleagues.

169
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,900
Why?

170
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,250
After all,

171
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,730
it's because she's unsociable.

172
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,220
All her colleagues

173
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
think

174
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,730
she's from the provincial capital

175
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,300
and a university graduate,

176
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,980
so

177
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,460
she looks down on everyone.

178
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,580
Her department manager
told me many times

179
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,490
that she wanted to fire her.

180
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,370
I thought

181
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,220
Ye Sibei wasn't that kind of person.

182
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,250
Out of kindness,

183
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,060
I investigated in private.

184
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,850
In the end,
I realized that was the truth.

185
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,180
The main reason
was that she's too quiet.

186
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,850
So, I spoke

187
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,100
to everyone in her department

188
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,770
and finally settled this issue.

189
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,180
The doctor said you could be discharged.

190
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,250
You should get changed.

191
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,770
Every reading is normal.

192
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,130
Right?

193
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:40,822
Let's recuperate at home.

194
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,650
I heard Ye Sibei
wanted to apply for a loan.

195
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,300
You even made
a fake income statement for her.

196
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,770
This must be illegal.

197
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,300
Ye Sibei came to me and said

198
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,370
her younger brother
is getting married.

199
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,770
She wanted to buy a house,

200
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,770
but her family isn't well-off.

201
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,490
She wanted me
to make a fake proof of income.

202
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,488
I told her many times

203
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,155
that buying a house is a huge decision.

204
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:17,750
She should not do something
that exceeds her capabilities.

205
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,420
However,

206
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,180
she kept coming to me.

207
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,130
Out of kindness,

208
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,730
I helped her.

209
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,300
Why do you care about Ye Sibei so much?

210
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,250
Officer Lin,

211
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,180
do you think
there's something between us?

212
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,130
I don't blame you, actually.

213
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,980
Her husband also thought the same.

214
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,100
You may ask around the company.

215
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,850
I treat every employee of the company

216
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,250
the same.

217
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,490
Not just Ye Sibei.

218
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,180
I try my best to help

219
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,420
every employee of the company.

220
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,130
For example,

221
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,300
the dinner gathering that day.

222
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,980
The girls were drinking a lot,

223
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,370
and I did my best to stop them.

224
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,250
Women shouldn't

225
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,980
drink that much, right?

226
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,130
Two days ago, Ye Sibei

227
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,370
asked me for a day off,
and she was even absent from work.

228
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,730
I was quite angry back then

229
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,180
because we were very busy.

230
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,850
Later, she told me

231
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,300
she was not feeling well,

232
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,770
so I approved her day off.

233
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:29,900
(Turn Around While You Still Can)

234
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,490
Master,

235
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,180
why aren't we questioning him further?

236
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,770
Don't you think

237
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,300
his statement just now
was made up beforehand?

238
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,850
If he did do it,

239
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,533
he would've had a perfect lie for it.

240
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,090
Then...

241
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,980
We still can't let him off the hook.

242
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,733
I'm not saying
that we're letting him go.

243
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,300
We'll keep waiting.

244
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,610
What are we waiting for, Master?

245
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,730
Walk faster.

246
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
Wait.

247
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:21,850
You should wear this, as well.

248
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,770
You look good.

249
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,220
Mom, I can go back on my own.

250
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,650
I feel bad seeing you like this.

251
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,060
- Don't find me again.
- Sibei.

252
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,100
- I don't want to trouble you.
- What do you mean?

253
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,220
I'm not using this.

254
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,730
Sir, Jinxiu Residential Area.

255
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,890
What do you mean?

256
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,780
This child...

257
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,730
(Police)
What do you do

258
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,650
in Fuqiang Real Estate?

259
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,370
I am

260
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,130
the company's financial director.

261
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,730
Were you there at the gathering

262
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,570
on 9th April?

263
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,060
I was there at the gathering.

264
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,888
We invited
Mr. Zheng from Wanfu Properties

265
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:22,933
to have dinner that day.

266
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,770
They had a project

267
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,770
that our company
had wanted for a long time

268
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,220
so we prioritized the gathering.

269
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,940
So,

270
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,780
that day,

271
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,650
Mr. Fan called everyone

272
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,060
who was still at work to the gathering.

273
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,010
How much did you drink

274
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,490
that night?

275
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,890
On the night of the gathering,

276
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,650
I drank about

277
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,770
a quarter of a liter.

278
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,100
As an employee

279
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,610
of the sales department,

280
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,460
I have to drink

281
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
during gatherings.

282
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,340
However, that day,

283
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,100
we had Mr. Zheng,

284
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,220
who loved drinking,

285
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,940
so

286
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,010
all of us

287
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,850
who went had to drink

288
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,130
with him.

289
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,490
There was no choice.

290
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,850
Were you

291
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,890
in the car that night?

292
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,770
I was in the car that night.

293
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,490
What happened

294
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,770
inside the car?

295
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,460
All of us drank a lot

296
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,340
at the gathering that night.

297
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,340
However, Sibei was drunk.

298
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,610
I helped her get in the car.

299
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,610
However, she was already

300
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,490
talking drunk
before she got in the car.

301
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,460
What did she say?

302
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,650
She was upset

303
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,340
and wanted us to be good.

304
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,850
She wouldn't
say something like that usually.

305
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,460
Perhaps she was in a bad mood

306
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,100
so she drank a lot that day.

307
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,490
How do you see Fan Jiancheng?

308
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,890
Mr. Fan is very nice.

309
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:37,650
No matter which employee is in trouble,

310
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,010
he will also provide some help.

311
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,955
Previously, Ye Sibei
needed proof of income.

312
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,244
She wanted her income
to be higher in the statement.

313
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:45,644
Mr. Fan signed it for her
without saying anything.

314
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,850
In your memory,

315
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,100
how much

316
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,890
did Ye Sibei drink that night?

317
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,250
Ms. Ye probably drank

318
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,770
more than 10 glasses that night.

319
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,650
Do you remember
if Ye Sibei attended many gatherings

320
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,340
like the one on 9th April?

321
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,490
Not many.

322
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,309
She doesn't attend these gatherings much

323
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,400
and she is inexperienced
in these drinking gatherings.

324
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,090
She doesn't usually drink.

325
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,700
(Guoqiang: Sibei,
how did you suffer this?)

326
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,980
(Chen Xiaoyang: Sibei,
what will you do in the future?)

327
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,100
(Do your best and believe in yourself)

328
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,740
(Li Xiaojuan: How did this happen?
I pity you.)

329
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
(Wang: Sibei, I pity you.
You must stay strong.)

330
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,780
Sibei.

331
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,500
Have you eaten?

332
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,090
I made you some food.

333
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,050
No need, thank you.

334
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,050
I don't feel like eating.

335
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,090
All right.

336
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,250
The police
must be investigating the case today.

337
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,940
They questioned many people.

338
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,460
Everyone knows about it now.

339
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,060
What happened next?

340
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,050
Then, many people called me

341
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,620
and sent text messages to comfort me.

342
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,090
They asked me not to take it to heart

343
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,810
and said I was pitiful.

344
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,770
They asked me
what I would do in the future.

345
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,620
What does my future

346
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,120
have to do

347
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,420
with this?

348
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,733
What does it have to do
with your future?

349
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,250
It didn't at first.

350
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,420
Because of them,

351
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,660
it has something to do now.

352
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,090
However, they did it out of kindness.

353
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,170
I understand.

354
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:11,800
Let me bring you to a place.

355
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,900
Give me your hands.

356
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,620
Spread your fingers.

357
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,050
When I first finished high school,

358
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,500
I had a hard time.

359
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,220
My salary was low as well.

360
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,140
I faced many problems.

361
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:49,330
The seniors would always bully
new employees like me.

362
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,860
I was small

363
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,300
and thin.

364
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,010
I came back

365
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,266
and did 200 push-ups every day

366
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,770
to make myself stronger.

367
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:00,010
Later, I fell in love with boxing,

368
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,140
so I learned how to box

369
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,330
on the internet.

370
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,220
Pinch it.

371
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,060
See if it's tight.

372
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,740
It's tight.

373
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,780
Give me a right jab.

374
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,490
Remember.

375
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,860
When you do a right jab,

376
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,010
you don't just use your arms.

377
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,380
You generate power
with your waist and hips too.

378
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,730
Will I hurt you?

379
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,770
If you hurt me,

380
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,140
I'll buy you a meal.

381
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,050
Try it again.

382
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,020
Right jab.

383
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,090
Duck.

384
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,140
Left, right, duck.

385
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,810
Right, left, duck.

386
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,490
Left, right, duck.

387
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,140
Right, left, knee.

388
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,300
Right, left.

389
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,610
Left.

390
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,530
Are you exhausted?

391
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,980
It's my fault.

392
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,777
I forgot you just got discharged
from the hospital.

393
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,980
Sorry.

394
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,860
Are you tired?

395
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,980
Give me your hand.

396
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,250
Do you come here often to box?

397
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:34,500
I don't feel so annoyed

398
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,980
after moving around.

399
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,500
Do you regret not finishing high school?

400
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,555
There's nothing to regret about.

401
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,900
It'd only be a waste of money

402
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,000
if I had kept studying.

403
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,330
It'd be better to drop out and work

404
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,355
so I could make money.

405
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:50,480
Now, I'm living a good life,

406
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
and that's enough.

407
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,090
What else do you like?

408
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,140
I like to watch movies,

409
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,530
read novels,

410
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,890
and cook.

411
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,466
You're not lying to me, are you?

412
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,090
Ye Sibei,

413
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,330
you don't really
care about who you marry.

414
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,180
A guy who graduated from high school

415
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,090
with nothing

416
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,900
and only likes to drink and box.

417
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,900
Why do you want
to marry someone like that?

418
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,250
Aren't you the same?

419
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,700
I had no job.

420
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,660
I was introverted and looked ordinary.

421
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,929
I also had a younger brother.

422
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,459
I also asked for a high betrothal gift.

423
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,140
Why did you marry me?

424
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,380
You are a university graduate.

425
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,700
You are also the boss of a workshop.

426
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,090
Actually, I was excellent back then.

427
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:40,222
Unfortunately, you didn't see that.

428
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,330
I was the literary scholar
of our school.

429
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,700
Which high school were you in?

430
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,400
I was from the Seventh High School.

431
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,090
What a pity.

432
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,980
I was in the class of '06
from Second High School.

433
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,530
If you studied in my school,

434
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,090
I'm sure you'd heard my name before.

435
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,530
I was always
one of the top students in my year.

436
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,660
You're amazing.

437
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,800
Why didn't
a university graduate like you

438
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,700
stay in the provincial capital?

439
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:13,090
I couldn't survive, I guess.

440
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,377
There were many university graduates
who shared the same major as I.

441
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,660
When I finally
found a job that suited me,

442
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,090
my mother messed it up.

443
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,660
I rented a house
and got scammed by the agent.

444
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,810
I encountered
many unfortunate incidents.

445
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,730
I immediately felt

446
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,420
that even though
my parents were always scolding me

447
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,810
and asking me for money,

448
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,810
that was still my home after all.

449
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,260
When I came back,

450
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,066
I'd have a place to stay at least.

451
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
But after you came back,

452
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:43,420
your life didn't change for the better.

453
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,090
Yes.

454
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,620
I was always thinking about this.

455
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,290
If my parents treated me badly

456
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,900
or if Nianwen were a very bad child,

457
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,740
it would be better.

458
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,140
However, Nianwen will fight for me,

459
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,420
and my parents are worried about me.

460
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,050
They gave me a little bit of love,

461
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,660
but it isn't much.

462
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,660
They brought me back to this swamp

463
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,980
so I would sink slowly.

464
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,380
I drowned.

465
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,620
I cannot escape from it

466
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,330
even if I want to.

467
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,810
How so?

468
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,250
Walk out of this door,

469
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,380
go down the stairs,

470
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,220
get in the car,

471
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,730
and drive to the provincial capital.

472
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,410
Three hours on the highway.

473
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,290
It's not that simple.

474
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,900
It's that simple.

475
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:37,170
Do you want to leave?

476
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,540
Now?

477
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,220
Now.

478
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,700
How long have you

479
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:54,810
had your driving license?

480
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,290
Don't speak to me.

481
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,090
I'm nervous.

482
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,930
All right.

483
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,290
Should I drive instead?

484
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,050
No.

485
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,940
I want to drive.

486
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,530
You can drive,

487
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,460
but remember one thing.

488
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,620
What is it?

489
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,240
Driving on the highway at a speed
of less than 60 kilometers per hour

490
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:14,930
is illegal.

491
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,330
You're awake?

492
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,620
Enjoying the sea breeze alone?

493
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,444
Aren't we going
to the provincial capital?

494
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,980
Why are we here?

495
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,090
I think I took the wrong highway exit.

496
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,140
So, I decided to keep driving

497
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,700
without looking at the road signs

498
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,050
until I couldn't drive anymore

499
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,900
and stopped there.

500
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,090
You couldn't drive anymore?

501
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,860
It ran out of petrol.

502
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,180
I can fix the car if it is broken.

503
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,644
If the car ran out of petrol,

504
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,620
there's nothing I can do to help.

505
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:50,940
What should I do?

506
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,620
Find a petrol station.

507
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:55,930
Let's go.

508
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,380
You should fuel yourself.

509
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,940
Tell me about yourself
when you were a child.

510
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
It's boring.

511
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,700
I want to hear about it.

512
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,980
I don't remember my parents much.

513
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,730
They always worked outside

514
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,955
and didn't come home much.

515
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,330
I lived with my brother
and my grandfather.

516
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,660
My brother and I

517
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,330
are considered left-behind children.

518
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,700
The elder kids in the village
often bullied me.

519
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,533
My brother was the only one
who protected me.

520
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,940
As far as I can remember,

521
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,660
my brother always had
new injuries on his face.

522
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:49,900
The injuries never seemed to heal.

523
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,420
Back then, he always told me

524
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,980
life was very pointless.

525
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,700
I was still young

526
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:00,460
and didn't know how he felt
when he said those words.

527
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,060
Bei...

528
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,330
Stay away!

529
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,810
I'm scared.

530
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,940
Mom, can you not leave?

531
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,730
Mom.

532
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,970
I have to work in the city

533
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,311
so I can make enough money
to raise both of you.

534
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,010
Qin Bei,

535
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,900
take good care of your brother.

536
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,530
Dad, I'm leaving.

537
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,040
Mom, don't go!

538
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,120
Don't follow me.

539
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:45,688
Be a good boy at home.

540
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,770
Mom!

541
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,220
Mom!

542
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,660
Do you know how I overcame the days

543
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,660
when I got bullied?

544
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,380
If they made me upset,

545
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,770
I'd scold them.

546
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,250
When I feel like scolding someone,

547
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,490
you must advise me.

548
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,290
Why?

549
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,220
Advise me to give them an earful.

550
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:35,860
Why don't you

551
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,330
practice scolding at the sea?

552
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,010
Jerk!

553
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,140
You are too polite.

554
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,530
Jerk!

555
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,700
Scum!

556
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,090
So disgusting!

557
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,660
Not enough!

558
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,500
Continue!

559
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,490
Despicable! Shameless! Pervert!

560
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,810
Thick-faced!

561
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,090
Shameless!

562
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,290
Hooligan!

563
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,290
Pervert!

564
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,490
Jerk!

565
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,380
Scum!

566
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,290
Shameless!

567
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,140
Did I not show you any respect?

568
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,180
Jerk!

569
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,380
Scum!

570
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,370
Sibei,

571
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,700
when we win the court case,

572
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,620
let's sell our house in Nancheng

573
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,330
and live here.

574
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,140
Officers.

575
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,210
I've been in here for a long time.

576
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,610
When are you going to question me?

577
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,130
Look.

578
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,780
I fell asleep twice

579
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,300
and drank about eight cups of water.

580
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,900
I'm a good person.

581
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,210
I'm really a good person.

582
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,210
If you don't question me,

583
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,940
how do you know
if I'm a good or a bad person?

584
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,210
Quiet. Why are you making noise?

585
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:29,860
I'm not.

586
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,740
I've been staying here

587
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,130
without making any complaints.

588
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,820
However,
you made me stay here for so long

589
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,022
without questioning me.

590
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:36,311
Why are you keeping me here?

591
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:37,866
If you don't plan to question me,

592
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:39,666
just let me go home
and this will be over.

593
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,650
Why don't we go outside?

594
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,300
Let's have a chat outside, Officers!

595
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,210
Don't just write things down.

596
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,780
Say something.

597
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,620
Officers.

598
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Officers.

599
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,100
Quiet.

600
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:54,466
Whether you are a good person or not,

601
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,490
you can talk to Captain Zhang
when he's here.

602
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,530
Captain Zhang!

603
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,940
Captain Zhang, where are you?

604
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,090
Captain Zhang, show yourself.

605
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,530
You...

606
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,490
You brought me here.

607
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,900
Captain Zhang!

608
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,330
Quiet.

609
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,820
I can't!

610
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,380
(Jiangbian Hotel)

611
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,370
Sibei.

612
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,090
I'm downstairs.

613
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,490
If you are free,

614
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,940
let's have a chat.

615
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,700
Sibei.

616
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,610
I'm here to visit you.

617
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,090
I asked someone

618
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,900
to send me these from our hometown,

619
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,340
especially for you.

620
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,860
I don't know how you have been

621
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,460
after you left the company.

622
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,380
If you are in trouble,

623
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,260
you must tell me.

624
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,650
Here. Take them.

625
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,490
No need.

626
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,130
I'm sure you are not here for this.

627
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,690
We've been working together

628
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,090
for so long.

629
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,210
I'll be blunt.

630
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,780
Actually,

631
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,610
Mr. Fan is a decent guy

632
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,090
and he treated you well.

633
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,050
You might not know this.

634
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,610
When you first joined the company,

635
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,460
the HR department disagreed.

636
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,530
It was Mr. Fan who protected you.

637
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,370
Ms. Tao,

638
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,130
what are you trying to say?

639
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,620
It's nothing.

640
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,820
I don't know

641
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,090
what happened between you

642
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,010
and Mr. Fan.

643
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,260
However, I want to advise you

644
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,420
to forgive whenever you can.

645
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,530
Well,

646
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,900
everything can be settled in private.

647
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,610
There's no need

648
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,380
to put him in jail, right?

649
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,090
Moreover, if this blows up,

650
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,355
no one will benefit from this.

651
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,800
It looks bad for the company

652
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,690
and you'll be ashamed.

653
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,050
Even if you don't think about yourself,

654
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,740
you have to think about your parents.

655
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,090
If news of this were to spread,

656
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,490
how would people look at your husband?

657
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,100
Chuchu as well.

658
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,610
If you don't spare Mr. Fan,

659
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:01,977
do you think
she can still work for the company?

660
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,130
There's also your parents.

661
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,220
What else?

662
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,690
What else can you use to threaten me?

663
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,490
I'm saying this for your own good.

664
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,740
How am I threatening you?

665
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,690
Thank you.

666
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,460
I'm not close to you.

667
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,022
There's no need to be so nice to me.

668
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,130
Once a criminal case is opened,

669
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,088
I can't decide
whether the case can be dropped.

670
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,090
Don't come to me for this
again in the future.

671
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:25,930
It's no use.

672
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,780
Sibei.

673
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,090
Sibei.

674
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,820
I'm not leaving tonight.

675
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,930
Sure.

676
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,140
Where should I sleep?

677
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:18,130
If I sleep on the bed,
you might be nervous.

678
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
If I sleep on the floor,

679
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,460
you might overthink.

680
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,090
Where do you want to sleep?

681
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,900
I'll sleep on the floor.

682
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,980
Why?

683
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,380
I'm fine with sleeping on the floor.

684
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,650
I like to sleep on hard surfaces.

685
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,460
Qin Nan,

686
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,090
before we got married,

687
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,980
were you in a relationship before?

688
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,380
No.

689
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,900
Did you have someone you liked a lot?

690
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,460
I'm not sure if I liked her or not.

691
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,860
However, there's someone

692
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,820
whom I've hoped could live well.

693
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,780
I've never thought about being with her

694
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
but I've always hoped
for her to live a good life.

695
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,340
(Forensic Examination Report)

696
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,180
Master.

697
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,370
Master.

698
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,090
Here's the forensic examination report.

699
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:21,300
The skin tissue collected
from Ye Sibei's fingernails

700
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,260
matches Fan Jiancheng's DNA.

701
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,380
Fan Jiancheng thought
he could lie his way out.

702
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,900
Let's see what else he has to say now.

703
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,780
Thankfully, we applied
for extended custody in time.

704
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,620
Let's go.

705
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,700
We'll question him.

706
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,610
The biological sample
collected from Ye Sibei's body

707
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,300
matches your DNA.

708
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,300
Fan Jiancheng!

709
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,650
How do you explain this?

710
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,610
It's all my fault.

711
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,650
I couldn't hold back.

712
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,380
She wanted to have sex with me.

713
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,260
What?

714
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,460
She was the one
who wanted to have sex with me.

715
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,690
Ye Sibei wanted to have sex with you?

716
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,050
How?

717
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,980
Didn't I tell you before?

718
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:27,622
I said her husband had always thought

719
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:28,940
there was something between us.

720
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,780
There was really nothing at first.

721
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,420
That day,

722
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,650
after I sent Chuchu home,

723
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,900
I wanted to send her home.

724
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,460
On our way, she told me

725
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,780
she was not happy

726
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,090
and said her husband treated her badly.

727
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,610
She said she wanted

728
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,900
to go out with me

729
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,010
and get some fresh air.

730
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,940
So, I drove
to the rapeseed flower field.

731
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,650
When we were there,

732
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,050
she said she liked me.

733
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,210
Then, she had sex with me.

734
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,340
During the process,

735
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,860
was Ye Sibei drunk

736
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,090
or sober?

737
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,690
Of course, she was sober.

738
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,650
After that, she even asked me

739
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,210
for 100,000 yuan.

740
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,490
I was so angry

741
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,610
and wondered what it would be
if I had paid her.

742
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,010
I chased her out of the car

743
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,690
and drove away on my own.

744
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,260
I didn't expect her

745
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,090
to look for me the next day.

746
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,900
She said she would make a police report

747
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,860
if I didn't pay her.

748
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,380
I figured I didn't do anything wrong

749
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,010
so I wasn't afraid.

750
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,650
Later, she told me

751
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,130
she would not drop the case

752
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,460
if I didn't pay her.

753
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,260
After that, all of you came.

754
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,530
Why didn't you tell us before this?

755
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,980
Officer Lin,

756
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,420
both of us have our own families.

757
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,380
It is embarrassing

758
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,820
to say this.

759
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,090
I'm just trying to hide it
for as long as possible.

760
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:56,940
Right?

761
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,300
Fan Jiancheng,

762
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,900
we have solid evidence now.

763
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,610
Are you still denying this?

764
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,711
Have you even
told us one true statement?

765
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,422
Everything I said was true.

766
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:08,866
If you don't believe me, get her here,

767
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:10,244
and we can confront each other.
