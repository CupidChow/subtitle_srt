00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
=Episode 17=

5
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,333
Captain Zhang wants to talk to you.

6
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,330
Hello?

7
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,930
Were you planning
to kill Fan Jiancheng today?

8
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,740
Qin Nan's going to do it for you.

9
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,100
You need to tell me exactly

10
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,010
what you planned.

11
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,890
Where did he go?

12
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,620
Answer me.

13
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,730
Say something!

14
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,940
Ye Sibei, you listen to me.

15
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,450
That 20,000 yuan
you got back in your senior year

16
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,380
was from Qin Nan.

17
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,220
It was his father's death compensation.

18
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,220
It was meant for his own education.

19
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,170
He gave it to you.

20
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,730
He's already given you

21
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,660
half his life.

22
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,780
Are you going to let him throw away

23
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,060
the rest of it too?

24
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,220
Ye Sibei.

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,220
Talk to me.

26
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:39,500
Outskirts of the city.

27
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,890
An abandoned power plant
at the foot of Mount Suming.

28
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,340
I'm sending you the location.

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,940
Call Fan Jiancheng and tell him
not to go to the casino tonight.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,740
(Fan Jiancheng)

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,820
(Sibei)

32
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:02,620
I need to take this call.

33
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,060
Sibei.

34
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,500
What did you say?

35
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,890
I'm going there now!

36
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,130
What happened?

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,450
It's my brother-in-law.

38
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,890
He's going after Fan Jiancheng.

39
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,890
She asked me to stop him.

40
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,060
I'm coming with you.

41
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,620
Come on!

(Zhao Shuhui)

48
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,130
Hello?

49
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,410
This is Zhang Yong.

50
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,730
Captain Zhang.

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,410
Where's Fan Jiancheng?

52
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,410
I don't know where he is.

53
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,450
He's not home.

54
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:11,450
Listen to me.
He's not answering his phone.

55
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,060
If you know where he is,
tell me right now.

56
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,290
Your husband's in danger.

57
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,450
If you can reach him,

58
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,533
tell him to come home.

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,780
Okay.

60
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,100
I'll call him now.

61
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,340
I'll call him.

62
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,740
I'll call him.

63
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,020
(Zhao Shuhui)

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,060
(Zhao Shuhui)

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,380
Drive carefully.

66
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,060
(Sibei,)

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,460
(I want you to do well.)

68
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,900
(I want you to enjoy everything)

69
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,220
(that I never could,)

70
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,100
(and find the happiness I never found.)

71
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,610
(I was drowning in my own struggles)

72
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,460
(until something happened to you.)

73
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,860
(At first,)

74
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,170
(I thought it was duty,)

75
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,410
(or maybe the part of me)

76
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,020
(that couldn't accept
seeing you humiliated.)

77
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,100
(But little by little,)

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,930
(I started)

79
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,460
(to feel something deeper.)

80
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,170
(Maybe it was more than that.)

81
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,220
Sibei!

82
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,930
- (I've asked myself countless times)
- Sibei!

83
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,220
- (why I stayed by your side.)
- Sibei!

84
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,930
(Is it because you were a reflection)

85
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,660
(of the hope I still had for the world?)

86
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,570
(But)

87
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,980
(when you asked me...)

88
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,850
Could you really accept
what happened to me?

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,170
Could you really love me?

90
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,660
(That was when I realized,)

91
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,490
(from the moment I began
to accept your weakness,)

92
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,170
(to understand you,)

93
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,370
(to share a life with you,)

94
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,780
(to hear you yelling
on the back of my motorcycle,)

95
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,100
(to watch the city lights together,)

96
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:36,850
(you were no longer
just my faith or my cause.)

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,780
(You were a real person.)

98
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,140
(Someone I had poured
all my emotions into,)

99
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,100
(whether it was love,)

100
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,220
(or something beyond that.)

101
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,860
(Sibei,)

102
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,290
(most people think you're the weak one.)

103
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,370
(But the truth is,)

104
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,410
(the weak one was me.)

105
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,370
(I gave in to fate over and over again,)

106
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,140
(and accepted every future
it forced on me.)

107
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,980
(But you,)

108
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,810
(past)

109
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,020

(your soul never)

111
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,460
(bowed to it.)

112
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,290
(That's what I admired most,)

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,622
(and what I loved most about you.)

114
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,460
(So in this world,)

115
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,410
(your being alive)

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,580
(Life's better with you by my side.)
(means far more than mine.)

117
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,410
(From here on...)

118
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,260
(Life's better with you
by my side every day.)

119
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,810
(I hope you live happily,)

120
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,930
(with the world I could never have.)

121
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,890
(And lastly,)

I drugged her.

185

I thought she was weak and easy...

186
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,340
She was timid.

187
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,666
I thought she wouldn't report it.

188
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,690
You two...

189
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,250
You weren't even on good terms.

00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,060
And

191
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,130
you were short on money.

192
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,460
So I figured

193
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,370
even if she did report it,
nothing would happen.

194
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,730
Is that enough?

195
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,570
Is that enough now?

196
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,250
I was wrong...

197
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,130
Qin Nan...

198
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,970
I was wrong...

199
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,530
You deserve to die.

200
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,340
I don't deserve to die, Qin Nan!

201
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,130
Is this necessary?

202
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,060
All this for something so small?

203
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,340
I just

204
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,060
couldn't control myself!

205
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,130
Qin Nan,

206
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,130
calm down.

207
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,570
Please calm down.

208
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,130
Even an animal knows when to stop.

209
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
You're worse than an animal!

210
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,220
Yes, I'm worse than an animal.

211
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,730
I'm nothing.

212
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,370
Qin Nan...

213
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,220
I'll turn myself in.

214
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,580
I'll give you money.

215
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,460
I'll give you everything.

216
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,130
I have a wife and a kid.

217
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,580
They depend on me.

218
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,130
What a shame.

219
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,570
I don't.

220
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,180
Qin Nan!

221
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,940
Ye Sibei asked me

222
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,580
to pass a message to you.

223
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,060
She's

224
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,940
let it go.

225
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,580
That's what she wanted me to tell you.

226
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,940
She's let it go.

227
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,060
She's not holding onto it anymore.

228
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
I don't believe that.

229
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,580
I know her.

230
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,530
She can't let it go.

231
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,370
I went to Mr. Yang's house today.

232
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,460
I know everything about your past.

233
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:33,580
And I told Sibei everything you did

234
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,010
to help her.

235
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,530
Just give me a bit more time, all right?

236
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,530
The case is about to be reopened.

237
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,488
You'll win this time.

238
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,700
You don't need
to throw away the rest of your life.

239
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,130
You don't need to, Qin Nan.

240
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,420
Think about it.

241
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,940
Ye Sibei is still waiting for you.

242
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,010
If you go down this road,
what's she going to do?

243
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
Captain Zhang,

244
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,370
this is a turning point in her life.

245
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,370
Even without Qin Nan,

246
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,340
Ye Sibei will meet

247
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,810
other people.

248
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,010
But without justice,

249
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,050
she'll spend her whole life

250
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,530
doubting the world.

251
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,460
The law will give you both that justice!

252
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,530
I don't believe it!

253
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,220
How many years will he get?

254
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,050
How many?

255
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,900
Whatever he's sentenced to,

256
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,860
how could it ever compare
to what she has to carry for a lifetime?

257
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,090
You think killing him
will make things right?

258
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,930
Yes!

259
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,010
If heaven won't deliver justice,

260
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,420
then I will.

261
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,900
No, no, no!

262
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,180
Who asked you to?

263
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,330
Who asked you to!

264
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,300
Come here.

265
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,700
Qin Nan.

266
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,570
One assault

267
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,220
won't ruin my life.

268
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,140
One lost case,

269
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,140
one failure,

270
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,770
one insult...

271
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,010
None of it will ruin me.

272
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,860
The reason I was scared before,

273
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,570
the reason I cared so much,

274
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,660
was because deep down inside,

275
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,860
there was no voice
telling me I was enough.

276
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,660
I thought no one loved me.

277
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,290
I thought no one

278
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,330
had ever actually cared for me.

279
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,010
So I kept denying myself.

280
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,010
Until this happened.

281
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,330
Whenever something happened,

282
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,570
I couldn't face it.

283
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,090
But today, I finally realized,

284
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,860
that's not true.

285
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,570
It's that I didn't love myself enough.

286
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,090
I didn't know how precious I was,

287
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,010
and that's why I wanted
so badly to kill him.

288
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,730
But when I saw you risking everything,

289
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,900
I knew it wasn't worth it.

290
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,330
This won't ruin my life.

291
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,770
It's just a detour.

292
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,570
Qin Nan,

293
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,130
you,

294
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,300
me,

295
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,730
we can still have a good life together.

296
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,220
I still have you.

297
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,180
Qin Nan,

298
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,460
justice shouldn't come
at the cost of sacrifice.

299
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,570
If it requires losing you,

300
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,290
then it's not justice.

301
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,330
You've already given me half your life.

302
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,010
I can't take the rest of it, either.

303
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,140
I need you.

304
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,090
I need you to live your life with me.

305
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,860
Qin Nan,

306
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,090
we can change our fates.

307
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,730
Can we really

308
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,860
change our fate?

309
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,570
Yes, we can.

310
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,730
If we keep trying,

311
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,730
there's no fate that can't be changed.

312
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,860
Fate can change!

313
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,570
There's no suffering
that can't be overcome.

314
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,570
No despair that can't be conquered...

315
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,570
There's no suffering
that can't be overcome...

316
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,810
No despair that can't be conquered...

317
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,580
(Infusion Room)

318
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,700
(Emergency Department)

319
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,490
Ma'am, you can't go beyond this point.

320
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,730
Officer,

321
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,290
I'm Qin Nan's family.

322
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,620
I just want to bring him some food.

323
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,290
It's not allowed.

324
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,130
We have rules.

325
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,250
Look, it's really just food.

326
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,460
Nothing else.

327
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,490
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,620
You'll have to leave.

329
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:32,177
How about this?

330
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,050
I'll leave the food here,

331
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,250
and I'll go in

332
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,570
just to say one thing to him, all right?

333
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,570
We have rules.

334
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,570
No family visits during detention.

335
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,730
Please, make an exception.

336
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,050
Then can I at least stand at the door

337
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,810
and see him for a second?

338
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,490
Sorry. No.

339
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,050
Please cooperate with us.

340
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,490
Just one look, please, one look.

341
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,460
I just want to see him.

342
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,810
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,250
If I could, I'd let you in.

344
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,810
But I can't.

345
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,460
Ma'am!

346
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,180
Ma'am.

347
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,490
Please leave now.

348
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,700
If you keep this up,

349
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,180
we'll have to remove you by force.

350
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,860
Qin Nan!

351
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,490
Take care of yourself!

352
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,700
I'll take care of everything

353
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,180
and wait for you to come back!

354
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,940
Qin Nan!

355
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,460
I'll be waiting for you to come back!

356
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,730
Qin Nan!

357
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,510
(Guantian Police Station)

358
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,380
Sibei. Why didn't you go in?

359
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,220
Captain Zhang.

360
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,700
Officer Lin.

361
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,860
I'm here to ask about Qin Nan's case.

362
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,844
It's probably not convenient for me
to go inside.

363
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,180
I just wanted to ask
if you could find out

364
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,570
what's going to happen next.

365
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,180
He'll most likely be sentenced.

366
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,500
How bad is it?

367
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,660
Too soon to say.

368
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,810
The court needs to decide

369
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,860
based on the evidence

370
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,555
whether it's intentional murder

371
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,266
or intentional injury.

372
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,940
So, don't worry yet.

373
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,250
Be patient.

374
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,250
Once the results of Fan Jiancheng's

375
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,180
medical report are out,

376
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,460
the court will give a verdict.

377
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,220
Thank you.

378
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,860
Sibei,

379
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,860
this case has
its causes and consequences.

380
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,620
We're already tracing

381
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,155
the drug dealers' transaction records.

382
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,860
We'll find the evidence soon.

383
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,730
Your efforts won't be wasted.

384
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,530
You'll get justice this time.

385
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,380
Thank you.

386
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,050
Thank you for not giving up

387
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,380
on my case.

388
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,970
Thank you.

389
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,810
Sibei, please, don't.

390
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,860
It's what we should do.

391
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,800
Things will get better.

392
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,460
They will.

393
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,860
Then, I'll leave you to it.

394
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,700
I'll head off.

395
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:50,820
(Password Hint)

396
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,340
(Welcome)

397
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,860
(This folder is empty.)

398
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,500
(Hidden files)

399
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,140
(Work)

400
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,820
(Videos, Images)

401
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,260
(Videos)

402
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,980
(Copying to USB drive)

403
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,860
(Completed)

404
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,620
(If the verdict was fair, why did
Qin Nan risk his life for an apology?)

405
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,660
(Stay strong, Sibei. Your persistence
will bring light to this fight.)

406
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,440
(Hello, Ms. Ye. I'm a content creator.)

407
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,850
(We've been following your story.)

408
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,460
(Would you be open to an interview?
Contact: Ms. Chen.)

409
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,330
Hello.

410
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,090
Is this Ms. Chen, the content creator?

411
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,140
This is Ye Sibei.

412
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,620
I'll do the interview.

413
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,810
Slowly now.

414
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,700
That's great.
You don't even need help anymore.

415
00:28:39,044 --> 00:28:40,330
Put your hand on the table.

416
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,460
I'll take that.

417
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,180
Let's put this on, Mom.

418
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,380
Where's Qin Nan?

419
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,660
Mom,

420
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,180
Nan's car service

421
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,220
just got a big contract.

422
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,420
He's been

423
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,688
driving back and forth
between here and the provincial city.

424
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:10,620
Sometimes he gets stuck
working too late there,

425
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,900
so he doesn't come home.

426
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,380
What about

427
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,180
your accountant exams, Sibei?

428
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,010
I've decided not
to take the exam anymore.

429
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,250
I want to learn a trade instead.

430
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,900
That's good, too.

431
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Learn a skill first

432
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,180
and get a job.

433
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,140
You can always

434
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,220
take the exams later.

435
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,540
No rush.

436
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,620
Sibei, why don't you

437
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,380
stay here tonight?

438
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,620
Spend the night here.

439
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,090
Eat more shrimp. Here.

440
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,220
I'll peel one for you.

441
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,460
What?

442
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,090
You want to peel it yourself?

443
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,740
I'll do it, Mom.

444
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Let her.

445
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Good for her fingers.

446
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,860
- Peel it yourself.
- That's right.

447
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,330
I'll peel it for you.

448
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,822
Her fingers still aren't strong enough.

449
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:04,700
- Good.
- Use a bit of strength.

450
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,180
Here.

451
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
There you go.

452
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,755
You can peel shrimp on your own now.

453
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,900
You guys eat as well.

454
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,090
Sure. We'll watch you eat.

455
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,940
Good.

456
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
You did it yourself.

457
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,860
Wipe your hands.

458
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:29,900
Here.

459
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,740
All right.

460
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,220
I used to have

461
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:03,660
a really hard time
getting along with our parents.

462
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,250
Why?

463
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,460
Mostly because

464
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,980
I always tangled up the good and the bad

465
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,330
in them.

466
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,660
When they hurt me,

467
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,955
I'd think about
all the good things they'd done,

468
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,660
and then I couldn't say no to them.

469
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,980
But when they treated me well,

470
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,420
I'd remember the bad,

471
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,730
and I couldn't love them completely.

472
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,620
I loved and hated them
at the same time.

473
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,220
So every day I kept trying,

474
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,220
hoping that if I could
just accept their flaws,

475
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,940
they'd love me genuinely,

476
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,380
and become the kind of parents I wanted.

477
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,460
One day,

478
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,980
I finally understood.

479
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,420
I accepted that they had both good

480
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,180
and bad in them.

481
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,010
Those are two separate things.

482
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,380
They can exist in the same person,

483
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,730
but I can't confuse them.

484
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,220
When someone does wrong,
I should refuse it.

485
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,330
But the good in them

486
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,460
shouldn't be erased because of the bad.

487
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,220
By your logic,

488
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,940
are there even bad people in this world?

489
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,420
Someone becomes bad

490
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,620
not because they make a mistake,

491
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:44,220
but because they refuse to change
after making one.

492
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,300
Sibei,

493
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,570
do you hate Chuchu?

494
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,700
If not for her,

495
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,420
maybe Nan

496
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,330
wouldn't have...

497
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,460
Chuchu was never really a bad person.

498
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,140
The Chuchu I know

499
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,060
will turn back.

500
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,890
Chuchu,

501
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,660
Sibei's interview just went online.

502
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,090
Do you want to see it?

503
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,340
(Power, Confidence, Independent Thinking)

504
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,650
(Listening)
(Welcome to "Listening.")

505
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,170
(She was forced into it!)
(I'm your host, Chen Hui.)

506
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,780
(Support women standing up.)
(Let's welcome today's guest,)

507
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,400
(Desperate to stay in the spotlight.)
(Ye Sibei.)

508
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,090
Hello, Sibei.

509
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,380
Hello.

510
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,180
Hello, everyone.

511
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm Ye Sibei.

512
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,140
Sibei,

513
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,780
can you tell us

514
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,130
how you've been doing lately?

515
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
To be honest...

516
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,340
not very well.

517
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,570
Has your life changed much since then?

518
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,090
In many ways, yes.

519
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,050
My work

520
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:50,890
and my life

521
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,980
have changed drastically.

522
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,650
Can you tell us more about that?

523
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,130
After everything happened,

524
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,380
I went to the police.

525
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,740
But once I did,

526
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,340
my mother tried to stop me.

527
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,690
My brother stopped me.

528
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,570
Later, I gathered my courage
and called the police again.

529
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,960
I was threatened,

530
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,190
insulted

531
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,460
and mocked.

532
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,090
They questioned what I had done.

533
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,170
They ridiculed my husband.

534
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,170
They humiliated my family.

535
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,650
All of this was beyond my imagination.

536
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,300
(Shameless! Get lost!
Let's see your performance!)

537
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,460
(Have some shame!)

538
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,530
Sibei, you

539
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,650
seem

540
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,380
very calm now.

541
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,490
I know those netizens curse me

542
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,260
because I lost the case.

543
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
I can understand that.

544
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,690
(The goddess finally shows up!)
This outcome fell upon me.

545
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,900
(Heard her husband went to jail, too.)

546
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,860
It truly left me desperate.

547
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,420
I even had

548
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
the thought of taking revenge myself.

549
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,860
(Luckily, my husband stopped me.)

550
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,050
(I saw someone online ask,)

551
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,860
("Why did you drink that night?")

552
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,340
(It was a work occasion.)

553
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,420
(We were trying to close a deal.)

554
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,650
(Everyone drank with the client.)

555
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,820
(Before drinking,)

556
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,090
(did you consider your safety?)

557
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,090
I did consider it.

558
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,690
Then why did you drink?

559
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,740
Actually,
I understand everyone's doubts.

560
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
Perhaps it's easy

561
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,530
to judge right or wrong.

562
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,260
But we live in a society
of personal relationships.

563
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,090
In social occasions,

564
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,820
as an employee,

565
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,010
no one wants to be seen
as uncooperative.

566
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,260
Especially when the client,
the superior,

567
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,300
and colleagues are watching me.

568
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,460
I felt like I was undergoing
a test of obedience.

569
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,170
If I didn't obey,

570
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,130
I would defy my superior

571
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,210
and offend the client.

572
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,900
So,

573
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,170
I chose to obey.

574
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,380
(Have you ever gone out alone at night?)

575
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,340
(Yes.)

576
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,860
(Have you ever worn)

577
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,820
(what you thought
was a beautiful outfit)

578
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,420
(or a short skirt?)

579
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,340
(Of course.)

580
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,622
(Who doesn't love to look nice?)

581
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,130
(At that time,
did you think about safety?)

582
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,090
I don't quite understand.

583
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,420
We could teach girls to protect

584
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,980
themselves beforehand,

585
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,860
but instead, people blame the victim

586
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,650
only after the harm,

587
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,940
saying it's because of her own behavior.

588
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,780
You're right.

589
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,010
We should give victims

590
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,170
more support and encouragement,

591
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,380
so they can stand up

592
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,530
without burden

593
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,610
to identify the perpetrator.

594
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,420
The reason I am

595
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,740
sitting here for this interview today

596
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,570
is to tell, through your program,

597
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,420
those girls like me

598
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,490
who have experienced injustice,

599
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,530
I am not the first,

600
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,420
and probably not the last.

601
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,090
(I chose to report it.)

602
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,460
(It is a difficult path.)

603
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,900
(The reason it is hard)

604
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,210
(is that I hesitated at first.)

605
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,380
(If at the start)

606
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,740
(I had chosen to do drug tests,)

607
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,300
(blood tests, and other checks,)

608
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,490
(the results now
might be completely different.)

609
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,340
I hope everyone can be stronger than me,

610
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,860
braver than me,

611
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,740
and never give up pursuing justice.

612
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,980
Go Sibei!

613
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,570
(Your courage is unmatched!)
We support you!

614
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,170
Ye Sibei, we believe in you!

615
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,422
Keep fighting. We can win, Sibei!

616
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:34,610
We are always with you.

617
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,050
- Go Sibei!
- Go Sibei!

618
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,260
Thank you.

619
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,460
Thank you all.

620
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,249
(Brave, independent, confident,
uncompromising,)

621
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,500
(never giving up, never silent,
thoughtful, not blind following.)

622
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,220
(Believe in yourself!
Your potential is limitless!)

623
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,340
Hello?

624
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,130
Officer Lin, this is Chuchu.

625
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,490

626
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:34,980
