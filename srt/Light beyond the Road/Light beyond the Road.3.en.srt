4
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,410
Good morning, Ms. Wang.

5
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,250
Good morning.

6
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,380
Good morning, Ms. Wang.

7
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
Good morning.

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,860
Want one?

9
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,100
Thanks.

10
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,940
This is really good.

11
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,711
What is the meaning of this?

12
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,290
You didn't do any of it?

13
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Did you leave after I left yesterday?

14
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,380
I'm asking you a question.

15
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,780
Speak.

16
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,010
You're just ripping the paper!

17
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,400
Let's see you rip it now!

18
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,450
Ms. Wang,

19
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,410
what happened?

20
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,260
Speak nicely.

21
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,100
Shut up!

22
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:05,332
You won't say it, right?

23
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,690
All right, come.

24
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,530
Come with me.

25
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,940
Come with me!

26
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,010
Ms. Wang.

27
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,890
Come with me!

28
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,130
Did you try to set me up?

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,340
I didn't.

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,820
You didn't, but you didn't do your work.

31
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:28,940
If you didn't want to do it,

32
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,177
you shouldn't have agreed!

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,820
You agreed to do it for me
but you didn't!

34
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,340
Who works like you?

35
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,288
How can you still call yourself
a human being?

36
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,060
Do you know

37
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,290
that these forms
are used to apply for loans?

38
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,450
They must
be submitted to the bank today.

39
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,130
When Ms. Tao asks about it

40
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,660
and the company
can't get the loan approved today,

41
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,980
can you take responsibility?

42
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,540
You've caused all of us trouble.

43
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,980
I'm in a mess because of you too.

44
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,660
Tell me. What will you do today?

45
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:56,995
Anyway, I won't take the blame for this.

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,780
Why are you keeping quiet?

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,100
Why are you keeping quiet?

48
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,060
Do you think you are helping me?

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,511
Do you think you can solve the problem
by staying silent?

50
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,170
Did I force you to do that?

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,060
Did I force you to agree?

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,050
Did I force you to do the task for me?

53
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,900
Ye Sibei,

54
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,220
do you really think

55
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,370
you don't need to work anymore

56
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,266
because you went drinking
with Mr. Fan once?

57
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,484
I was wondering why
you weren't in your work clothes today.

58
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,580
I was wondering
why you had been acting tough today.

59
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,540
I heard

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,170
you had fun

61
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,170
drinking with Mr. Zheng a few days ago.

62
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,980
You were sharing drinks together.

63
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,290
Do you think you've found
someone to support you?

64
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,460
I'm warning you.

65
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,780
As long as you are an employee here,
you must work for Fuqiang.

66
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,340
Get out and apologize

67
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,540
to Ms. Tao immediately.

68
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,100
Otherwise, leave the company!

69
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,580
I dare you
to find Mr. Zheng to support you.

70
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,340
You're even crying crocodile tears?

71
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,810
What? Do you feel aggrieved?

72
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,930
Was I wrong to scold you?

73
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,290
Does your husband know about this?

74
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,490
He doesn't?

75
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,980
Why don't I help you tell him instead?

76
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,580
Why should I apologize?

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,290
Because I'm an easy target?

78
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,140
Do you think I'm weak?

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,100
Are you trying to rebel?

80
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,410
Ye Sibei, how dare you hit me!

81
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,410
How dare you!

82
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,660
You hit me?

83
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,100
I'll beat you to death!

84
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,810
Wang Lin, what are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

85
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,050
You're so shameless! Get away!

86
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:00,050
You're exactly
the type of shameless person!

87
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,290
I dare you to hit her again!

88
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,490
I dare you!

89
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,930
What are you doing?

90
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,370
What are you staring at?

91
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,580
- Lin! Lin, speak nicely.
- Why are you pulling me away?

92
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,610
Try hitting me again!

93
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,700
Stop!

94
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,660
What are you doing?

95
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,780
- I dare you to hit me again!
- Don't point at me! Try touching me again!

96
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,610
Let's speak nicely!

97
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,580
Call the police!

98
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,900
- That's enough.
- Those outside!

99
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,380
That's enough.

100
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,740
Speak nicely.

101
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,250
Hello.

102
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,700
Hello, Nan.

103
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,540
Can you

104
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,088
come to the Guantian Police Station now?

105
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,900
Sibei fought with someone.

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,422
They are trying to settle things now.

107
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:41,155
The other person's husband is also here.
I'm afraid that we are at a disadvantage.

108
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:41,810
Do you...

109
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,888
I'll head over immediately.

110
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,540
(Mediator)
Officer, she hit me first.

111
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,290
(Involved Party)
Shouldn't she compensate me?

112
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,220
Shouldn't she apologize to me?

113
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,850
Are you the only loud person here?

114
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,370
You're so loud like a roe deer.

115
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,490
- What did you say?
- You want Sibei to apologize?

116
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,140
Everyone knows Sibei's character.

117
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,050
How could she hit you?

118
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,460
This is none of your business.

119
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,140
Can't she speak?

120
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,980
- Is she mute?
- Who are you?

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,460
Apologize to you?

122
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,155
Both of you are the ones
who should apologize.

123
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,610
If you don't give us
an explanation today...

124
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,610
Stop arguing!

125
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,490
Quiet!

126
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,060
(Guantian Police Station)

127
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:13,580
Ye Sibei's family member is here.

128
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,930
Sibei, I was afraid
that we would be at a disadvantage

129
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,466
since Wang Lin called her husband here,

130
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:21,644
so I called Nan as well.

131
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,250
Sorry. A client's waiting for me.

132
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,140
I must go.

133
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,490
Nan, I'll leave her to you.

134
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,250
What happened?

135
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,850
What do you mean?

136
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,980
You called for backup?

137
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,850
Is this a gang fight?

138
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,610
Come on. Hit me right here.

139
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,460
Come on. Hit me!

140
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,780
Wang Lin, calm down.

141
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,060
Did she hit you?

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,330
Yes.

143
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,220
No. She didn't hit me.

144
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,450
She hit my wife.

145
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,410
Look at my face.
It's swollen because she hit me.

146
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:57,133
Since the family members are here,

147
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,333
sit down and settle this.

148
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,500
Sit down.

149
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,050
What do both of you want now?

150
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,410
Do you want to settle this or not?

151
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,850
We can settle this.

152
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,580
But look at her attitude!

153
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,980
We are fine
with not getting any compensation

154
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,930
but she must at least apologize to me.

155
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,770
How much?

156
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,220
(Involved Party)

157
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,060
1,000 yuan.

158
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,010
Sorry.

159
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,220
Sorry. Can you forgive me?

160
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,340
Don't let him pay.

161
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,340
Do you agree? If you agree,

162
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,820
sign the mediation agreement.

163
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,210
Fine. Forget it.

164
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,133
Since both sides
have agreed to settle this,

165
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,280
sign the form.

166
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,911
I'll forget about it this time.

167
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,320
Here.

168
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,300
Sign here.

169
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,260
(Involved Party Signature)

170
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,490
Why did you fight?

171
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,650
Excuse me, may I ask

172
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,610
why they fought?

173
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:23,680
It was because of overtime work.

174
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:25,820
Ms. Ye agreed
to help Ms. Wang work overtime

175
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,210
but she didn't do it.

176
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,822
So, both of them had an argument.

177
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,333
Is she the one who has been
asking you to work overtime?

178
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,460
That's not right.

179
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,730
What do you mean by
keep asking her to work overtime?

180
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,290
She did it willingly.

181
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,940
Willingly.

182
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,010
Did you agree to it?

183
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,622
Forget it. I've already apologized.

184
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,180
No.

185
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,770
Officer, look at his attitude.

186
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,610
Apologize to her.

187
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,370
What did you say?

188
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,220
I'm asking you to apologize to her.

189
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,220
I'm not apologizing.

190
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,340
Why should I apologize to her?

191
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,369
What a joke this is.

192
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,133
You're asking her
to work overtime all the time.

193
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:11,800
She refused you.

194
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,300
Why are you causing her trouble then?

195
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,220
Besides, regardless of

196
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,010
who started the fight,

197
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,300
she still got hurt, right?

198
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,770
You caused the trouble
and beat her up in this state.

199
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,490
I want you to apologize to her now!

200
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,890
I'm not apologizing! So what?

201
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,770
- Are you trying to scare me?
- Try it!

202
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,260
Stop shouting!

203
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,490
What are you doing?

204
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,730
Quiet!

205
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,570
Sit down!

206
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,570
Sorry.

207
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,530
All right.

208
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,850
We've apologized now.

209
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,850
All right. Wang Lin has apologized now.

210
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,220
If you agree to settle,

211
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,490
let's sign another agreement.

212
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,730
Here you go.

213
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,777
It must be tough on you.

214
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:03,370
Over here.

215
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,260
Sign it.

216
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,420
(Involved Party's Opinion:
Agree to mediate)

217
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:25,060
(Involved Party's Signature: Ye Sibei)

218
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,900
(Guantian Police Station)

219
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,850
Sorry.

220
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:51,088
I made you come all the way here.

221
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,690
Ye Sibei,

222
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:57,244
don't apologize
if you didn't do anything wrong

223
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,940
in the future.

224
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,850
Let me send you home.

225
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,770
No need.

226
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,940
I need to return to the office.

227
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,490
Let me send you back to the office.

228
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,180
I can go back on my own.

229
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,530
Dad called me today.

230
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
He said

231
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,220
his birthday is in two days

232
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,066
and asked us to visit him together.

233
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,220
Find an excuse to reject him.

234
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,288
I promised him we'll go.

235
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,340
I'll find the right time
to tell them everything.

236
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,850
When you are free,

237
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,888
you may come home
to get the divorce agreement.

238
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,730
I've signed it.

239
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,530
I'll be leaving then.

240
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,420
Talk to her.

241
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,220
I've been in the company for so long

242
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,100
and I've never felt so aggrieved.

243
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,770
That's enough.

244
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,850
This car is using
the tires you asked about.

245
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,430
Sibei.

246
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,555
Get in.
Let me take you back to the office.

247
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,300
Hurry up. I can't park here.

248
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,490
Sibei,

249
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,770
are you

250
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,300
having any troubles at home?

251
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,530
If you have any trouble,
you need to tell me.

252
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,422
I'll try to help you out
as much as possible.

253
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,780
It's nothing.

254
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,770
I was thinking about this.

255
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,530
With your personality,

256
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,890
you wouldn't have hit someone,

257
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,730
right?

258
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,010
Wang Lin

259
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,250
was too agitated.

260
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,420
She insisted that the company

261
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,530
deal with this strictly.

262
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,580
Deal with what?

263
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,940
It's nothing.

264
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,770
However, I mean

265
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,300
you should take a break at home
for a few days.

266
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,133
Mainly, it's to give me some time

267
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,377
to comfort her.

268
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,530
Mr. Fan,

269
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,866
I think I didn't do anything wrong
in this incident.

270
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
This has nothing to do
with being right or wrong.

271
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,420
In that case,

272
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,820
why am I being punished?

273
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,650
This is not really a punishment.

274
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,650
She gets off work
at five in the evening every day

275
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,420
and hands her work to me.

276
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,600
I've been working overtime
every day because of her.

277
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:43,000
I didn't want to work overtime
because I had something to do,

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,933
yet she wouldn't listen.

279
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,530
Today, the report was not done in time

280
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,300
and she dragged me into a room
and scolded me in public.

281
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,130
Don't you think that was too much?

282
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,650
Shouldn't she be punished?

283
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,180
This isn't a reason for you to hit her.

284
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,060
Didn't she hit me as well?

285
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:01,940
What punishment will she receive?

286
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,010
Or are you just punishing me alone?

287
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,130
You were the one who hit her first.

288
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,970
Yes.

289
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,060
I did hit her first.

290
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,350
However, you ignored the fact
that she asked me to work overtime

291
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:15,933
every day.

292
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,010
You ignored the fact
that she scolded me.

293
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,650
You ignored the fact that she hit me.

294
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,580
So why is the company
suddenly interfering

295
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,700
after I hit her?

296
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,180
What's this kind of attitude?

297
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,060
Look at you.

298
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,650
What's wrong, Sibei?

299
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,290
What's wrong, Sibei?

300
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:16,488
Was I the one who asked

301
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,311
to get out of the car
on the day of the gathering?

302
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,370
Yes.

303
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,180
Didn't you ask me about it?

304
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,050
What's wrong?

305
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,530
Let go of me!

306
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,940
(Let go of me!)

307
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,260
What are you doing?

308
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,890
What are you doing?

309
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,660
It's not too far away.

310
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,770
I want to take a walk alone.

311
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,500
Sure. I'll unlock it for you.

312
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,570
Be careful.

313
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,100
(Money)

314
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,460
(Money)

315
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,140
Ye Sibei.

316
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,250
Mr. Fan is asking you
to go to his office.

317
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,420
(Everything)

318
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,060
(Your dream home begins here.)

319
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,810
Mr. Fan, are you looking for me?

320
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,650
Sibei, you're here.

321
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,890
Sit down.

322
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,380
You fought Wang Lin today

323
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,250
and affected the company badly.

324
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,180
Fuqiang is a legitimate company.

325
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,290
If we allow our employees
to beat up others

326
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,810
without taking action,

327
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,140
we'll become a hooligan company.

328
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,290
I hired you.

329
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,250
Back then, I thought

330
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,770
you were

331
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,180
a smart and capable

332
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,250
university graduate

333
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:40,260
who was obedient.

334
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,900
All right.

335
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,700
That's it.

336
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,770
Go back and take a few days' break.

337
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,140
Calm yourself down.

338
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,660
You don't have to come to work for now.

339
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,570
Nan.

340
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,610
Chuchu?

341
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,930
Why are you here?

342
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,290
Do you have time?

343
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,622
I want to have a chat with you.

344
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:22,890
Enjoy.

345
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:26,088
What do you want to talk about?

346
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,090
Sibei...

347
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,290
She was sacked today.

348
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,530
She has not been doing well recently.

349
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,620
I've heard a little

350
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,288
about what's going on between you two.

351
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,600
It's not easy
for two people to be together.

352
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,530
After you get married,

353
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:49,090
you should manage your marriage.

354
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,220
Are you here as a lobbyist?

355
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,610
No need.

356
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,330
I've thought it through.

357
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:00,066
Forget about it
if that's all you're going to say.

358
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,980
Nan,

359
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,490
Sibei is a very nice person.

360
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,050
When I was in high school,
I liked to make up.

361
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,290
I was bullied by other people in school.

362
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,290
She and Nianwen
came to help me at my school.

363
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,490
Back then,

364
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,700
I had bad results

365
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,540
and I was foolish.

366
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:26,330
Everyone thought I was from
the school of hard knocks.

367
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,044
I would surely
mess up my life in the future.

368
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,090
However, she told me

369
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,800
that a person would not
mess up in life at a certain moment.

370
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:34,290
If I were willing to do it,

371
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,730
I could study,

372
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,730
so I admired her at that time.

373
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,860
I thought she was amazing.

374
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,810
When I was in high school,

375
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,810
her mother asked her to work

376
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,980
so Ye Nianwen could study.

377
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,460
She got an aid from the school
to complete her high school studies.

378
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,050
Later, she went to university

379
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,050
for four years

380
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,000
and didn't ask for any money
from her family.

381
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,620
After she graduated,

382
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
she tried to find a job
in the provincial city.

383
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:01,530
She did everything she could there

384
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:03,860
and was finally brought back here
by her mother.

385
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
This little city

386
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,530
doesn't have many good jobs.

387
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,860
She was 23 years old when she came back.

388
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,900
Her parents wanted her
to become a civil servant.

389
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,530
However, that was when

390
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,860
Sibei started changing gradually.

391
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:21,290
When I first went to her house,

392
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,810
I would always hear them arguing.

393
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,000
They would complain about her

394
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,980
not getting a good job
despite being a university graduate

395
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,090
and how she couldn't find a boyfriend
until now.

396
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,330
They even forced her
to go on blind dates.

397
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,810
They said she was too arrogant

398
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,530
and wasted her university studies.

399
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,330
I felt bad as well when I heard that.

400
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,810
It was as if all her hard work in life

401
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,090
was meaningless.

402
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,050
I've been thinking about it many times.

403
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,140
If I were in her shoes,

404
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,980
I probably
wouldn't make it into university.

405
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,220
So, Sibei has done a lot

406
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,730
to reach this stage.

407
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,300
Nan,

408
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,490
Sibei isn't

409
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,770
what she looks like now.

410
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,490
She is only at her lowest point in life.

411
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,844
She needs someone to support her.

412
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,290
If you give her a boost, you'll...

413
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,130
I'm done.

414
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,010
Do you have anything else to say?

415
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,050
Qin Nan.

416
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,050
Do you really have
no feelings for her at all?

417
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,422
When you hear all these,
don't you feel like pitying her

418
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:20,700
and helping her?

419
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,140
Everyone has their own difficulties.

420
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,220
I told her countless times

421
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,380
to live her life well.

422
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,860
However, she gave up on her life first.

423
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,140
Who else can help her?

424
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,010
What do you mean
by giving up on her own life?

425
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,570
She would choose
every hairband seriously,

426
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,140
use different cups
for drinking water and tea,

427
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,180
and even when she was drunk,

428
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,040
she told me

429
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,290
she wanted to live her life with you.

430
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,940
No one who is trying to give up on life

431
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,530
will do all these things.

432
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,622
Qin Nan, have you really
tried understanding her?

433
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,770
She isn't giving up.

434
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,380
She had too much burden

435
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,177
and she struggled,
but you didn't see that.

436
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,290
Did you think she was a coward

437
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,330
at the police station today?

438
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,220
Yes. You are not a coward.

439
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,444
You vented your frustration.

440
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,490
However, she was fired by her company.

441
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
You thought
she didn't handle things well,

442
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,700
but if you were in her shoes one day,

443
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,090
do you think you'd do better than her?

444
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,421
(Everything I Never Told You)

445
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,780
(In our lives, we must find ourselves
and escape other people's expectations)

446
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,460
(We are alone,)

447
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,420
(brave,)

448
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,380
(angry,)

449
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,530
(bright,)

450
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,620
(never wavering.)

451
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,090
We fight,

452
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,010
we work hard,

453
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,290
and we resist,

454
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,490
to overcome the darkest moments.

455
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,220
The bright future
is within touching distance.

456
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,330
There are no difficulties
that cannot be overcome.

457
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,810
There's no despair that won't pass.

458
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,090
Don't lose every step of confidence

459
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,700
and abandon every dream.

460
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,290
Your firm belief
is always in your hands.

461
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,770
The most wonderful moment
will always be found in the future.

462
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,220
I am Ye Sibei from Year 1 Class 7.

463
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,090
I will never give up

464
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,290

really be changed?

Well,

00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,220
you spoke well today.

It's possible.

Qin!

483
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,540
Open the door for me.

484
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,090
All right. I'm in.

485
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,050
Shut the door.

486
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,490
Why are you here at midnight?

487
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:02,980
You were asleep, right?

488
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,220
Sorry.

489
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,330
I've disturbed your sleep.

490
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,090
This is urgent.

491
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,220
What is it?

492
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,330
I found the video.

493
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,740
You must

494
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,460
help me confirm it.

495
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,290
Let me show you.

496
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,220
Just take a look, that's all.

497
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,810
Don't tell anyone about it.

498
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,111
I'm not watching then. Go back.

499
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:25,066
Why are you behaving like this?

500
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:27,730
You're here at midnight
because you want me to identify the car.

501
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,980
Yes.

502
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,010
I trust you.

503
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,290
I trust you, all right?

504
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,130
Show me.

505
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,290
Seriously.

506
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,810
What's that

507
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,650
attitude of yours?

508
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,010
Every second counts in an investigation.

509
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,850
I'm sure you know.

510
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,010
I must find evidence quickly

511
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,770
and persuade the involved party
to file a case.

512
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,010
Otherwise, I wouldn't
find you at midnight.

513
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,570
Here it is.

514
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,980
Where did you get this video?

515
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,066
I can only see the roof.

516
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,220
How can I identify the car?

517
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,050
It's good enough
that I found a video to see the roof.

518
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,460
They don't have cameras
like the city government does.

519
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,700
My colleagues and I

520
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,530
went from door to door
to ask for this video.

521
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,244
This is a camera
that the local villagers

522
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,090
used to prevent theft
in their farmlands.

523
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,380
We found this footage from the cameras.

524
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,980
Keep watching.
The video's quite long.

525
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,470
Aren't you married?

526
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,290
Why are you staying here?

527
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,666
I'll be getting a divorce soon.

528
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,610
Why?

529
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:30,820
We are a bad match for each other.

530
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,250
In that case, why would you get married
in the first place?

531
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,620
She wasn't like this in the past.

532
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,060
Qin, let me tell you.

533
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,010
Two people

534
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,180
must tolerate each other in life.

535
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,010
Especially the man.

536
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,250
He can't be too calculative.

537
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,980
Otherwise, you'll suffer.

538
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,330
Life is backing me into a corner.

539
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,010
All of them
are backing me into a corner.

540
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,980
I don't want anything.

541
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,860
- I gave everything away.
- Look how drunk she was.

542
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,570
I just want everyone

543
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,330
to live well.

544
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,570
Was I wrong to do that?

545
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,290
I had a dream last night.

546
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,290
I was back in high school

547
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,090
and I thought

548
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,140
life was really good

549
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,090
back then.

550
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,290
I did the flag-raising speech

551
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,620
and everyone was looking at me.

552
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,770
However,

553
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,810
I've never
felt that way again after that.

554
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,860
I really want
to live my whole life with him.

555
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,570
I don't know what it feels like
to like someone or not.

556
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:41,420
I can't feel it but I really want
to live my life with him.

557
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,330
Why is it so difficult?

558
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,620
There's a reason for everything.

559
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,140
Nothing changes for no reason.

560
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,180
Just wait.

561
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,860
Look at the door.

562
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,090
Here it comes.

563
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,090
You're going to watch it again?

564
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,930
Sure. Go ahead.

565
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,900
I don't know what it feels like
to like someone or not.

566
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,820
I can't feel it but I really want
to live my life with him.

567
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,860
Why is it so difficult?

568
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,650
This is it.

569
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,490
Look.

570
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,700
It's coming.

571
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,460
There it is.

572
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,866
Why do you keep rewinding the footage?

573
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:20,170
I want you to look at the car.

574
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,740
The front is not important.

575
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,900
But I really want
to live my life with him.

576
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,860
Why is it so difficult?

577
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,900
The car is here. Get in.

578
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,740
Get inside.

579
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,580
This is the car.

580
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,820
Take a look.

581
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,140
Is it this car?

582
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,050
Yes. It's this car.

583
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,555
This is also the car
in the rapeseed flower field.

584
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,900
That's great!

585
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,650
Qin,

586
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,490
thank you.

587
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,380
You've been a great help.

588
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,410
I'm leaving.

589
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:04,690
I've disturbed your rest.

590
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,610
Go to sleep.

591
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,420
Qin,

592
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,490
open the door for me.

593
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,570
I've disturbed your rest, Qin.

594
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,420
Sorry.

595
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,130
All right.

596
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,090
That's good enough.

597
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:16,900
I'm leaving.

598
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,740
Goodbye.

599
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,490
Let's get a divorce.

600
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,570
I won't do it.

601
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,740
(When you are free,)

602
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,911
(you may come home
to get the divorce agreement.)

603
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,170
I've signed it.

604
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,490
(But I really want
to live my life with him.)

605
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,900
(Why is it so difficult?)

606
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,820
(When will this end?)

607
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,740
(Have you really
tried understanding her?)

608
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,050
She isn't giving up.

609
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,111
She had too much burden

610
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,980
and she struggled,
but you didn't see that.

611
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,740
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

612
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,940
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

613
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Who are you?

614
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,900
Is the car yours?

615
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,260
It's mine!

616
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:44,970
Wait,

617
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,740
did I scratch your car, Sir?

618
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,900
Just tell me.

619
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,860
I'll compensate you.

620
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,690
Were you driving this car

621
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,090
on the 9th of April?

622
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,300
Talk!

623
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,900
Did you bring Ye Sibei
to the rapeseed flower field?

624
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,860
I know who you are!

625
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,980
What are you doing?

626
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,420
I know who you are!

627
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,650
She did it willingly!

628
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,650
She did it willingly!

629
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:28,755
She drank and got in my car.

630
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:31,610
She told me she liked me
and said you treated her badly.

631
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:33,657
Everyone saw and heard it.

632
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,900
They can prove it!

633
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,460
What if she drank and got in your car?

634
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,340
Are you mad?

635
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,050
If she didn't do it willingly,

636
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,130
why would she get in my car?

637
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,900
Why would she drink so much?

638
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,244
Why would she say she liked me?

639
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,090
I'm right even if we go to court.

640
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,820
Do you think
she dared not report to the police?

641
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,740
Report to the police?

642
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,820
What?

643
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,570
That was why you chose her.

644
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,340
Speak!

645
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,780
Beat me up.

646
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,780
Beat me to death.

647
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,820
If this blows up,

648
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,900
it'll look bad for both of us.

649
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,340
Let me see

650
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,940
how a rapist

651
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,900
dares speak to me about looking bad.

652
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,420
I'm telling you.

653
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,740
I'll make you

654
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,170
return what you owe her in prison!

655
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,090
Good morning, Chen.

656
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,960
Morning.

657
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,900
Morning.

658
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,610
Chen Xiaoyang.

659
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,570
- What happened to Mr. Fan?
- Why did he...

660
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,170
Was it serious?

661
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,210
I don't know.

662
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,420
He was holding his stomach,

663
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,690
but he didn't go to the hospital.

664
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,900
I wonder if he hurt his ribs.

665
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,490
Why didn't he go to the hospital?

666
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,420
- I don't know.
- Who's going to the hospital?

667
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,380
This morning,

668
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,490
Ms. Ye's husband beat up Mr. Fan.

669
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,860
He is furious right now.

670
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,050
You are close to Ms. Ye.

671
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,170
You should avoid him.

672
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,010
I'll be leaving.

673
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,170
Are his injuries...

674
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,420
Let's go.

675
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,780
(Chuchu)

676
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Do you miss me, Dear?

677
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,210
Nianwen, it's terrible.

678
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,530
What happened?

679
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,740
When I arrived at the office,
I heard my colleagues

680
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,050
saying Nan beat up
my superior, Fan Jiancheng.

681
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,900
What about Sibei?

682
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,210
Did she go to the office?

683
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,100
No. Yesterday, she...

684
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,300
She was fired.

685
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,330
I understand.

686
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,666
Chuchu, stop Fan Jiancheng

687
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,060
from making a police report.

688
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,940
How can I do that?

689
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,330
Hello?

690
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,590
Hello?

691
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,460
(Do you think)

692
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,420
(an apology can solve all our problems?)

693
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,570
I don't mean that.

694
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,460
Have you thought about our future?

695
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,100
Ye Sibei,

696
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,690
you shouldn't lead a life like this.

697
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:14,681
You've been fixing it every day

698
00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:16,666
and I've been waiting for you every day.

699
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:18,210
Finally, most of the petals

700
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,490
have fallen
and only three are remaining.
