3
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,980
Any plans after

5
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,180
the case ends?

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,050
Why do you ask?

7
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,620
It'd be like a rebirth.

8
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,300
Didn't you say

9
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,100
you wanted to do things that you wanted

10
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,620
but never got to do?

11
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,940
I've thought about

12
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,940
whether I should stay at Nancheng

13
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,100
or in other cities.

14
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,311
That would depend on Sibei.

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,890
There's something
I've been curious about.

16
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
If

17
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,660
you married someone else

18
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,380
instead of Ye Sibei,

19
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,570
could you accept this?

20
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,850
That's because

21
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,340
we've handled

22
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,380
a similar case.

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,060
In the end,

24
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,130
they won the case,

25
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,222
but lost their marriage.

26
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:43,466
That won't happen to us.

27
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,730
You met through matchmaking, right?

28
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:52,850
You've only been
married for a year or so,

29
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,220
and your relationship is so strong.

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,010
You knew her before?

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,010
No.

32
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,940
I didn't.

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,850
I'd never met her.

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,540
Really?

35
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:06,010
Which school did you go to?

36
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,940
No. 7.

37
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,010
I guess not, then.

38
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,170
I was wondering if you two

39
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,290
were from the same school.

40
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,730
You'd have something in common,

41
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,220
or perhaps you'd met her before

42
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,410
but forgot about it.

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,466
But that's not the case.

44
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,450
No. 2 and No. 7 High School

45
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,980
are still pretty far apart.

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,820
Nan.

47
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,900
Captain Zhang.

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,500
How is it, Nianwen?

49
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:39,660
Everything going well?

50
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,533
Chuchu has changed her testimony.

51
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,820
She said she didn't
give my sister the condom,

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,200
implying that it was my sister's.

53
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,610
Rise, everyone.

54
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,890
The People's Court

55
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,930
of Nancheng, Linjiang Province

56
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,340
(Defendant)
has reached a judgment.

57
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,100
After deliberation by a collegial panel,

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,250
which is then submitted to
the Adjudication Committee

59
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,511
for discussion of a proceeding

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,850
initiated by the
Public Prosecution Service,

61
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,810
the court finds that

62
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,650
the evidence against

63
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,490
the defendant,
Fan Jiancheng, is insufficient.

64
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,377
Therefore, the court finds the defendant

65
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:42,220
not guilty of rape.

66
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,100
(Presiding Judge)

67
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,220
Wenwen.

68
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,290
You saw that?

69
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,020
Daddy has been acquitted.

70
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,780
He's a good person.

71
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,290
He was framed.

72
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,140
He will be home soon to see you.

73
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,610
Yes, I'm innocent.

74
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,660
I did nothing wrong.

75
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,780
I want to thank the law

76
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,290
and the court for proving my innocence.

77
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,290
Of course, I must thank my wife

78
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,111
for working so hard

79
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,220
and staying by my side.

80
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,020
As a father

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,490
and a husband,

82
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,410
I do have some imperfections.

83
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,780
I hope that my case will set
an example for everyone,

84
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,490
and I will be reflecting
deeply on my actions.

85
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,900
You scumbag!

86
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,170
What are you doing? Let go!

87
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,410
Ye Sibei's family is assaulting him!

88
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,770
Move!

89
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,530
Let go!

90
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,100
- Move!
- Let go of me!

91
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,130
What are you doing?

92
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,610
Get a hold of yourself!

93
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,610
What are you doing?

94
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,820
Let go of me!

95
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,850
- Let go!
- Let go!

96
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,420
That's enough.

97
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,530
Don't get upset over this.

98
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,180
I'm telling you, you're a cop.

99
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,250
Don't get emotionally
involved in a case.

100
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,940
Whatever you do,

101
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,490
especially when handling a case,

102
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,610
you...

103
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,770
You can't let your emotions lead you.

104
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,010
I know I'm a cop.

105
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,130
But, Captain Zhang.

106
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,010
I'm also human.

107
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,460
Humans have a sense
of conscience, right?

108
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,010
Still, the court must have

109
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,490
their reason to deliver this verdict.

110
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,420
I understand.

111
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,250
Before I left the courthouse,

112
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,250
I went to talk to Judge Gao.

113
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,060
Judge Gao.

114
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,060
Captain Zhang.

115
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,150
Thank you for your hard work.

116
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:02,730
You too.

117
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,250
I have a question.

118
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,610
Why did the court

119
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,820
find him not guilty?

120
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,010
I know it has been hard on Ye Sibei.

122
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,820
It requires immense courage
to take this step.

123
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,580
However, as judges,

124
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,580
we can only deliberate our verdict

125
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,850
based on evidence and facts.

126
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,130
We try our very best

127
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,890
to ensure justice for all.

128
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,890
Let me tell you about a case from 1999.

129
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,820
A woman accused a man of raping her.

130
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,820
While there were flaws
in the chain of evidence,

131
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,890
basically,

132
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,010
it made sense
that the man was the culprit.

133
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:41,730
Besides, we used to prioritize

134
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,940
statements and testimonies,

135
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,580
and the woman wailed uncontrollably,

136
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,711
so the man was jailed for 12 years.

137
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,250
When he was released 12 years later,
he kept appealing his case

138
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,622
and spent many years doing so,

139
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,010
until a fugitive on the run

140
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,250
admitted that he was the true culprit.

141
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,610
That's how his innocence was restored.

142
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,890
Who'd have expected

143
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,250
that things would turn out this way?

144
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,780
Judge Gao.

145
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,180
He was jailed for 12 years,

146
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,580
then spent years appealing.

147
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,010
Wouldn't you say he wasted

148
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,010
most of his life on this case?

149
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,580
That's why we need to understand

150
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,730
that once the law is violated,

151
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,770
whether it's an aggrieved victim

152
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,730
or an innocent man maligned,

153
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,180
it would be incredibly tormenting.

154
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,180
What we can do

155
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,130
is to prepare sufficient evidence

156
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,010
to explore what's closest to the truth.

157
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,250
I believe you understand what I mean.

158
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,730
It's tough being a judge.

159
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,730
If you really care,

160
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,010
keep investigating this case.

161
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,610
This case

162
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,090
isn't over.

163
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,770
Wenwen!

164
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,890
Wenwen!

165
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,530
- Where's my daughter?
- Daddy!

166
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,850
Daddy!

167
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,730
- Wenwen!
- I missed you.

168
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,300
You're finally back.

169
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,980
I missed you.

170
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,260
Let's hug it out.

171
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,820
And a kiss.

172
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,700
Not enough.

173
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,940
My daughter is getting

174
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,420
prettier by the day, isn't she?

175
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,730
Daddy.

176
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,490
They said you did something bad.

177
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,840
Who said that?

178
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,740
I'll slap them.

179
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm a good guy.

180
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,980
More hugs from Daddy.

181
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,300
Take her to bed.

182
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
Go to bed.

183
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,220
- I still want to play with Daddy.
- Go to bed.

184
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,420
You can play tomorrow.

185
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,730
Daddy's back.

186
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,980
Wenwen!

187
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,890
Now that I'm back,

188
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,460
I can keep you company every day.

189
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,980
Go to bed early,

190
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,850
and we can play all day tomorrow,

191
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,460
okay?

192
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,300
Okay.

193
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,580
Let me kiss my little princess.

194
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,300
- There.
- Go to bed.

195
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,250
Mommy.

196
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,400
Good night. Go to bed.

197
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,155
- Good night, Daddy and Mommy.
- Good night.

198
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,000
Good night.

199
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,730
Darling,

200
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,100
you see...

201
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,180
Don't touch me!

202
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,660
You...

203
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,180
You put something so dirty

204
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,220
into my daughter's trophy.

205
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,733
What's wrong with you?

206
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,460
Mr. Fan has a message for you.

207
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,580
He asked you to polish

208
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,100
Wenwen's trophy.

209
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,300
Do you know

210
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,700
that you're standing here now

211
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,540
because of me?

212
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,140
If not for me,

213
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,100
you'd still be in jail now!

214
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,970
Yes.

215
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,570
It's my fault.

216
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,130
I'm sorry, Darling.

217
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,444
Thank you for doing me
such a huge favor.

218
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,430
I promise that in the future,

219
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
I'll treat you and Wenwen well.

220
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,850
Everything in the house,

221
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,850
the house, the car,

222
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,420
my money, as long as you want them,

223
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,530
they're all yours.

224
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,140
Don't be angry.

225
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,340
I let you come back

226
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,180
so that you can be a good father.

227
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,220
From now on,

228
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,180
you're on your own.

229
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,660
So...

230
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,570
About the USB drive...

231
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,140
The USB drive?

232
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,570
You will never know

233
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,980
where the USB drive is.

234
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,050
(Headlines)
Please briefly tell us

235
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,180
what happened that day.

236
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,570
That night, both of us drank alcohol.

237
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,220
We went back home together.

238
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,733
My house was just ten minutes away,

239
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:40,730
so I got there first.

240
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,980
Before I left, I reminded her

241
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,555
to send me a message
once she reached home.

242
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,180
When you got down,

243
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,220
was the victim in a clear state of mind?

244
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,420
We chatted in the car.

245
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,730
(Both of us were)

246
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,810
(a little tipsy,)

247
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,860
(but still pretty much sane.)

248
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,330
(What did you chat about?)

249
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,860
(She said life is too hard,)

250
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,570
(and I told her to keep
moving forward regardless.)

251
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,570
That means

252
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,530
you didn't abandon her.

253
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,290
Only both of us were in the car.

254
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,420
Based on what you say,

255
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,290
if I were the one who lived further,

256
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,290
I'd have been the victim,

257
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,420
and she'd have been the one
who abandoned me, right?

258
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,420
You're saying that

259
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,300
either of us could've been
at fault, right?

260
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,330
Did she send you a message

261
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,250
when she reached home?

262
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,140
All I can say is that
I made sure she was safe

263
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
before I slept.

264
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,810
(I don't feel like answering
this question anymore.)

265
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:50,420
(It's been said that the victim)

266
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,050
took a loan out

267
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,220
to buy a house for you and her brother.

268
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,730
Did you know about this before?

269
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,570
No.

270
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,380
Our families

271
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,010
got together to discuss our marriage.

272
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,420
At first, my father requested for

273
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,710
a bride price and a house.

274
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,330
His family replied that they're not

275
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,177
well off, and they
can't afford the bride price,

276
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,420
so they'll just buy us a house

277
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,050
under my name and her brother's.

278
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,533
Both of us would pay the house loan.

279
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,490
I always thought the down payment

280
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,420
came from her brother's parents.

281
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,940
If I'd known Ye Sibei paid for it,

282
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,980
I would've rejected.

283
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,180
Now, because of this lawsuit,

284
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,380
we sold the house.

285
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,900
From now on, I have...

286
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,730
I have nothing to do with his family.

287
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,140
Nianwen, where are you going?

288
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
Nianwen!

289
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,180
What did she say?

290
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,180
What did she say?

291
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,380
She said you were awake.

292
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,380
What, awake?

293
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,420
She said that when she left,

294
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,050
you could still talk normally

295
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,980
and recognize people,

296
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,822
and you were still
in a clear state of mind.

297
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,730
She said that when she got down,

298
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,133
she asked you to send her a message
once you reach home,

299
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,490
and she only slept after
she made sure you were safe.

300
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:29,488
She also said it wasn't her
who gave you the condom.

301
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:17,220
Dad, I'm going out.

302
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,770
I won't be having dinner.

303
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,980
Okay.

304
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,820
I...

305
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,010
Take it easy.

306
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,980
It's raining.
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

307
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,940
It wasn't raining yet
when I left the house.

308
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,660
You could've taken shelter somewhere.

309
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,660
I can see your house from here.

310
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,180
If I go elsewhere,

311
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,250
I can't see you coming out.

312
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,770
You...

313
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,570
We agreed to meet at the cinema, right?

314
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,730
It's a 15-minute walk
from here to the cinema.

315
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,666
I can't wait that long.

316
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,380
What's with the rush?

317
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,900
You can't even wait for 15 minutes?

318
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,180
What do you think

319
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,140
of me?

320
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,010
You're a good guy.

321
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,900
Is that a rejection?

322
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,570
Fine.

323
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,820
It's okay.

324
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,010
But there's something I need to say.

325
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,980
Chuchu.

326
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,010
I like you.

327
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,730
I know that you

328
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,180
may not feel the same way now,

329
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,460
but don't stress over it.

330
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,770
I'm happy to be with you,

331
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,900
going shopping together,

332
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
and watching a movie.

333
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
As long as you want it,

334
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,820
I can do anything.

335
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,420
Actually,

336
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,770
just being with you

337
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,660
already makes me happy.

338
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,570
Is that so?

339
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,980
You're not expecting a reply?

340
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,700
Instead of getting rejected,

341
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,140
not getting a reply
means I still have hope.

342
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,460
I don't need a shopping buddy.

343
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,180
What I need is a boyfriend.

344
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,740
What?

345
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,770
Chuchu!

346
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,660
I can do that!

347
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,250
Of course, I can!

348
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,940
What can you do?

349
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,810
I can be your boyfriend.

350
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,420
Ye Nianwen loves Chuchu.

351
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,180
Chuchu loves Ye Nianwen.

352
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,780
You're here.

353
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,570
Why did you lie?

354
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,180
Lie about what?

355
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,700
You lied in court!

356
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,530
Take your phone and recording pen out.

357
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,420
Who do you think I am?

358
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,660
I know you too well.

359
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,420
Take them out.

360
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,730
I'm grabbing your collar.

361
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,909
I'm threatening the witness.

362
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,933
Even if I were recording,
it wouldn't be admissible.

363
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:33,220
Let's talk about it at home.

364
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,770
Take your coat off.

365
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,660
Take your phone out.

366
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,730
Empty your pockets.

367
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,020
(The World Never Disappoints
Anyone Who Works Hard)

368
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,740
Is this good enough?

369
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,660
Hi, Dad.

370
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,220
Chuchu.

371
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,090
Sibei and Qin Nan are here for you.

372
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,940
Let them come in.

373
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,700
Ask away.

374
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,700
Why did you lie?

375
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,220
When I was in court,

376
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,860
other than what I said about the condom,

377
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,900
I didn't lie about anything else.

378
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,700
I didn't lie.

379
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,770
That night, Zheng Qiang insisted
on drinking with everyone.

380
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
He's a good drinker.

381
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,860
I drank for a while and got tipsy.

382
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,090
Fan Jiancheng saw me,

383
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,700
and he asked me to tend to you

384
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,420
so that we could
avoid drinking together.

385
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,420
That's why I trusted him that night.

386
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,700
I thought he was a good man.

387
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,090
Actually, after you vomited that night,

388
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,660
you were pretty much the same as usual.

389
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,330
Perhaps you were emotional

390
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,170
and talkative,

391
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:31,090
but you could still talk clearly

392
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,330
and recognize people.

393
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,090
We kept chatting in the car, too.

394
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,900
You asked me why life is so hard.

395
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,090
I replied,

396
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,980
there's no end to challenges in life.

397
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,330
We can only move forward.

398
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,740
I remember that.

399
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,490
After I got down, I told you

400
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,555
to call me when you get home

401
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:51,755
to let me know you're safe.

402
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,140
When I got home, I was so tired,

403
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,900
so I set an alarm for one hour

404
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,380
and went to sleep.

405
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:58,730
When I woke up,

406
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,810
I saw your message

407
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,860
telling me that you've

408
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,900
reached home,

409
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,700
so I didn't think much

410
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,140
and went back to sleep.

411
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,780
Where's the message?

412
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:07,930
Show me the message.

413
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,780
(Location Pin: Jinxiu Residential Area
I'm home.)

414
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,555
It must've been Fan Jiancheng.

415
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,050
Fan Jiancheng drove my sister

416
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,940
to her apartment,

417
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,660
and sent this message with her phone
before deleting it.

418
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,900
And the call too.

419
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,511
He made the call,
then deleted the record.

420
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
It was past midnight.

421
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:38,330
Sibei was already unconscious.

422
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,490
At first, I was

423
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,250
determined to help Sibei.

424
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,700
That's why I did whatever you told me.

425
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:47,180
I didn't show this message
to the police.

426
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,460
You said you were unconscious,

427
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,010
so I left it at that.

428
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,860
Why did you change your testimony, then?

429
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,288
Why did you say

430
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,977
you didn't give Sibei the condom?

431
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,770
You're lying.

432
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,140
You must be lying!

433
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,866
I've been having dreams lately.

434
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,420
I saw us

435
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,090
trapped inside a cage,

436
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,250
surrounded by people with sticks

437
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,380
and knives, threatening us.

438
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,700
They wanted me to bite you,

439
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,690
and then asked you to do the same to me.

440
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,700
They said we're both sinners.

441
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:28,180
We did something wrong,

442
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:30,770
so we need to be punished.

443
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,770
But I've been

444
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,980
wondering what I did wrong.

445
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,860
I shouldn't have worked in sales.

446
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,333
I shouldn't have gone
to social gatherings.

447
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,530
I should've called

448
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,490
my family.

449
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,330
I should've sent you home that night.

450
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,900
Every day, I ask myself

451
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,090
why I didn't do all that.

452
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,490
Why did I trust someone so easily?

453
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,460
Why didn't I call my family

454
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,660
to let them pick us up that night?

455
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,140
Why did I choose to work in sales

456
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,770
just for a measly income?

457
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,180
Why did I

458
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,380
leave you alone

459
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,460
in the car that night?

460
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,180
How could I be so bad?

461
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,860
How could I be so bad?

462
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,220
But I don't have

463
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,980
the courage to be good.

464
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,420
It's too difficult to be
good in this world.

465
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,260
I can't do it.

466
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,860
I admit, I'm a little selfish.

467
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,780
I'm unrestrained,

468
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,940
I'm incorrigible, yes.

469
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
But at least that makes me live better.

470
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,460
That's how everyone is,

471
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,770
so I'll just follow suit.

472
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,860
I already know that people think of me

473
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,460
as a money digger

474
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,900
who forced my boyfriend to buy a house

475
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,511
and suck his sister's blood dry.

476
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,770
If those people knew it was me

477
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,250
who gave Sibei the condom,

478
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,220
I can't imagine

479
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,140
what they would say about me.

480
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,940
They'd say,

481
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
"Look at that girl,

482
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,570
wearing stockings and high heels,

483
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,330
she must be a whore.

484
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,980
If she has a condom,

485
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,420
does that mean she..."

486
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,610
I'm sorry.

487
00:31:23,044 --> 00:31:24,140
I can't take it anymore.

488
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,860
Let's go.

489
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,090
I haven't finished asking.

490
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,940
Let's leave it at here.

491
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,570
Chuchu.

492
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,700
You're not bad.

493
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,090
Don't be a bad person, ever.

494
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,180
All I cared about was seeking
justice for myself,

495
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,940
and I had neglected your situation.

496
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,980
Goodbye.

497
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,250
- Sibei...
- Sibei!

498
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,140
- Sibei.
- Sibei!

499
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,730
Stop pursuing this case.

500
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
I'll give you the money.

501
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,140
I'll give you all my money.

502
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,420
Go to the capital

503
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,250
and start a new life.

504
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,980
Stop pursuing this.

505
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,660
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,490
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,770
I'm sorry.

508
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
I understand.

509
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,090
I don't blame you.

510
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
It wasn't your intention.

511
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,490
Lead a good life

512
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:24,911
and take care of yourself.

513
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,330
Sibei.

514
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm sorry.

515
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,420
I'm sorry.

516
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,700
I'm sorry.

517
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,330
I'm sorry.

518
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,610
Sibei.

519
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,980
I'm sorry.

520
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,540
I'm sorry.

521
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,980
Sibei.

522
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,260
I'm sorry.

523
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,700
Sibei!

524
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,090
I'm sorry!

525
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,130
Why are we leaving?

526
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,340
She lied. She affected
the judges' decision.

527
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,170
This case shouldn't
have ended like this.

528
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,780
It was Fan Jiancheng who harmed me.

529
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,490
She's a key witness.

530
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,460
Her statement caused you a disadvantage!

531
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,266
So what if you knew that
it was Fan Jiancheng

532
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,170
who did this to you?

533
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,010
I'm sorry, Nianwen.

534
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,170
I messed up your life.

535
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,090
Sibei, no, I...

536
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,010
Let's end it now.

537
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,780
Everyone has sacrificed too much.

538
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,690
Sibei.

539
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,780
We can still appeal to the prosecution.

540
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,044
We can have a second hearing.

541
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,050
There are too many people involved.

542
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,170
I'm out of energy.

543
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,410
Go home.

544
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,780
Don't make your sister worry.

545
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,090
You're really not going to appeal?

546
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,780
No.

547
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,260
Can you accept this?

548
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,980
What's not to accept?

549
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,090
We've already made it this far.

550
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,570
We made it this far.

551
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,940
Throughout this journey,
I've received a lot.

552
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,570
I know I'm not alone.

553
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,780
Life has to continue.

554
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,570
We have to look forward, right?

555
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,410
Okay.

556
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,570
I'll be with you.

557
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,900
Let's move forward together.

558
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,380
I'm happy to hear that.

559
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,220
Sibei.

560
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,090
But don't you think

561
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,780
it's a pity...

562
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,820
Let's go home.

563
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,130
I'm really sleepy.

564
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,180
Sibei.

565
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,780
I made you chicken soup.

566
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
Drink some.

567
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,940
You haven't eaten for days.

568
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,980
You need to drink some.

569
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,170
I don't want to.

570
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:49,300
Our local hospital
has limited resources.

571
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:51,130
They couldn't diagnose anything.

572
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,740
Why don't we just

573
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,900
go to the city hospital?

574
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm exhausted, that's all.

575
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,860
I just need more sleep.

576
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,900
Listen to me, then.

577
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,650
Drink some soup,

578
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,355
or else I'll have to carry you
to the city hospital.

579
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,650
I don't want to drink.

580
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,010
One more mouthful.

581
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:35,930
No.

582
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,690
Hello, Jun?

583
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,340
Nan.

584
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,130
There's a guy at the workshop

585
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,420
who insists that you fix his car.

586
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,890
Go.

587
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,288
- Okay, got it.
- Great.

588
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,650
I'm going, then.

589
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,570
I'll leave the soup here.

590
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,820
Remember to drink some.

591
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,170
Sorry

592
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,010
for the delay.

593
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,340
You're Qin Nan?

594
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:30,380
What's wrong with your car?

595
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,860
It's...

596
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,090
There's a smoky smell,

597
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,780
and the warning lights are on,

598
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
so please take a look.

599
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,780
What are you doing?

600
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,860
Who let you do that?

601
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,050
Give it back! It's mine!

602
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,888
- Who let you do that?
- Give my phone back!

603
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,260
What are you up to?
I knew you were fishy.

604
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,570
Who let you take these photos?

605
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm just recording my life.

606
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,220
(Delete)
What do you mean by that?

607
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:33,170
What kind of life are you recording?

608
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,780
More like violating privacy, you know?

609
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,650
No.

610
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,380
Stop recording.

611
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,220
Stop.

612
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,420
I'll be honest.

613
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,044
I have over 300,000 followers
on social media.

614
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:43,622
I know he's in trouble,
so I'm helping him to clear his name.

615
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,570
Do you think

616
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,690
he needs your help?

617
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,780
I have over 300,000 followers.

618
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,260
I've got social influence.

619
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,170
I can help him.

620
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,410
Hello.

621
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:53,355
Do you still need to fix your car?

622
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,050
Go ahead.

623
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,377
I'm already here, anyway.

624
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:59,420
If you want to fix your car,
I can do it.

625
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,780
But stop taking photos.

626
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,340
Nan.

627
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,820
What's your plan now?

628
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,900
What do you mean?

629
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,700
You were about to file
for divorce, right?

630
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,740
Then, your wife got into trouble.

631
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,540
As decent people,

632
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:32,600
we're obligated to help

633
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,860
if someone is in trouble.

634
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,020
But it's already over, right?

635
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,100
The court's verdict is out.

636
00:42:40,355 --> 00:42:42,300
The court's verdict
might not be the truth.

637
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,220
Think again, will you?

638
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,700
You haven't been married for long.

639
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,140
Do you really know her that well?

640
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,700
I know her.

641
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,300
More than anyone else does.

642
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,660
I trust her.

643
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,380
Since you trust her, I believe in you.

644
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,700
If anyone dares to say

645
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,380
anything rotten about you,

646
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,420
I'll chase them all away.

647
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,820
Hey, Mom.

648
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,540
Qin Nan.

649
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
When are you free?

650
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,020
Can you come over?

651
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,540
Don't panic.

652
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,488
Tell me what happened.

653
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,140
I need to talk to you.

654
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,540
Just come over.

655
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,140
Okay, got it.

656
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,980
I'll be right over.

657
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,540
Jun, I need to go.

658
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:48,933
