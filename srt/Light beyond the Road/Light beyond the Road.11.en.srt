00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,850
Sibei.

7
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm going to court.

8
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,850
Don't worry.

9
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,290
Nianwen.

10
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,170
This trial

11
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,820
affects not only my life,

12
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,260
but also Qin Nan's.

13
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,380
He might spend

14
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
his whole life
trapped in that lonely youth,

15
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,170
questioning the laws of this world.

16
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,220
Only if we win this case

17
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,850
can he find the answer he seeks.

18
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,380
Don't worry.

19
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,890
Trust the prosecution.

20
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,570
(Judge, Presiding Judge)
Nancheng People's Court.

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,500
(Clerk)
Criminal Trial Division.

22
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,130
The court is now in session.

23
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,850
Bailiff, bring the defendant Fan Jiancheng in.

24
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,170
Thank you.

25
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,180
Stand up.

26
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,780
The prosecutor
will now read the indictment.

27
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,340

(Courtroom 3)

29
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,410
Mr. Ye, Mrs. Ye.

30
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,290
If you need anything,

31
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,580
just let me know.

32
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,020
Wait outside for a while.

33
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,860
Okay.

34
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,540
(Public Waiting Area)

35
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,780
Dad, Mom.

36
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,020
Sit here first.

37
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,580
I'll go out with Captain Zhang.

38
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,044
Call me if you need anything.

39
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,050
Captain Zhang, got a lighter?

40
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,900
No smoking allowed here.

41
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,180
Nervous?

42
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,740
Captain Zhang.

43
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,730
Will our case

44
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,570
be fine?

45
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,170
Well,

46
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,170
usually,

47
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,410
once we send a case
to the procuratorate,

48
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,290
the case is closed

49
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,580
if they decide not to prosecute.

50
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,460
That means it's over.

51
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,810
If they review it

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,410
and believe the defendant is guilty,

53
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,050
they'll pursue criminal liability

54
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,540
and send it to court.

55
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,844
If the court rules not guilty,

56
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:47,780
then we

57
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,220
and the procuratorate

58
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,511
did all that for nothing.

59
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:52,610
So we'll win

60
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,780
our case?

61
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,100
Keep going.

62
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,170
Keep going.

63
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,622
You won't be disappointed.

64
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,700
That's all I can say.

65
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,540
But sometimes, persistence

66
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,340
is harder than I imagined.

67
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,780
And Sibei

68
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,700
has suffered enough.

69
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,410
On the night of April 9,

70
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,410
Zheng Qiang from Wanfu Properties

71
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,580
called me and said

72
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,050
he agreed to discuss our cooperation.

73
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,020
Zheng Qiang

74
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,340
loves a lively crowd.

75
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,540
Here. Come in.

76
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,900
So I called the employees

77
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,410
still working overtime

78
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,580
to join us.

79
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,460
For some reason,

80
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,700
Zheng Qiang thought
Ye Sibei offended him

81
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,930
during the dinner.

82
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,900
Fan.

83
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,810
Your employee is disrespectful to me.

84
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,810
She's new here,

85
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,580
not used to drinking occasions

86
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,700
and can't handle alcohol.

87
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,410
I tried to stop him but failed.

88
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,410
During the drinking,

89
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,220
Ye Sibei told me

90
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,900
to take her home afterward.

91
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,020
I agreed.

92
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,050
When we got near her home,

93
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,220
she said

94
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,810
she didn't want to go home.

95
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,460
She asked me

96
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,540
to take her to the canola field.

97
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,810
I asked her,

98
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,290
"Why do you want to go there?"

99
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,340
She said

100
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,810
that her husband wants a divorce.

101
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,900
She was upset.

102
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,290
So I drove her

103
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,020
to the canola field.

104
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,020
Then she

105
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,050
suddenly hugged me,

106
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,930
saying she liked me.

107
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,050
While talking,

108
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,900
she took a condom from her bag.

109
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,140
I lost control for a moment.

110
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,580
And it happened.

111
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Defendant Fan Jiancheng.

112
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,810
Your lawyer submitted new evidence.

113
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,700
When were those photos

114
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,020
and the recording taken?

115
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,340
How did you take them?

116
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,460
The photos and the video

117
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,050
were taken during that incident.

118
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,700
I took out my phone.

119
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,540
She didn't object, so I filmed.

120
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,020
Why did you record the video?

121
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:16,930
Maybe

122
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,810
we were both too excited. I...

123
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,700
But once I calmed down later,

124
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,140
I got scared.

125
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,340
Because both of us

126
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,460
had families, right?

127
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,580
So I told her,

128
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,410
just this once, never again.

129
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,810
But she refused.

130
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,890
She asked

131
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,010
for 100,000 yuan,

132
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,180
or else she'd tell people

133
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,060
what happened.

134
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,530
As you said,

135
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,420
if the victim threatened you,

136
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,530
why

137
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,940
was she left alone in the canola field?

138
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,890
Weren't you afraid?

139
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,530
Afraid of what?

140
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,340
I was furious.

141
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,060
I really thought

142
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,460
everything she said

143
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,770
and everything that happened was fake.

144
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,700
I thought she was scamming me.

145
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,340
So I didn't agree

146
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,700
and drove away alone.

147
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,060
The next day, she called,

148
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,820
saying she had called the police,

149
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,010
but there was still room for maneuver.

150
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,530
She asked me to reconsider it.

151
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,700
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.

152
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,130
So I didn't agree to her demand.

153
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,130
After the case
went to the procuratorate,

154
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,420
the photos and videos you took

155
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,420
were clearly in your favor.

156
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,220
Why didn't you submit them earlier?

157
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,700
Unless it's unavoidable,

158
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,010
who'd show something like that publicly?

159
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,940
Right?

160
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,300
You said Ye Sibei seduced you

161
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,940
and threatened you repeatedly.

162
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,300
Since she threatened you once,

163
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,890
why didn't you record her

164
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,940
to keep proof later?

165
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,060
I'm a man, after all.

166
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,370
And...

167
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,010
I'm partly

168
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,010
to blame

169
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,420
for this situation.

170
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,340
Even if she tricked or scammed me,

171
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,111
I never thought of suing her.

172
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,610
When I first realized

173
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,130
she was the victim,

174
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,180
I actually resented her.

175
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,940
I thought she was too weak.

176
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,220
She was bullied yet stayed silent.

177
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,977
She was even scared
to report to the police.

178
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,130
It was when I heard
what she said in that video

179
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,220
that I suddenly realized

180
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,530
she might have suffered
in ways I never knew.

181
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,180
I should have known her better.

182
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,370
Whether she was weak

183
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,250
or timid,

184
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,700
I should have been more tolerant.

185
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,820
I shouldn't have always told her

186
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,490
to try harder

187
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,700
and be stronger

188
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,100
while doing nothing myself.

189
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,260
Qin.

190
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,940
Good, really.

191
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,610
That's the right way to think.

192
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,420
But only now do I understand

193
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,530
that she didn't report to the police,

194
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,700
not because she was weak,

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,180
but because I was ignorant.

196
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,370
I really had no idea

197
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,370
what kind of hardships awaited.

198
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,530
After we went through it all,

199
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,700
being judged by others,

200
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,100
seeing
all the ridiculous comments online

201
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,180
and even now

202
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,850
still anxious about the trial,

203
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,980
I realized

204
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,355
I might not have had the courage
to report to the police

205
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,420
if I had known
it would turn out like this.

206
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,300
But she knew all that

207
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,300
and still reported it.

208
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,820
You regret it?

209
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,850
Sometimes I feel so lost.

210
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,820
What's the point of holding on?

211
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,820
If we lose this case,

212
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,060
what's the point

213
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,730
of everything we've been through?

214
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,300
Ms. Ye rarely talks

215
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,490
to others at the company.

216
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,060
Her husband picks her up
after work every day.

217
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,850
Sibei, aren't you leaving?

218
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,370
I'll leave when I finish these.

219
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,530
Her husband didn't come a while ago.

220
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,730
Ms. Tao told me she secretly

221
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,420
lent her brother
money to buy a house

222
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,610
without telling her husband.

223
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,420
He was furious when he found out.

224
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,940
He wanted a divorce.

225
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,980
Before leaving work that day,

226
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,700
I wanted to clean early.

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,300
Accidentally,

228
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,700
I knocked her bag over.

229
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,700
I quickly helped pick it up.

230
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,820
When I crouched down to get it,

231
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,250
I noticed her bag

232
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,180
contained a...

233
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,020
A...

234
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,300
A condom.

235
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,300
I felt embarrassed,

236
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,940
so I left right away.

237
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,820
When Zheng Qiang
urged Ye Sibei to drink,

238
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,300
did the defendant stop him or go along?

239
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,850
Mr. Fan tried to help her at first.

240
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,300
We all wanted to help her.

241
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,820
But

242
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,250
Mr. Zheng was pushy.

243
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,100
I just think

244
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,250
drinking's just for the mood.

245
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,850
(Witness)
I drink like this everywhere.

246
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,490
You drink one, and I'll drink one.

247
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,300
That's mutual respect, right?

248
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Once everyone's relaxed, it's fun.

249
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,530
If everyone holds back,

250
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,890
this meal...

251
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,780
Well...

252
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,980
What's the point of the meal then?

253
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,820
(Defense)
How many glasses did Ye Sibei drink?

254
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,610
About ten.

255
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,700
That girl

256
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,420
is just a young staff.

257
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,980
Everyone toasted me

258
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,100
one glass after another.

259
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,490
She cunningly tried to dodge the drinks.

260
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,780
Well...

261
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,250
She disrespected me,

262
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,180
so I couldn't let it slide.

263
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,530
We just drank together.

264
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,980
I made sure she drank.

265
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,420
Sir, hands off.

266
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,060
April 10th,

267
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,730
5:49 AM.

268
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,940
The 110 center got a call.

269
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,180
She said she was trapped in a field

270
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,300
and needed a coat.

271
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,420
I rushed over.

272
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,940
There's bodycam footage as evidence.

273
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,180
She was hiding in the field.

274
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
Pale-faced,

275
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,940
shaking all over,

276
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,180
unable to speak clearly.

277
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,940
I sensed something was wrong,

278
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,610
so I called my colleagues

279
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,820
and notified forensics.

280
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,100
Then, we took Ye Sibei to the hospital
for relevant examinations.

281
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,420
To your knowledge,

282
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,420
Ye's report at the time

283
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,300
was that she needed a coat.

284
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,850
She didn't report rape, right?

285
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,780
Yes.

286
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,700
What did the condom you saw look like?

287
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,060
It was purple.

288
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,420
Please take a look.

289
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,260
Is this the one?

290
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Yes.

291
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,940
Then, when she pointed out
that the defendant

292
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,180
drove her home that day,

293
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,820
did you hear it yourself
or from someone else?

294
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,060
I heard it with my own ears.

295
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,700
Remember

296
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,370
to get me and Chuchu home safely.

297
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,820
Don't worry. I'll get you two home safe.

298
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,700
Mr. Fan, hurry inside.

299
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,279
Mr. Zheng couldn't find
anyone to drink with

300
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,820
and got anxious.

301
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,530
Alright.

302
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,490
Take care of her.

303
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,420
Okay.

304
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,180
That day, there were others

305
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,420
besides the defendant

306
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,060
who could take her home, right?

307
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,370
Ms. Ye mentioned Mr. Fan would send her.

308
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,700
Because Mr. Fan was the only one

309
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,250
not drinking that night.

310
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,340
So

311
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,490
I didn't ask further.

312
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,730
You took Ye Sibei's clothes,

313
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,100
collected biological evidence,

314
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,700
and did related tests.

315
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,300
Why didn't you do a blood test?

316
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,700
It's because I wasn't sure

317
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,490
what she had gone through at first.

318
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,180
We could only start

319
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,700
with a physical examination

320
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,420
to see if she was injured.

321
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,300
It was when she requested

322
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,060
a DNA test

323
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,180
that I realized

324
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,490
she had been sexually assaulted.

325
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,820
Was this confirmed

326
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,250
after the results came out,

327
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,980
or did you believe it right away?

328
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,060
I believed it right away.

329
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,377
So you collected evidence,

330
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,180
assuming my client was guilty

331
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,700
from the start?

332
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,420
But Ye Sibei's condition
was already clear.

333
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:52,180
Yes or no?

334
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,370
Yes.

335
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,700
Because I couldn't lie to my conscience.

336
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,777
- Alright.
- Ye Si...

337
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,420
Your Honor, I'm done.

338
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,660
Qin.

339
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,610
Back then,

340
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,060
there was a case here.

341
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,420
The man's crime period

342
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,180
was from 1993

343
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,940
all the way to 2009.

344
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,940
During that time,

345
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,250
he raped dozens of women.

346
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,180
Do you know

347
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,511
why he was so bold?

348
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,780
Why?

349
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,300
Later, he told his lawyer

350
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,700
that throughout all those crimes,

351
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,810
no one resisted,

352
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,980
and no one reported to the police.

353
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,810
It almost cost the offenders nothing.

354
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,180
Would he be afraid?

355
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,700
Impossible.

356
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,980
You can't expect a bad man

357
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,730
to suddenly repent one day

358
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,090
and lay down his knife.

359
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,930
Such people,

360
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,980
will only sharpen that knife

361
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,860
if not stopped.

362
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,940
Recently, there was a case online

363
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,980
that caused a huge stir.

364
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,180
Remember it?

365
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,420
That missing girl.

366
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,180
They found her later.

367
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,530
She said nothing.

368
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
She didn't dare to speak

369
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,780
or report it.

370
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,460
And the case

371
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,730
just faded away.

372
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,220
Ye Sibei

373
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,860
is truly brave.

374
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,090
She reported to the police.

375
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,050
She stood firm.

376
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,180
That's

377
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,940
the greatest warning

378
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,111
to those hiding in the dark,

379
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,066
thinking they never have to pay a price.

380
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,570
Qin.

381
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,290
Everything you've done

382
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,490
truly isn't meaningless.

383
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,290
Ye Sibei, your turn.

384
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,860
(Judge, Presiding Judge)

385
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,740
(Legal Representative)

386
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,010
Victim Ye Sibei.

387
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,330
(Presiding Judge)
Please describe that day.

388
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,460
My name is Ye Sibei.

389
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,220
28 years old and from Nancheng.

390
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,420
I was an accountant

391
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,900
at Fuqiang Real Estate.

392
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
That night,

393
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,800
Fan Jiancheng
suddenly came back to the office

394
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,980
and told us to attend a dinner.

395
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,860
After dinner, he drove me home.

396
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,980
He blindfolded me

397
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,940
and threw me out of the car.

398
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,700
Twenty.

399
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,180
He told me to walk forward,

400
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,220
counting to 1,000.

401
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,330
Twenty-two.

402
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,420
Or he'd kill me.

403
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,140
I was terrified.

404
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,770
Keep walking.

405
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,090
Count to 1,000.

406
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
If you turn around, I'll kill you.

407
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,980
Twenty-six.

408
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,180
After counting to 1,000,
I removed the blindfold

409
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,180
and found myself in a canola field.

410
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,620
(Defendant)

411
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,940
Ye Sibei.

412
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,180
Usually,

413
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,860
you're well-behaved, right?

414
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,460
Had anyone ever told you before

415
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,530
that it's dangerous

416
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,570
for girls to drink at night?

417
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,700
Yes.

418
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
As a well-behaved girl,

419
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,220
why did you still go,

420
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,666
knowing the risk?

421
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,180
Do you mean

422
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,530
a girl who drinks at night

423
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,700
is guilty?

424
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,770
You misunderstand me.

425
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,010
I'm just curious

426
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,380
what made you do it.

427
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,090
In that situation,

428
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,090
I was under pressure.

429
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,460
Everyone was watching me.

430
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,290
I felt that if I refused to drink,

431
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,090
we might lose the deal,

432
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,860
and all efforts would be wasted.

433
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,570
Besides,

434
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,700
many colleagues I trusted were there.

435
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,490
I didn't feel it was dangerous.

436
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,222
After the incident,
you called the police.

437
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,420
Why did you say you were fine?

438
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,940
Because my mother told me

439
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,180
not reporting it would hurt me less.

440
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,180
After calling the police,

441
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,290
you called the defendant again.

442
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,420
What did you say?

443
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,140
I asked for leave.

444
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,290
He was my superior.

445
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Do you carry condoms daily?

446
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,220
No.

447
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,860
Then why did you

448
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,330
have one in your bag

449
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,170
that day?

450
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,610
Look.

451
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,940
What are you doing?

452
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,288
If you really run into a criminal,
you should offer it.

453
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,940
Prevent disease, reduce harm,

454
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,490
and increase survival.

455
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,420
I'll put it in your bag.

456
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,730
No, I don't want it.

457
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,700
My colleague put it there.

458
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,730
She said that if attacked,

459
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,570
giving the condom voluntarily

460
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,180
will increase survival odds.

461
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,220
Understood.

462
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,860
Who told you

463
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,460
condoms increase survival odds?

464
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,020
Ye Sibei.

465
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,090
It was Chuchu.

466
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,730
Before the defendant assaulted you,

467
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,940
you gave him the condom, right?

468
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,260
No.

469
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,490
When I woke up,

470
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,330
it was already happening.

471
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,900
Did you see his face?

472
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,740
No.

473
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,460
You were blindfolded the whole time,

474
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,900
so you don't know who he was?

475
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,410
Yes.

476
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,180
Please look at this photo.

477
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,540
Impossible.

478
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,180
This can't be.

479
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,020
That's not me.

480
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,700
It's not me!

481
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
It is you.

482
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,730
It's not.

483
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,180
According to court evidence,

484
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,420
the photo we provided

485
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,180
shows you weren't blindfolded.

486
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,620
Your eyes were open,

487
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,180
looking at the camera.

488
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,570
You were conscious.

489
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,380
How do you explain that?

490
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,330
I don't remember.

491
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,380
No.

492
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,140
That's not me.

493
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,490
There's no way it's me!

494
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,620
During the whole incident,

495
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,290
did he hit you?

496
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,220
Did you resist?

497
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,460
I did.

498
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
I scratched him and cried for help.

499
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,220
So during the process,

500
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,330
you screamed, right?

501
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,570
Yes or no?

502
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,290
Yes, he forced me to scream!

503
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,700
He said he'd kill me if I didn't!

504
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,620
Did you enjoy it?

505
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,700
No!

506
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,980
Your Honor, that question is irrelevant!

507
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,490
Irrelevant questions are not permitted.

508
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,010
Yes, Your Honor. Understood.

509
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,260
Ye Sibei.

510
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,180
You love your husband.

511
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,700
You want to be with him forever, right?

512
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,180
Your monthly salary
is 3,500 yuan, right?

513
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,860
Yes.

514
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,940
Your monthly salary is 3,500 yuan.

515
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:35,711
You took a credit loan of 100,000 yuan

516
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:36,900
to be repaid in four years.

517
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,770
You pay 2,400 yuan every month,

518
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,900
leaving only 1,100 yuan
for living costs.

519
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
Yet your own mortgage

520
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,090
is still not paid off.

521
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,330
Your husband runs a car repair shop.

522
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,010
Life isn't exactly easy.

523
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,980
You love him.

524
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,420
You want a life with him.

525
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,570
Haven't you ever thought

526
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,180
about your own future?

527
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,020
Or do you

528
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,980
have another plan?

529
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,140
Your Honor.

530
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,380
The defense's question
is beyond the case scope.

531
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,010
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

532
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,220
Bailiff,
please escort the victim Ye Sibei out.

533
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,420
Please have Ye Sibei
leave the courtroom.

534
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:02,888
(Defendant)

535
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,090
Bailiff,
please bring the witness Chuchu in.

536
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,490
Please describe
what happened that night.

537
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,380
My name is Chuchu.

538
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,090
I work in sales at Fuqiang Real Estate.

539
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,940
Sibei, call me when you get home.

540
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,420
Let me know you're safe. Bye.

541
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,460
That's what happened that night.

542
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,940
I got off the car before Ye Sibei.

543
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,490
Your fiancé
is Ye Sibei's younger brother, right?

544
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,740
Yes.

545
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,980
Were you drunk that night?

546
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,170
No.

547
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,330
Was Ye Sibei drunk that night?

548
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,170
She was.

549
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,700
When you two separated,

550
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,330
your statement says

551
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,770
Ye Sibei was semi-conscious.

552
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,940
May I ask how conscious

553
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,333
she was?

554
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:24,770
(Ye Sibei was already unconscious,)

555
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,900
(and you left her in the car.)

556
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,940
(Are you even human? Did you mean it?)

557
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,460
(You're the same as the rapist.)

558
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,730
(What kind of person are you?)

559
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,140
(You hurt people like that.)

560
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,050
(Wearing a short skirt)

561
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,290
(- with big curls,)
(- Don't you feel guilty?)

562
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,900
(- she's no good either!)
(- You have no conscience.)

563
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,940
(- The accomplice must be punished.)
(- She's always drinking with men.)

564
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
(Who knows what she's done
in private with those bosses?)

565
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,900
(- Does she think no one knows?)
(- How ridiculous.)

566
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,140
(- Darn accomplice.)
(- All kinds of people exist.)

567
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,460
Chuchu, please answer the question.

568
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,740
(You're a sinner!)

569
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,540
(Chuchu.)

570
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,220
(Are you feeling unwell?)

571
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,420
I... I was remembering.

572
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,380
That night's events

573
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,180
were all a bit blurry.

574
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,860
I just recall her rambling non-stop.

575
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,570
Could she still recognize people?

576
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,460
Yes.

577
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,700
She talked all night long.

578
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,330
Her logic was clear.

579
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,900
She could make phone calls clearly, too.

580
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,420
That's why I felt safe
leaving her in the car.

581
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,810
I even told her

582
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,700
to call me when she gets home.

583
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,900
She could recognize people.

584
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,420
She could speak clearly and logically.

585
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,290
In other words,

586
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,490
Ye Sibei was sober

587
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,140
when you two separated.

588
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,420
Please answer my question.

589
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,380
Witness, please answer.

590
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,260
Yes.

591
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,860
During the whole time she was drunk,

592
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,140
did her sobriety

593
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,620
seem to get worse?

594
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,010
No.

595
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,460
After getting drunk,

596
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,570
she said things she never said before.

597
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,010
After vomiting,
she was more clear-headed.

598
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,330
Was she usually like this

599
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,460
after drinking?

600
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,770
Yes.

601
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,180
How much could she usually drink?

602
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
About 80 ml.

603
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,600
How much did she drink that day?

604
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,730
Less than that.

605
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,700
So her intake that day

606
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,420
wasn't enough
to cause loss of consciousness?

607
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,940
I don't know.

608
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,940
You gave her a condom

609
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,220
and told her

610
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,770
it could increase

611
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,066
her chance of surviving a rape

612
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:51,180
when encountering a criminal,
didn't you?

613
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,220
Chuchu, please answer my question.

614
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,180
Witness Chuchu,
please answer the question.

615
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,220
No.

616
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,619
I never gave it to her,

617
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,911
nor did I say anything like that.

618
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,570
What are you saying?

619
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,180
Tell the truth!

620
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,490
Mind the court discipline.

621
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,540
Sit down.

622
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,380
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

623
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,570
Prosecutor.

624
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,860
Do you have any questions
for the witness?

625
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,460
In your statement,

626
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,860
you clearly said

627
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,570
Ye Sibei was dazed
when you got out of the car.

628
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,090
Why change your story now,

629
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,755
saying she could recognize people
and make phone calls clearly?

630
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,140
I thought it meant she was dazed

631
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,570
if she kept talking.

632
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,220
What exactly do you mean

633
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,860
by saying she talked non-stop?

634
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,900
When people drink too much,

635
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,180
they say things they don't usually say.

636
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,090
After she got drunk that day,

637
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,900
she talked a lot to me.

638
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Normally, she's someone

639
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,460
who rarely talks about herself.

640
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,420
But that day she held me,

641
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,730
talking about her family

642
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,940
and how upset she felt.

643
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,860
Your Honor, I have no more questions.

644
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,620
Bailiff, escort witness Chuchu out.

645
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,180
The victim claimed
that she was forced to cooperate

646
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,460
and scratched my client

647
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,220
throughout the incident.

648
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,330
Everyone, look at the position
of the scratches in this photo.

649
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,490
Isn't this

650
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,900
why such scratch marks
were more likely to appear?

651
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,740
So it's reasonable to suspect

652
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,570
that such an intimate posture

653
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,420
shows the victim cooperated.

654
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Prosecutor reminds defense

655
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,940
that the court examines facts,

656
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,420
not speculation.

657
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,210
There's a time gap between the incident

658
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,940
and the victim's injury assessment.

659
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,170
But the scratches still remained,

660
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,490
which shows

661
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,420
the victim made a desperate struggle

662
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,090
in an extreme situation.

663
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,690
And the scratches being deep and messy

664
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,940
further prove

665
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,170
the victim fought back fiercely.

666
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,690
But it's also possible

667
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,860
they were caused
by sexual pleasure, right?

668
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,780
Defense.

669
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,170
Please do not interrupt
the prosecutor's speech.

670
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,170
Prosecutor, continue.

671
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,740
I emphasize again

672
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,940
that the so-called scratches
from sexual pleasure

673
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,420
are pure speculation.

674
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,690
Defense should respect facts.

675
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,460
The court should disregard such claims.

676
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,690
(Prosecutor)
Record defense for disrupting order.

677
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,010
My first statement is finished.

678
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,570
Your Honor, I'll be careful later.

679
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,410
I understand.

680
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,340
Actually, what I wanted to say

681
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,570
is that whether active or passive,

682
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,010
the scratches in the photo

683
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,300
strongly support

684
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,570
that they were in an embrace.

685
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,420
The victim claimed

686
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,690
she never saw the defendant's face.

687
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,130
But her eyes are clearly open

688
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,300
in that photo.

689
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,530
The victim's statement

690
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,460
is completely inconsistent

691
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,090
with the injury assessment and photo.

692
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,340
I argue

693
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,420
that a single photo

694
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,210
only records a moment.

695
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,170
Its authenticity and relevance
are doubtful.

696
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,210
Without other supporting evidence,

697
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,780
it cannot show

698
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,210
the real situation then.

699
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,490
Even a captured expression existing

700
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,170
does not mean clear awareness.

701
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,610
If the victim were fully conscious

702
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,980
while looking at the suspect
taking photos,

703
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,460
how could she show no instinctive shame

704
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,260
or reaction to avoid the flash?

705
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,980
Thus, I believe

706
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,780
that this photo,

707
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,740
where she seems calm and clear-minded,

708
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,570
actually proves

709
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,610
the victim had already
lost consciousness,

710
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,300
showing no normal reaction.

711
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,420
The victim was not fully conscious.

712
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,130
Her usual tolerance exceeded 80 ml.

713
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,460
All witnesses' statements,
including hers,

714
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,530
confirm that day's amount

715
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,260
was not enough for a full blackout.

716
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,900
And witness Chuchu confirmed

717
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,420
that when they separated,

718
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,490
the victim could recognize people

719
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,010
and make phone calls
logically and clearly.

720
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,210
So the prosecutor believes

721
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,740
the claim of confusion

722
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,050
is unfounded.

723
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,980
The victim was not fully conscious,

724
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,929
which is supported

725
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,860
not only by the evidence
submitted by the defense,

726
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,300
but also
by other relevant case evidence.

727
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,460
They've been examined in court.

728
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,570
I think
there's no need for repetition.

729
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,460
Also,
the voice recording evidence shows

730
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,380
that the defendant

731
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,266
accused the victim of extortion
on one hand,

732
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:01,050
but bribed her through the company

733
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,420
on the other hand,

734
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,690
trying to make her change her statement

735
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,820
and withdraw charges.

736
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,900
Such actions show

737
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,340
the defendant trying to cover his crime

738
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,460
and attempting
to escape legal punishment.

739
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,940
The fact
that the victim thought of recording it

740
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,170
shows strong legal awareness,

741
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,610
so it raises suspicion

742
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,210
that she recorded it

743
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,940
to threaten the accused.

744
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,170
Her providing her recording

745
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,260
to the authorities

746
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,259
was her legal right,

747
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,400
not an act of extortion,
as claimed by the defense.

748
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,090
But aren't such contradictions

749
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,050
common in this case?

750
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,300
She said she had no awareness,

751
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,260
yet her intake that day

752
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,820
wasn't enough for a blackout.

753
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,570
I call this speculation

754
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,940
without a factual basis.

755
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,780
Alcohol tolerance alone

756
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,822
is not the sole standard
for judging awareness.

757
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,860
Her unawareness

758
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,420
was a fact.

759
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,050
Footage outside the hotel shows

760
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,130
she was helped into the car,

761
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,300
unable to walk by herself,
after being drunk.

762
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,610
It clearly shows
she was drunk and dazed.

763
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,530
But witness Chuchu's

764
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,610
latest in-court testimony shows

765
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,130
that when they separated,

766
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,420
the victim should've been sober,

767
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,900
not what she described

768
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,460
as loss of consciousness,

769
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,300
nor total blackout.

770
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,420
The credibility
of witness Chuchu's testimony

771
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,170
should be

772
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,380
assessed with all the evidence.

773
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,460
(Defense)
In her statement,

774
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,420
the victim never mentioned

775
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,780
anything about condoms.

776
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,460
But there was indeed a condom wrapper

777
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,940
at the scene.

778
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,420
The victim claimed

779
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,900
Chuchu told her to take the condom,

780
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,420
but Chuchu flatly denied it.

781
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,780
The victim's statement

782
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,940
is full of contradictions.

783
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,820
So how truthful

784
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,610
is her testimony?

785
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,610
With such a contradictory statement,

786
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,900
what exactly is the victim hiding?

787
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,210
Is it the truth?

788
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,130
Defense,

789
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,420
please stop making wild speculations.

790
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,820
(Judge)
Both sides, remain calm.

791
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,980
Now, the prosecutor and defense

792
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,780
shall proceed to the second argument.

793
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,090
Your Honors.

794
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,940
In this case,

795
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,530
the defendant was the victim's superior.

796
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,460
There was no ambiguity
between them before the incident.

797
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,050
There's no basis
for voluntary sexual intercourse.

798
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,610
On the day of the incident,

799
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,260
there was improper urging to drink.

800
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,380
As her superior, the defendant

801
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,170
let it happen

802
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,610
(Defendant)
instead of stopping it.

803
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,740
Video and witness evidence show

804
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,820
the victim was already drunk.

805
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,610
Her mind was unclear,

806
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,300
and her resistance weakened.

807
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,610
The defendant
took the drunk victim alone

808
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,900
to a canola field.

809
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,820
He created an environment

810
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,130
that was completely
closed and overpowering,

811
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,530
causing the victim

812
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,530
to have limited ability to resist,

813
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,490
unable to fight back,

814
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,010
unable to effectively resist,

815
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,420
to be at the defendant's mercy,

816
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
and subject to his assault.

817
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
After the incident,

818
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,420
the victim
immediately called the police,

819
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,733
requested a physical examination
and preserved evidence.

820
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,420
Though later
she retracted under pressure,

821
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,570
that cannot deny

822
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,170
the existence of the crime.

823
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,780
Considering her accusations,

824
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,780
documents, objects, expert opinions,

825
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,570
and audiovisual evidence,

826
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,610
the prosecution believes

827
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,340
that the defendant Fan Jiancheng

828
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,900
used violence, coercion, and other means

829
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,090
to force sexual intercourse
against her will,

830
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,610
violating Article 236
of the People's Republic of China's

831
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,050
Criminal Law,

832
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,340
constituting the crime of rape.

833
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,740
The facts are clear,

834
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,940
and he should be held criminally liable.

835
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,980
We ask the court to rule by law.

836
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,300
Your Honor, the prosecutor rests.

837
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,420
Now, the defense
shall give their final statement.

838
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,780
Your Honors.

839
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
In this case,

840
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,170
the victim sought a home loan
for her brother

841
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,730
and used
my client's position in the company

842
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:51,088
to falsify a salary certificate
before the incident.

843
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,530
When her husband found out,

844
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,420
their marriage began to fracture.

845
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,740
It can thus be concluded

846
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,780
that she and the defendant
had private contact,

847
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,260
and she was in serious need of money,

848
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,820
with motive to extort the accused.

849
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,610
In this case,

850
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,130
the defendant's statement

851
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,090
matches other evidence overall,

852
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,380
showing no flaws,

853
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,090
while the victim's statement

854
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,340
differs from witnesses
and physical evidence.

855
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,570
Detective Lin Feng,

856
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,940
out of sympathy as a woman,

857
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,420
showed subjective bias in this case,

858
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,780
making the evidence partial

859
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,780
and unreliable.

860
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,090
The prosecution's
conviction of my client

861
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,420
lacks direct evidence,

862
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
relying mainly on assumptions.

863
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,860
But in common sense,

864
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,340
the victim brought a condom that day.

865
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,170
And her alcohol intake

866
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,130
was not enough to cause a blackout,

867
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,860
yet she claimed no awareness.

868
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,980
Knowing her route
differed from Chuchu's,

869
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,010
she knew

870
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,170
she would be alone on the way,

871
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,570
yet chose my client, an older man,

872
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,610
to drive her home.

873
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,530
Though she called police later,

874
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,570
she didn't mention
sexual assault directly.

875
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,610
She only filed
a second report days later.

876
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,980
These actions defy common logic.

877
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,860
Thus, the defense believes

878
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,380
the facts are unclear
and the evidence is insufficient.

879
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,170
We cannot confirm

880
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,530
that my client committed rape.

881
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,050
He should be acquitted.

882
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,170
(Presiding Judge, Judge)
Your Honor, the defense rests.

883
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,980
Does the litigation agent
have any additional statements?

884
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,340
Your

885
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,050
Honors.

886
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,980
After the dinner
on the night of April 9,

887
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,940
my client got into the defendant's car,

888
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,820
and was taken...

889
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,460
She was taken...

890
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,820
Ye Sibei

891
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,050
is my sister.

892
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,900
She lived her life with great caution.

893
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,740
She loved beauty

894
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,570
but never dared to bare her arms.

895
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,490
She liked makeup

896
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,940
but never wore bright, bold colors.

897
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,090
She rarely went out alone at night.

898
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,860
Most times, she asked our dad

899
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,260
or my brother-in-law to drive her.

900
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,050
The clothes she wore when assaulted

901
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,570
were her company uniform.

902
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,420
She was always mindful of it.

903
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
Even in summer,

904
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,010
she'd cover herself with a coat.

905
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,420
So on the day she called the police,

906
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,610
she told them she needed a coat.

907
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,420
Because that coat

908
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,420
was a kind of sexual protection for her.

909
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,420
When the coat was gone,

910
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,900
she asked the police for it.

911
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,860
That was her way of asking for help.

912
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,300
She wanted to report it,

913
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,340
but my mom stopped her.

914
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,570
I stopped her, too.

915
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,980
Because as a lawyer,

916
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,300
I know such cases cause secondary harm.

917
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,980
So she reported to the police

918
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,490
and denied she ever did.

919
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,380
But my sister
still chose to report again.

920
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,490
It was not for money,

921
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,900
nor to extort anyone.

922
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,420
She just wanted justice.

923
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,940
As a victim

924
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,740
and a woman,

925
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,380
facing something like this

926
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,780
and choosing to report it

927
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,460
already takes great courage.

928
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,460
I believe justice
shouldn't erase her courage.

929
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
She deserves justice.

930
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,820
That's all from me.

931
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,490
The courtroom debate is over.

932
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,300
The panel

933
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,260
will reach a verdict after discussion.

934
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,940
The court is adjourned.
