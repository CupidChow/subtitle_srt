(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
=Episode 15=

5
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,890
Not asleep yet?

6
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,060
What about the money on the card?

7
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,010
It's gone.

8
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
I lost it.

9
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,570
Lost it?

10
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,220
You used that money to gamble?

11
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:22,780
I've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

12
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,660
Not in a good mood.

13
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,820
Stop bothering me.

14
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,220
That's Wenwen's education fund!

15
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,220
You even used that?

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,170
I've tolerated
all your dirty business outside!

17
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,850
And you still used our child's money!

18
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,290
Do you deserve to be a father?

19
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,444
What are you shouting for?

20
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,220
I'll earn the money back later.

21
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,660
I'll make it up. What's the big deal?

22
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,060
Every penny in that fund

23
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,540
was earned by me!

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,660
Besides,

25
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,220
the house and the car!

26
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,570
Didn't I earn every bit by playing dumb?

27
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
You're sick.

28
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,220
You're the one who's sick!

29
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,220
Are you even a father?

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,170
Mind your own business!

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,130
Why are you always so disobedient?

32
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,220
Why do you always yell at me?

33
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
Let go of me! Let go!

34
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,660
Come on.

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,620
Come here.

36
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,620
Hold me.

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,850
Hold me.

38
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,820
- I won't.
- Be good.

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,100
Hold me!

40
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,570
Married for so long,

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,850
you don't even know how to hug?

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm telling you,

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,340
the evidence is in my hands.

44
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,340
Don't push me too far!

45
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,010
You're threatening me?

46
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,850
I'm not even angry.

47
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,380
You know why?

48
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,060
Because if I get caught,

49
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,540
you're my accomplice.

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,340
Then Wenwen

51
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,220
won't just lose her dad,

52
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,730
she'll lose her mom too.

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,540
How scary is that?

54
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,220
Zhao Shuhui, listen to me.

55
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,010
Keep

56
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,730
that video.

57
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,570
Keep it safe for me.

58
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,380
If you want,

59
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,100
you can even watch it.

60
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,220
I don't mind.

61
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,930
Eat more vegetables.

62
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,460
Here.

63
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,660
Have some shrimp.

64
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,660
I will eat more, too.

65
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,980
Same as you.

66
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,690
Sibei.

67
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Do you have plans today?

68
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
What's wrong?

69
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,410
If not,

70
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,844
let's go buy groceries together.

71
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,820

(Nurses' Station)

89
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,980
Hello.

90
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,890
Which ward is Huang Guifen in?

91
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,980
I'll check for you.

92
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,370
She's in bed 219.

93
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,620
How is her condition now?

94
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,250
It's stable at the moment.

95
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,370
She's in recovery now.

96
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,130
That's good.

97
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,060
Please help me give this to her.

98
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,700
You're not going in?

99
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,460
I've got something urgent to deal with.

100
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,580
Thank you.

101
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,850
All right.

102
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,730
Family of patient 219.

103
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,850
- I was just looking for you.
- Miss.

104
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,088
A lady just now asked me
to give you this fruit basket.

105
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,700
Thank you, Miss.

106
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,300
Where is she?

107
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:18,488
She said she had
something urgent and left first.

108
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,180
Sibei, these are Mom's
clothes to change into.

109
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,200
I'll just leave them here.

110
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,890
Have you eaten?

111
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,730
Yes, I have.

112
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,300
Mom, look what I brought you.

113
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,300
You used to buy these
for me when I was little.

114
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,650
I want you to try blowing it too.

115
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,890
The doctor said it might help,

116
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,333
and could stimulate the muscles here.

117
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,140
All right, that's enough.

118
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,460
Don't blow too hard.

119
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,911
Your blood vessels are still blocked.

120
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,650
Okay.

121
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,866
- Slow down.
- Give it to me.

122
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,770
I'll put it away for you.

123
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,160
Right.

124
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,650
Use more strength
in your right foot, Mom.

125
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,340
The doctor said
you need to use that leg.

126
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,180
Don't stop after just a few steps.

127
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,377
I can't use any strength.

128
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,140
Right foot.

129
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,460
Put more effort into your right foot.

130
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,940
Water.

131
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,980
Don't try to get out of it.

132
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,060
No cheating.

133
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:59,580
You can have a drink
after you finish walking.

134
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,980
You're stopping already?

135
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,300
Then I'll call the doctor.
I'll tell him you refuse to walk.

136
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,511
That you won't do your exercises.

137
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,940
I'll cut you a piece later.

138
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,460
Slow down.

139
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,530
We'll stop when we reach the front.

140
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,530
See, that's not bad at all.

141
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,060
Right, that's good.

142
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,300
Just a few more steps.

143
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,180
Come on, right foot.

144
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,140
Good.

145
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,460
Right foot.

146
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,850
Yes, right foot.

147
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,140
That's it.

148
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:09,980
Go.

149
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,022
Congratulations, Ms. Huang.
You're discharged.

150
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,650
Goodbye.

151
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,940
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

152
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,940
Sibei.

153
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,460
We're leaving soon.

154
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,333
Is there anything you still want to do?

155
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,980
Not really.

156
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,060
But since you asked,

157
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,770
I do want to see someone.

158
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,300
Who?

159
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Mr. Yang.

160
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,580
Mr. Yang?

161
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,820
He was my Chinese teacher
in my high school.

162
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,900
His name is Yang Qiyu.

163
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,420
He's a really kind person.

164
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,740
I almost couldn't finish my senior year.

165
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,140
He told me
there was a donation program

166
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,740
and helped me apply for a place.

167
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,422
It was a direct donation of 20,000 yuan.

168
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,220
That's how I got to stay in school.

169
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,620
You really should thank him.

170
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,140
What about the donor, then?

171
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,470
Do you know who it was?

172
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,700
No idea.

173
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,810
If I ever find out,
I'll properly thank him.

174
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,500
But that can wait till later.

175
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,020
I have nothing right now.

176
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Nothing to offer in return.

177
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,060
All right, when I make more money,

178
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,940
we'll thank him together.

179
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,540
What about you?

180
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,420
Is there anything
you want to do before leaving?

181
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,860
I'll tidy up the shop
and hand it over to Jun.

182
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,900
Dad called,

183
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,620
and said the drainpipe at home broke.

184
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,140
I'll just replace it completely.

185
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,266
No point fixing it again.

186
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,980
He can't fix it without me anyway.

187
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,460
And then I'll go see...

188
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,020
Qin Nan.

189
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,900
I mean you.

190
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,660
Your own plans.

191
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,020
Not just things for me.

192
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,260
That is what I want to do.

193
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,980
You can't live only for me.

194
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,100
You should have your own life.

195
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,020
What are you saying?

196
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,044
You're overthinking it.

197
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,540
We're leaving Nancheng because of me.

198
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,460
You're working for me.

199
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,260
Everything is because of me.

200
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,180
You do everything for me.

201
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,177
It makes me
feel like I'm dragging you down.

202
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,420
Sibei.

203
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,820
We're husband and wife.

204
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,540
Isn't that what couples do?

205
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,900
When hardship comes,

206
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,260
we face it together.

207
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,020
All right.

208
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm just

209
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
sleep-deprived and overthinking.

210
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,460
Go on, get to work.

211
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,140
Okay, I'll stop being in your way then.

212
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,660
I'm off.

213
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,620
I'm off.

214
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,820
Tonight,

215
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,780
let's make some noodles.

216
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,260
Noodles with tomato sauce.

217
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,660
- Tomato and egg?
- Okay.

218
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,020
Okay.

219
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,460
I'll make it a bit sweeter for you.

220
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,700
- Sure.
- All right.

221
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,020
Then add some...

222
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,180
Would one slice of beef be enough?

223
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
One slice is enough.

224
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,900
Just one slice?

225
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,820
That's all you want?

226
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,900
One slice is enough.

227
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:56,700
The tickets are fine, right?

228
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,540
No problem.

229
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,260
Buy me two more tickets
for next Wednesday.

230
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,420
Two more of the same, right?

231
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,660
Next Wednesday, same time.

232
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,900
Wait for me here.

233
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,820
Okay.

234
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,100
This is the deposit.

235
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,100
Make sure you're on time.

236
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,300

Do you have anything
you want to do today?

261
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,740
Nothing much.

262
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,020
This is fine as it is.

263
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,380
I'm thinking
of taking some time to relax.

264
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,220
Where to?

265
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,420
I'll go with you.

266
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,460
I want to go alone.

267
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,060
To Guangzhou.

268
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,180
When...

269
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
When are you going?

270
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,300
Wednesday.

271
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,780
I've already bought the ticket.

272
00:24:57,911 --> 00:25:00,180
You won't blame me
for deciding on my own, will you?

273
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,940
Are you upset?

274
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,820
No.

275
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,260
When will you visit Mr. Yang?

276
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,220
Tomorrow, I guess.

277
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,540
It's the weekend.

278
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,780
He should be at home.

279
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,420
We can visit my parents on Monday.

280
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,780
And Tuesday...

281
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,740
Do you have anything
planned for Tuesday?

282
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,900
You're just going on a trip,

283
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,780
not leaving forever.

284
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,500
Why pack the schedule so tight?

285
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,980
You're right. I'm rushing it.

286
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:58,380
(Happiness)

287
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,460
Mr. Yang.

288
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,180
Over here, Sibei.

289
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,540
Mr. Yang.

290
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,380
Sibei.

291
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,460
This is the Chinese teacher
I told you about.

292
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,740
Mr. Yang.

293
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,220
This is Qin Nan, my husband.

294
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
Hello, Mr. Yang.

295
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,180
Mr. Yang is like family to me.

296
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
No need to be so formal.

297
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,380
Time flies, doesn't it?

298
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,140
You've grown and matured.

299
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,980
Come in.

300
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,880
Let's go.

301
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,820
This way.

302
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,300
Long time no see, Sibei.

303
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,180
How's your mother doing?

304
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,300
Is she recovering well?

305
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,980
Much better. She's out of the hospital.

306
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,700
Now she's just recovering at home.

307
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,580
That's good.

308
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Mr. Yang, let me do that.

309
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,380
Careful, it's hot. Here.

310
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,660
Qin Nan.

311
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,220
Go on.

312
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,460
Mr. Yang, Mrs. Yang.

313
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,580
A toast to you both.

314
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,820
Wishing you health and longevity.

315
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,300
And happiness every day.

316
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,140
Thank you.

317
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,180
I wish you two as well.

318
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,940
Success in your careers,

319
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,980
and a happy family.

320
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,700
May you have a child soon.

321
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,460
Here.

322
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,060
- Drink more.
- Sure.

323
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,340
Here, have some food.

324
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,700
- Eat more.
- Mr. Yang, let me top up your glass.

325
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,380
Sibei.

326
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,220
You poor child,

327
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,340
why has your life
been so full of hardship?

328
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,740
Mr. Yang, let's not talk about that.

329
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:52,740
Let me drink to you again.

330
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,700
Come on. Sit.

331
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,540
Sibei.

332
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,580
Qin Nan is a good man.

333
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,180
Cherish your life together.

334
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,100
Treasure him

335
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,260
and don't let him down.

336
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,860
What has happened doesn't matter.

337
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,500
What hasn't happened yet
is what's worth thinking about.

338
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,260
You're right, Mr. Yang.

339
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,380
(Nancheng No.2 Middle School)

340
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,500
I don't remember
some of these classmates.

341
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,220
That's normal.

342
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,100
You kept to yourself back then.

343
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,000
This must be our Year One class photo.

344
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,580
Yes.

345
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,860
Let me see.

346
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,180
I'll find where you are in it.

347
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,020
All right,

348
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,700
but why not let me see too?

349
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,900
I want to spot you.

350
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,380
How would you recognize me?

351
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,500
Don't underestimate me. I can find you.

352
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,900
Here, this one, right?

353
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,180
Not bad.

354
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,740
Sharp eyes.

355
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,100
Looking at these photos of you

356
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,340
makes me want to visit your school.

357
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,020
Go then.

358
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,900
Sibei.

359
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,500
Take Qin Nan to see it.

360
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,620
You really want to go?

361
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,860
I do.

362
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,180
That up ahead was my old classroom.

363
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,860
See that spot?

364
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,380
Third row from the back.

365
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,420
That was my seat.

366
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,700
I used to be a top student.

367
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,220
Our class was one
of the best in the grade.

368
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,780
The class across
from us was the worst one.

369
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,580
Mr. Yang was their homeroom teacher.

370
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,020
And also our Chinese teacher.

371
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,420
So you looked down on poor students?

372
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,220
Of course not.

373
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,180
I just worried that
if I worked too hard and did too well,

374
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,420
they'd resent me.

375
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,940
Impossible.

376
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,100
Your school wasn't like that?

377
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,180
Of course not.

378
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,020
Our school was full of poor students.

379
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,220
We were all about the same.

380
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,755
No one could look down on anyone.

381
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,930
Come on.

382
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,380
I'll show you the playground.

383
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,220
Let's go.

384
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:01,020
There used to be
a flag-raising platform over there.

385
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,420
Every Monday, the school would pick

386
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,100
one outstanding student
to give a speech.

387
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,220
I gave one once.

388
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,500
What did you talk about?

389
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,420
Studying hard?

390
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,420
I wrote the speech myself.

391
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,020
Mr. Yang even praised it.

392
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,180
I still remember the title.

393
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,860
"The Best Is Always in the Future."

394
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,820
There's no suffering
that can't be overcome.

395
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,220
No despair that can't be endured.

396
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,300
The strongest thing
is always in our hands.

397
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,420
The best is always in the future.

398
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,420
Three, two, one.

399
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,980
Cheese.

400
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,460
Do you believe that?

401
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,380
I did back then.

402
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,900
And now?

403
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Once I get to
the provincial capital on Wednesday,

404
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,580
I think I'll believe it again.

405
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,020
Sibei.

406
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
Wednesday is my birthday.

407
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,180
Can you not go?

408
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,020
No.

409
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,180
I already bought the train ticket.

410
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,700
It'd be a waste not to go.

411
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,380
I thought your birthday was on the 21st.

412
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,380
That's my lunar birthday.

413
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,666
Then let me celebrate with you at noon.

414
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,740
I'll buy you a cake.

415
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,660
A big one.

416
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,080
Three sides!

417
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,060
Sibei.

418
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,180
You're the only family

419
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:44,180
I have left in this world.

420
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,780
I know.

421
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,140
I've always known.

422
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,500
Because of you,

423
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,580
I feel like

424
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,260
I'm not living in this world alone.

425
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,780
That I have a home.

426
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,660
Ye Sibei.

427
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,540
Thank you.

428
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,900
You're talking so strangely today.

429
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,340
We're here to visit the graves.

430
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
In front of our elders,

431
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
we should speak properly.

432
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
That spot over there,

433
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,380
it'll be for me someday.

434
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,340
Remember that.

435
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,180
There you go again.

436
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,800
You're thinking too far ahead.

437
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,180
Alright.

438
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,140
That's enough.

439
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,220
You go on down first.

440
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,300
I'll tidy up and come down later.

441
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,980
Okay.

442
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,940
Go ahead.

443
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,140
Grandfather.

444
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,060
Father.

445
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,940
Bei.

446
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,900
This is Ye Sibei.

447
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,420
My wife.

448
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,220
My beloved.

449
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,220
(Happiness)

450
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,860
(Officer Lin)

451
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Officer Lin.

452
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,180
I have something to report.

453
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,220
(With you in my life,
every day is joyful.)

454
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,980
Make a wish.

455
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,940
♪Happy birthday to you♪

456
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,380
♪Happy birthday to you♪

457
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,140
♪Happy birthday to you♪

458
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,770
♪Happy birthday to you♪

459
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,140
What did you wish for?

460
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,460
Not telling you.

461
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,180
Here.

462
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
What is it?

463
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,140
Nothing.

464
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,700
Since my grandfather passed away,

465
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:56,700
I haven't celebrated a birthday again.

466
00:40:58,377 --> 00:41:00,044
Thank you for celebrating it with me.

467
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,360
Then I'll celebrate it
with you every year.

468
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,180
Let's cut the cake.

469
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,740
Alright.

470
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,880
Why did Mom put things up so high?

471
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,780
Look how thick the dust is.

472
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,980
Dad, you didn't stop her?

473
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,620
How could I stop her?

474
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,260
If she doesn't put them high,
there's nowhere else to store them.

475
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,180
She still complains about you.

476
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,540
Says you sold the house back then.

477
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,180
Now the prices

478
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,780
keep shooting up.

479
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,740
- Captain Zhang, what brings you here?
- Nianwen.

480
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,300
I came to see your mom.

481
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,980
Just in a personal capacity.

482
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,140
Come in, please.

483
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,180
You're too polite.

484
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,220
Dad, Captain Zhang is here.

485
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,180
He's come to see Mom.

486
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,644
- Hello, Mr. Ye.
- Captain Zhang.

487
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,260
Please, have a seat.

488
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,620
I'll go take a look.

489
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,940
If Mrs. Ye is resting,
don't disturb her.

490
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,460
Let her rest properly.

491
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,580
It's fine. I'll just check.

492
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,460
Alright.

493
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,380
Dad, you go ahead.

494
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,420
- Please sit.
- Sure.

495
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,180
I'll make you a cup of tea,
Captain Zhang.

496
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,700
Nianwen, no need to fuss.

497
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,180
I won't stay long.

498
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,300
It's fine.

499
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,740
Did I come at a bad time?

500
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,060
Looks like you're packing up.

501
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,220
Are you moving house?

502
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,180
My sister and Nan
are going to the provincial capital.

503
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,060
So we're helping to sort out

504
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,500
and pack up my sister's things.
