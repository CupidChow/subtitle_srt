(Butylphthalide Sodium
Chloride Injection)

5
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,850
Mom.

6
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,890
Mom, you're awake.

7
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,410
Leave

8
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,250
Nancheng...

9
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Leave

10
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,730
Nancheng...

11
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,120
Go...

12
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,250
Go...

13
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,220
(Warning: Radiation.
Do not enter when the light is on.)

14
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,820
Don't worry.

15
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,450
They're just taking a scan.

16
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,920
The doctors inside will look after her.

17
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,620
Come.

18
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,660
Sit for a bit.

19
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,900
Sibei.

20
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:10,380
About your mom's hospital stay,

21
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,610
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

22
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,900
If she wants you
to go to the provincial capital,

23
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,740
you should go.

24
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:20,900
I'll handle things here.

25
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,170
With Mom like this,

26
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,020
I can't leave.

27
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,610
You don't trust me
to take care of her, do you?

28
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,820
Well...

29
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,330
You're right.

30
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,420
All these years,

31
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,220
I've never done anything

32
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,688
that could make you feel at ease.

33
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,010
Not once.

34
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,420
Sibei.

35
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,290
When you were born,

36
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,490
I was the one who urged your mom

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,340
to send you to the countryside.

38
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,490
All these years,

39
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,020
you've always thought your mom
was against you in everything,

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,220
blamed you for everything,

41
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,170
and favored Nianwen

42
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,010
over you.

43
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,460
But the truth behind it all...

44
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,410
It was because of me.

45
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,580
Your mom's illness

46
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,820
made me suddenly

47
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,490
realize a lot of things.

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,688
I used to blame her for her temper.

49
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:43,850
But someone
who had to feed the whole family...

50
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,410
If she weren't strong-willed,

51
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,410
how could we have lived
the life we have now?

52
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,460
I've wronged your mom.

53
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,690
And I've wronged you.

54
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,540
You've suffered too much because of me.

55
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,220
Dad, stop talking.

56
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,140
It's time.

57
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,250
This family

58
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:11,850
needs me to take responsibility too.

59
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,770
As a husband,

60
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,420
as a father,

61
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,266
I've been absent for too long.

62
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,250
Sibei,

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,930
listen to your mom.

64
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,570
Go to the provincial capital.

65
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,410
Start a new life there.

66
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm here.

67
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,210
Dad's here.

68
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:32,250
Don't worry.

69
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,940
(Ye Sibei achieved first-tier university
score in first mock exam of Year Three)

70
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,460
(Awarded this certificate
as encouragement)

71
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,020
(Received Sibei's salary, 900 yuan)

72
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,940
(The best things are always ahead...)

(Nancheng People's Hospital)

74
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,530
- Please keep your receipt. Next.
- Thank you.

75
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,890
Hello, I'd like to renew bed 219.

76
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,730
How much is it?

77
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,530
You still need to pay 3,800 yuan.

78
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,060
Can you hurry up?

79
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,460
Sorry,

80
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,420
just a moment.

81
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,940
Come on, hurry up.

82
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,820
Right away.

83
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,650
Hello, 3,800 yuan.

84
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,730
Here.

85
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,440
Is it done?

86
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,650
Total amount 4,000 yuan.

87
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,580
Extra two.

88
00:10:09,244 --> 00:10:10,650
- Please keep your receipt.
- Thank you.

89
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,490
Next.

90
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,180
Hello, Nan.

91
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,460
Hey, Nianwen.

92
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,300
Where's your sister?

93
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,220
She went to collect Mom's CT results.

94
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,850
Alright, got it.

95
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,340
What a coincidence, Sibei.

96
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,530
I'm here with my wife for a check-up.

97
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,130
I heard your mom's unwell, right?

98
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,650
Is she feeling any better lately?

99
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,370
Oh, yes.

100
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,820
Do you need money?

101
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,580
If you're short on money,
you must tell me.

102
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,220
If you're struggling,
I'll help you however I can.

103
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,130
Please leave.

104
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,460
Get out.

105
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,660
Honey,

106
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,370
our appointment's over there.

(Follow the Host for More Perks.)
Welcome to Fan's livestream,

108
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,100
new and old friends alike.
Hello, everyone.

109
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,530
Fan welcomes you all.

110
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,530
If you're new here,
tap that little red heart.

111
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,650
Give me a follow, too.

112
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,250
Today, I'm bringing you

113
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,600
these adorable fortune cats again.

114
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,220
We've got five thousand in stock today,

115
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,180
all available
in the cart and link below.

116
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,530
Just click to order.

117
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,850
(Take this one for example.)

118
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,370
(The Peach Blossom Luck Cat.)

119
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,940
(That's right, you guessed it.
It brings romance and good fortune.)

120
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,180
(We've got five thousand total today.)

121
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,820
(Everyone, raise your lucky right hand,)

122
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,980
(give it a wave,)

123
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,130
(and place your orders quickly!)

124
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,890
(That's right, just like that.)

125
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,770
Officer,

126
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,250
I already told you last time.

127
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,890
That woman drank a lot that night.

128
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,770
Nothing else unusual happened.

129
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,730
Did any of you hand her water?

130
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,490
Or see her drinking any?

131
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,460
We weren't in the room the whole time,

132
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,980
but we didn't give her water.

133
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,940
Manager Yang,

134
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,370
when we took your statement last time,

135
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,100
I remember there were
three waiters present,

136
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,850
right?

137
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,610
Yes.

138
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,340
Then why are there only two today?

139
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,580
Where's the other one?

140
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,220
She's resigned.

141
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,530
Resigned?

142
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,340
Yes.

143
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,420
When was that?

144
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,610
Shortly after that incident happened.

145
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,130
She said she found a better job.

146
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,340
Do you know where she is now?

147
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,460
Meili, these officers
would like a word with you.

148
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,770
I'm sorry,

149
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,340
we'll just need a bit of your time.

150
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,730
It's fine.

151
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,570
Please, have a seat.

152
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,980
We

153
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,010
went to your previous workplace.

154
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,130
They said you'd changed jobs.

155
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,220
Why did you move here?

156
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,730
There's this lady.

157
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,580
She thought I was quite capable at work,

158
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,300
so she introduced me to this place.

159
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,890
The environment's better here,

160
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,100
and the pay's higher, too.

161
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,610
Right, that's fair.

162
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,610
Who's this lady?

163
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,820
Ms. Tao.

164
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,130
She was at that dinner, too.

165
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,850
Show her the photo.

166
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,690
Is this her?

167
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,850
Yes.

168
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,580
Tao Jie, right?

169
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,010
Have you known her long?

170
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,340
No.

171
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,730
Then why did she
recommend you for a job?

172
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,220
She came by the shop
to chat with me one day.

173
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,890
She said we got along well.

174
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,730
Then we realized
we were from the same hometown,

175
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,220
so she helped me find this job.

176
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,130
Same hometown, huh?

177
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,770
Yes.

178
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,100
Ah, hometown ties.

179
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,220
That explains it.

180
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,100
Where are you from?

181
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,940
Zhi County.

182
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,060
Zhi County.

183
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,340
You're here because

184
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,610
of that case, aren't you?

185
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,220
Let me ask you,

186
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,100
the night Ms. Ye got drunk,

187
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,220
did anyone give her water?

188
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,980
Yes, I did.

189
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,420
What's wrong? Don't scare me.

190
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,420
It's fine. Relax.

191
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,530
Just tell us the truth.

192
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,060
Did you pour that glass
of water yourself?

193
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,660
No.

194
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,420
After Ms. Ye vomited that night,

195
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,980
she looked really uncomfortable,

196
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,100
and Mr. Fan
handed me a glass of water.

197
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,980
Waiter.

198
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,940
Yes, Sir?

199
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Do me a favor.

200
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,580
Take this glass of water
to my colleague.

201
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,010
She's had a bit too much to drink.
The one in the coat.

202
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
It'll help her sober up.

203
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,420
Alright.

204
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,260
Thank you.

205
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
Water.

206
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,580
Miss, would you like some water?

207
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,420
Have a drink.

208
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,890
So it was Mr. Fan
who handed you the water?

209
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,090
Fan Jiancheng?

210
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,210
Yes.

211
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,060
Captain Chen, in that drug case
you're investigating,

212
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,010
is there anyone from Nancheng

213
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,088
on the list of registered buyers
of that medicine?

214
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:03,190
Alright, let me know
if anything comes up.

215
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,250
Okay, thanks.

216
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,290
Check if Fan Jiancheng has any record

217
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,940
of purchasing controlled drugs.

218
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,020
Got it.

219
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,340
(Shop for Transfer)

220
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,460
Nan,

221
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,380
everything's ready.

222
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,090
You and your wife are really leaving?

223
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,380
Starting over somewhere new.

224
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:40,733
You've canceled the memberships, right?

225
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,010
I've found a few repair shops for you.

226
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,250
They're all run by my friends.

227
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,660
The only thing is, they're a bit far.

228
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,810
It might be inconvenient
for your commute.

229
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,620
But the business is good,

230
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,490
and the pay's higher.

231
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,420
You can pick whichever you like.

232
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,380
Choose one that suits you.

233
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,660
I wanted to take over the shop,

234
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,666
but I don't have enough money.

235
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,490
I've scraped some together
from my family,

236
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,010
and borrowed from friends,
but it's still not enough.

237
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,850
How much short?

238
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,020
Thirty thousand.

239
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,900
Nan, can you wait for me?

240
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,180
I'll borrow some more
when I go home for Chinese New Year.

241
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,290
No need.

242
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,422
Forget the thirty thousand.

243
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,530
That's not right.

244
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,220
You've been with me for so long.

245
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:25,266
Do you think I'd care
about thirty thousand yuan?

246
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,530
All I want

247
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,660
is for you to look after it.

248
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,180
It's my hard work over all these years.

249
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,940
Don't worry, Nan.

250
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,530
I don't even know what to say.

251
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,940
You and your wife

252
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,620
- need money the most right now...
- Enough.

253
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,090
If we're buddies, don't make a fuss.

254
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,060
Thanks, Nan.

255
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:52,050
Then treat that thirty thousand
as your share.

256
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,420
Let's leave on the first of next month.

257
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,810
That soon?

258
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
You don't want to go?

259
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,620
No.

260
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm just worried it'll be hard for you.

261
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,660
Maybe wait
until Mom recovers before leaving.

262
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,380
Nianwen's still at home anyway.

263
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,250
We can start packing bit by bit.

264
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,810
It's not that far.

265
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,940
We can come back often.

266
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,610
Alright.

267
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,530
Once we've settled down,

268
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,380
we can bring Mom to stay with us.

269
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,250
I warmed you some milk.

270
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,940
It'll help you sleep.

271
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,660
You haven't been resting well lately.

272
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,090
Alright.

273
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,380
It's late. Wash up and get some sleep.

274
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,810
(Alright, here we go.)

275
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,900
(Welcome, everyone,
to Fan's livestream.)

276
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,220
(Thanks for joining us.)

277
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,980
(Raise your lucky left hand,)

278
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,010
(wave it, shake it.)

279
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,010
(Wave and shake your right hand, too.)

280
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,955
(Do you know what that means?
I'll tell you.)

281
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,810
(Follow the host for more perks)
(Wave it high, and shake it.)

282
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,010
(Hurry and place your orders.)

283
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,810
(That's right. Just like that.)

284
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,620
(Everyone type six-six-six in the chat.)

285
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,730
(Girl, don't tease me.)

286
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,810
(I'll tell everyone,)

287
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,860
(whoever raises their right hand,)

288
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,420
(the right hand, this one,)

289
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,290
(and waves it like this,)

290
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,420
(that's the male cat.)

291
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
(What does it mean?)

292
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,530
(Wealth and treasure!)

293
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,050
(Fortune flows from all directions.)

294
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,050
(And when it raises its lucky left hand)

295
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,220
(and waves it to everyone,)

296
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,770
(what does that mean?)

297
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,490
(It means building good connections.)

298
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,770
(Perfect for any kind of shop)

299
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,490
(whether you're in food service...)

300
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,460
Don't watch that.

301
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Why are you watching him?

302
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,740
You're up.

303
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,220
That's strange today.

304
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,530
Why did I sleep so long?

305
00:21:43,755 --> 00:21:45,010
You didn't even wake me up.

306
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,420
Didn't matter. There wasn't much to do.

307
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,644
Might as well sleep more.

308
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,090
I need to go tidy up the shop today.

309
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,250
And give our car a full check.

310
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,820
These next few days,

311
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,220
shouldn't we go to the provincial city

312
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,140
to look at houses?

313
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
Sure.

314
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,530
Why are your dark circles so heavy?

315
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:04,420
Didn't sleep well last night?

316
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,220
I slept fine, though.

317
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,620
Go wash up.

318
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,620
Breakfast's soon.

319
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,570
Nan.

320
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,690
Let me do it.

321
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,860
- I'll do it.
- It's fine.

322
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
I'll do it myself.

323
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,050
No, let me.

324
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,250
Let me serve you one last time.

325
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,010
Sounds like I'm not coming back.

326
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,250
You've got packing to do,

327
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,530
and plenty at home to handle.

328
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,050
I've got this.

329
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,860
After this, I'll check
all four-wheel alignment

330
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,810
and everything for you.

331
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,140
- Don't worry.
- Alright.

332
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,288
Make sure to fill up the tank.

333
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,730
I've got a long drive tomorrow.

334
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,860
Got it, don't worry.

335
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,250
Ms. Tao, where are you going later?

336
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,980
I've no time for fun.

337
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,490
I'm picking up my kid soon.

338
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,466
Where are you two off to?

339
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:22,810
We're going to catch a film.

340
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,770
There seem to be
quite a few new ones lately.

341
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,220
Recommend me a good one later.

342
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,900
Sure.

343
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,620
We'll get going then.

344
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,530
Alright, take care.

345
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

346
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,730
Master.

347
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,570
She's out.

348
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,250
You...

349
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,050
Sorry about that.

350
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,250
It's you.

351
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,250
Captain Zhang, are you alright?

352
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,090
I'm fine.

353
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,330
Didn't actually bump me.

354
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,250
It gave me a fright.

355
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,490
It also scared me half to death.

356
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,050
You scared me, and I scared you.

357
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,570
What are you doing here?

358
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,620
Just handling some work nearby.

359
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,050
Happened to pass through.

360
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,900
You're off work or out on business?

361
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,010
Off work.

362
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,066
Going to pick up my child.

363
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,010
Did you finish work this early?

364
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,733
Finished everything early today,
so I left.

365
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,060
Well...

366
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,890
Uh...

367
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,730
I remember you're
the finance director, right?

368
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,770
Yes, finance director.

369
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,420
So, when you joined there,

370
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,730
you were already the director?

371
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,420
Or did you work your way up?

372
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,570
I worked my way up little by little.

373
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,220
Impressive.

374
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,250
Promoted to finance director
in just four years.

375
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,730
You're a local, right?

376
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,180
Yes, I'm from Nancheng.

377
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,140
What's your relationship
with Fan Jiancheng?

378
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,810
Mr. Fan and I have no private contact.

379
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,050
Only work matters.

380
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,620
Is Wu Meili a relative of yours?

381
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,690
Who?

382
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,650
Wu Meili.

383
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,300
Wu Meili...

384
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,380
You mean Meili?

385
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,220
Yes.

386
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,140
She's a distant relative of mine.

387
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,900
What about her?

388
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,380
Nothing, just came to mind.

389
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,980
Just asking.

390
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,050
No worries.

391
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,620
It's nothing?

392
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,380
People say
you've treated her pretty well, right?

393
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,460
That's only right.

394
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,620
Captain Zhang,
I've got to go pick up my kid.

395
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,290
- Alright, go ahead.
- Alright.

396
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,460
- I'm fine.
- I'll be off then.

397
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:27,290
Nice car you've got.

398
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,810
Bought on a loan.

399
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,460
Drive safe.

400
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,860
Did you two
know each other long before that?

401
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,530
She came to the shop
to chat with me last time.

402
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,290
She said we really clicked.

403
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,250
Then, we found out
we were from the same place.

404
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,570
So she introduced me here.

405
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,810
Where are you both from?

406
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,650
From Zhi County.

407
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,820
Zhi County.

408
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,610
Master.

409
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,930
Well?

410
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,620
That Tao Jie

411
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:05,530
is definitely hiding something.

412
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,260
Here.

413
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,890
What about yours?

414
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:35,177
I've already finished mine.

415
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,050
I'm going to shower.

416
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,400
(Nancheng Pharmaceuticals)

417
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,330
Why did I sleep so long again?

418
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,060
You're awake?

419
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,860
It's been strange lately, really.

420
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,290
How can I sleep that long?

421
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,770
I usually wake up around 6 AM.

422
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,530
Sleeping more's not bad.

423
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,220
You've been too tired recently.

424
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,400
But didn't we agree

425
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,250
to go to the provincial city
to see houses today?

426
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,620
I've already made the appointment.

427
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,860
Let's get ready and go.

428
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,770
Dad called and said Mom wants soup.

429
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,155
I need to simmer it for six hours.

430
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,155
You go by yourself.

431
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,220
That's a big decision.

432
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,290
Can I really decide alone?

433
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,620
I trust your judgment.

434
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,890
Alright, then.

435
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,530
Breakfast's on the table.

436
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,460
Eat it while it's hot.

437
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,650
Hello, Jun?

438
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,250
Didn't I tell you to fill up the tank?

439
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,050
Why's it only half full?

440
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,220
I did fill it completely.

441
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,460
The receipt's still in the car.

442
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,740
Got it.

443
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,300
Hello?

444
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,530
Hey, Sir. The moving boxes
you ordered have arrived.

445
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,530
I'm at your door.

446
00:29:06,822 --> 00:29:08,330
Alright, just leave them by the door.

447
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,220
Someone's home.

448
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,844
I've been knocking for ages,
but no one answered.

449
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,220
No one's there?

450
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,140
My wife said
she was staying home to make soup.

451
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,730
Well, I've been knocking
for a while, but still no answer.

452
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,220
I'll leave them at the door.
I've got more deliveries to make.

453
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,290
Okay, got it.

454
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,220
Leave them there.

455
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,660
(Sibei)

456
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,290
Sibei.

457
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,300
Sibei.

458
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,380
Sibei.

459
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,820
Hello, Nianwen?

460
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,380
Is your sister at the hospital?

461
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,980
No, why?

462
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,820
What's wrong, Nan?

463
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,140
Nothing.

464
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,060
Master.

465
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,010
Tao Jie and Fan Jiancheng
really are having an affair.

466
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,370
Who are we targeting?

467
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,730
Fan Jiancheng, of course.

468
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,460
Slow down.

469
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,060
Ye Sibei.

470
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,810
What are you doing here?

471
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,220
I came to buy some bread.

472
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,010
Captain Zhang, are you on a case?

473
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,220
No, just passing by.

474
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,060
Passing by.

475
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:01,980
Alright, I'll let you work.

476
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,050
I'll head over there.

477
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,220
Sure, take care.

478
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,330
You're back.

479
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,050
When did you get home?

480
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,380
Just now.

481
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,570
Why didn't you answer my call?

482
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,290
My phone ran out of battery.

483
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,380
Where did you go?

484
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,380
To the hospital.

485
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,290
You haven't eaten, right?

486
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,220
I'll cook for you.

487
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,010
You forgot to drink this.

488
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,620
What about yours?

489
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,530
I've finished mine.

490
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,890
Qin Nan.

491
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,370
Qin Nan.

492
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,300
Qiang.

493
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,210
Mr. Fan.

494
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,650
Mr. Wang, luck's on your side tonight.

495
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,260
Not bad, up two hundred thousand today.

496
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,100
Take care.

497
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,660
Mr. Wang.

498
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,210
You're too kind.

499
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,466
Keep it for the lads to have tea.

500
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,090
Alright, then.

501
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,570
Take care. Come again soon.

502
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,380
Three sides top.

503
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,420
Four sides blow.

504
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,170
- Nine.
- Nine.

505
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,170
Three sides!

506
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,010
Dealer's call.

507
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,990
Three sides.

508
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,860
No joke.

509
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,780
Sir, you're brilliant.

510
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,210
No more bets.

511
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,700
Five fives.

512
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,090
The player opens one card.

513
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,660
Six fives.

514
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Oh, come on.

515
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,660
No more bets.

516
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,740
- The dealer draws.
- Open one card.

517
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,220
That's a good one.

518
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,300
First time here.

519
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,490
No five points.

520
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,533
The dealer has five points.

521
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,620
Turn to the player.

522
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
Nine up.

523
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,260
- Got nine.
- Yes.

524
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,050
Four times.

525
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,850
Triple payout!

526
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,340
Why's your luck so bad?

527
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
If you're that good, come and try.

528
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,780
Why is your body so cold?

529
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,780
I was reading outside just now.
Didn't wear enough.

530
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,260
Go to sleep.

531
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,450
Sibei.

532
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,570
Next month
we'll move to the provincial city.

533
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,820
Start our life over.

534
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,980
We'll have a wonderful future.

535
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,660
I know.

536
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,090
You and me...

537
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,460
We'll all

538
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,010
