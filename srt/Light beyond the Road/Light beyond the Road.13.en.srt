00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
=Episode 13=

4
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,250
Mom.

5
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,130
Mom.

6
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,100
Come in, quickly.

7
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,210
- Dad.
- Have you eaten?

8
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,770
Sit down.

9
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,980
- What happened?
- Sit down.

10
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,660
Come, sit.

11
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,330
Sit, and I'll tell you.

12
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,170
Sit.

13
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:06,660
It's nothing serious.

14
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,100
- What's wrong?
- It's fine.

15
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,260
It's fine.

16
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,170
Nianwen's been

17
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,610
acting a bit strange lately.

18
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,260
He's not eating well

19
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,340
and not sleeping well.

20
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,450
All he thinks about
is his sister's matter.

21
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,850
He keeps saying
he must seek justice for her.

22
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,410
He's right to feel that way.

23
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,730
But you know,

24
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,490
we...

25
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,260
We can't fight those
who have power, can we?

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,540
I'm just worried that if he...

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,380
Mom.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
Please don't worry too much.

29
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,170
I'll go and talk to Nianwen later.

30
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,260
That's good.

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,340
How's Sibei doing now?

32
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,570
She...

33
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,100
She's a bit tired.

34
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,940
She hasn't got much strength.

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,850
But don't worry, Mom.

36
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,540
We've already been to the hospital.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,380
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,780
See?

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,610
I told her...

40
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't talk.

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,340
She's just keeping
everything bottled up.

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,890
I know her too well.

43
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,170
She's been stubborn
since she was little.

44
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,540
When she gets in a mood,

45
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,450
she won't talk for days.

46
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,380
I had no choice.

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,500
I'd buy her an apple,

48
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
steam it for her, and she'd eat...

49
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,450
How could I forget that?

50
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,260
I'll go and buy some apples now.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,450
- Sit here.
- Mom.

52
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,940
I'll go now.

53
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,060
She can't eat anything.

54
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,130
She has to eat.

55
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,220
We all have to eat.

56
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,066
Our whole family needs to let this go

57
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,010
as soon as possible.

58
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,220
You wait here.

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,100
I'll be right back.

60
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,340
Busy right now.

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,540
Wangwang.

62
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,130
Wangwang's back.

63
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,980
Guifen.

64
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,060
Doing some grocery shopping?

65
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,730
Ms. Li.

66
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,340
Why are you running the stall today?

67
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Where's Zhang?

68
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,290
Guifen, he hasn't been able
to get up early lately.

69
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,290
So we swapped shifts.

70
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,250
What would you like?

71
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,820
Some apples.

72
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,177
- Sure.
- Which one's better?

73
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,490
Pick the big ones.

74
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Alright.

75
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,250
Sixteen yuan fifty.

76
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,850
Just make it sixteen.

77
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,020
Thanks.

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,300
All set.

79
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,730
Take care, Guifen.

80
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,250
You know her family well?

81
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,980
Yeah, quite well.

82
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,410
Well, about her daughter's case...

83
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,250
Is it true?

84
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,660
The court's already ruled.

85
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,370
Her daughter, Sibei,

86
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,980
has never been obedient.

87
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,140
Always talking back to her mom.

88
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,290
Wild sort of girl.

89
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,130
Li Mingyu!

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,570
What did you just say?

91
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,290
Guifen.

92
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,580
I didn't say anything.

93
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,250
Say that again.

94
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,460
What's the matter?

95
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,730
Can't we even talk now?

96
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,660
Huang Guifen, stop causing trouble here!

97
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,540
Over there.

98
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,250
Stop fighting! Stop!

99
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,580
Here, this way!

100
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,540
Excuse me.

101
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:33,730
Stop fighting!

102
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,490
Mom!

103
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,330
Stop fighting!

104
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,370
Stop it, Mom!

105
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,290
So you've brought backup too?

106
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:38,930
Stop it!

107
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,770
Guifen!

108
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,900
You've no conscience left, have you?

109
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980
Tell me.

110
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,290
I must've been blind.

111
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,460
Others badmouth Sibei,

112
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,660
and you join in, do you?

113
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,610
Do you even know what's right or wrong?

114
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,730
Even if others don't know Sibei, you do!

115
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,580
My Sibei's been a good child

116
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,810
since the day she was born!

117
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,290
She's always done well at school!

118
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,020
She's always been a model student!

119
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,490
She's always come top of her class!

120
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,850
When your family
first moved into the city,

121
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,400
your child couldn't keep up at school.

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,580
Who tutored your kid?

123
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,660
How long did your kid
eat at our table?

124
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,050
You've forgotten that, haven't you?

125
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,850
And now you...

126
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,490
- Have you no conscience left?
- Mom!

127
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,140
Do you have any shame at all?

128
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,100
Look at the mess
you've made of my stall!

129
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,239
You'll pay for that!

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,410
Fine, how much? I'll pay you!

131
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,290
At least five hundred!

132
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,850
Money's all you care about, isn't it?

133
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,650
Here!

134
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
Mom.

135
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,940
Move aside.

136
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,088
Li Mingyu, listen to me.

137
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,020
My daughter

138
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,540
has been wronged.

139
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,660
We'll keep appealing.

140
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,290
Until that scum ends up in prison.

141
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,930
Do you hear me?

142
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,450
Mom.

143
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,444
- Let's go home.
- And all of you!

144
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,930
I'm warning every single one of you!

145
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,540
From now on, if anyone dares

146
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,290
to speak ill of my daughter again,

147
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,540
I'll tear your mouth apart!

148
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,340
Mom, let's go home.

149
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,450
Let's go home.

150
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,100
- Stop staring, everyone.
- Calm down.

151
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,450
Forget it.

152
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,900
Calm down, Ms. Li.

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,000
Alright, disperse now.

154
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,930
- Calm down.
- Nothing to see. Move along.

155
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,610
Go on.

156
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,450
It's over now.

157
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,930
Mom.

158
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,220
Have a sip of water. Calm down.

159
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,980
I'm fine.

160
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,460
Put it there. Sit down.

161
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,980
Sit.

162
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,490
Guifen,

163
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,340
you and Ms. Li are usually so close.

164
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,900
So why are you fighting with her
in public today?

165
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,490
Aren't you ashamed?

166
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,930
After all, I was a teacher once.

167
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,900
Consider my reputation, will you?

168
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Fine, call me a shrew.

169
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:56,930
I've embarrassed you, have I?

170
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,810
You always side

171
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,900
with whoever's doing well

172
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,190
and go with whoever flatters you.

173
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,140
What are you saying?

174
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Unreasonable.

175
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,180
Ye Ling.

176
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,660
I'm unreasonable, am I?

177
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,050
When I married you,

178
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,100
was I like this?

179
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:12,644
If I'd been like this back then,
would you have married me?

180
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,340
I'm unreasonable?

181
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,250
I'll tell you this.

182
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,140
If anyone again, in front of me,

183
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
speaks ill of Ye Sibei,

184
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,610
I'll still make a scene.

185
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,490
What's the big deal?

186
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,050
I don't care about saving face anymore.

187
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,340
What do I care about?

188
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,730
No.

189
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,580
There are many people
saying such things.

190
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,688
You can't go after each one

191
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:27,977
and argue with them, can you?

192
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,490
Look,

193
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,777
because you argued today,

194
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,940
you lost five hundred yuan.

195
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,890
That's what you'd say as her father.

196
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,890
Do you know

197
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,460
how they spoke about Ye Sibei?

198
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,650
Do you know how awful those words were?

199
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,940
Sibei is a victim.

200
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,340
She was forced!

201
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,100
Do you know how scared she was then?

202
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,580
Who cared?

203
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,340
How can you be the same as them?

204
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:48,466
I ask you!

205
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,100
Back then,
you were full of righteous anger.

206
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,220
You wanted to call the police.

207
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Now Fan Jiancheng is
swaggering around again.

208
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,610
What have you done?

209
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,100
You just cower at home!

210
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,220
You good for nothing.

211
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,340
What can I do?

212
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,220
I could take a knife and kill him?

213
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,080
If I'd known it'd come to this,

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,511
I might have taken the money
and settled it privately back then.

215
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,490
Ye Ling.

216
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,130
Get out.

217
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,820
Wait, Mom.

218
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,650
Mom!

219
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,820
I really can't stand you anymore!

220
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,610
- What have you done for this family?
- I...

221
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,980
What have you ever done?

222
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,130
I was just agreeing with you!

223
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,220
Answer me!

224
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,610
Ye Ling, I'm asking you!

225
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,460
Ye Sibei's

226
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,370
innocence and dignity...

227
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,220
How much are they worth?
Name your price!

228
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,490
Alright.

229
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,850
I was wrong.

230
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,370
Mom.

231
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,490
Let's not argue with him.

232
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,010
Dad.

233
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,490
How could you say something like that?

234
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,330
You...

235
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,220
I just spoke without thinking,
and followed her words.

236
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,250
I was wrong.

237
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,500
(Jinyan Law Firm)

238
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,370
It's him.

239
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,540
Alright.

240
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,780
I understand.

241
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,130
Nianwen.

242
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,130
Stop waiting.

243
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,733
Lawyer Meng is away on a business trip.

244
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:15,911
He won't be back for now.

245
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,450
Nianwen!

246
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,700
Meng Xin!

247
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,420
Open the door!

248
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,530
I just saw you!

249
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,610
You're hiding on purpose.

250
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,730
Feeling guilty, aren't you?

251
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,010
Open the door! Open it!

252
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,850
Nianwen!

253
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,130
Stop coming here to make a scene!

254
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,300
As for your sister's case,

255
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,010
there's nothing new
we can work out by talking here.

256
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,650
Since you chose to file a lawsuit,

257
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,300
you must be ready to face the outcome!

258
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,650
Then tell me,

259
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,730
how did Fan Jiancheng get

260
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,390
that photo of my sister
with her eyes open?

261
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,580
Say something!

262
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,060
Open the door!

263
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,900
Open up!

264
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,100
Nianwen!

265
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,890
Did you take
the judicial exam for nothing?

266
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,890
Defense lawyers,
in the course of their practice,

267
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,420
have the right to keep their clients'

268
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,940
information confidential!

269
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,220
We are lawyers!

270
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,010
We must be loyal to our clients!

271
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,250
That's the iron rule!

272
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,490
Is that how you interpret it?

273
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,130
There's nothing wrong
with loyalty to a client,

274
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,010
but your client is a rapist!

275
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,820
He should be punished as he deserves,

276
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,420
not helped to forge evidence!

277
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,300
You're aiding evil!

278
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,100
Do you even deserve to be a lawyer?

279
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,977
Do you?

280
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:44,644
- Do you deserve to be a lawyer?
- Nianwen!

281
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,440
Let go of me!

282
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:46,530
Tell me!

283
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,650
- Tell me!
- Let go!

284
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,820
How can you call yourself a lawyer?

285
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,850
Get out.

286
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,850
Enough!

287
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,730
Let go!

288
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,100
What are you two doing?

289
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,530
Nianwen.

290
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,100
Mr. Qin, you came just in time.

291
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,100
Please take Nianwen home.

292
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,420
He laid hands on me today.

293
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,730
If he comes again,

294
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,220
I'll call the police.

295
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,200
Nianwen. We've worked together
as mentor and student.

296
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:15,088
I'll give you one last piece of advice.

297
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,250
Coming here to vent your anger

298
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,530
won't help you at all.

299
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,010
What you should do now

300
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,220
is go home and comfort your family.

301
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,730
If you believe the verdict is wrong,

302
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,530
use your training
to appeal for your sister.

303
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,940
Coming here to shout at me

304
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,420
only shows you've lost your head!

305
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,100
Let's go.

306
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,890
Come on.

307
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,730
It's over. Go.

308
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,140
Nianwen.

309
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,650
You really can't
keep going on like this.

310
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,133
Do you know
how worried your parents are?

311
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,610
Give it back!

312
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,130
Nan.

313
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,340
I can't help it, you know?

314
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,890
I...

315
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,340
I could only go to Meng Xin.

316
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,700
I really had no other choice.

317
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,610
I just hoped that maybe

318
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,250
he'd feel a bit of pity for me.

319
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
Even just give me a small hint.

320
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,610
But there's no hope at all.

321
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,488
Nothing left.

322
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:07,970
I know.

323
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,490
I failed my sister.

324
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,370
When she wanted to call the police,
I stopped her...

325
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,130
Why did I stop her?

326
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,970
I really...

327
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,130
Nianwen!

328
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
Nianwen!

329
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,090
Enough, Nianwen!

330
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,980
I know you're in pain.

331
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,890
We all are.

332
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,130
But life has to go on.

333
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,250
Mom and Dad are getting old.

334
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,140
Their health's not good.

335
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,180
If we both fall apart now,

336
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,300
who will they rely on?

337
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,300
Just do me this favor.

338
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,460
I'll look after your sister.

339
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,130
You take care of Mom and Dad.

340
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,490
Together, we'll hold this family up.

341
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,850
Don't worry.

342
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,610
This isn't over.

343
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,850
We'll get justice in the end.

344
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,370
But it'll take time.

345
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:51,250
It might be a long while

346
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,890
before we get the answers we want.

347
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,010
That's why we must

348
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,730
stand up like grown men,

349
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,250
protect our family,

350
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,490
and protect those we care about.

351
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,730
We have to keep living.

352
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,140
(Labor Termination Notice)
Ming.

353
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,370
What's the meaning of this?

354
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,890
We're not that intimate.

355
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,020
I don't deserve it.

356
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,300
Fine.

357
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,340
Then I'll call you Mr. Zhao.

358
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,530
Mr. Zhao.

359
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,610
I've worked at Fuqiang for years.

360
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,770
Maybe no great achievements,
but plenty of hard work.

361
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,010
Don't tell me you've forgotten

362
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,533
how you made all that money.

363
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,340
You want to use me and then cut me off,

364
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,730
at least give me an explanation!

365
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,733
Doing it on purpose, are you?

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,088
Afraid people can't hear?

367
00:16:59,088 --> 00:16:59,980
That's right!

368
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,890
I just want everyone to see

369
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,490
how you, Mr Zhao,
use people and then ditch them!

370
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,900
How you threw out

371
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,010
the man who helped you
start this business

372
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,330
like he was nothing!

373
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,490
Do you even realize

374
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,380
how much your dirty mess
costs the company?

375
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,290
Don't you?

376
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,380
I've helped you

377
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,700
when I should,

378
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,860
and when I shouldn't.

379
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,010
Now the shareholders
are furious with me.

380
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,390
I can't help you this time.

381
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,250
Don't talk to me about shareholders.

382
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,490
You've really
lost your mind, haven't you?

383
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,700
Forgot everything?

384
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,620
Who helped you grab
your first plot of land?

385
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,570
Who built your first building for you?

386
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,140
If it weren't for me, Fan Jiancheng,

387
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,010
your shareholders

388
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,620
would be left with nothing to eat!

389
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,570
Jiancheng,

390
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,140
you're stuck in a pit.

391
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,140
Stop struggling.

392
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,490
Someone gave you a hand,

393
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,250
and you just
took the chance to climb out.

394
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,460
If you take the money and go,

395
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,466
we're still relatives.

396
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,460
Now you remember we're relatives.

397
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,180
My wife calls you brother.

398
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,290
My daughter calls you uncle.

399
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,860
Let me tell you something, Zhao Ming.

400
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,490
Ten percent of the shares,

401
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,050
three million in compensation,

402
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,180
one penny less,

403
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,730
and I'll expose
every filthy thing you've done.

404
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,330
Come on.

405
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,860
You know

406
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,980
who's backing me.

407
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,250
You know what your

408
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,460
reputation is now?

409
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,980
You really do scare me.

410
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,860
Listen, Zhao Ming.

411
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,620
When I call you Mr. Zhao,

412
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,900
you're a boss.

413
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,290
When I don't,

414
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,860
you're nothing but rubbish!

415
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,700
Pah!

416
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,050
I've got far more class than you.

417
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,100
(Labor Termination Notice)

418
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,570
Mr. Fan.

419
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,140
Did you finish the task I gave you?

420
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
Alright.

421
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,555
Help her sit down and rest for a bit.

422
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,250
With your drinking capacity, Mr. Zheng,

423
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,490
how could they possibly outdrink you?

424
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,777
Xiaoyang, come on.

425
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,980
Mr. Zhao's been waiting for you.

426
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,490
Where did you two disappear to?

427
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,330
I just went to the toilet.

428
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,250
Mr. Zheng, look,
our table is round tonight,

429
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,290
and our glasses are full.

430
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,140
Thank you.

431
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,620
Thank you, ladies.

432
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,490
No more for me. Don't pour.

433
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,050
Three more glasses.

434
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,050
I'll take the penalty.

435
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,980
Penalty...

436
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,050
Alright then, Mr. Zheng, I'll drink.

437
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,311
I accept the penalty.

438
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,330
Mr. Zheng...

439
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,490
Come on. More liquor.

440
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,700
Waiter.

441
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,820
Yes, sir?

442
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,180
Please

443
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,220
take this glass of water

444
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,730
to my colleague over there.
She's had a bit too much to drink.

445
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,460
She's the one wearing the coat.

446
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,090
It'll help her sober up.

447
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:24,930
Of course.

448
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,900
Thank you.

449
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
Have some water.

450
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,740
Tao Jie.

451
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,740
Mr. Fan.

452
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,330
I just finished signing these documents.

453
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,460
They're very important.

454
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Handle them quickly.

455
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,060
(Room 208. Wu Meili)

456
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,860
All done. Don't worry.

457
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,290
Feeling any better?

458
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,010
I brought
your favorite steamed apples.

459
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,980
See if it still tastes like
when you were little.

460
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,730
You used to love
steamed apples as a child.

461
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,900
You lost
your baby teeth later than most.

462
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,250
Once, when you were eating an apple,

463
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,490
you suddenly called me.

464
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,620
You were crying.

465
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,490
"Mom.

466
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,570
The apple's grown a tooth."

467
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,330
I looked,

468
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,180
and your tooth

469
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,490
was stuck in the apple.

470
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,490
Then you still insisted,
"I want to eat it."

471
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,700
So I steamed one for you.

472
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,250
And you told me,

473
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,250
it was the best apple you'd ever eaten.

474
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,460
Back then, life was hard.

475
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,700
You only got one when you were ill.

476
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,290
Later, things got better as you grew up.

477
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,380
And I forgot...

478
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,180
Sibei.

479
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,940
You've always been a good daughter.

480
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,460
No matter how hard I've been on you,

481
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,810
whatever I asked you to do,

482
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,290
you'd say you didn't want to,

483
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,420
but you'd still do it for me.

484
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,930
From now on,
I won't ask you to do anything.

485
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,660
Do whatever you want.

486
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,730
I support you.

487
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,860
Sibei, have a bite.

488
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,490
See if it still tastes the same.

489
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,090
Just one bite.

490
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,660
Come on.

491
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,940
Isn't it the same as before?

492
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,700
Have a bite.

493
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,530
I won't force you anymore.

494
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,940
If you don't want it, that's fine.

495
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,010
I'll come see you another day.

496
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,940
Mom.

497
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,250
Did she eat?

498
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,570
Qin Nan.

499
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,180
I've got an idea for you.

500
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,530
When Sibei

501
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,490
gets a bit better,

502
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,900
why don't you two

503
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,700
move somewhere else for a while?

504
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,410
Mom.

505
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,460
You know what Sibei's like.

506
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,460
She won't just walk away.

507
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,490
If she did that,

508
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,250
she'd feel like she was running away.

509
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,460
Then everything she's fought for

510
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
would be for nothing.

511
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,220
See later if she can eat a little.

512
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,980
If not, you eat it.

513
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,290
It can't sit too long.

514
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm heading off.

515
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,355
Mom, let me walk you out.

516
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:33,250
No need.

517
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,700
Ms. Jin.

518
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,460
Have some tea.

519
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,300
Thank you.

520
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,350
Ms. Jin,

521
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,700
did you come today

522
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,844
because something happened

523
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,140
to Wenwen at school?

524
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,530
Ms. Zhao,

525
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,700
here's the situation.

526
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,980
Wenwen used to be

527
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,700
a very lively and cheerful child.

528
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,890
But lately,

529
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,210
she's been sitting alone in class.

530
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,980
She doesn't go out
to play during breaks.

531
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,860
Sometimes,

532
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,980
she doesn't speak all day.

533
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,100
Other teachers

534
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,340
have also told me

535
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,140
that she often zones out in class,

536
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,460
lost in thought.

537
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,280
They're not sure
what she's thinking about.

538
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,740
Oh, right.

539
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,780
This is the drawing Wenwen made
during a psychology session.

540
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,140
Please take a look.

541
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,780
This is her drawing?

542
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,140
The counselor asked the children

543
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,980
to draw something

544
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,460
that best shows how they feel inside.

545
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,740
Some drew birds in the sky,

546
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,740
some drew sunflowers,

547
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,980
and others drew their parents.

548
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
But Wenwen's picture

549
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,460
really surprised the teachers.

550
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,300
Combined with

551
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,740
her recent behavior,

552
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
which is very unusual,

553
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,420
the psychology teacher

554
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,140
asked me to keep an eye on her.

555
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,180
Ms. Jin, I understand.

556
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,980
Sorry to trouble you

557
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,220
for coming all the way here.

558
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,259
(This rice here)

559
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,820
(is the one many of you
kept asking about)

560
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,420
(in the comments under my video.)

561
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,100
(It's fifty-one yuan a bag
on the official website.)

562
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,940
(But today, I won't even charge)

563
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,500
(fifty-one for two bags. Here we go!)

564
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,220
(Thirty-nine ninety! Add to cart!)

565
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,180
(Two bags, everyone.)

566
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,820
(Two bags! Remember! Two bags!)

567
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,600
(The link's live.
Hurry and place your orders.)

568
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,400
(Not much stock left.
We're out of stock already.)

569
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,220
(How come some
of you say you missed it?)

570
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,100
(One thousand orders gone.)

571
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,140
(- Yes.)
(- Oh my goodness.)

572
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
(You guys are amazing, really!)

573
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,140
You've arrived, Madam.

574
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,980
Alright, thank you.

575
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,980
If you don't mind,
could you leave me a good review?

576
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,840
Sure, no problem.

577
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,940
- Of course.
- Thanks.

578
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,540
No worries.

579
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,380
Take care.

580
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,620
(Order Completed)

581
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,540
(The court has cleared my name!)

582
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,380
Yes, I am innocent!

583
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,980
(I am not guilty!)

584
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,380
(Ye Sibei's family beat someone up!)

585
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,180
Where's Wenwen's parent?

586
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,780
Dad.

587
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,220
Captain Zhang.

588
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,740
Captain Zhang.

589
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:07,930
What a coincidence.

590
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,740
It really is you.

591
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
What are you doing here?

592
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,177
Waiting for someone?

593
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,222
Me?

594
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,900
No.

595
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,740
I just dropped off a passenger.

596
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,700
A passenger?

597
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:17,980
Yes.

598
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,380
I'm driving

599
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,577
for a ride-hailing app now.

600
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,711
Really?

601
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,200
Captain Zhang, where are you heading?

602
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,066
I can give you a lift.

603
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,700
Alright.

604
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,580
Well then...

605
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,420
How...

606
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,644
How do I place the order?

607
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,180
No need to book.

608
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,420
Just hop in.

609
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,180
Is that proper?

610
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,644
What's improper about it? Come on.

611
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,180
Alright.

612
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,690
I'm not holding back with you anymore.

613
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,860
Nianwen.

614
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,140
Do you really like driving?

615
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,020
I...

616
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:02,511
You were doing well as a lawyer.

617
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:03,644
Why did you quit?

618
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,933
What made you
suddenly decide to drive instead?

619
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,180
No particular reason.

620
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,620
I just think I'm

621
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,900
not that clever,

622
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,860
not good with words.

623
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,540
Not cut out to be a lawyer.

624
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,540
Maybe

625
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,940
I chose the wrong career.

626
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,020
Nianwen.

627
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,300
Don't be so pessimistic.

628
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:25,044
You can't just stop walking
because you sprained your ankle.

629
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:27,911
Evil never triumphs over good.

630
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,100
After all,

631
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,700
the truth

632
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,140
will always come to light.

633
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,100
Captain Zhang,

634
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,022
will you keep investigating?

635
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,500
Watch the road.

636
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,780
Captain Zhang,

637
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,180
the last time I saw Chuchu,

638
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,020
I got a lead.

639
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,420
That night, she did get
a message from my sister

640
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,733
saying she'd gotten home safely.

641
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,260
But when we checked my sister's phone,

642
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,300
there was no record of it.

643
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,380
So I believe

644
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,060
Fan Jiancheng used my sister's phone

645
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,700
to send that message to Chuchu.

646
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,620
Then he deleted it.

647
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,060
Clearly out of guilt.

648
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,060
He just wanted

649
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,540
to stop Chuchu
from asking about my sister that night.

650
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,620
But deleting the message

651
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,820
made him look even guiltier.

652
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,100
So...

653
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,500
So we can follow this lead further...

654
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,340
Nianwen.

655
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,980
I have to tell you this seriously.

656
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,540
We police handle the cases.

657
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,980
Don't do what you shouldn't do.

658
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,540
If you want to keep driving,

659
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,620
I won't stop you.

660
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,540
But let me give you some advice.

661
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,260
Don't let one incident

662
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,020
make you abandon your career

663
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,300
and change your whole path.

664
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,420
Your life

665
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,500
belongs to you.

666
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,380
Live it well.

667
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,500
If it were you...

668
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,460
Master.

669
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,300
What would you do?

670
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,700
Master, you're finally here.

671
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
Have a look.

672
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,660
This is Fan Jiancheng's
activity record for the past month.

673
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,220
Nothing unusual.

674
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,500
See if I've missed anything.

675
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,660
Eat. Eat while I read.

676
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,460
How?

677
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,460
Looks fine.

678
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,620
No problem?

679
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,020
Then what do we do about the case?

680
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,780
For now, there's nothing we can do.

681
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,300
How...

682
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,260
How can that be?

683
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:46,980
You forgot what you said before?

684
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,866
You said this case wasn't over.

685
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,900
Yes.

686
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,420
But right now,

687
00:31:58,222 --> 00:32:00,480
it's been less than a month
since the first trial ended.

688
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,980
Think about it.

689
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,820
He'll definitely
be keeping his head down now.

690
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,180
Even if you keep digging,

691
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,180
you won't find anything.

692
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,260
Enough.

693
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,300
So

694
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,980
the direction's wrong.

695
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,500
What do you mean?

696
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,260
What we should be looking into now

697
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,980
isn't Fan Jiancheng.

698
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,180
Why did Zhao Shuhui

699
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,977
suddenly produce that piece of evidence?

700
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,620
Can you make sense of that?

701
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,940
That day,

702
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,500
at the court,

703
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,380
Fan Jiancheng was released on the spot.

704
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,260
And Zhao Shuhui's reaction was odd.

705
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,820
She didn't look happy at all.

706
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,020
That's not how someone

707
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,900
who truly believes
her husband is innocent

708
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,820
would react.

709
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,260
But actually,

710
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,780
what confuses me most is

711
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,060
that Ye Sibei believed she was assaulted

712
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,460
because she'd drunk too much

713
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
and blacked out.

714
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,980
But everyone there
said she didn't drink much.

715
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,220
And

716
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,620
that photo of her

717
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,020
with her eyes open but no memory of it

718
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,180
proves the inconsistency.

719
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes.

720
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,260
But why?

721
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,340
Boss.

722
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
The drinks!

723
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,020
How many times have I told you,
no more drinking?

724
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,100
Let's drink another day.

725
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,780
Sit down.

726
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,260
- What?
- You've had enough.

727
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Enough drinking.

728
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,100
What drink?

729
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,380
Oh my god.

730
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,100
Li.

731
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,260
Quick, mop it up.

732
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,820
Coming.

733
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,700
Hurry.

734
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,020
Sorry...

735
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
You're still drinking?

736
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,500
Here, have some water.

737
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,460
Drink some water.

738
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,900
Here.

739
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,860
Drink a little first.

740
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,140
Master.

741
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,100
Master.

742
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,700
Why are you
always so curious about trouble?

743
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,420
Told you to drink less.

744
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,260
Stop eating.

745
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,500
Go back and review every statement

746
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,940
from all involved parties.

747
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,155
Waiter, the bill, please.

748
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,460
Table two, right?

749
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,260
That's 158 yuan.

750
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,340
Master.

751
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,700
I've gone through
all the witness and suspect statements

752
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,780
dozens of times already.

753
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,380
I really can't find

754
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,900
anything strange.

755
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,820
We're not looking for
what's in the statements.

756
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,820
We're looking for

757
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,500
what's missing.

758
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
What's missing?

759
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,500
Water.

760
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,260
So, guys, what do you
want to hear next?

761
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,620
I will keep chatting with you.

762
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,300
This matter...

763
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,020
It's all in the past.

764
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Right?

765
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,666
No need to bring it up again.

766
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:28,420
Besides, the court
has already cleared my name.

767
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,020
As for those malicious rumors,

768
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,380
I won't pursue them.

769
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,260
After all,

770
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,244
everyone deserves a chance
to make things right.

771
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,540
Alright then,

772
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
time's about up.

773
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,700
I should get back
and spend time with my wife.

774
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,020
Everyone, tap a little heart for me.

775
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,940
Five.

776
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,020
Four.

777
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,980
Three.

778
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Two.

779
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,020
One.

780
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,940
Alright.

781
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,020
Goodbye, everyone.

782
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,860
See you next time.

783
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,620
Fan Jiancheng.

784
00:35:57,444 --> 00:35:59,220
You've got some nerve
doing live streams.

785
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,620
Are you afraid the whole city
doesn't know who you are?

786
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,260
Or afraid

787
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,900
the whole country doesn't?

788
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,500
What do I have to be afraid of?

789
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,540
The court already cleared my name.

790
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,020
I'm innocent.

791
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,500
You know how scary public opinion

792
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,700
can be, don't you?

793
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,780
If you keep this up,

794
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,540
how will Wenwen face people?

795
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,460
How will she face her classmates?

796
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,060
Have you thought about her?

797
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,660
I am thinking about Wenwen.

798
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,660
I'm thinking about our family.

799
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,100
Look,

800
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,260
your brother cut off
my source of income.

801
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,620
If I don't make money, how do we live?

802
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,460
Right?

803
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,300
Fine.

804
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,780
You can earn money,

805
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,300
but

806
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,220
you must never hurt Wenwen.

807
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
Come on.

808
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,620
I'm her father.

809
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
How could I hurt her?

810
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,860
And besides,

811
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,020
you're my wife,

812
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,980
and I'm your husband.

813
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Stop calling me "Fan Jiancheng".

814
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,820
Call me Jiancheng.

815
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Alright, fine.

816
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,420
From now on,

817
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,700
I won't bring this up again, alright?

818
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,100
Come on.

819
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,260
Let's go to bed.

820
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,660
Okay.

821
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,080
No need to pull me. I can go myself.

822
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,540
You're back.

823
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,780
Why did you get out of bed?

824
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,020
I feel much better.

825
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,220
I want to get some fresh air.

826
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,400
Where do you want to go?

827
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,700
To my parents' place.

828
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,980
So they won't worry.

829
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,740
Alright.

830
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,540
Qin Nan.

831
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,659
You don't need to do that.

832
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,780
- Leave it to us.
- It's fine.

833
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,980
It's fine, Mom. I'll give you a hand.

834
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,020
Go. Rest inside.

835
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,155
Go on, good boy.

836
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:32,980
Sibei.

837
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,220
I want to talk to you.

838
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,540
I know this matter

839
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,660
is extremely important to you right now.

840
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,380
But your life with Qin Nan

841
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,700
is important too, isn't it?

842
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,980
You have to think
about your future together.

843
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,220
Listen to my advice.

844
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,220
If it doesn't work out, just go.

845
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,420
Leave this place.

846
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,180
Go anywhere you like.

847
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,540
I trust you,

848
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,900
and I trust Qin Nan.

849
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,180
Wherever you go, you'll be fine.

850
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,540
What do you think?

851
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,500
Mom, why should I leave?

852
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,500
Why won't you listen to me?

853
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,260
Think about it,
the rest of your life belongs to you.

854
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,420
You have to live it well.

855
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,980
It's all my fault.

856
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,300
I shouldn't have let you come back.

857
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,044
Otherwise, none
of this would've happened.

858
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,020
Sibei.

859
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,180
Give me a bank card.

860
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,980
If you ever need money,

861
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,100
I will find a way.

862
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,180
Please listen to me.

863
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,060
Leave this place.

864
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
I'm begging you.

865
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,940
I can't leave.

866
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
If I go,

867
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,220
I'll carry this stigma for life.

868
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,140
But if you stay...

869
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,940
You'll sacrifice the rest of your life.

870
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,380
Which is worth it?

871
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,060
(Hello, fans of Nancheng Stories.)

872
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,820
(How are you all?)

873
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,840
(I'm Jie.)

874
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,140
(Many of you must've been following)

875
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,555
(the Nancheng sexual assault case.)

876
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,420
(Especially)

877
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,620
(after I published my article
on WeChat.)

878
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,660
(Many of my fans)

879
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,060
(came to comment)

880
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,180
(and share your views.)

881
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,820
(So today,)

882
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,780
(we've invited the person
involved in the case,)

883
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,580
(Mr. Fan,)

884
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,700
(and his lawyer,)

885
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
(Mr. Meng Xin.)

886
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,540
(They actually invited Fan Jiancheng!)
(Hello everyone, I'm Fan.)

887
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,844
(He looks like a tough one.)
(One of the people involved in the case.)

888
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:22,180
(So that's what
Fan Jiancheng looks like.)

889
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,020
(Hello, everyone.)

890
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,820
(Meng Xin is a big-shot lawyer.)
(I'm his lawyer, Meng Xin.)

891
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,380
(Welcome to you both.)

892
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,420
(Since this incident happened,)

893
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,540
(it's stirred up
widespread social discussion.)

894
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,260
(We've found)

895
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,540
(that people online
hold very different views)

896
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,380
(and opinions.)

897
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,660
(Mr. Meng,)

898
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,180
(what are your thoughts on this matter?)

899
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,180
(This isn't simple. There's more to it.)

900
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,180
(As a lawyer,)

901
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,820
(Why do people doubt the victim first?)
(I truly dislike seeing)

902
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,020
(I support Sibei. Hope she stays strong.)
(such issues spiraling endlessly online.)

903
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,260
(I think, as onlookers,)

904
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,180
(Fan Jiancheng must have an agenda.)
(we shouldn't insult suspects,)

905
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,020
(nor should we insult victims.)

906
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,900
(Victims suffer immense mental stress.)
(We must stay aware of our actions,)

907
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,060
(to avoid hurting others.)

908
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,180
(Because of how this has spread,)

909
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,860
(it's already caused great harm.)

910
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,660
(I believe some people out there)

911
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,420
(still misunderstand me.)

912
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,220
(So I hope)

913
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,260
(when facing similar situations,)

914
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,660
(everyone can think for themselves.)

915
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,900
(At the same time,
I'd like to take this chance)

916
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,260
(This kind of thing takes two.)
(to appeal to everyone)

917
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,780
(Both sides bear responsibility.)
(to please)

918
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,860
(Fan Jiancheng is shameless.)
(give Ms. Ye)

919
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,940
(How dare he say that?)
(a chance to turn over a new leaf,)

920
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,620
(to find her way back,)

921
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,780
(and start anew.)

922
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,820
Mom!

923
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,420
Mom!

924
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,180
Mom!

925
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,140
Call an ambulance!

926
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,140
Dial 120!

927
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,020
Dad, call an ambulance!

928
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,860
Mom!

929
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:00,420
(Emergency Room. Rescue Area.
No Unauthorized Entry)

930
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,620
Miss, how is she?

931
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,460
Miss, how's my wife?

932
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:20,780
Sudden cerebral infarction.

933
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:22,660
Fortunately, you brought her in quickly.

934
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
For now,

935
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
she's stabilized.

936
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,022
Please go and complete her admission.

937
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,980
Dad.

938
