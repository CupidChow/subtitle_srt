00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000

00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,851
=Light Beyond the Reed=

3
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

4
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,220
=Episode 16=

5
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:55,511
You have only been married
for more than a year

6
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:56,980
and you're already so close.

7
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:58,820
Do you know her from the past?

8
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,580
No. Not at all.

9
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:01,940
I've never seen her before.

10
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,980
Are you sure?

11
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,380
Which high school are you from?

12
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm from the No. 7 High School.

13
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,740
Have some tea.

14
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,660
Nianwen.

15
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,700
How did your sister
and your brother-in-law meet?

16
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,540
Blind date.

17
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,820
I heard Sibei didn't meet anyone
during the blind date

18
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,220
and met Nan.

19
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,977
They fell for each other
after they met and spoke to each other.

20
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,340
My father was upset about it

21
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:32,980
because Nan
had a low level of education.

22
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,540
However, Sibei wanted him.

23
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
Love at first sight.

24
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,900
That's probably it.

25
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,540
Sibei

26
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,060
met too many bad men back then.

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,300
My mother scolded her every day.

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,380
She was so afraid.

29
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,260
Qin Nan is also from Nancheng, right?

30
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,220
Which high school did he graduate from?

31
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,860
I don't know about that.

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,000
He didn't mention it before.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,940
Captain Zhang.

34
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,220
Did you come here today

35
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,827
because you have updates
about Sibei's case?

36
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,660
Nianwen,

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,260
Sibei has given up.

38
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,220
What are you obsessing about?

39
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,740
I don't know.

40
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,580
I...

41
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,780
I can't overcome this.

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,740
Whenever I close my eyes,
this is all I can see.

43
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,380
This incident ruined Sibei,

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,860
my mother,

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,100
and Chuchu.

46
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,220
Everything around me
has been affected because of this.

47
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,220
If Sibei cannot have justice,

48
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,300
I will never get over this.

49
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,820
Nianwen,

50
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,740
there's a new clue

51
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:02,500
in Sibei's case.

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,140
What is it?

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,380
If what Chuchu said back then was true,

54
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,620
what Sibei told us

55
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,340
might not be true.

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,220
Captain Zhang,

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,740
what do you mean?

58
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,540
Are you saying that Sibei lied?

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,860
Perhaps Sibei

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,020
remembered wrongly?

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,150
Previously,

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,140
I considered this possibility.

63
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,860
If Sibei

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,220
had taken psychiatric drugs like this,

65
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,140
she might have had a vague memory

66
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,340
or even lost her memory.

67
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,780
Objectively speaking,

68
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,820
Meng Xin was right.

69
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,500
With the amount she drank,

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,740
it was

71
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,460
almost impossible

72
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,480
for her to lose her memory.

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,340
However, Sibei

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,300
did not do a blood test

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,355
and missed the best window
for evidence collection.

76
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:58,220
Recently, we've been investigating

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,940
the illegal trade of controlled drugs
in Nancheng.

78
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,900
We just raided one of their hideouts.

79
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,260
We will verify with the buyers
that the drug dealer told us

80
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,900
one-by-one.

81
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,740
If one of them

82
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,900
mentions Fan Jiancheng,

83
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,340
that means

84
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,133
he had the intention
to commit the crime.

85
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,820
Captain Zhang,
what do you need me to do now?

86
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Find Chuchu.

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,340
Find her?

88
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,220
Ask her to stand up

89
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,533
and admit she gave false testimony
during the first trial.

90
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,140
It's no use, Captain Zhang.

91
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,220
She won't stand up for it.

92
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,600
If she could,
she would've done it already.

93
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,180
Are you that sure?

94
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,860
Let me tell you, Nianwen.

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,660
For many people,

96
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,860
when they are
at this crucial point in life,

97
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,500
they would feel like standing on

98
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,540
a steel wire

99
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,955
with kindness on one side
and evil on the other.

100
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,620
Which way

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,340
she falls

102
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,260
depends on how the world pushes her.

103
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,220
It depends on you.

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,900
How do you want to push her?

105
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,220
Chuchu,

106
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,260
lunch is ready.

107
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,900
Come out and eat.

108
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,540
You've been shutting yourself inside
for a month.

109
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,100
Come out and get some fresh air.

110
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,940
You can't go on like this.

111
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,940
I'm very worried about you.

112
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,060
Hello, Master.

113
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,060
Lin Feng.

114
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,860
Call Nancheng No. 2 High School.

115
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,740
Help me investigate

116
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,020
if there's a student
called Qin Nan in 2006.

117
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,380
All right.

118
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,620
Oh, I need a day off this afternoon.

119
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,260
What are you doing?

120
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,220
Qin Nan called me.

121
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,020
He said something felt off

122
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,933
about Ye Sibei.

123
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,900
She's going to take a bus
to Guangzhou alone.

124
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,180
Qin Nan is very worried.

125
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,740
He wanted me to accompany her.

126
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,100
Sure. Go ahead.

127
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,466
Help me with the investigation

128
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:07,900
at Nancheng No.2 High School
immediately.

129
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,740
Sure.

130
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,020
Chuchu.

131
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,060
Nianwen is here to see you.

132
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,500
Why are you here?

133
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,340
Come in.

134
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,900
How's Mrs. Ye doing?

135
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,300
She has been discharged.

136
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,260
Thank you.

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,420
Are you here for your sister?

138
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm here for you.

139
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,140
(It Is A Long Journey)

140
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,980
I'm not recording.

141
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,540
Don't worry.

142
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,420
I've been focusing on Sibei's incident

143
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,660
for a long time previously

144
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,420
without asking about you.

145
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,300
Have you been doing well lately?

146
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,340
Do you know that this concern

147
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,220
has come too late?

148
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:56,460
I've been waiting for you
to ask this question for so long.

149
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,780
However, you weren't here
when you were supposed to.

150
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Nothing matters now.

151
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,540
I don't trust you.

152
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,220
You don't trust me either.

153
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,620
Stop asking me anything.

154
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,780
Chuchu.

155
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,020
Are you a good person

156
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,020
or a bad person?

157
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
You can see me as a bad person.

158
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
A bad person won't call herself one.

159
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,140
You call yourself a bad person

160
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,866
because your conscience
is condemning you.

161
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Tell me.

162
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,540
Why did you lie?

163
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,900
You won't understand even if I tell you.

164
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,220
I might not understand,

165
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,020
but I know

166
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,540
you are Chuchu.

167
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,300
You will never be a bad person.

168
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,420
I am the last person who saw her.

169
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,220
I wanted to lie for her

170
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,540
to prove her innocence

171
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,900
and help her
send Fan Jiancheng to prison.

172
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,620
However, I didn't expect...

173
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,140
If I weren't

174
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,540
the victim that night,

175
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,340
no matter how I cover

176
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,540
or explain it,

177
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
it'd have been my crime.

178
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,540
I saw people
questioning everything about me.

179
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,140
My clothes,

180
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,780
my outfit,

181
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,220
and my relationship history.

182
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,820
Everything about me.

183
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,020
Ye Nianwen, do you know?

184
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,340
I've been doubting myself.

185
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,140
I don't know
if doing sales is right for me.

186
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,540
I don't know
if my outfit is right for me.

187
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,220
I don't know

188
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,540
whether having a relationship

189
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,777
since I was in high school

190
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,140
was a grave crime or not.

191
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,540
Everyone thinks I am wrong.

192
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
Everyone.

193
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,420
But I think I was not wrong.

194
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,140
I've been fighting this...

195
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,660
But there's a voice

196
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,420
deep inside my heart telling me

197
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,820
that I was wrong.

198
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,780
I wasn't supposed to do that.

199
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,340
But you were the one

200
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,140
who gave Sibei the condom.

201
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,660
That's the fact.

202
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Am I supposed to die because of that?

203
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,266
Didn't I give her the condom

204
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,340
because I wanted to protect her?

205
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,900
I wanted her to be well,

206
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,780
yet I've become a sinner
beyond redemption?

207
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,020
Just tell the truth, then.

208
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,020
You can't lie in court.

209
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,780
You lied
and affected the judge's decision.

210
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,900
The case should not be judged that way.

211
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,020
Do you know

212
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,220
why I've never wanted
to tell you all these?

213
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,100
I knew you'd say this.

214
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,220
Do you think
I wanted to make a false testimony?

215
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,100
That's because I was afraid!

216
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,060
When I think about

217
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,420
how I was badly scolded online

218
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
because I left Sibei in the car,

219
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,562
I wouldn't dare think about
what they'd do to me

220
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,420
if they found out I did something else.

221
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,540
So, I felt lucky deep down

222
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,540
because if it's more pitiful

223
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,540
being a good person
rather than a bad person,

224
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,580
I'd rather become a bad person.

225
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,300
Chuchu.

226
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,980
When you say all these,

227
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,660
doesn't it hurt your conscience?

228
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,300
It does.

229
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,740
Do you know
how long I've waited for you?

230
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,380
Do you know how long I have waited

231
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,940
for you to tell me

232
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,940
that I'm a good person

233
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,540
and you believe me?

234
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,820
If you had told me these words,

235
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,940
I would have had the courage to step up.

236
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,300
I thought about stepping up many times,

237
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,420
but every time,

238
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,500
you,

239
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,660
the people around me, and the internet

240
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,580
made me feel that I'd ruin myself

241
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,380
by stepping up.

242
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
The only time I had the courage

243
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,488
that made me feel like stepping up

244
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,300
was when Sibei told me

245
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,500
that I wasn't a bad person.

246
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,420
I don't get it.

247
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
Why must you step up

248
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,940
only when someone else admits it?

249
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:10,420
You did the wrong thing.

250
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,488
Isn't accepting your punishment
and making up for it

251
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:13,540
the right thing to do?

252
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,180
Ye Nianwen,

253
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,060
can you treat me as a human?

254
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,820
Not everyone will do
what one is supposed to do.

255
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,500
You made everything seem so easy.

256
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
In that case, Sibei

257
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
should have reported
to the police back then.

258
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,940
Why didn't you let her
make the police report?

259
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,500
Because you are human too.

260
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,900
Aren't you?

261
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,688
(Honorary Credential, Yang Qiyu,
Open Teacher's Lesson Second Place)

262
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,980
Captain Zhang, right?

263
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
Please come in.

264
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,380
(Ticket Check)
Train 3299 is ready for departure.

265
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,220
Please line up.

266
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,980
You can send me off here.

267
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,740
I'm not leaving for good.

268
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,420
Suddenly, I feel like

269
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,940
you'll be gone for a long time.

270
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,820
Nonsense.

271
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm leaving.

272
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:03,420
You're not in a rush, anyway.

273
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,380
Take your time.

274
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,580
Sibei,

275
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,820
do you know what I wished for just now?

276
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,060
What?

277
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,380
I wished

278
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,740
for Ye Sibei

279
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,580
to be safe and happy

280
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,020
forever.

281
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,580
Why didn't you wish for me to get rich?

282
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,940
They are just worldly possessions.

283
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,660
Go on.

284
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
Go to Guangzhou

285
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,260
and don't miss me.

286
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,140
Don't turn around.

287
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,060
Don't worry.

288
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,420
I won't turn around.

289
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Dear travelers,

290
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,940
the ticket check for Train 3299

291
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,860
bound for Guangzhou
from Nancheng will be stopping.

292
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,940
Dear travelers,

293
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,380
ticket check for Train 3299

294
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,300
bound for Guangzhou
from Nancheng will be stopping.

295
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,140
Actually,

296
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,140
since the day they got married,

297
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,660
I wanted to tell Ye Sibei about this.

298
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,260
However, Qin Nan wouldn't let me.

299
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,820
Why not?

300
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,980
Qin Nan didn't want to
pressure Ye Sibei.

301
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,100
He said if I had told her that,

302
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,111
Ye Sibei would feel like
she owes him something

303
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,900
in their marriage.

304
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,940
Mr. Yang,

305
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,540
what kind of person

306
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,500
was Qin Nan

307
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,620
back then?

308
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,340
Qin Nan had dark skin.

309
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,060
He was quiet.

310
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,140
He usually hung around

311
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,380
with the hooligans of the city.

312
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
He slept in class

313
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,380
or skipped class to play games.

314
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,140
I scolded him many times

315
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,420
because of this.

316
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,580
(One day,)

317
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
(Qin Nan)

318
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,260
(came to my office.)

319
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,100
Mr. Yang.

320
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,580
Qin Nan.

321
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,220
What's wrong?

322
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,860
Is there still hope for me

323
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,020
to study well?

324
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,860
Qin Nan.

325
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,900
There's still hope.

326
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,900
As long as you want to study,

327
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,180
there'll always be hope.

328
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,900
If you want to study,

329
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,780
I'll give you tuition.

330
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,060
(Later, I asked Qin Nan)

331
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,100
(why his attitude
toward study had changed.)

332
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,500
(Nanbei Breakfast)

333
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,460
(He said)

334
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,940
(it was because of a female student
from the class next door.)

335
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,300
(The girl)

336
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,900
(was a good student in school
who had excellent grades.)

337
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,860
(After school,)

338
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,660
(she would always help out
in her family's stall.)

339
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,020
(Her positive character)

340
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,340
(touched Qin Nan a lot.)

341
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,660
(The girl)

342
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,490
(was Ye Sibei.)

343
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
(So, Qin Nan loved Ye Sibei a lot)

344
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,500
(and that began)

345
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,866
(when they were still at school.)

346
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,500
(Qin Nan's feelings for Ye Sibei)

347
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,900
(weren't love.)

348
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,500
(They were still young.)

349
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,020
(Moreover,)

350
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,822
(they didn't interact
with each other much.)

351
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,140
(I asked Qin Nan before.)

352
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,140
(He said these words to me.)

353
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,300
("Mr. Yang,)

354
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,780
(I'm very impressed with Ye Sibei)

355
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,420
(because she can do things)

356
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,500
(that I can't.)

357
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,660
(She gave me hope.)

358
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,300
(I only hope)

359
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,740
(she can live well.)

360
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,900
(If she can live well,)

361
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,700
(that will make me feel)

362
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,700
(that something in this world)

363
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,380
(can be changed through hard work.")

364
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,180
The next station is Yunwen Station.

365
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,940
Travelers getting off at the station,
please get ready to disembark.

366
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,580
The next station is Yunwen Station.

367
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,460
Travelers getting off at the station,
please get ready to disembark.

368
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,620
I remember
it was during the summer holidays.

369
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,860
One day, at midnight,

370
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,660
I suddenly received a call from Qin Nan.

371
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,700
He didn't say a word

372
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,940
throughout the call.

373
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,020
He was only weeping.

374
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,580
In the end,

375
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,060
he wailed.

376
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,180
Later, I found out

377
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,020
his father had passed away.

378
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,700
His brother died as well.

379
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,140
Well...

380
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,660
Keep this 30,000 yuan.

381
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,860
Take good care of your grandfather.

382
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,500
(Since then,)

383
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,060
(Qin Nan)

384
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,980
(felt like a different person.)

385
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,940
(He always sat in class)

386
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,140
(without saying a word)

387
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
(or doing anything.)

388
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,060
(Drop Out Letter)
(Later,)

389
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,340
(Qin Nan)

390
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,420
(came to me)

391
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,940
(and told me)

392
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,460
(he wanted to drop out.)

393
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,780
Mr. Yang.

394
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,780
Come in, Qin Nan.

395
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,380
Mr. Yang,

396
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,540
please deliver this

397
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,980
to Ye Sibei's home.

398
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,580
Tell her

399
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,955
someone is giving her a donation.

400
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,900
Qin Nan!

401
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,540
Qin Nan!

402
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,140
You will regret this!

403
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,900
The money

404
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,460
was for Qin Nan's education.

405
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,660
It was also his future.

406
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,380
He left his money for Ye Sibei.

407
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,500
Deep down inside,

408
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,580
he saw Ye Sibei

409
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,500
as a projection of himself.

410
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,780
He hoped

411
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,660
Ye Sibei could do what he couldn't.

412
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,820
If Ye Sibei could do it,

413
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
it would also motivate him

414
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,020
and show him hope in the world.

415
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,020
Do you think

416
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,900
Qin Nan loves Ye Sibei?

417
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,340
If you think so,

418
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,900
it'd be difficult for you
to understand Qin Nan's actions.

419
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,380
It is not love.

420
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,340
Qin Nan sees Ye Sibei

421
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,780
as a religion.

422
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,300
Hello.

423
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,980
Don't get off.

424
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,020
Lin Feng is following you.

425
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,340
Head to Guangzhou.

426
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,860
Don't stop.

427
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,940
What do you mean?

428
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,660
I wrote a letter with my message

429
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,940
and put it in your bag.

430
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,340
Burn it after you read it.

431
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,780
Don't leave any traces.

432
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,500
You know what I'm going to do?

433
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Sibei,

434
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,780
don't come back.

435
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,020
You must not be involved in this.

436
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,420
You promised me.

437
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,500
Head to Guangzhou

438
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:12,020
and don't turn around.

439
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,300
Qin Nan,

440
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,500
don't do something foolish.

441
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,740
(Sibei,)

442
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,180
(you are probably on the train)

443
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,620
(when you read this letter.)

444
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,860
(You might be approaching Yunwen.)

445
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,780
(I had a hard time
making this decision.)

446
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,020
(I don't know what love is.)

447
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,220
(I don't want my life)

448
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,860
(to depend on someone else.)

449
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,020
(So,)

450
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,466
(I've been thinking about)

451
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,600
(whether to kill Fan Jiancheng or not
for a long time.)

452
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,220
(But when we were looking
at the flag platform together,)

453
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,860
(I suddenly made my decision.)

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,340

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,500
Mr. Yang.

562
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,460
Qin Nan?

563
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,679
I want to ask if Ye Sibei

564
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,460
has attended
the College Entrance Examination.

565
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,700
She did.

566
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,420
How are

567
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,260
her results?

568
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,460
It was good.

569
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,420
If nothing goes wrong,

570
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,940
she should be in the first batch.

571
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,300
Good.

572
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,140
That's great.

573
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,940
Sure.

574
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,300
Hello.

575
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,580
Hello.

576
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,540
Hello.

577
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,540
Who are you?

578
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,180
Why aren't you speaking?

579
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,420
Are you looking for me?

580
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,620
It's time to work!

581
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,660
Time to work! Hurry up!

582
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,180
(Gradually,)

583
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,180
(I gave in to the world.)

584
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,660
(I gave it to the rules.)

585
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,980
(Ordinary World Volume 2 by Lu Yao)

586
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,460
Three Jacks.

587
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,420
You're passing?

588
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,020
Four fours.

589
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,420
You won't escape now!

590
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,940
(Until we meet again)

591
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,300
(many years later.)

592
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,460
Ye Sibei!

593
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,020
(When I was lost
in endless days of survival,)

594
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,460
(I thought about
how you were working hard)

595
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,380
(in life)

596
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,580
(so I kept struggling)

597
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,980
(and holding on.)

598
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,780
(My world was bleak)

599
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,740
(and cold.)

600
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,340
(You, who smiled in the rain,)

601
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,660
(gave me a bit of warmth.)

602
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,780
(You, who were radiant under the sun,)

603
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,980
(showed me a bit of light.)

604
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,940
Mr. Gao,

605
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,780
have some water.

606
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,820
How long have you been

607
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,790
a temporary worker here?

608
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,644
By tomorrow,
I'll have been here for a month.

609
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
Not bad.

610
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,220
Within such a short period,

611
00:36:27,222 --> 00:36:29,822
you've learned which spanners
to use when I repair cars.

612
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,940
I was watching on the side

613
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,740
when you were making repairs.

614
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,260
I remember everything.

615
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,060
Do you like fixing cars?

616
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,140
I do.

617
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,060
Do you want to learn?

618
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,900
I do.

619
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,300
You can work for me in the future.

620
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,780
Ye Sibei!

621
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,060
A call for you!

622
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:11,060
Do you think
it's the caller from last time

623
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,500
who didn't speak?

624
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,740
I don't know.

625
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,780
What's going on?

626
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,860
Thank you.

627
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,700
It's all right.

628
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,740
Hello.

629
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,380
Hello.

630
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,340
I am Ye Sibei.

631
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,420
Hello. Say something.

632
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,060
Why do you always call me
without saying a word?

633
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,780
Sorry.

634
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,060
I called the wrong number.

635
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,500
(I thought)

636
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,100
(I'd live my whole life)

637
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,220
(carrying my hopes for you.)

638
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,780
(However, when I met you again)

639
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,460
(after many years...)

640
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,380
(I don't know)

641
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,500
(what happened to you.)

642
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,820
(I could no longer see
a bright smile on your face.)

643
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,740
(You lost your radiance.)

644
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,140
(I couldn't see)

645
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,020
(the glow in your eyes.)

646
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,220
(I felt sad.)

647
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,740
(I was upset
to see you become like this.)

648
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,860
(I could accept how I gave in to fate)

649
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,940
(but I couldn't accept your change.)

650
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,740
(Your silence)

651
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,900
(made me fall back
into the icy cold world)

652
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,380
(So, I tried to approach you.)

653
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,745
(I want to find
the radiant you from before.)

654
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,460
(That was how)

655
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,020
(I could breathe.)

656
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:48,355
Let's get to know each other.

657
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
Ye Sibei.

658
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,860
Qin Nan.

659
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:10,040
(However, I saw your weakness
and how you backed down)

660
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,140
(after we got married.)

661
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,220
(It felt like a thorn
stabbing into my heart.)

662
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,060
(I couldn't handle the fact
that my hopes for you since I was young)

663
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,500
(were completely crushed.)

664
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
(Guantian Police Station)

665
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,340
Sorry.

666
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,740
(I felt weak.)

667
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,070
(I felt the glimmer of light in my life)

668
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,600
(Divorce Agreement)
(getting dimmer)

669
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,260
