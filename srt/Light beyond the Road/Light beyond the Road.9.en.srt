00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,260
(Certified Public Accountant Exam)

5
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,180
(Chuchu quit her job.
Don't you feel guilty?)

6
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,660
(You troublemaker.)

7
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,500
Sibei.

8
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,450
You haven't called me in so long.
Did you miss me?

9
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,290
Chuchu.

10
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
You quit your job?

11
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,540
You found out so soon.

12
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:56,340
It has nothing to do with you.

13
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,980
That company's way too dangerous.

14
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,060
I don't want to stay there.

15
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,550
Besides, it's full of scheming people.

16
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,020
I've wanted to leave for a long time.

17
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,444
How did they threaten you?

18
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,500
I'll go talk to them.

19
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,220
They didn't exactly threaten me.

20
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,260
They just wanted me
to talk some sense into you.

21
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,130
But I wasn't having it.

22
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,260
Why should I?

23
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,780
Instead of going after Fan Jiancheng,

24
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,466
they've been pressuring you nonstop.

25
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,610
So I told them straight up

26
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,450
that I quit.

27
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,100
I can just get a new job.

28
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,730
I'm getting married soon anyway.

29
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,660
I don't care.

30
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,610
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,260
I'm sorry, Chuchu.

32
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,100
Sibei.

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,660
I should be the one saying sorry to you.

34
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,260
If only I'd been more cautious that day.

35
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,730
If only I hadn't trusted him so easily.

36
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,540
It wasn't your fault.

37
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,890
It wasn't your fault either.

38
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,820
I really am sorry.

39
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,850
Forget it, let's not talk about this.

40
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm on the street right now.

41
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,060
If I cry off my makeup,
I'll look terrible.

42
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,460
Anyway, I've quit.

43
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,730
I'll go find a new job tomorrow.

44
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,644
Considering how capable
and beautiful I am,

45
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,250
I can definitely find another job.

46
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,250
Right, Sibei?

47
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,290
I'm sorry...

48
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,220
That's enough, Sibei.

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,460
Let's just drop the subject.

50
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,370
Since we've filed the case,
let's go all the way.

51
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,900
We'll show them what we're capable of.

52
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll hang up now.

53
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,220
Did they threaten Chuchu?

54
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,730
I'm going to the police station.

55
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,020
I'll come with you.

56
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:25,580
(Here's two hundred thousand.)

57
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
(This money)

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,220
(is more than enough
to pay off your loan.)

59
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,780
(And you can save the remaining amount.)

60
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,740
(Ye Sibei.)

61
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,580
(If you have any concerns,)

62
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,660
(just tell us.)

63
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,410
(The company will work it out.)

64
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,340
(Is this your compensation?)

65
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,730
(You can interpret it however you like.)

66
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,290
(But once you take the money,)

67
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,460
(just explain things clearly.
That's fine, right?)

68
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,220
(Explain what?)

69
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,850
(Don't play dumb.)

70
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,900
(You sued Mr. Fan.)

71
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,780
(That hurt the company's reputation.)

72
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,170
(You know that, don't you?)

73
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,780
This is such an important recording.

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,370
Why didn't you give it to us then?

75
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,610
I didn't want to drag others into it.

76
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,410
But now they've gone too far.

77
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
They even forced Chuchu to quit.

78
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,220
How outrageous they are.

79
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,730
What are you still worried about, Sibei?

80
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,620
You did great.

81
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,020
Whenever something like this happens,

82
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,460
you have to collect the evidence.

83
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,730
If they dare to do it again,

84
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,020
just tell them

85
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,170
that threatening
or bribing others to lie

86
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,490
is a criminal offense.

87
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,730
Sibei.

88
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,250
Don't be afraid.

89
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,066
If something like this happens again,

90
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:37,250
gather your evidence,
and come to me right away.

91
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,410
I know you're all pretty busy.

92
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,020
It's a small matter.

93
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,730
As long as the case goes smoothly,
that's enough.

94
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,170
Don't stand on ceremony.

95
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,020
Export this file.

96
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,020
Officer Lin.

97
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,860
Captain Zhang.

98
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
No need to see us out.

99
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,570
Thank you for the day.

100
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,010
Don't mention it.

101
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,900
Head home and get some good rest.

102
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,770
Thank you.

103
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,220
In fact, it hasn't been easy

104
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,340
for either of them.

105
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,340
Right, Master?

106
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,050
Master!

107
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,050
Now isn't the time

108
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,540
to look at the flowers.

109
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,570
What a pity.

110
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,580
Isn't the key with you?

111
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,900
Just move it yourself.

112
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,620
Make good use of our time.

113
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,420
Give them an explanation
as soon as possible.

114
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,460
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,660
Chuchu!

116
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,620
Chuchu.

117
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,820
You're off work

118
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,250
so early today.

119
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,850
I quit, too.

120
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,500
What?

121
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,130
You quit too?

122
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,250
What happened?

123
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,490
What else could it be?

124
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,580
You think I would
try to persuade Sibei and you

125
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,330
to make peace with them?

126
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,490
No way.

127
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,330
Well...

128
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,730
Yet you did them a favor

129
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,180
by quitting, you know?

130
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,730
You should have waited for them

131
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,450
to get impatient and fire you.

132
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,250
Then they'd have to pay compensation.

133
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,780
You're something.

134
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,490
Now you know how to use legal means.

135
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,970
I finally witness your professionalism.

136
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,330
Stop teasing me.

137
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,020
Lately, I often feel useless.

138
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,940
It's okay.

139
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,540
It's a good thing.
You never liked my job anyway.

140
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,100
You said there were
too many social events.

141
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,570
Great. We can now start over, right?

142
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,940
Let's start over.

143
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,180
(Guantian Police Station)
Sibei. This is an accusation.

144
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
Officers.

145
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,420
I didn't tell her
to give false testimony.

146
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
I just told her

147
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,610
to tell the truth,

148
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,330
so we could help her.

149
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,820
Stop bothering those around me.

151
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,180
We won't.

152
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,250
Why would we do that?

153
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,060
Besides,

154
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,222
this has nothing to do with us anyway.

155
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,130
It better be.

156
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,900
Ye Sibei.

157
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,130
Aren't you tired?

158
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,300
Aren't you tired?

159
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,210
Who isn't?

160
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,210
However, no matter what,

161
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,970
we need

162
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,300
to get on with it.

163
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,300
Let's go.

164
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,330
I'll think of a way.

165
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,620
(Go to hell, Ye Sibei.
You're disgusting and shameless.)

166
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,820
Check that out.

167
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
How pitiful.

168
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,130
Let's lend them a hand.

169
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,210
- We'll help them out.
- Okay.

170
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,540
Let's go help them too.

171
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,250
Thank you.

172
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,730
Thank you.

173
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Thank you.

174
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,420
- You'll be fine.
- You're doing great.

175
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,900
You got this, young lady.

176
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,130
- You can do it.
- You'll be fine.

177
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,900
- You got this.
- Keep going.

178
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,580
(Dad)

179
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,860
Hello, Dad.

180
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,300
Sibei.

181
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,490
Come home now.

182
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,730
Something happened to your mom.

183
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,820
What happened to her?

184
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,900
She fainted.

185
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,300
Come home quickly.

186
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,420
Then call 120
and take her to the hospital.

187
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Why don't you send her to the hospital?

188
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,300
Come home first and we'll discuss it.

189
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,140
What's wrong?

190
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,730
My dad said my mom is sick.

191
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,900
I have to go check on her.

192
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,730
But he won't take her to the hospital.

193
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,660
I just feel like

194
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,490
something's off.

195
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,860
I'll come with you.

196
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,860
Okay.

197
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,210
You go up first.

198
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,422
I'll find a place to park.

199
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:28,970
Sure.

200
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,420
I said, just sell the house.

201
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,490
I don't want it.

202
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,200
I'll stay single

203
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,288
and stand by my sister
and fight the case to the end.

204
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,755
We own this house too.

205
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,730
Have you asked
for your mom's permission?

206
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,733
Have you asked for mine?

207
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:47,940
Have you asked for Chuchu's?

208
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,600
You can't sell it
just because you want to!

209
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,090
What...

210
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,090
What's on your mind?

211
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,140
Sibei.

212
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,210
Where's Mom?

213
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,050
In the room.

214
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,700
Sibei.

215
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,060
Listen to me. Leave. Head back first.

216
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,970
Nianwen, what are you doing?

217
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,940
Dad, what is this?

218
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,450
Sibei.

219
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,180
Come.

220
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,140
- Come.
- Dad.

221
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,380
Come here.

222
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,450
Look at your mom.

223
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,660
Look what she's become.

224
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,690
Mom.

225
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,300
Mom, what's wrong?

226
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,820
She hasn't taken anything or gone out

227
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,850
for days.

228
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,370
Sibei.

229
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,940
- Sibei...
- Sibei.

230
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,500
Hello.

231
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,820
Zhao Shuhui.

232
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,370
Was it you?

233
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,500
What?

234
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,060
You were behind
what happened to my brother, right?

235
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,250
Who's your brother?

236
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,180
What happened to him?

237
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,490
You're the one who called me.

238
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,180
I'm the defendant's family,

239
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,900
so we shouldn't be in contact.

240
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,311
You're getting revenge, aren't you?

241
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,610
Didn't you get what the police said?

242
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,820
That's enough.

243
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,900
I haven't contacted you, have I?

244
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,370
Then why were my brother
and Chuchu forced to quit?

245
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,060
You should ask them.

246
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,730
Maybe they just aren't capable enough.

247
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,900
They got in through connections anyway.

248
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,660
Instead of working,

249
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,060
why did they quit?

250
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:38,730
Let's check on Mom first.

251
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,610
Mom, how are you feeling?

252
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,660
If you're not feeling well,
why not go to the hospital?

253
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,300
I'm alright.

254
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,940
I'll be fine after a nap.

255
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,020
Forget about saving money.

256
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,466
Go get checked if you feel unwell.

257
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,555
I'm not going.

258
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,180
How did I raise such a daughter?

259
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,420
When will you finally grow up?

260
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,370
You've been stubborn, willful,

261
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,644
and sharp-tongued since you were little.

262
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,540
And you've always
competed with Nianwen.

263
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,820
You've always said

264
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,020
we're being unfair,

265
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,190
and we always play favorites.

266
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:45,370
Now that you've grown up,

267
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,540
you just keep running away.

268
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,250
We finally got you home,

269
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,060
and you still think
we're holding you back.

270
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,370
We didn't have a single relative
in that big city.

271
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,180
You were all alone.

272
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,060
If something happened,

273
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,300
could your dad and I

274
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,820
just grow wings and fly to you?

275
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,300
We hoped you'd grow up

276
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,610
and become more sensible.

277
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,650
When will you...

278
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,170
When will you ever understand?

279
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,650
You keep saying

280
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,930
I don't care about you,

281
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,300
and I don't love you.

282
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,410
That I want to hurt you.

283
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,170
Ye Sibei, I'm your mother.

284
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,300
Would I ever hurt you?

285
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,610
You're a girl.

286
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,820
Tell me how I should treat you.

287
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,288
Tell me how I should love you.

288
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,450
Your grandma,

289
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,300
your aunt,

290
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,500
and I have been there.

291
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,244
None of us ever complained about things.

292
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,260
In the end, women just

293
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
get married

294
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,650
and have kids.

295
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,610
Isn't that right?

296
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,300
Why can't you do the same?

297
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,410
Why do you have to ask for so much?

298
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:41,930
Mom, let's not talk about this.

299
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,060
It's not good for your health.

300
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,930
Tell me about it.

301
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,140
I'm all ears.

302
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,170
What did I do wrong?

303
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,500
Say something.

304
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,740
I don't get it either.

305
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,500
How can you find this blatant unfairness

306
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,370
normal?

307
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,740
You didn't go to school,

308
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,650
so my uncle could.

309
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,170
You took care of Grandma,

310
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,840
but all the property went to my uncle.

311
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,650
Don't you feel any resentment at all?

312
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,170
No.

313
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,010
You do.

314
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,930
But everyone told you that's wrong.

315
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,820
That it's selfish and ungenerous.

316
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:24,370
You were forced
to live that way your whole life.

317
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,060
So you think I should do the same.

318
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,930
I know you love me.

319
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,500
But your love for me
isn't the same as for Nianwen.

320
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,020
What you have for me isn't just love.

321
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,580
There's jealousy too.

322
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,010
Sibei.

323
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,060
I'm jealous of you?

324
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm your mother. I'm jealous of you?

325
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,060
What would I be jealous of?

326
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,930
You can't accept
that I won't live like you.

327
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,410
Because that means
rejecting your whole life.

328
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:14,740
You keep saying it's for my own good.

329
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,610
But sometimes you can't tell good

330
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,610
from bad.

331
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,450
Yes.

332
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,060
I can't tell good from bad,

333
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,900
but you do.

334
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,300
Times have changed, Mom.

335
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,930
I know why you didn't
want me to go to the police.

336
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,610
But look.

337
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,540
Nianwen supports me.

338
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,930
Chuchu supports me.

339
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,300
Qin Nan supports me, too.

340
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,300
Times have changed.

341
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:43,850
Times have changed?

342
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,930
Then... Then why am I still lying here?

343
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,020
Have you ever seen your dad
this anxious before?

344
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,980
Sibei. If times have changed,

345
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,650
why are you still
wasting your time here?

346
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,300
You're the victim.

347
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,370
You should have won by now.

348
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,370
Why is it never-ending?

349
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,740
You're right about one thing.

350
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,410
I do treat Nianwen better than you.

351
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,930
Because he's a boy.

352
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,770
Right?

353
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,300
I know it's unfair to you.

354
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,890
But Sibei,

355
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,060
can you listen to me, please?

356
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,540
Heed my advice

357
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,020
and negotiate with them.

358
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,260
Name a number and end it all.

359
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,170
We can't keep doing this.

360
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,140
Sibei.

361
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,130
Sibei.

362
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,060
Come out now.

363
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Something happened!

364
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:23,930
Sibei.

365
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,300
What is it, Nan?

366
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,930
What happened?

367
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,930
We have to go home now.

368
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,890
Mom, we're leaving.

369
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,820
What happened, Nan?

370
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,130
Officer Lin just called.

371
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,580
Someone's been snooping at the station.

372
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,220
They might be coming for us now.

373
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,170
We have to leave now.

374
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,755
- Mom, we're off.
- Nianwen, lock the door.

375
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,300
Slow down, Nan.

376
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,650
- Ms. Ye! Ms. Ye!
- Ms. Ye!

377
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,370
Let's go!

378
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,610
- Ms. Ye!
- Ms. Ye!

379
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,970
Where are they?

380
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:03,850
Check over there.

381
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,690
Here.

382
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,460
They're gone.

383
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,410
How could this happen?

384
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,410
Sibei.

385
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,220
Dad, what's the situation there?

386
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,300
Don't worry about it.

387
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,540
Nianwen has called the police.

388
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,000
He and your mom are driving them away.

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,370
Don't come back. You hear me?

390
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,610
She's not Ms. Ye!

391
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,020
She's not! You've got the wrong person!

392
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,740
(How absurd. Behind sexual assault
is continuous personal persecution.)

393
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,780
(We strongly urge authorities
to take this case seriously.)

394
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,866
(The case has been handed over
to the procuratorate.)

395
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,460
(The victim is innocent
and shouldn't be blamed.)

396
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,300
(That rapist is absolute trash.)

397
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,260
(Does he have a daughter? Isn't he afraid
the same could happen to her someday?)

398
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:03,890
Was it you who contacted the media?

399
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,130
Of course not.

400
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,610
All those online posts

401
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,850
and ridiculous rumors,
that was your doing, right?

402
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,170
It wasn't me.

403
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:11,644
You did those awful things

404
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,370
and someone posted them online.

405
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,610
It has nothing to do with me.

406
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,330
What more do you want?

407
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,460
I haven't even pushed you
to the edge yet.

408
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,530
Haven't you?

409
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:21,650
You had those people
splash paint on my house.

410
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,500
You had them harass me
and send me texts.

411
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,130
You got Chuchu fired.

412
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,610
And you said
you haven't pushed me to the edge?

413
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,980
Chuchu quit on her own.

414
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,170
You gave her an impossible choice.

415
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,410
And you call that voluntary resignation?

416
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,850
This has nothing to do with me.

417
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,610
Those self-media posts
have nothing to do with me either.

418
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,730
Ye Sibei.

419
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:47,970
Listen here.

420
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,370
Not you alone

421
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,610
have paid the price for what happened.

422
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,580
We haven't had it better either.

423
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,330
Now that it's come to this point,

424
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,610
have you ever considered

425
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,130
if you're at fault too?

426
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,650
No.

427
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,170
I...

428
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,210
I...

429
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,860
I...

430
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,730
Sibei.

431
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,860
It's alright.

432
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,580
We're all ready.

433
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,170
From now on,

434
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,177
stop looking at your phone.

435
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,300
They're doing all this

436
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,980
to stop you.

437
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,930
Sibei.

438
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,980
They're afraid of you.

439
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,300
Why is Sibei

440
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,220
being so stubborn?

441
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,090
If she gives in to them

442
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,355
and negotiates with the Fan family,

443
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,500
the problem will be solved, right?

444
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,500
Why don't you get it, Dad?

445
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,650
It's not something to give in.

446
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,540
We've managed to come to this point

447
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,955
because Sibei hasn't given in to them.

448
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:31,600
If Sibei hadn't filed that lawsuit,

449
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:33,300
the Fans wouldn't have come
to negotiate.

450
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,260
Now they've come to us.

451
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,133
No matter how much money they offer,

452
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,530
as long as we take it,
Sibei will forever be accused

453
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:39,800
of making a false accusation.

454
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,650
Dad, are you trying
to push Sibei to the edge?

455
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
How could you say

456
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,911
I'm trying to push her to the edge?

457
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,820
Can't she take
some minor grievance in life?

458
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,260
You call this a minor grievance?

459
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,300
Since ancient times,
there has been injustice.

460
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,500
How can you say
this is just a minor grievance?

461
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Well, Dad,

462
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,740
if it were you, could you stand it?

463
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,690
Yes!

464
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,740
I can stand anything.

465
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:02,800
I've put up with plenty
for your sake and your sister's.

466
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,980
I haven't said anything

467
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,300
these past two months.

468
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,260
But now we can't even
bring food to the table.

469
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,330
What can you do?
Can you magically make money appear?

470
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,540
I've told you a million times
to sell the house.

471
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,500
Have you asked for Chuchu's opinion?

472
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,850
Are you going to do this to her?

473
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,580
Guifen.

474
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,980
Look at your son.

475
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,377
He's about to do something stupid.

476
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,260
Go check if they're gone.

477
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,890
It's late.

478
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,170
They should've left by now.

479
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,850
It's getting late.

480
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,980
Get Chuchu home already.

481
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,090
Guifen.

482
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,170
You should talk to Nianwen.

483
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,220
Can you stop it?

484
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,420
Chuchu.

485
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,020
It's pretty late.

486
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,260
I'll send you home.

487
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,300
Okay.

488
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
Let's go.

489
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Say goodbye to Mom.

490
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,980
Mrs. Ye,

491
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,060
I'll be leaving now.

492
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,300
Take care.

493
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,260
Let's go.

494
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,650
Let's just stop here.

495
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
Chuchu.

496
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,260
Our house...

497
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,020
I might have to sell it.

498
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,740
I'm sorry. I...

499
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,740
I'm not capable enough.

500
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,460
Given my family's situation,

501
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,220
I really have no idea when I can

502
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,020
give you a stable life.

503
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,860
So...

504
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,580
So you know, I...

505
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,540
I really don't want you
to suffer with me.

506
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,380
I mean...

507
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,980
We...

508
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,500
We...

509
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,340
Ye Nianwen.

510
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,980
Do you love me?

511
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
As long as you love me

512
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,740
and care about me, that's enough.

513
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:37,220
Honestly, I don't care
that much about the house.

514
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,980
What I care about is you.

515
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,460
It's okay.

516
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,020
We're still young.

517
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,410
We can take our time
and make money together.

518
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,660
Right?

519
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,490
Right?

520
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
You've grown up.

521
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,540
You're amazing.

522
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,220
Just bear this in mind.

523
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,410
No matter what happens in the future,

524
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,740
Ye Nianwen loves Chuchu.

525
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,580
Chuchu loves Ye Nianwen.

526
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,090
Okay.

527
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,300
I'll bear that in mind.

528
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,300
Always.

529
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,740
Ye Nianwen loves Chuchu.

530
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,410
Chuchu loves Ye Nianwen.

531
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,170
Just go to the shop.

532
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,466
You don't have to stay with me.

533
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,020
You still need to make money.

534
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,540
How will you get back later?

535
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,820
I'll take the bus.

536
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,340
Don't worry.

537
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,530
I'm off.

538
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,260
Officer Lin.

539
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Ye Sibei?

540
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,330
Do you have a cold?

541
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,300
You're all bundled up.

542
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,340
No.

543
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,460
Come with me.

544
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,500
Drive slowly.

545
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,300
Stay safe. Bye.

546
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Okay.

547
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,860
Nan.

548
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,300
Nianwen?

549
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:57,740
What's the matter?

550
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,580
Nan.

551
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,330
There's a warning light on

552
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,330
in my car.

553
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,300
Can you take a look?

554
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,140
Sure.

555
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,820
Oh, right, Nan.

556
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,410
There's been progress on Sibei's case.

557
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,300
The procuratorate
has filed charges in court.

558
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,330
Jun.

559
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,540
Pass me the scanner.

560
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,580
Ask whatever you want.

561
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,170
I'll answer what I can.

562
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,977
Otherwise,
I'll pretend I didn't hear you.

563
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Do I just wait for the trial now?

564
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,820
Yes.

565
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:41,260
When it comes to cases like this,

566
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,500
it takes no more than three months

567
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,220
to get your verdict.

568
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,460
For a case like mine,

569
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,740
what are my chances of winning?

570
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,060
I understand.

571
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,850
Before the verdict,

572
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
nothing's certain.

573
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,330
You and Captain Zhang
have really worked hard.

574
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,820
I'll head back now.

575
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,300
Ye Sibei.

576
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,330
For you,

577
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,300
it should be over now.

578
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,410
Now that it's in our hands,

579
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,020
we'll put an end to it.

580
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,260
You don't need to stay stuck.

581
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,580
You can look ahead now.

582
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,490
I know.

583
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,980
I'm studying for an exam.

584
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,740
I'll be taking the CICPA test.

585
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,140
Thank you.

586
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,170
Take care.

587
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,300
Say what's on your mind.

588
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,330
I can't figure it out.

589
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,820
Then stop trying.

590
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,177
That brain of yours
won't figure it out anyway.

591
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,490
Master.

592
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,820
Ye Sibei is clearly the victim.

593
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:03,860
Why does she have
to put up with all this?

594
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,810
You should've seen

595
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,540
how she covered herself
so tightly just now.

596
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,210
Why do victims have to carry such shame?

597
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,810
What did she do wrong?

598
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,420
Stop asking why.

599
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,020
Do you think this is an exam

600
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
where you write the right answer

601
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,460
and get points?

602
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,650
What is reality?

603
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,290
What is life?

604
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,290
It's when you know the right answer,

605
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,730
but you

606
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,810
can't act

607
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,650
accordingly.

608
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:30,540
There's no standard answer to it.

609
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,810
That's what reality is.

610
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,355
(The rapist's wife and daughter.)

611
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:32,210
What are you doing?

612
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,420
Don't block our way!

613
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:34,490
Move! Go away!

614
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,060
Ms. Chuchu!

615
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:35,900
Move aside!

616
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,466
Ms. Chuchu!

617
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:37,770
Don't avoid us, Ms. Chuchu!

618
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,780
(-Ye Nianwen, you heartless vampire.
-How can you still be with her?)

619
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,360
(Huang Guifen, selling out
your daughter...)

620
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,780
(Ye Ling, you coward.)

621
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,900
(Alas, girls should really learn
to protect themselves.)

622
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,300
(Sibei, stay strong! You're amazing!)

623
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,780
(Believe in yourself.
You're stronger than you think.)

624
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,980
(Be brave. You can do it.)

625
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,860
(Certificate of Merit,
Class Star Student)

626
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,300
(2017, 5th Nancheng
Children's Piano Competition)

627
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,340
The trial's tomorrow.

628
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,130
Mr. Fan has one request.

629
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,860
He told you

630
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,610
to polish Wenwen's trophy often.

631
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,580
It gathers dust easily.

632
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,170
Dinner's ready.

633
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,210
What's wrong?

634
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,170
The trial's tomorrow.

635
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,060
Isn't that a good thing?

636
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,580
Are you nervous?

637
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,210
I'm a little scared.

638
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,020
Sibei.

639
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,860
We've come this far.

640
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,340
There's nothing left to fear.

641
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,060
Besides, I came across

642
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,733
the encouraging notes
from those netizens.

643
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,420
With all of them behind you,

644
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,690
it's Fan Jiancheng who should be scared.

645
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,500
But no one's perfect.

646
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,210
What if they find out

647
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,340
I'm not who they expect me to be?

648
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,020
They'll curse me too, won't they?

649
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,500
Stop thinking about it.

650
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,180
Let's eat.

651
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,650
Mommy.

652
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,340
Wenwen.

653
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,010
Wenwen.

654
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,860
- Mommy.
- What's it, baby?

655
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,940
It's getting late.
Why aren't you in bed?

656
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,340
Why are you crying?

657
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,980
Why aren't you in bed either?

658
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,060
I miss Daddy.

659
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,020
I miss Daddy.

660
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,210
Come here, baby.
Mommy will give you a hug.

661
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,170
Hear me out.

662
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,540
Well,

663
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,090
Daddy...

664
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,730
Daddy has been framed.

665
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,130
He's innocent.

666
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,420
Mr. Policeman will send him home soon.

667
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,500
So stop crying,

668
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,340
got it?

669
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,610
But my classmates called Daddy

670
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,540
a baddie.

671
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,020
They were talking nonsense.

672
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,340
There's no way Daddy's a baddie.

673
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,690
He's a good person.

674
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,290
Daddy has been kind to you,

675
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,170
hasn't he?

676
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,810
You've never seen Daddy do evil

677
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,980
or talk bad about anyone,

678
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,820
right?

679
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,090
I promise.

680
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:00,980
Your dad

681
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,130
will be home soon.

682
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,210
Let me give you a hug.

683
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,060
