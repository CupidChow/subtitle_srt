I'm Ye Sibei.

Qin Nan.

20
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,570
Sibei.

21
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,130
You're awake.

22
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,380
Qin Nan...

23
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,900
I'm sorry.

24
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,610
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,580
I'm sorry for...

26
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm sorry for letting you
see the pathetic side of me.

27
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,370
Stop apologizing to me.

28
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,050
I don't need your apology.

29
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,220
I should be the one apologizing.

30
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,420
Actually...

31
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,220
Actually, that day,

32
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,410
I was already waiting
for you down there.

33
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,020
I saw the gates were locked,

34
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,810
and the lights off,

35
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,100
so I thought you were already back home.

36
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,330
If only...

37
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,340
If only I had...

38
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,810
If only I had called you...

39
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,900
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,730
It's not your fault.

41
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,050
It was an accident.

42
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,490
No one could have expected it.

43
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,540
Qin Nan.

44
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,580
I want to make a police report.

45
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,580
I'll make a police report.

46
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,850
Okay.

47
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,020
Once you're discharged,

48
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,490
we'll go to the police station.

49
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,170
You'll win this time.

50
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,370
Justice will be served.

51
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,570
Your future...

52
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,050
will be very, very bright.

53
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,460
If anyone scorns you,

54
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,170
I'll bark back at them.

55
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,370
If anyone bullies you,

56
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,410
I'll whack them up.

57
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:18,220
You didn't do anything wrong.

58
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,170
If anyone says otherwise,

59
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,900
then it's them who did something wrong.

60
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,740
Sibei.

61
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,580
I'm your husband.

62
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,220
I'll be with you.

63
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,050
Ye Sibei.

64
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,410
You have a home.

65
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,050
You know?

66
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,410
We know you love fruit cake,

67
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,660
so we ordered one for you.

68
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,540
Nianwen, call your sister.

69
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,660
Ask her where she is.

70
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,690
Sure.

71
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,770
Allow me.

72
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:31,060
You're still playing with that?

73
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,580
Open the lid

74
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,044
- and put the candles on.
- Okay.

75
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,420
Nianwen.

76
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,260
Hey, Nan.

77
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,370
Mom's asking where you are now.

78
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,060
We're not coming.

79
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
You guys eat first.

80
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,650
Fine.

81
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,610
Ye Sibei's family?

82
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,460
Please sign here.

83
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,060
Wait, Nan.

84
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,850
Are you at the hospital?

85
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,300
Is it my sister?

86
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,330
What happened?

87
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,340
What happened to her?

88
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,300
What happened?

89
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,220
Where are you now?

90
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,890
What happened?

91
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,700
Which hospital?

92
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,022
We're at People's Hospital.

93
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,890
I knew it.

94
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,580
What happened?

95
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,020
What is it?

96
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,420
Where are they now?

97
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,780
People's Hospital.

98
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,490
Wait for me.

99
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,020
Come on, Mr. Ye.

100
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,420
(Happy Birthday!)

101
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,820
Students and teachers, walk forward.

102
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,180
Stand according to your classes.

103
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,490
Stand in line.

104
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,340
Face towards me.

105
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,250
Closer to each other.

106
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,890
Okay, look here.

107
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
Three.

108
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Two.

109
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,060
One.

110
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,420
Nan.

111
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,010
Nan.

112
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,890
How's my sister?

113
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,130
What happened to Sibei?

114
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,890
She's safe now.

115
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:45,010
They're doing other checkups on her.

116
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,010
No.

117
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,300
She's always been fine.

118
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,180
Why is she in the hospital?

119
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
She drank a lot.

120
00:10:58,488 --> 00:10:59,730
It was alcohol poisoning.

121
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,300
Where is she now?

122
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,770
In the observation room.

123
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,530
- Mom!
- Alcohol poisoning?

124
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,490
Why would a girl

125
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,580
drink so much alcohol?

126
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:11,890
How was she drinking exactly?

127
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,180
Weren't you supposed
to keep an eye on her?

128
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,010
What were you doing
when she was drinking?

129
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,180
Dad, pipe down.

130
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:18,850
We'll talk about this
after Sibei is out.

131
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,680
We can talk about it.

132
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:20,980
Dad. Calm down.

133
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,900
(Emergency)

134
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,010
Your family is a strange bunch.

135
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,530
She's never been favored at home,

136
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:50,770
but when she's in trouble,
you all act like

137
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,133
you've cared about her very much.

138
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:54,220
Who are you trying to impress?

139
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,460
Our love is real,

140
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,820
but so are the deep-rooted perceptions

141
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:05,530
ingrained in our family.

142
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,940
For instance, my mom.

143
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,890
She actually cares about Sibei.

144
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,140
But she also thinks

145
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,460
that women should just live like that.

146
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:14,460
She didn't want

147
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,300
my sister to have a life beyond hers,

148
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:18,355
yet she hoped my sister
could have a good life.

149
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,511
And me...

150
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,820
You claimed I didn't want

151
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,650
my sister to go to the police

152
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,130
so that I wouldn't get implicated.

153
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,377
(Ward Building)
Perhaps that's one of the factors.

154
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,940
But I still believe that,

155
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,749
compared to the nasty comments

156
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,488
she would face after lodging a report,

157
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:40,044
it'd be better
if she didn't go to the police.

158
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,300
Nan, you know what?

159
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,420
Making a police report
is just the beginning.

160
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
After that, she'd be called in
to take statements

161
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,130
and retell her experience.

162
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,980
She'd have to recall

163
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,650
those painful moments

164
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,130
and get judged by the public

165
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,500
who'd spread rumors about her.

166
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,610
Then, there's the possibility
of failing her case.

167
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,300
That's why

168
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,460
I was thinking...

169
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,300
I was thinking

170
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,010
that making my sister bear

171
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,740
and sacrifice so much...

172
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,820
Is it worth it?

173
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,140
Nianwen.

174
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,730
Say, why do people pursue justice?

175
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,060
Because justice is
the basis of a well-lived life.

176
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
If someone's world

177
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,770
doesn't even have basic justice,

178
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,060
how do you expect her to believe

179
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,890
that she can live well in this world?

180
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,490
Other people can bully her

181
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,466
and get away with it.

182
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:42,220
She paid in kindness,
yet received malice.

183
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,770
How do you expect your sister
to accept a world like this?

184
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,690
Yes,

185
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,530
she chose to go to the police.

186
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,100
She'd have to face many obstacles,

187
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,770
and she's actually struggling inside.

188
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,180
If she does as you say

189
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,460
and gives up directly,

190
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,177
things may seem peaceful on the surface,

191
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:58,044
but the pain will torment her forever.

192
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,100
Is there even absolute justice?

193
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,010
If there isn't,
why do we need you people?

194
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,010
You guys aspire to be lawyers,
prosecutors and judges

195
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,650
because you want to uphold justice

196
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,820
in this world, right?

197
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,690
You.

198
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,820
Me.

199
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,060
Ye Sibei.

200
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,340
Every kindhearted person in this world

201
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,940
is working hard to live

202
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,300
because we pursue justice, right?

203
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,210
Hey, Mom.

204
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,850
Nianwen.

205
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,610
Your sister is missing.

206
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,420
Where is my daughter?

207
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,850
How could she disappear?

208
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,300
How could you let her go?

209
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,220
Calm down and listen to us.

210
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,850
Mom!

211
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,420
- Check the security footage!
- Don't worry, Mom.

212
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,580
Calm down first!

213
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
How?

214
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,010
Call Ye Sibei, now!

215
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,850
Miss, did you see where she went?

216
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,460
- She was walking towards the corridor.
- If anything happens to her...

217
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,130
- I thought she was using the washroom.
- I'll make sure you pay!

218
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,850
So we didn't pay much attention...

219
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,300
Dad, keep an eye on Mom.

220
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,040
Let's split and search.
Keep in touch by phone.

221
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,130
We're going to search now.

222
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,130
Right away.

223
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,780
Wait for me.

224
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,940
Sibei!

225
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,370
Hello, Sir.

226
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,490
Have you seen a woman

227
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,288
wearing a patient's uniform
walk out of here?

228
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:13,020
No.

229
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,890
She looks like this.

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,890
No, I haven't.

231
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,490
You haven't?

232
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,330
No.

233
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,700
(Multi-Service Counter)

234
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,130
Sibei!

235
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,380
Sibei!

236
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Where are you going?

237
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,250
Mrs. Ye!

238
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,250
Let go of me!

239
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,380
- Calm down, Mrs. Ye!
- Let go of me!

240
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,770
Mrs. Ye!

241
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,620
Ye Sibei, what are you doing?

242
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,860
- Mom, not so hard!
- Let go of me!

243
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,620
Let go!

244
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,140
What in the world are you trying to do?

245
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,490
Where are you going?

246
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,060
Tell them

247
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,620
where you're going.

248
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm going to make a police report.

249
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,220
Police?

250
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,330
For what?

251
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,140
On the night of April 9,

252
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,140
I didn't return home.

253
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,730
I was raped.

254
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,570
Nonsense!

255
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,060
That's nonsense.

256
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,910
You...

257
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,010
You're crazy.

258
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,860
Ye Sibei.

259
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,220
How much longer are you keeping this up?

260
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,050
Qin Nan, you...

261
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,220
Go look for the doctor.

262
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,140
Come.

263
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,980
Come with me!

264
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,140
Mom, calm down.

265
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,220
Hear her out!

266
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,050
I...

267
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,770
I'm going to seek justice for myself.

268
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,380
I'm going to make a police report.

269
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,940
I won't let you do that.

270
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,770
I didn't let you then,

271
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,460
I'm not letting you now,

272
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,380
and I won't let you go, even tomorrow!

273
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,860
Why?

274
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
You're asking why?

275
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,140
You're asking why?

276
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,570
So what if they find him

277
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,140
and prove that he's guilty?

278
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,140
Would that restore your chastity?

279
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,220
What would others say about you?

280
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,380
Have you thought about that?

281
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,730
I have.

282
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,422
I'd live in pain
if I heard their gossip.

283
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,140
But even if I hold back,

284
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,620
would that stop the pain?

285
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,380
Since both options are painful,

286
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,620
why do I need to hold back?

287
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,850
Sibei.

288
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,010
That's how life is,
holding back your feelings.

289
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,460
You...

290
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,940
Have you thought about us?

291
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,490
Qin Nan.

292
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,050
And

293
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:45,940
your father.

294
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,860
And

295
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,380
Nianwen and Chuchu.

296
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,770
What about us?

297
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,940
What would people

298
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,330
say about our family?

299
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,570
And the two of them are getting married.

300
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,860
What about their lives?

301
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,180
You can't just think of yourself.

302
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,620
How could you be so selfish?

303
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,730
Me, selfish?

304
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,140
Am I selfish?

305
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,250
You and Dad wanted a son,

306
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,460
so you had me, then Nianwen.

307
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,460
After that, you abandoned me
in the village for three years.

308
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,490
When Dad lost his job

309
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,380
and we all lived in poverty,

310
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,490
I was blamed for being a jinx.

311
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,570
So you're not selfish?

312
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,460
You wanted Nianwen
to attend a good school

313
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,890
and paid for his education.

314
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,940
I didn't get a single cent
for my studies!

315
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,380
After graduating, I worked hard

316
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,770
and landed a decent job.

317
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,250
You were worried
that no one would fend for you,

318
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,822
and you created a scene at my workplace,

319
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:40,140
which made me lose my job

320
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,490
and forced me to move back here!

321
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,770
So you're not selfish?

322
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,860
When I got married,

323
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,220
and got a job,

324
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,010
you never asked me

325
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,940
if I was okay,

326
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,660
or if Qin Nan and I

327
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,622
ever quarreled.

328
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:55,050
But when Nianwen was planning
to get married and buy a house,

329
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,460
you came to me, asking for money.

330
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,380
You think I don't need money?

331
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,010
You say that I'm selfish,

332
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,490
but what about you?

333
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,730
What have you done for me?

334
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,940
Even now, given my situation,

335
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,330
I don't expect you
to do anything for me.

336
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,010
All I want is justice.

337
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,460
Is that selfish of me?

338
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,770
You are selfish.

339
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:27,940
I gave birth to you and raised you up.

340
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,900
You say that I've never
done anything for you.

341
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,050
Why do you think I'm stopping you

342
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,220
from filing a police report?

343
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,380
Why do you think

344
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,140
I'm stopping you from divorcing him?

345
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,730
Is it because of me?

346
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,140
It's because of you!

347
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,330
Then let me make my police report!

348
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,460
The reason I'm here now

349
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,490
and not at the rooftop

350
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,940
is that I want to send that scumbag

351
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,140
to jail!

352
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,620
I'm not even scared of dying.

353
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,140
Do you think I'd fear what lies ahead?

354
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,220
Mom.

355
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,900
If you still think of me
as your daughter,

356
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,140
let me go.

357
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,330
Sibei.

358
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,490
Go.

359
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,180
I'll go with you to the police.

360
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,840
I was

362
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,790
an insensible kid.

363
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,830
Actually, I knew what was going on.

364
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,340
I could feel it.

365
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,290
I just didn't dare think too much.

366
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,530
I thought

367
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,140
that since I didn't do those things,

368
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,380
I didn't have to feel guilty.

369
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,530
I thought I was deserving

370
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,140
of the benefits you gave me.

371
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,570
That's why I never cared about you.

372
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,530
Whenever something happened,

373
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,620
I was running away subconsciously.

374
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,380
I made up excuses for myself.

375
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,570
But I actually knew...

376
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,140
Sibei.

377
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,250
You were right.

378
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,420
I remember that back in class,

379
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,940
my teacher told me

380
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,290
that law itself is fighting against

381
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,290
the evil of this world.

382
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,220
It's never been an easy path,

383
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,380
but someone has to trod it.

384
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,730
If you don't fight for your own rights,

385
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,900
no one would ever know
what's right or wrong.

386
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,780
Sibei.

387
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,940
I didn't want you to go to the police

388
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,140
because I felt miserable,

389
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,620
but I never asked you

390
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,900
if that was what you wished.

391
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,620
If you want to do it now,

392
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
I'll come with you.

393
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,860
Let's file a police report.

394
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,380
No matter the results,

395
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,620
you're not the one at fault.

396
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,650
Thank you.

397
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,900
Do you feel unwell?

398
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,860
Are you feeling okay?

399
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,930
I'm good.

400
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,860
I've never felt better.

401
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,530
Nianwen, get in the car.

402
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,470
Coming.

403
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,300
Huang Guifen.

404
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,980
How could you hide something

405
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,340
so important from me?

406
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,700
Are you blaming me now,

407
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,370
Mr. Ye?

408
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,888
Would it make any difference?

409
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,620
Have you cared about anything

410
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,140
in this household?

411
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:47,810
Don't you have any common sense?

412
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,490
She should have

413
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,380
gone to the police right away!

414
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,810
What you're doing now is
letting the rapist get off scot-free!

415
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,140
If anything

416
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,460
had happened to Sibei,

417
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,140
you'd be an accomplice to the rapist!

418
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,420
Go on.

419
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,570
Of course, I will.

420
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,210
Answer me.

421
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,900
Why did you hide it from me?

422
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,330
Who do you think I am?

423
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,900
Ye.

424
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,220
You're already
an old man in your sixties.

425
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,380
How could you be as naive

426
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,140
as Qin Nan and Nianwen?

427
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,620
Why can't you understand anything?

428
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
Do you think that going to the police

429
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
would restore
your daughter's reputation?

430
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,860
I'm telling you,

431
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,250
it won't do any good to Ye Sibei.

432
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,220
Fine.

433
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,155
You think looking for the police
is the right thing to do?

434
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,050
She's going there now.

435
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,140
Ye Ling, I'm telling you,

436
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,220
brace yourself.

437
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,220
Be prepared for what's about to come.

438
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,220
This is just the beginning.

439
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,570
Are you coming?

440
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,740
(Police Reception)

441
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,380
Do you need any help?

442
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:14,000
I'd like to lodge a police report.

443
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:24,620
Have some water.

444
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,860
Thank you.

445
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,140
Why are you wearing a hospital uniform?

446
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,866
You could've changed
into something else.

447
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,900
This must be urgent.

448
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,570
I was worried that any longer,

449
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,460
and I'd never come.

450
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,620
Ms. Ye,

451
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,900
don't be nervous.

452
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,900
Once you're ready,

453
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,860
we can begin.

454
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,810
Let's confirm your basic information.

455
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,460
Your name.

456
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,140
Ye Sibei.

457
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,660
Age.

458
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,620
28 years old.

459
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,140
Address.

460
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,660
503, Block 9, Fuxing Street, Nancheng.

461
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,810
Place of work.

462
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,620
Fuqiang Real Estate.

463
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,140
Your case?

464
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,900
I've been raped.

465
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,850
Nianwen.

466
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,500
Sit down.

467
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,360
Nan.

468
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,930
Aren't you worried about my sister?

469
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,360
She's brave.

470
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,010
Braver than any of us.

471
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,010
Since when did you feel

472
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,900
that your mind was in a blurred state?

473
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,690
When I got in the car.

474
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,180
Who else was in the car?

475
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,780
My friend,

476
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,060
who's also my brother's fiancée, Chuchu.

477
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,090
And my superior,

478
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,570
Fan Jiancheng.

479
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,090
You trust both of them, don't you?

480
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,010
Yes.

481
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,420
Why do you

482
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,730
trust Fan Jiancheng?

483
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,060
Because I...

484
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,900
I thought he was a nice man.

485
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,290
He was kind to all of us.

486
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
Also,

487
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,730
he was the one who recruited me.

488
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,380
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
It's okay.

491
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,780
No rush.

492
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,320
Relax, Sibei.

493
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,810
After I got in the car,

494
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,730
I felt intoxicated.

495
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,860
My mind was in an unclear state.

496
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,620
When I woke up,

497
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,810
I realized I was in the car.

498
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,980
When it ended...

499
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,300
What ended?

500
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,570
The rape.

501
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,380
Please be specific.

502
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
I heard...

503
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Tick.

504
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,650
Tick.

505
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,850
Tick.

506
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,900
A ticking mechanical sound.

507
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,220
Then, I woke up.

508
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,810
I felt...

509
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,250
I was probably at the back seat.

510
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,180
I was blindfolded.

511
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,940
I was laid down on a leather seat.

512
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,460
It was narrow.

513
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,660
He was on top of my body.

514
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,920
Moving.

515
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,940
When you said "moving",

516
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,810
did you mean he was touching you,

517
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,010
or was it

518
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,810
intercourse

519
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,490
or anything else?

520
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,810
Is it important?

521
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,650
It is.

522
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,060
Intercourse.

523
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,420
Was he

524
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,730
talking to you?

525
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,680
He was an aging man.

526
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,510
Rough hands.

527
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:38,419
Ye Sibei.

528
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:40,929
You haven't told me what he said to you.

529
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:42,659
Can I get a different officer?

530
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,209
I understand how you feel.

531
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:55,169
But even if we get you another officer,

532
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,659
these are questions we have to ask.

533
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:00,169
Are they necessary?

534
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,379
It's all about seeking the truth.

535
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,609
If it's for seeking the truth,

536
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,739
what I said earlier
should suffice, right?

537
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:07,899
No.

538
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:08,739
Why?

539
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,609
What's important should be

540
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:11,339
who he is,

541
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,339
and just arrest him, right?

542
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,609
Ms. Ye.

543
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:19,649
The details

544
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:21,219
are crucial to solving the case

545
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,929
and proving his guilt.

546
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,449
I hope you can understand.

547
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:27,529
To anyone other than you yourself,

548
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:30,609
what you said may not be the truth.

549
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:32,929
You have to be honest.

550
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:36,089
Only honesty can represent the truth.

551
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:38,699
What I'm saying is the truth.

552
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:40,939
I'm being honest.

553
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,189
Then continue.

554
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,899
The truth has to be spoken

555
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,179
and verified before
it can be acknowledged.

556
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,699
It is a painful process, of course.

557
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:53,339
But if you don't speak up,

558
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:55,419
the truth will never emerge.

559
00:34:58,259 --> 00:35:00,179
What you will face in the future

560
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:01,179
might be

561
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:02,699
much crueler

562
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:04,529
than this,

563
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:05,369
and

564
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:07,529
there will be tougher questions.

565
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,699
If you can't even stand

566
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,649
answering questions like this,

567
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:25,089
your path would be difficult.

568
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,782
Pretending, are you?

569
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:47,472
"Pretending, are you?"

570
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,670
Yell!

571
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,300
Or else I'll kill you!

572
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,870
"Yell!"

573
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,840
"Or else I'll kill you!"

574
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,980
And then?

575
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,730
I yelled.

576
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,220

(Guantian Police Station)

578
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,620
Captain Zhang?

579
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,700
Qin Nan?

580
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,500
Captain Zhang.

581
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,050
Ye?

582
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,275
Why are you guys here?

583
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,740
Sibei.

584
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,990
Are you okay?

585
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,140
Ye Sibei

586
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,460
is my wife.

587
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,660
Captain Zhang.

588
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,530
I'm counting on you.

589
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,300
Of course.

590
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,500
It's my job.

591
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,220
Ye Sibei.

592
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,410
You did the right thing.

593
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,780
Go home and rest.

594
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,050
We'll inform you if there's anything.

595
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,608
Captain Zhang still has the report

596
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,860
about your case from before.

597
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,730
Don't worry.

598
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,850
Thank you.

599
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,930
Thanks, Captain Zhang.

600
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,780
We're going home now.

601
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,570
Okay.

602
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,820
We'll keep you informed.

603
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Bye, Captain Zhang.

604
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,660
Goodbye.

605
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,820
Oh no.

606
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,780
What is it?

607
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,650
I made a mistake.

608
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,160
I need to make a report.

609
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,450
Sibei.

610
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,410
Don't be scared.

611
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,631
I've got everything planned out.

612
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:36,570
I'll get my mentor,

613
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,130
Meng Xin, to represent you.

614
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,260
He's amazing.

615
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:39,860
He's helped

616
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,420
many people to seek justice.

617
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,100
Okay.

618
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,890
Sibei.

619
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,780
Are you okay?

620
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,980
(I finally felt like)

621
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,730
(my future was no longer bleak.)

622
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,340
(Just unknown.)

623
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,460
Did you hurt your hand?

624
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,300
No.

625
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,564
It's okay, you don't have to.

626
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:29,940
I'm almost done, Sibei.

627
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,380
Just one more.

628
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,940
That's okay.

629
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,460
I don't need it now.

630
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,610
Sibei.

631
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,730
I'm so sorry.

632
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,650
Why are you apologizing?

633
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,820
I should've sent you
back home that night.

634
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,500
I'm sorry.

635
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,500
I'm so sorry.

636
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,180
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,650
You're a lady too.

638
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,500
If he had sent me home first that night,

639
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,340
I'd probably be the one apologizing now.

640
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:21,570
But when I left the car that night,

641
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,980
I really didn't notice.

642
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,940
You were drunk.

643
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,860
I don't blame myself.

644
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:30,500
You shouldn't blame yourself, either.

645
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,820
Sibei.

646
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,820
What exactly happened that night?

647
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,260
Weren't you still fine

648
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,390
when I got out of the car?

649
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,420
I don't know, either.

650
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,370
Sibei.

651
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,380
It's over.

652
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,970
Don't think too much.

653
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,100
It's okay.

654
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Hey, Chuchu.

655
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,340
Nan.

656
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,100
Have you eaten?

657
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:15,231
I was planning to do so
once you're here.

658
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,050
I just dropped by to visit Sibei.

659
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,820
See you, Sibei.

660
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Don't overthink it.

661
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,820
You must be hungry.

662
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I've got egg soup

663
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,660
and congee.

664
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,860
Which one do you want?

665
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,820
Egg soup, then.

666
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,850
Sure.

667
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,090
Eat up.

Hello.

Well...
