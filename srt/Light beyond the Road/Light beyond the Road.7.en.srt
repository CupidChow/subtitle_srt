=Episode 7=

4
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,600
The interrogation was halfway through.
And you wanted to leave him hanging.

5
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:56,620
Now, great.

6
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,130
He leaves us hanging instead.

7
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,820
Strategy?

8
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,540
I don't see
your strategy doing any good.

9
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,660
Why are you

10
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,210
so impatient?

11
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,260
If you're so impatient,

12
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,500
how can you be a criminal investigator?

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,688
Fan Jiancheng is so cunning.

14
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:10,933
How can I not be anxious?

15
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,500
You really aren't worried.

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,380
Your work attitude right now
is a problem.

17
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,540
Have you already decided
that Fan Jiancheng

18
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,780
is the criminal?

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,410
Listen.

20
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,500
This is a major taboo for us police.

21
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,820
Before the verdict comes out,

22
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,940
he's just a suspect.

23
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,260
Do you get that?

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,540
Who are you to judge?

25
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:35,729
If you keep this up,

26
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,488
you might as well
quit criminal investigation.

27
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,220
Everyone makes mistakes.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,660
Weren't you also reprimanded

29
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,220
for showing the photos and videos

30
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,290
to Qin Nan?

31
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,780
Is...

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,410
Is that the same?

33
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,260
Back then,

34
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,500
I was completely unaware
and acting in a personal capacity.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,940
I think you have a point.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,890
I was wrong.

37
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,820
I was just too anxious.

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,260
If you're really anxious,

39
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,340
don't argue over his statement.

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,940
Keep looking for new evidence.

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,410
Why can't the testimonies

42
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,100
about Ye Sibei being drunk

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
be used as evidence?

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,430
The testimonies show

45
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,500
she wasn't sober that night.

46
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,410
So Fan Jiancheng's claim

47
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,500
that Ye Sibei seduced him
doesn't hold up.

48
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,380
Being drunk

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,000
itself is a very weak piece of evidence.

50
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,890
Think about it. Someone drinking.

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,550
Their

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,740
mood, environment,

53
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,730
and the way they drink

54
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,170
matter a lot.

55
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,100
You're right.

56
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,340
Chuchu mentioned before

57
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,940
that Ye Sibei was upset that night.

58
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,820
How about this?

59
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,340
Call Ye Sibei here again.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,500
We'll take another statement.

61
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,500
Okay.

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,020
(Police)

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,340
Do you and Fan Jiancheng
have any contact

64
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
outside of work?

65
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,500
No.

66
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,810
We never chatted privately.

67
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,580
We only talked about work.

68
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,490
In public occasions,

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,980
he showed care for my life

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,340
like an elder.

71
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,710
I respect him a lot.

72
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,610
I'm also grateful.

73
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,410
Grateful?

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,740
Why do you feel grateful?

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,490
Because I couldn't find work.

76
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,140
Fuqiang didn't plan to hire me at first.

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,810
It was Fan Jiancheng
who told HR to keep me.

78
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,220
So I'm very grateful.

79
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,490
Why did Fan Jiancheng ask HR

80
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,340
to let you join the company?

81
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,220
He said I was a college student

82
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,660
and capable.

83
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,490
If I were rejected due to age,

84
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,810
it'd be a pity.

85
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,850
But whether that reason was true,

86
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,100
I don't know.

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,610
Are you short of money lately?

88
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,780
Yes.

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,610
My brother is getting married
and buying a house.

90
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,780
I took a credit loan of 100,000 yuan.

91
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,050
I asked Fan Jiancheng
for proof of employment.

92
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,930
I wanted my salary written higher

93
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,100
for easier loan approval.

94
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,340
And did he give it to you?

95
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,220
Yes, he did.

96
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,340
He always acted friendly in the company,

97
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,100
so he would help with that.

98
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,370
Did you call Fan Jiancheng
after the incident?

99
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,490
I made one call.

100
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,290
I needed to ask for leave.

101
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,610
Before that...

102
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,100
Given your tolerance,

103
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,488
how much can you usually drink?

104
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,980
I'm not sure.

105
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,490
Because I rarely drink.

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,100
I had never really gotten drunk before.

107
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
But you did drink before.

108
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,930
What's the most you've had at once?

109
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,930
53% baijiu

110
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,660
served in tiny glasses...

111
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,810
Around 13 glasses.

112
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,460
That's impressive.

113
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,850
When you say
you've never been truly drunk,

114
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,730
what did it feel like?

115
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Just a bit dizzy,

116
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,980
feeling excited,

117
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,250
wanting to talk,

118
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,850
but still fully aware.

119
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,580
At most, walking would sway a bit.

120
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,170
So your consciousness was clear?

121
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
Sibei.

122
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,050
I asked a friend.

123
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,980
The water plant where he works
is short of a bookkeeper.

124
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,220
But the pay is a bit low.

125
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,610
I've already spoken to him.

126
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,730
Do you want to check it out?

127
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,730
No problem.

128
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,930
I'll tell him.

129
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,300
Done.

130
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,460
After breakfast,

131
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,250
you can pack up and go.

132
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,170
Okay.

133
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,250
I also sent
the contact info and address on WeChat.

134
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,466
Good luck with the interview.

Just call me Dachun.

141
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,370
He told me about you.

142
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,340
I'll show you inside.

143
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,220

I'll head out first. We'll talk later.

No, Director.

I'll only take a few minutes.

152

She was previously an accountant
at a real estate company.

at your company recently?

165
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,660
Seems like

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,980
I'm an outsider. I shouldn't say much.

193
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,370
But Nan and I grew up together.

194
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,390
I know him.

195
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,610
He's kind-hearted.

196
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,130
If you two can stay together,

197
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,850
treat him well.

198
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,660
That's all.

199
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,530
It isn't like
what people are saying out there.

200
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,530
I understand.

201
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,940
If you have any difficulties,
let me know.

202
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,420
I'll be going now.

203
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,610
Mechanic.

204
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,450
Is anyone here?

205
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,820
Hurry.

206
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,130
Bro, again?

207
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:47,244
- What happened?
- Again. A tire's flat again.

208
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,370
I remember I just fixed it.

209
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,180
It got punctured again?

210
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,490
Yes, it's flat again.

211
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,420
Bro, let me see where it's punctured.

212
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,300
Here.

213
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,530
Where?

214
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,490
Here. Look.

215
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,100
Right in the center.

216
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,880
Isn't this
the one you patched last time?

217
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,780
No.

218
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,180
I remember last time I patched

219
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,088
a bit more to the side.

220
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,222
This time, it's dead center.

221
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:15,022
Look.

222
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't try to cheat me.

223
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,650
This is the hole from last time.

224
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,490
If it wasn't patched properly, fine.

225
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,940
Why are you arguing with me?

226
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,250
It's obviously not the same.

227
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,650
This is a fresh one.

228
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm the boss here.

229
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,450
What's going on?

230
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:28,969
Look at his skills.

231
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,911
It's only been a few days
since he patched the tire,

232
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,755
and it's already bad?

233
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:34,080
- Speak properly. I didn't patch it wrong, okay?
- How am I supposed to speak properly?

234
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,940
What's going on?

235
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,420
He came by a few days ago to patch it.

236
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,650
I remember it wasn't in the center.

237
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,844
It was a bit to the side.

238
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,730
Look,
it's right in the middle this time.

239
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,280
Dead center.

240
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,540
He insists
I didn't do a good job last time.

241
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,530
Do you think
two nails can make one hole?

242
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,850
I can't handle this?

243
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,390
It's fine.

244
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,330
Sorry.

245
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,300
We might need to inspect this tire.

246
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,490
Sure, go ahead.

247
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,660
Give us a moment.

248
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,220
Take a look.

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,940
This is where it was patched last time.

250
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,820
And this is the new puncture.

251
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,660
So?

252
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,420
Since it's a new puncture,

253
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,650
it can't be free.

254
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,720
But today I can give you 20% off.

255
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,450
Deal?

256
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,130
But I want you to patch it.

257
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,820
I don't want that laborer.

258
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,300
Go grab a meal first.

259
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,377
Come back in half an hour to pick it up.

260
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,850
Fix it quickly.

261
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,060
Let's go.

262
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,940
They clearly came looking for trouble.

263
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,330
Honestly,

264
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,100
I really wanted to hit him.

265
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,060
Forget it.
We're in the service industry.

266
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,530
Hi, Sibei.

267
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,220
Nan's inside.

268
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,100
Okay.

269
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
I'm back.

270
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,100
You're back.

271
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,250
How was the interview this morning?

272
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
It was okay.

273
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,370
Are you tired?

274
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,820
Look at that woman.

275
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,490
Is she
the one from our chat group last night?

276
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,330
Seems familiar.

277
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,850
Why are you so jumpy?

278
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,260
The car's fixed.

279
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,370
Drive it away and get lost.

280
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,900
What did you say?

281
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,610
Can't you understand Chinese?

282
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:14,900
I told you to get lost.

283
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,420
Seriously?

284
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,250
These darn mechanics
are driving me crazy.

285
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm not leaving.

286
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,980
I'm back again.

287
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,980
I still won't leave.

288
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,530
What can you do?

289
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,980
Qin Nan.

290
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,530
Nan.

291
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,370
Get lost!

292
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,300
Are you okay?

293
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,650
You want to fight?

294
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,940
I'm speechless.

295
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,250
I'm just fixing a car, and this happens.

296
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,780
You want to hit me?

297
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Come on, hit me here.

298
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,850
Hit me here, got it?

299
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,850
What?

300
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,690
Scared?

301
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,820
Come on, hit me here.

302
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Hit me here. Go.

303
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,060
Bro, forget it.

304
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
- Let's go.
- Qin Nan.

305
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,850
Alright.

306
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,010
We've got other things to do.

307
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,610
- Let's go.
- Just you wait.

308
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,100
Just wait!

309
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,650
Look at these lowlifes.

310
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,100
Don't take what they said
to heart, Sibei.

311
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,630
Enough, go inside with Sibei.

312
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,690
Go back.

313
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,550
Don't take what they said

314
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,350
to heart.

315
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,300
No matter what they say,

316
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,250
don't overthink it.

317
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,850
If someone says stuff like that again,

318
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,940
just cover your ears.

319
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,820
Once we finish the lawsuit,

320
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,220
we'll leave this place.

321
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,220
Don't be so impulsive anymore.

322
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,060
People like that aren't worth it.

323
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,860
Nan, Sibei.

324
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Food's here.

325
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:13,250
Let me do it.

326
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,100
It's alright.

327
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,130
Here you go.

328
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,610
How was the interview today?

329
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,100
They said I'm not a good fit.

330
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,020
It's okay.

331
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,490
I'll ask other friends.

332
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,300
If it doesn't work out,

333
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,530
you can help out at my shop.

334
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,530
Why do you have so many books here?

335
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,300
Sibei, listen to me.

336
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,980
Nan sometimes speaks all fancy

337
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,650
because he reads too much.

338
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:06,810
Don't listen to his nonsense.

339
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,980
Sometimes I just read

340
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,977
when bored fixing cars.

341
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,220
Why didn't you read at home?

342
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,200
Reading
in front of a college student like you?

343
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,250
I worry you think I'm pretending.

344
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,220
Nan is a cultured man.

345
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
You don't know Nan

346
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,250
well enough.

347
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,660

to learn about him.

Sibei.

351
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,530
Management has stepped in.

352
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,940
Come by the office when you have time.

353
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,980
They'll give you an explanation
about this matter.

354
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,500
Got it.

Sibei.

358
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,180
I don't think you should go.

359
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,250
It's clearly a trap
waiting for you to fall in.

360
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,140
Nan, what do you think?

361
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,940
What do you think?

362
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,700
I'm going.

363
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,570
They said
they'll give me an explanation.

364
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,330
I want to see what they have to say.

365
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,500
Alright.

for a ride on it.

00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:44,844
Don't let them have their way.

379
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
How about you

380
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,140
memorize some insults?

381
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,300
Got it.

382
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,610
Sibei.

383
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,460
How about

384
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,220
I go with you?

385
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,570
No need.

386
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,330
Trust me. I can handle it.

387
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,940
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

388
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,330
Ms. Ye, you...

389
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,430
Ms. Tao asked me to come.

390
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,660
Please wait a moment.

391
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,140
Hello, Ms. Tao.

392
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,220
Ye Sibei is here.

393
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,090
Have her come to Mr. Fan's office.

394
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,500
Okay.

395
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,940
Ms. Ye.

396
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,940
Ms. Tao is waiting for you
in Mr. Fan's office.

397
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,490
Thank you.

398
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,930
Sibei.

399
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,420
She's here.

400
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,730
Sibei, you're here.

401
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,180
Let me introduce you.

402
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,700
This is Mr. Zhao.

403
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,650
You've met him before.

404
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,700
And this is...

405
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,620
Sibei, why don't we sit first?

406
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,888
We'll talk after sitting.

407
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,700
Please sit.

408
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,850
Sibei.

409
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,010
Sorry.

410
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,180
You even had to come all the way here.

411
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,050
Mr. Zhao

412
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,460
values you highly.

413
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,490
So today,

414
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,050
we still want to talk about Mr. Fan.

415
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Here's 200,000 yuan.

416
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,490
Enough to clear your loan

417
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
and save a bit more.

418
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,540
Ye Sibei.

419
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,620
If you have any requests, just tell us.

420
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,420
The company will help.

421
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,140
Is this your compensation?

422
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,050
You can take it however you like.

423
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,530
But once you take the money,

424
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,860
just explain things clearly.

425
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,730
That's fine, right?

426
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,420
Explain what?

427
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,940
Don't play dumb.

428
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,220
You accused Mr. Fan.

429
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,180
That hurt the company's reputation.

430
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,250
You know that, right?

431
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,700
We could've sued you.

432
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,770
But Mr. Zhao
was generous and wanted peace,

433
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,900
so he called you here.

434
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,940
You just want money, right?

435
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,180
Now you've got it.

436
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,730
We can call it even.

437
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,940
Is that what Fan Jiancheng told you?

438
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,940
He said I wanted money?

439
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,050
If you're not happy with this amount,

440
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,420
we can discuss it.

441
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,260
Discuss what?

442
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,220
You think I framed him?

443
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,380
Sibei.

444
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,420
I know you well.

445
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,220
It can't be a false charge.

446
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,900
There must be a misunderstanding

447
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,180
between you and Mr. Fan.

448
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,050
What misunderstanding?

449
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,490
I didn't arrest him.

450
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,490
The police did.

451
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,490
What misunderstanding?

452
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,620
Tell the police that.

453
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,140
Ye Sibei.

454
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,220
Stop pretending.

455
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,900
This is Mr. Fan's wife.

456
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,740
Zhao Shuhui.

457
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,010
You just think the money's not enough.

458
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,050
If it's not for money,

459
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,220
why are you here?

460
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,220
Why am I here?

461
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,460
I came to ask

462
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,420
what Fuqiang Real Estate

463
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,700
plans to deal with that scumbag
Fan Jiancheng?

464
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,490
Who are you calling a scumbag?

465
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,380
- Who are you calling a scumbag?
- Shuhui.

466
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,220
- Shuhui.
- Say it again if you dare! Say it again!

467
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,250
Shuhui, don't be angry.

468
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,660
Well...

469
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,020
Why don't you take a short break?

470
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:49,822
Leave this to me.

471
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,940
Mr. Zhao.

472
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,620
Maybe let us talk alone.

473
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,540
Okay.

474
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,780
(Money)

475
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,890
Sibei.

476
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,090
Sibei.

477
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,050
Now it's just the two of us.

478
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,730
Listen to me.

479
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,460
I'm helping you.

480
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,530
The company doesn't know what happened,

481
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,050
so it can't just

482
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,620
take action against Mr. Fan

483
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,490
without knowing the truth.

484
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,420
They can't punish him,

485
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,460
but they can pay me

486
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,490
to make me retract?

487
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,140
You can't say it like that.

488
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,660
It's not retracting.

489
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,010
I just hope you'll tell the truth.

490
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,250
Every word I've said

491
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,620
is the truth.

492
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,220
Fine.

493
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,940
You can ignore the company's name

494
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,460
and your own reputation,

495
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,340
but you still need to make a living.

496
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,620
Have you found a job?

497
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,620
If you had found one,

498
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,380
you wouldn't be sitting here.

499
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Think about it.

500
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,430
A woman
who drinks with clients at night,

501
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:39,022
needs her superior to drive her home,

502
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:40,700
and owes a huge amount of debt.

503
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,530
And a superior
who has a happy family, upright,

504
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,220
rich and influential.

505
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,490
Who would believe it's rape?

506
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,380
What superior wouldn't think twice

507
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,530
before hiring you?

508
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,050
What if you do it again?

509
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,090
Sibei.

510
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,010
Your only way out now is to be honest,

511
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,730
apologize,

512
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,380
and return to Fuqiang.

513
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,380
Do you understand?

514
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,660
I don't have to stay in Nancheng.

515
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,940
I can leave.

516
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,020
Yes.

517
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,260
You can leave.

518
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,660
But what about your family?

519
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,530
You'd have your husband
give up his shop,

520
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,730
give up his home,

521
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,530
make Chuchu lose her job,

522
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,050
make your parents suffer shame,

523
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,220
have your brother lose his future,

524
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,660
and move the whole family away?

525
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,940
Aren't you being selfish?

526
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,460
Sibei.

527
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,810
Sometimes in life,

528
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,460
you must bow your head
and take shortcuts.

529
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,770
Take the money,

530
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,660
and everyone will be happy.

531
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,010
If you don't take it,

532
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,490
you'll hurt yourself and others.

533
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,380
It truly is a shortcut.

534
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,010
That's the right choice.

535
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,700
But I can't do it.

536
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,220
I can't accept this injustice.

537
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,620
I can't watch someone
who should be punished

538
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,290
live freely in this world,

539
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,180
doing as he pleases,

540
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,660
while I live in pain.

541
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,460
Have you really thought this through?

542
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
This path is hard.

543
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,300
I know.

544
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,940
But someone must walk it.

545
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,530
You can threaten me,

546
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,220
but I'll tell you this.

547
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,490
If you fire Chuchu,

548
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,860
this won't end well.

549
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,660
I'll go online.

550
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,050
I'll tell everyone what I know.

551
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,700
You think this is the worst outcome?

552
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,540
It's not.

553
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,380
Ye Sibei, are you insane?

554
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
You think posting it online
will draw attention?

555
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,570
People will curse you

556
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,700
for making it public!

557
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,540
We'll see!

558
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,460
I'll post the recording online.

559
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
I'll tell everyone

560
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,180
how you tried to make a victim retract.

561
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,730
I'll clearly tell the world who you are,

562
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,530
what you look like,

563
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,490
and what you've done.

564
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,620
Tao Jie, you'd better pray

565
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,180
none of you ever make a mistake.

566
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,010
Or you'll face judgment

567
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,490
from the world with me!

568
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,700
Ye Sibei.

569
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,940
You're a lunatic!

570
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,220
Stop threatening me.

571
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,420
Stop trying to stop me.

572
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,620
I'll press this case.

573
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,860
As long as I live,

574
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,180
I'll never give up.

575
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,010
I'll fight for what's right.

576
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,700
I'll demand justice!

577
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,380
I'll tell you this.

578
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,010
In this world,

579
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,420
truth and justice still exist.

580
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,780
And I

581
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,940
will get them.

582
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,570
Sibei.

583
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,180
I lost my temper, okay?

584
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,730
Calm down.

585
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,620
We can

586
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,660
talk this through.

587
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,220
Give me your phone.

588
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,060
Give it to me!

589
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,570
Stop her!

590
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,290
What happened?

591
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:36,860
Get her!

592
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,620
Don't let her leave!

593
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,900
Don't let her get away!

594
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,090
Don't let her leave!

595
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,900
- Hurry!
- Go!

596
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,570
Quick!

597
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,700
Hurry! Stop her! Don't let her get away!

598
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,860
Qin Nan, let's go!

599
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,730
Qin Nan.

600
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,220
Pull her away!

601
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,460
Grab her!

602
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,020
Sit tight.

603
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
Quick. Stop him!

604
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,650
Stop!

605
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,610
Hurry up!

606
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,250
What are you guys good for?

607
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,530
What did you do?

608
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,460
I insulted them.

609
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Why?

610
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,730
Because they threatened me!

611
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,160
♪Through the clouds♪

612
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,290
♪You hide your emotions, staying silent♪

613
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,810
♪I wish I could accompany you

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:47,440
♪If I could capture your shadow♪

615
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,540
Where are we going?

616
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,700
To celebrate.

617
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,380
Celebrate what?

618
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,530
To celebrate Ye Sibei

619
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,940
finally growing up.

620
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,490
I'm 28 already.

621
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,530
I've been an adult for years.

622
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,820
♪So I must trust in myself♪

623
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,720
♪Please let me become you♪

♪Don't be afraid, I am your soul's coat♪

629
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:56,844
That's what happened earlier.

630
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,730
Are you scared?

631
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,180
The old Ye Sibei would be scared.

632
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,940
But not the new Ye Sibei.

633
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,420
But I can't figure it out.

634
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,010
Why are there so many people

635
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,150
who defend the bad person

636
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,570
but not protect the good?

637
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,730
Some do it for gain.

638
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,980
Like people in your company.

639
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,700
Letting a powerless woman

640
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,700
admit she framed her superior

641
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,010
is easier than letting a top executive

642
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,860
face the shame.

643
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,980
Some do it to comfort themselves

644
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,220
that accepting

645
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,940
someone deserves punishment

646
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,755
is easier than accepting

647
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,180
a crime without reason.

648
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,490
Because they can believe

649
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,090
they'll be safe

650
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:58,490
as long as they don't commit sin.

651
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,460
That's the victim-blaming theory.

652
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
What else?

653
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,380
Some are just tradition.

654
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,530
But no matter the reason,

655
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,900
there are all kinds of people.

656
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,010
Some will oppose you.

657
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,860
Some will stand by you.

658
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,140
It's just that

659
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,210
good people are ignored more

660
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,780
and silenced more easily.

661
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,260
Look at them more.

662
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,260
Don't lose heart.

663
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,260
And you?

664
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,050
If good and evil have causes,

665
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,860
why are you by my side?

666
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,810
Have you dated

667
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,780
before we got married?

668
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,050
No.

669
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,460
Have you liked someone before?

670
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,980
I don't know if it counts.

671
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,460
But there was someone.

672
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,460
I always wished her well.

673
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,300
I never thought of being with her.

674
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,740
But I always wished her well.

675
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,220
I know.

676
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,530
After what happened,

677
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,380
whether out of morals or pity,

678
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,940
you'd still help me.

679
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,090
Thank you for staying with me.

680
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,980
But now you saw

681
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,460
that I can do it alone.

682
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,860
I can handle the case myself.

683
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:18,066
I can go
to the provincial capital alone.

684
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,940
I can live on my own.

685
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,610
You don't have to follow me everywhere.

686
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,090
When we get back,

687
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,740
let's go to Civil Affairs Bureau
and finalize it.

688
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,220
What if

689
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,010
I don't want to finalize it?

690
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,050
You've already done enough for me.

691
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,900
I don't want you to be burdened by duty.

692
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,170
What if it isn't duty?

693
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,010
Even without me,

694
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,780
you'd still keep moving forward.

695
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,580
Without me,

696
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,740
you'd still fight for what's right.

697
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,460
You'd start to resist.

698
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,010
You'd learn from failure.

699
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,260
Then one day,

700
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,490
maybe because of a sentence,

701
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
a book,

702
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,780
or a netizen

703
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,860
who'd tell you you were right,

704
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,490
you'd go back to the police

705
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,010
and report it.

706
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
You'll keep going alone.

707
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,940
It's always been Ye Sibei who decides.

708
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,780
Anyone could be Qin Nan.

709
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,780
If it's only duty,

710
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,300
you wouldn't need me anymore.

711
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,260
Why

712
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,130
do you think I'm here?

713
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,490
Why?

714
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,050
Must I really say it aloud?

715
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,610
You haven't answered me.

716
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,010
What is it?

717
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,980
Why celebrate my coming of age?

718
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:17,940
Because I think being grown

719
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,340
isn't the same as being legal.

720
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,420
How's it different?

721
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,420
Learning to face the world

722
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,420
in your own way is adulthood.

723
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,860
Let me ask one more question.

724
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,780
Why so many questions?

725
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,050
It's the last one.

726
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,260
Go on.

727
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,260
What's good

728
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,740
about someone like me?

729
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,860
Everything's good.

730
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
Let me count.

731
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,340
You're tough, stubborn, defiant,

732
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,980
and never give up.

733
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,420
Even poor, you'd fold paper

734
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,420
to shade the lamp.

735
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
You'd buy pretty hair clips.

736
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,820
You'd match plates when eating.

737
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,340
You'd choose different cups to drink.

738
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,940
On weekends,

739
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,610
you'd iron your clothes nicely.

740
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,940
Wherever you go,

741
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,420
you carry that dandelion flower

742
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,940
and care for it carefully.

743
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,780
Ye Sibei.

744
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,050
You have many good qualities.

745
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,260
You're truly wonderful.

746
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,740
Go to sleep.

00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,340
♪There's a gray cloud in your eyes♪
