00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,660
I'm here.

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,660
A bowl of congee
and a basket of buns, right?

8
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,010
- Yes.
- Coming right up!

9
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,170
Hello, Sibei. What is it?

10
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,170
I'm working.

12
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,380
Excuse me, where is
the gynecology department?

13
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,380
It's just ahead.

14
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,660
Keep going straight ahead.

(Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic)

16
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,890
Hello.

17
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,260
Are you Ye Sibei's mother?

18
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,044
Yes, I am.

19
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:05,100
My name is Lin Feng,

20
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,990
(Police)
with Guantian Precinct Detective Unit.

21
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,450
How is she?

22
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,820
Where is she? Is she okay?

23
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,660
Don't worry.

24
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,890
She's safe.

25
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,660
We got her call around six this morning.

26
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,911
She said she needed a coat.

27
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:20,380
We found her in a rapeseed field
on the outskirts of the city.

28
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,555
She was hiding in the field.

29
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,010
None of her belongings were taken.

30
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,690
Her wallet and phone
were still with her.

31
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,380
But she hasn't spoken a word since.

32
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,540
So, we brought her to the hospital
for an examination.

33
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,177
Our team is still processing the scene.

34
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,940
Processing it for what?

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,940
You just said she was fine.

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,540
Based on the scene,

37
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:39,980
it's possible your daughter

38
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,780
was the victim of a sexual assault.

39
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,220
Where is she now?

40
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
Please come with me.

41
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,220
So far, she hasn't given us
any statement,

42
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,820
but she did request to be examined.

43
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,260
We've confirmed she has
no other external injuries,

44
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,540
and we've collected skin cells and
tissue from under her fingernails.

45
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,660
She'll also need blood
and urine tests shortly.

46
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,340
Please wait here for now.

47
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,570
If the tests confirm she was assaulted,

48
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,540
I'll need your help to comfort her

49
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,260
and encourage her to talk to us.

(Gynecological Examination)

51
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,410
Officer, look.

52
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,140
I know my daughter better than anyone.

53
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,810
She's a good, well-behaved girl.

54
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:24,700
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

55
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,370
You... You should just go.

56
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,810
Which room is she in?

57
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,250
It's the room up ahead.

58
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,100
That one?

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,810
Let me talk to her
and get this sorted out.

60
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,660
If we need you,

61
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,100
we'll call you, alright?

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
You can go now.

63
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,210
Mrs. Ye.

64
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,660
Mrs. Ye.

65
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,410
Sibei?

66
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,250
Doctor?

67
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,370
Mrs. Ye.

68
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,850
Doctor, please open the door.

69
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,100
- Please listen to me.
- I'm the patient's family.

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,088
- Mrs. Ye.
- Let me in.

71
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,370
- Mrs. Ye.
- Please let me in, Doctor.

72
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,490
- Please open the door.
- Mrs. Ye.

73
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,288
- Please listen to me!
- What are you doing?

74
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,533
We won't disclose any details

75
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,600
of your daughter's case
to anyone unrelated to it.

76
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,050
What case?

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,540
All she did was ask you for a coat!

78
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,660
What did she even say?
Was there even a case filed?

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,140
If not, how can
there be a case to begin with?

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,980
Please calm down.

81
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,100
You're a woman too.

82
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,930
Can't you try to put yourself
in her shoes?

83
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,040
- This could affect her entire life.
- I understand.

84
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:09,911
We're in a hospital.

85
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,050
Open the door! I'm her family!

86
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,660
Open it now!

87
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,780
Mrs. Ye, please calm down!

88
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,970
Let's sit down and talk about it.

89
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:18,050
You need evidence to
make these claims, right?

90
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,980
Do you even know
where she was last night?

91
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,220
You don't, do you? Well, I do.

92
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,400
We spoke on the phone.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,810
She just had a fight with her husband.

94
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,660
We talked on the phone.

95
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,780
I have the call log right here.
I have proof.

96
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,311
You need to have proof too.

97
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,250
I need you to stay calm.

98
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,250
Otherwise, I can sue you!

99
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,250
- This is the hospital.
- I have to protect my daughter's reputation!

100
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,340
Do you understand?
I don't care where we are!

101
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,810
Please wait
until the examination is over.

102
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,540
Sibei,

103
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,100
it's me, Mom.

104
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,940
Open the door!

105
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,140
What is all this shouting?

106
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,220
This is a hospital.

107
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,700
You're disrupting our work.

108
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,620
Sibei.

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,740
Sibei.

110
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,220
I'm here.

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,340
Let me look at you.

112
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,460
Are you okay?

113
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm here.

114
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,420
Let's go home.

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Doctor, I'm so sorry.

116
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,340
My behavior was out of line.

117
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,540
Here's the thing,

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,220
could you please give us

119
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,250
all of her test results?

120
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,540
Well,

121
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,810
we didn't file a police report.

122
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,930
We have the right

123
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,340
to protect our privacy, don't we?

124
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,340
You're a woman,
and you understand, right?

125
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,355
Even so, you can't just barge in here.

126
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:23,866
Yali, take the patient back
to the recovery room.

127
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,577
Yes.

128
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,700
The physical exam's done,

129
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,720
but the blood and urine tests
haven't been completed.

130
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,980
You can discuss what to do next
once you've made up your mind.

131
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,340
Thank you, Doctor.

132
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,460
Can't you just let her rest
for a moment?

133
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,980
We have to wait for the results.

134
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,980
- If they confirm she was assaulted...
- What do you mean "if"?

135
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,340
Then this becomes a criminal case.

136
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,140
You're too young.

137
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,220
- You have no idea...
- Mrs. Ye.

138
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,780
You're a cop. You make an arrest,

139
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,580
- you get your justice...
- We...

140
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,140
And then what?

141
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,660
- What happens to her then?
- We asked you here

142
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,810
- to cooperate with us.
- You'll ruin her life, okay?

143
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,100
We asked you here to assist
us with our investigation.

144
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,460
We're handling this by the book, okay?

145
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,700
We're following the law.

146
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,140
And this is up to the victim.

147
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,577
This is not your decision to make.

148
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,500
Lin Feng.

149
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,940
Come out for a sec.

150
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,900
I'll be right at the door.

151
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,140
Call me if you need anything.

152
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,220
Are you okay?

153
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,140
Are you hurt?

154
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,140
Do you want to lie down?

155
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,020
Did that really happen

156
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,020
to you last night?

157
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,370
Sibei,

158
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,900
say something.

159
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,810
Sibei, you have to listen to me on this.

160
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,020
Here's what I think.

161
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,810
What matters most

162
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,700
is that you're safe

163
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,730
and unharmed.

164
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,810
You need to let this go,

165
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,700
alright?

166
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,490
Let's just pretend it never happened.

167
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,290
Think of it as getting bitten
by a stray dog.

168
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,977
I don't mean anything else by it,

169
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,850
but you

170
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,370
can't file a police report.

171
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,730
Just tell them you
and Qin Nan had a fight.

172
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,010
Nothing else happened.

173
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,820
What about that jerk?

174
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,060
What matters right now is you.

175
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,060
You have to protect yourself.

176
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,460
We need to keep this between us.

177
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,890
No one can know,

178
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,130
understand?

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,250
What about that jerk?

180
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,130
Sibei,

181
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,460
didn't I make myself clear?

182
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,490
No one can know about this.

183
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,444
If word gets out,
how will people look at you?

184
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,370
What about your marriage with Qin Nan?

185
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,370
If your friends

186
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,730
and relatives find out,

187
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,250
what will they think of you?

188
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,460
Your whole life

189
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
will be ruined.

190
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,940
I know this is unfair to you,

191
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,770
but this is

192
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,130
the best way to protect yourself.

193
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,820
Even if they catch him

194
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,130
and lock him up for a few years,

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,644
he will still be released
after he has served his sentence.

196
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,250
What about your future?

197
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,940
Have you thought about it?

198
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,130
I'm doing this for your own good,
don't you see?

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,820
Think about it.

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,610
If this blows up,

201
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,370
people will say

202
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,130
you

203
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,010
were drunk,

204
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:44,940
that you fooled around with someone,

205
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,010
and that's how it happened.

206
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,250
It was a company dinner.

207
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,130
I wasn't fooling around.

208
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,130
You're my daughter.

209
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,355
Of course, I believe you.
But will others believe it?

210
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,980
Can we control what people say?

211
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,100
Gossip can destroy you.

212
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,730
Sibei,

213
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,490
you have to trust me on this.

214
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,850
You must do as I say.

215
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,690
Don't file a police report, alright?

216
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,130
You must be tired.

217
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,490
Let's go home

218
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,610
and rest.

219
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,370
Captain Zhang.

220
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,130
What a coincidence.

221
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,850
You're here.

222
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,850
Captain Zhang,

223
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,580
I didn't expect to run into you here.

224
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,700
What's going on?

225
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,010
Why are you all gathering here?

226
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,850
Here, Captain Zhang.

227
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,250
What are you doing?

228
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,100
What is this?

229
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,220
You are going to smoke?

230
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,100
What is this place?

231
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,250
This is the hospital.

232
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,890
Right.

233
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,730
I'm so sorry, Captain Zhang. I forgot.

234
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,340
How about this?

235
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,730
Keep it. Keep it first.

236
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,530
No, I don't want it.

237
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,130
Thank you.

238
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,220
Okay.

239
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,770
So what are you

240
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,610
doing here?

241
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,130
Captain Zhang, when I saw you
were here today

242
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,370
with your team,

243
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,622
I knew there had to be a case.

244
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:02,260
Let me just...

245
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,730
What are you doing?

246
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,420
I just came by to see

247
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,130
if anyone might need legal assistance.

248
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,250
No, we're good.

249
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,650
Come on, Captain. You never know.

250
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,130
I don't mind waiting here for a bit.

251
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,420
Leave.

252
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,340
Don't go poking around.

253
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,980
If we actually need your help,

254
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,130
someone will let you know.

255
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,890
Leave now.

256
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,730
Alright, Captain.

257
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,600
- I'll be on my way.
- Keep your voice down.

258
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:26,770
If anyone needs representation,
please make sure to call.

259
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,100
Okay, okay.

260
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,980
My firm handles all kinds of cases.

261
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,610
Captain Zhang,

262
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,220
- thank you for your hard work.
- Okay.

263
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:35,890
I'll get out of your hair.

264
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,370
You'll get over it.

265
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,340
Stop crying.

266
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,650
Are you okay?

267
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,730
We should still complete
the blood and urine tests.

268
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,130
I'm going home.

269
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,610
Thank you for bringing me the coat.

270
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,650
I can mail it back to
the precinct tomorrow, if you'd like.

271
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,610
No, wait.

272
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,010
The examination isn't finished.

273
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,010
If you're not feeling any
major physical distress,

274
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,980
it's best to complete the tests.

275
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,610
Then you can come to the station with us

276
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,250
to give a formal statement.

277
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,490
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,610
I just had a fight with my husband.

279
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,010
It's not something you can help me with.

280
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,010
Hang on.

281
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,288
Even if it was a marital dispute,

282
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,340
what happened to you...

283
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,420
Since when do you take a statement
for a couple having a spat?

284
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,650
I've never heard of that!

285
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,730
What's wrong with you?

286
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,570
Come on.

287
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,180
Ye Sibei.

288
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,490
Ye Sibei.

289
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,330
- Ye Si...
- Enough.

290
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,890
Don't force them.

291
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,650
What kind of mother is she?

292
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,010
We need to file a case.

293
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,370
For what?

294
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,210
Don't be so dramatic.

295
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,420
I'm trying to eat here.

296
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,530
Master,

297
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,370
doesn't today's case

298
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,770
feel familiar to you?

299
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,020
No.

300
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,890
Listen,

301
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,490
don't get into that habit.

302
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,890
The case feels familiar?

303
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,420
No two cases are ever the same.

304
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,010
What I mean is,

305
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,060
the previous case

306
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,711
and today's sexual assault,

307
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,770
couldn't they be the same...

308
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,420
Who said today's case
was a sexual assault?

309
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,820
Master,

310
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,650
you saw the situation yourself.

311
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,300
The victim's state was clearly off.

312
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,650
The medical report also showed...

313
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,610
Showed what?

314
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
The victim hasn't said anything,

315
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
and you're already

316
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
drawing conclusions?

317
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,770
But her condition...

318
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,420
You're not the victim.

319
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,180
The most we can do right now

320
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,610
is follow the legal procedure.

321
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,610
But what she'll have to face afterward
goes far beyond the legal system.

322
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,530
So we're just going to do nothing?

323
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,300
Is your workload

324
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,770
too light these days?

325
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,730
Are you just fixating
on this one case?

326
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,155
That case from the other day
has been stalled for how long now?

327
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,688
Where's your sense of urgency?

328
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,420
Finish your noodles.

329
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
No.

330
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,700
Where are you going?

331
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,180
The Traffic Police unit.

332
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,111
Didn't you tell me to
follow up on the leads?

333
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,490
At least finish your noodles first.

334
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,890
What a waste.

335
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,540
What?

336
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,555
I can't believe her.

337
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,180
(Certificate: Ye Ling, 10th Place,
Nan City Outstanding Teacher Open Class)

338
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,530
Why is Sibei back home?

339
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,300
Why shouldn't she be?

340
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,555
She had a fight with Qin Nan.

341
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,010
What was the fight about?

342
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,340
Isn't it normal for couples to argue?

343
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,530
Still, she shouldn't

344
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,490
come running home
every time they have a spat.

345
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,370
A marriage

346
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,940
is like two people in the same boat.

347
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:42,220
You've got to communicate,
find common ground,

348
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,530
and work through your differences

349
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,490
if you want it to last.

350
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,980
If you just run home whenever you fight,

351
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,580
that boat is going to capsize.

352
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,140
Alright,

353
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,010
my birthday is in a few days.

354
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,460
Invite him over.

355
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,700
I'll have a word with him.

356
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,730
Alright, alright.

357
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,370
Sibei,

358
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,180
shouldn't you call your superior?

359
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,770
You skipped work today.

360
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,100
You have to tell them.

361
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,750
Tell them you caught a cold
and need to take a sick day.

362
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,288
Be back at work tomorrow morning.

363
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,130
Hurry up.

364
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,340
(Mr. Fan)

365
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,490
Ye Sibei,

366
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,580
what's going on with you?
You skipped work today.

367
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,530
Even if you're not coming in,
you should at least ask for leave.

368
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,890
You skipped work without informing.

369
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,340
Are you planning to quit now?

370
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Fan.

371
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,250
I drank too much last night

372
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,420
and ended up at the hospital.

373
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,820
I'd like to ask for a day off.

374
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,180
Nothing serious, I hope?

375
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,980
Sibei,

376
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,530
Mr. Zheng is one of our clients.

377
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,460
I couldn't really stop him last night.

378
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,420
Even if I'd tried,
it wouldn't have worked.

379
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,180
It's fine.

381
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,820
I just can't come in to work today.

382
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,420
Get some rest then.

383
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,940
You can come back to work tomorrow.

384
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,500
Okay.

385
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,260
I'm home.

386
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,090
Sibei?

387
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,140
You're here.

388
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,420
You're home, son.

389
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,490
Hi, Nianwen.

390
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,330
You must be hungry.

391
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,180
Who goes hungry these days?

392
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,777
The superiors at my firm love me.

393
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:39,420
I'm out at fancy business
dinners every night.

394
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,220
You know, the real high-end stuff.

395
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,570
Honestly, I'm sick of it.

396
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,650
Don't get so full of yourself, Nianwen.

397
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,180
You just graduated.

398
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,140
You should learn

399
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,940
to keep a low profile at work.

400
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,140
Mr. Ye!

401
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,050
Mr. Ye!

402
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,570
You'd better go take a look.

403
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,980
Li and Song are at it again,

404
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,380
arguing over the trash

405
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,730
by the entrance.

406
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,980
Those two.

407
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,422
They've been bickering for decades.

408
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,380
They're a handful.

409
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,180
Eat without me.

410
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,133
I'll go check on them.

411
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,180
Right, the earth
can't spin without you.

412
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Well, they need me.

413
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,980
Go on then.

414
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,330
We'll eat without you.

415
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,940
Sibei,

416
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,180
what brings you home today?

417
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,330
You were at
People's Hospital today?

418
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
How did you know?

419
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,660
I saw you there.

420
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,940
Why were you offering cigarettes
to those police officers?

421
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,050
I was building case sources.

422
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,660
Think about it.

423
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,250
Those cops handle cases every day.

424
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,490
They know tons of people
who might need a lawyer.

425
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,250
If they're willing
to refer victims to me,

426
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,900
I get clients.

427
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,420
Then why not just wait
at the police station?

428
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,420
I do stake out the station.

429
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,660
I heard there was a big case,

430
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,570
and the entire criminal unit
got called out,

431
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,980
so I followed them.

432
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,250
I lost them,

433
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,250
but I figured that for a major case,

434
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,844
any victims would end up
at the hospital.

435
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:21,420
So I rushed over to People's Hospital.

436
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,900
You have no idea

437
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,940
how long I searched,

438
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,380
but then I saw three officers

439
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,220
stationed outside

440
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,810
one of the rooms.

441
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:28,980
And it was right

442
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,180
near the gynecology ward.

443
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,730
My guess is

444
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,620
it's a rape case.

445
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,050
Did you see the victim?

446
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,980
No.

447
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,770
If I had, I'd be working
on the case right now

448
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,620
instead of being home.

449
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,380
Timing is everything

450
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,620
with these cases.

451
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,490
Any delay,

452
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,420
and it gets much harder to win.

453
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,250
Are cases like that

454
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,420
hard to win?

455
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,180
Sibei, think about it.

456
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,420
What are the two key elements
for a rape conviction?

457
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,810
First,

458
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,900
we have to prove
the objective fact occurred, right?

459
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,620
Meaning, we must prove

460
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,490
that Person A

461
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,660
had sexual intercourse

462
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,250
with Person B.

463
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,180
We can prove that

464
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,420
with biological evidence.

465
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,730
That's the easy part.

466
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,140
The hard part is the second element.

467
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,220
How do we prove

468
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,420
it was forced?

469
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,900
So, let's say

470
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,420
the victim has bruises,

471
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,700
and the defense will say

472
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,730
it could have been

473
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,730
a kink.

474
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,460
There's a video?

475
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,180
They'll claim it was a setup.

476
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,900
Right?

477
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,180
So we need a very strong
chain of evidence

478
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,620
to prove coercion.

479
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,570
And during this process,

480
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,180
those jerks

481
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,140
will throw all kinds

482
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,980
of disgusting accusations
to protect themselves,

483
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,940
like

484
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,620
that she led him on,

485
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,810
that they were actually
in a relationship.

486
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,570
That kind of smear can destroy

487
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,420
a victim's reputation.

488
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,330
Many victims

489
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,420
break down before it even

490
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,260
gets to trial.

491
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,010
That's why I say,

492
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,330
in cases like these,

493
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,700
whether you report it or not,

494
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,980
it's painful

495
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,570
either way.

496
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:13,050
Perhaps it's better to just
pretend nothing ever happened,

497
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,330
and just forget about it.

498
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,570
Can we eat now,

499
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,410
Attorney Ye?

500
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,180
I'll get the rice.

501
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,180
Doesn't it taste a little salty?

502
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,020
A little.

503
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,700
Qin.

504
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,333
Captain Zhang.

505
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,620
You got the car all cleaned up?

506
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,420
Yes.

507
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,090
Thank you.

508
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,180
I patched up the tire

509
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
and gave it a full wash.

510
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,620
How much? I'll transfer it to you.

511
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,460
Just 70 is fine.

512
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,180
Where'd you take this car?
It was covered in mud.

513
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,050
Out to the outskirts.

514
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,380
Must've used a lot of your water.

515
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,900
Alright, I'm sending it over now.

516
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,740
Okay.

517
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,730
By the way,

518
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,460
your tire's pretty worn down.

519
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,355
If it gets another cut,

520
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,380
you might as well replace it
instead of patching it again.

521
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,220
Really?

522
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,250
Alright, maybe next time.

523
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,570
How much is a new one?

524
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,490
For your size, a 215/60 R17,

525
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,660
you've got a lot of options.

526
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,844
Come take a look over here.

527
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,660
Your original tires were Continentals.

528
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,090
We've got those,

529
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,660
but we also carry others
in the same category.

530
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:52,620
Like this one here,

531
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,660
Michelin,

532
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,420
or these,

533
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,140
Pirelli, and GT Radial.

534
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,220
Prices vary depending on

535
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,940
what you want.

536
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,860
You really know your tires.

537
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,222
You're teasing me, Captain Zhang.

538
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:06,250
It's my job.

539
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:09,980
Take a look at something for me.

540
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,980
Check out this tire tread.

541
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,980
Can you tell

542
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,420
what kind of tire

543
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,220
or vehicle

544
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
they came from?

545
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,540
Let me see.

546
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,660
This isn't for an official case.

547
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,570
It's off the record.

548
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,490
Just a personal favor.

549
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,090
- Keep it between us.
- I got it.

550
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,660
From what I can tell,

551
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,180
three of these tires

552
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,620
were replaced,

553
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:49,620
and only one
is an original factory tire.

554
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:52,955
This specific tire isn't very common.

555
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:54,330
Currently, there are only two models

556
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,860
on the market that fit this pattern.

557
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,810
One is the new third-generation

558
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,900
Ford Taurus,

559
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,570
and the other is

560
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,380
the Toyota Crown sedan
that stopped production

561
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,420
back in 2013.

562
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,330
Judging from the wear
on this original tire,

563
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,860
it's pretty worn down.

564
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,420
It's likely the older model.

565
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,930
An older model...

566
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,330
A Crown?

567
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,380
That car was worth over
800,000 back in its day.

568
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,460
In Nancheng,

569
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,711
that's considered a luxury car.

570
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,090
You're good. You really know your stuff.

571
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,050
You flatter me.

572
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,980
Alright, I'm going now.

573
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,460
Goodbye.

574
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,660
Okay, my car keys...

575
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,500
They are here.

576
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:34,900
Here you go.

577
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,570
Alright.

578
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:35,980
Thanks.

579
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,460
Drive safe.

580
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,300
Okay, bye.

581
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,460
Sibei.

582
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,380
Sibei, when you have time,

583
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,149
you should really talk
things out with Qin Nan.

584
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,730
The longer a couple
lets a conflict fester,

585
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,066
the harder it is to fix.

586
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,770
Go home and get some rest.

587
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,730
You should get some rest too.

588
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,490
You're not drinking!

589
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,010
Drink with me!

590
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,250
More!

591
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,250
Give her a break.

592
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,050
Are you okay?

593
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,860
Liu! Liu!

594
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,290
(Recently, a missing person case
was reported)

595
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,420
(on Shanghe Xinchun Street in our city.)

596
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,700
(Nancheng News)
(The victim is a young female.)

597
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,730
(It was 1 AM, you know?)

598
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,220
(Why was she wandering on the street?)

599
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,180
(She had no sense of danger.)

600
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,290
(Don't you think she's trying)

601
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,420
to seduce someone out there?

602
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,980
You should go home early.

603
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,220
It hasn't been safe out lately.

604
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,050
(Keep walking.)

605
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,570
(Count to 1,000.)

606
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,220
(If you turn around, I'll kill you.)

607
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,580
(Personal Loan -
Current Payment Due: 2,400 yuan)

608
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,220
See that gum stain on the floor?

609
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,220
Scrape it off.

610
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,460
Put a little muscle into it.

611
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,770
If it still doesn't come off,

612
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,220
use this spray.

613
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,250
Once it's damp, it'll come up easier.

614
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:24,222
You've got to get it off.

615
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:25,770
Those black spots look terrible.

616
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,050
I promise I won't make things
difficult for you.

617
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,250
I won't hold anyone back.

618
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,460
I won't

619
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,770
let everyone's hard work go to waste.

620
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,820
Just please,

621
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,860
make sure you get me

622
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,940
and Chuchu home safely.

623
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,620
Don't worry.

624
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,460
I'll get both of you home
safe and sound.

625
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,490
As for the floors,

626
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,730
mop them inside and out.
First with a wet mop,

627
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,940
then follow with a dry one.

628
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,200
If the floor's slick,
anyone wearing dress shoes

629
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,980
could slip and fall.

630
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,370
Sibei.

631
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,700
You may carry on.

632
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,540
Where's your uniform?

633
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,540
You...

634
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,980
Why aren't you wearing it?

635
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,770
You haven't just started working here.

636
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,220
Company policy requires
you to wear the uniform,

637
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,060
Sibei.

638
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,260
I forgot.

639
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,980
Don't forget tomorrow.

640
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,220
Mr. Fan.

641
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,900
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

642
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,700
What?

643
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,860
The night before last,

644
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,220
was it you who drove me home?

645
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,660
Yes, I took you and Chuchu home.

646
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,980
I dropped Chuchu off first.

647
00:29:54,288 --> 00:29:55,866
You girls were really drunk,

648
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:57,620
but her place was on the way.

649
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,020
Why do you ask?

650
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,900
Did you

651
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
see me all the way to my door?

652
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,530
You were really drunk, huh?

653
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,530
Must've blacked out.

654
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,700
My wife called me

655
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,860
while I was driving you.

656
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,980
We got into a huge argument
over the phone.

657
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,420
You overheard and told me

658
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,460
to just let you out by the roadside.

659
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,530
So I dropped you off
before reaching your complex.

660
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,620
What's wrong?

661
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,620
Is your husband upset with you?

662
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,050
I should get to work.

663
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,220
Just look at it.

664
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:05,980
What are you...

665
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,290
You startled me!

666
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:08,900
What's wrong?

667
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,740
Sibei.

668
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,490
You look so pale.

669
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,770
Did you not rest well?

670
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,060
I'm fine.

671
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,050
Get some rest.

672
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,620
I got a client waiting.

673
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,460
Talk later.

674
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,300
I'm running late.

675
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,820
Chuchu.

676
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,700
That night,

677
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,420
did we go home together?

678
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,940
Yes. As soon as we got to my place,
I got out first.

679
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,622
Mr. Fan was the one who took you home.

680
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,780
Sibei.

681
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,460
Call me when you get home.

682
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,420
Let me know you're okay.

683
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,420
I'm going home now. Bye-bye.

684
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,180
Why? You blacked out?

685
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,180
My memory

686
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,250
is a little hazy.

687
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,420
Nothing happened, right?

688
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,010
Okay, I have to go.

689
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,980
A client is waiting.

690
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,380
Did you see his face?

691
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,660
Did he hit you?

692
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,770
You can't tell anyone about this,

693
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,810
especially not Qin Nan.

694
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,940
No man can
look past something like this.

695
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,420
Don't expect him to understand.
He won't.

696
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,010
In cases like these,

697
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,380
whether you report it or not,

698
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,250
it's painful

699
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,250
either way.

700
00:33:10,377 --> 00:33:12,777
Perhaps it's better to just
pretend nothing ever happened.

701
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:13,940
Just forget about it.

702
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,220
Ma'am,

703
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,090
may I help you?

704
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,900
Is this Qin Nan's shop?

705
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,888
I'm his mother-in-law.

706
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,130
Ma'am.

707
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,220
Nice to meet you.

708
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,090
I'm Jun.

709
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,570
Nan's friend.

710
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,380
I got to Nan's wedding late.

711
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,555
So I didn't get to meet you.

712
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:00,420
He's upstairs. I'll call him.

713
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
So he's here.

714
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,180
Nan! Nan!

715
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,222
Your mother-in-law is here.

716
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,650
Mom?

717
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,610
Come on.

718
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,380
Give me a hand.

719
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,511
- Mom.
- I see you're busy.

720
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,400
What brings you here?

721
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:15,620
I just want to see you.

722
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,930
Mom.

723
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,450
Have a seat.

724
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,050
I'll get you some water.

725
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,370
It's fine.

726
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:33,900
Mom,

727
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,740
have some water.

728
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,570
Someone lives here too?

729
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,090
I sometimes rest here

730
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,420
when work gets busy.

731
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,050
Business must be good then.

732
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,460
It's been alright.

733
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,460
Still, it's better to stay at home
when you can.

734
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,210
You don't eat or sleep well here.

735
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,130
Look at you, you've lost weight.

736
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,090
Anyway,

737
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,980
you two have been married
for quite a while now.

738
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,740
I've been

739
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,300
meaning to stop by

740
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
but never got around to it.

741
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,090
Since I happened to be in the area,
I thought I'd drop by.

742
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,610
I made some braised meat

743
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,900
for you and Sibei.

744
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,820
Go home

745
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,266
and heat it up for dinner tonight.

746
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,260
Mom,

747
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,460
is there something

748
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,780
you wanted to talk to me about?

749
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,330
No.

750
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,050
Really, there isn't.

751
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,940
Was there something

752
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,900
you wanted to tell me?

753
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,420
Nothing from me either.

754
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,050
You didn't come over
for dinner last week.

755
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,050
Try to make it this week, okay?

756
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,460
Make some time.

757
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,850
Well,

758
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:35,266
if there's nothing else,
I should be going.

759
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,650
Mom, just stay a little longer?

760
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,380
It's fine.

761
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,000
I've got tons of things to do back home.

762
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,090
Remember to heat the food
all the way through.

763
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,930
- No need to walk me out.
- No, I insist.

764
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:42,866
I'm going now. It's fine.

765
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,010
I'm going.

766
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,460
How are you getting back?
Let me call a cab for you.

767
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,090
It's broad daylight
and there are plenty of buses.

768
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,260
Why waste the money?

769
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,580
Qin Nan.

770
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,420
Nianwen's getting married soon,

771
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,490
and I won't have much
left to worry about.

772
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Don't you think it's time
for you and Sibei

773
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,610
to have a baby?

774
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,610
While I'm still young,
I can help take care of it.

775
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,490
You should think about it.

776
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,330
Alright, I'll be off.

777
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,980
(Reminder in 5 minutes)

778
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,210
It's time.

779
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,410
Sibei,

780
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,900
I've got the invoices and data

781
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,420
all ready for you.

782
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,610
Get this done today.

783
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,820
I have plans today.

784
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,010
I have to leave early.

785
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,090
You don't even have kids.

786
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,780
What do you need to
go home so early for?

787
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,530
Young people

788
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,210
should be putting in more overtime.

789
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,650
I'm saying this for your good.

790
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,610
I need to get home

791
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,610
before dark.

792
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,090
Then finish it before dark.

793
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,100
(Xuehua Car Service)

794
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,220
(Station 2)

795
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,090
Nan, you've been eating
and sleeping at the shop lately.

796
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,090
You and your wife fighting or something?

797
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,530
No.

798
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,210
Come on, I can tell.

799
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,740
Since the day you got married,

800
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,430
have you ever stayed
overnight here before?

801
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,460
You've been sleeping here for days now.

802
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:30,530
What happened between you two?

803
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,940
You've never been married.

804
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,210
You wouldn't get it.

805
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,490
I wish I could get married.

806
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,460
Who'd want me though?

807
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,780
After I got out of jail,

808
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,130
forget dating

809
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,090
or finding a wife,

810
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,980
I couldn't even find a job.

811
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:48,066
You were the only one who didn't
look down on me and hired me.

812
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,210
You told me

813
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:51,800
that as long as a person works hard,

814
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,130
they can always start over,

815
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,900
and something about

816
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,650
a hurdle?

817
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,210
So what's this hurdle you and your wife

818
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,610
are stuck on now?

819
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,490
Tell me.

820
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:11,000
It's not something
I can explain in a short time.

821
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,490
If a short time isn't enough,

822
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,420
spend a longer time then.

823
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,980
You read all those books.

824
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,488
Surely you can help me understand.

825
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,460
I've never seen a mechanic

826
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,740
as studious as you.

827
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,900
Wait, I get it.

828
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,090
It's because your wife
is a college grad, right?

829
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,800
You're scared she'll look down on you,
so you keep studying...

830
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,210
Did she really look down on you

831
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,090
for that?

832
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,980
Get lost!

833
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,940
Go fix the darn car!

834
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,780
I remember now.

835
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,260
That thing you said to me back then...

836
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,260
It was "There's no hardship
you can't overcome,"

837
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,010
right?

838
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,820
Well, now I'm saying it,

839
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,260
to you and to her.

840
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:08,733
Something you should remember.

841
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,220
(Do most women who are raped
really choose not to report it?)

842
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,260
(According to empirical research
in criminology, yes.)

843
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:16,260
(What if the police act unprofessionally
and smirk instead of showing sympathy?)

844
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,260
(Married woman raped by an acquaintance,
continues to be harassed by him.)

845
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,511
(How should survivors of sexual assault
face life after what's happened?)

846
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,300
(Spring of the Canola Blossoms)

847
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,660
Hello.

848
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,130
Hello, Nan.

849
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:01,900
Can you come

850
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,300
to Guantian Police Station now?

851
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,820
It's Sibei.

852
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,220
I'll be right there.
