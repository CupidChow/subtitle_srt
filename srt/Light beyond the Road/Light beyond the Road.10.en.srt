Yeah, it is.

let that end with me.

isn't that high anyway.

76

Can you try a little harder?

86
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,622
Even Sibei has more strength than you.

87
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,290
If Sibei had stayed with my mom,

88
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,290
I wouldn't have lost my job.

89
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,250
Now, a respectable teacher like me

90

91

If someone really reports you,

92
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,000
what does that have to do with me?

93
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:26,311
You were the one
who insisted Sibei should come back.

94
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,980
You've ruined my whole life.

96
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,610
look, I got first place
in the whole school.

What about you?

100
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,610
How did you do this time?

101
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,250
Judging by that look,

102
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,888
don't tell me you came in last again.

Don't you have anything better to do?

go wash that tub of clothes.

107

But I have a lot of homework today.

108
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,170
A lot? You still have time to argue?

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,930
Go do your homework right now.

110
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,780

with your brother.

Please, I'm begging you.

123
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,100
My grades are way better
than my brother's.

124
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,140
You even paid
a placement fee for his high school.

125

you wicked woman!

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,690
Qin Nan.

192
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,911
I just grabbed something.

193
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,111
Here, change into it first.

194
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,090
Thanks.

195
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,300
Sibei, listen to me.

196
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,250
That audio...

197
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,090
I didn't...

198
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,580
I didn't seduce him.

199
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,420
Yes, I know.

200
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,300
I know you didn't.

201
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,770
I didn't.

202
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,266
They wouldn't dare post it online.

203
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,770
If it spreads online, it's a crime...

204
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:32,688
Sibei.

205
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,460
I want to go home.

206
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,933
Sibei, where are you going? Sibei!

207
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:35,820
Sibei, calm down.

208
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,070
- Listen. Calm down.
- I want to go home.

209
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,700
Sibei!

210
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,460
- Calm down!
- Don't run off!

211
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,610
- We're here with you!
- Running won't help!

212
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,890
- Calm down a bit!
- Sibei, listen to me!

213
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,730
You need to calm down now.

214
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,780
Don't be afraid.

215
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,650
Mom.

216
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,490
Mom!

217
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,980
What are you doing?

218
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,533
Was it you who called the police?

219
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,980
Was it you who said
you could handle this?

220
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,100
Our whole family came here with you.

221
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,700
And now you want to go back?

222
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,340
I'm telling you,

223
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,420
no one's going back!

224
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:13,911
Do you know
how much courage it took for us?

225
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:17,066
Do you know
how much we've suffered for you?

226
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,490
Do you know how many times

227
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,755
people have pointed fingers
at us because of you?

228
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,820
You want to save face?

229
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,180
So we don't deserve ours?

230
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,530
Ye Sibei, listen to me.

231
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,250
This is the path you chose.

232
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:37,955
Even if you have to crawl,

233
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,610
you'll finish what you started.

234
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,730
Do you understand?

235
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,660
Sibei.

236
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,010
The news is already out there.

237
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,010
If we walk away now,

238
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,060
we'll never clear our names.

239
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,180
Sibei, look at me.

240
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,180
Sibei.

241
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,420
We've come this far.

242
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,100
Think about everything
you've been through.

243
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,940
Sibei.

244
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
You did nothing wrong.

245
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,610
He's the one who's guilty.

246
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,180
Let the guilty face punishment.

247
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,460
Make him say he's sorry to you.

248
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,700
Make him apologize.

249
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,420
That's what justice should look like.

250
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,610
No audio, video, or photo

251
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,530
can ever hide the truth.

252
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,650
Sibei, you did nothing wrong.

253
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,180
Ye Sibei.

254
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,220
There's something we need to tell you.

255
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,180
Please come with me.

256
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,450
Hello.

257
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,010
I'm her legal representative.

258
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,850
I'll go with her.

259
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
Alright.

260
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,780
(People's Court)

261
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,650
Ms. Ye,

262
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,980
the prosecution has requested
to postpone the hearing.

263
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,850
Why?

264
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,940
Because the defendant's lawyer

265
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,010
submitted new evidence

266
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,980
that the prosecution didn't have before,

267
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,290
it needs to be verified.

268
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,380
We'll inform you
of the new hearing date later.

269
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,220
Alright, thank you.

270
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,660
Sibei, don't worry yet.

271
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,900
It's part of the normal process.

272
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,100
(Convenience Waiting Area)

273
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,090
Postponed hearing.

274
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,530
The defense submitted new evidence.

275
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,380
Then let Sibei

276
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,220
go home and rest.

277
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Sibei.

278
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,340
(May All Things Go Well)

279
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,570
Dad.

280
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,850
Mom.

281
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,900
Actually,

282
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,330
I've handled

283
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,330
similar cases before.

284
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,250
Those audio recordings

285
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,050
can often be edited

286
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,810
or technically altered.

287
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,250
The court won't just

288
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,570
take their word for it.

289
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,620
They'll conduct
forensic verification next.

290
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,570
Even if we take a step back,

291
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,180
and say the recording is real,

292
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,380
it still proves nothing.

293
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,660
In that situation,

294
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,530
the victim might have complied

295
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,460
to protect her own life.

296
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,250
The trial hasn't even begun yet.

297
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,770
We can't lose our composure first.

298
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,130
Mom.

299
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,650
Dad.

300
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,420
Our son's right.

301
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,570
Take a shower first.

302
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:31,890
I'll run the water for you.

303
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,770
How did you feel
when you heard the recording?

304
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,060
Disgusted?

305
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,860
I didn't feel much.

306
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,660
I didn't think anything of it.

307
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,140
Would you really believe me?

308
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,420
Would you truly
not mind something like that?

309
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,660
Would you still love me?

310
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,020
Sibei.

311
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,620
Sex sometimes represents humiliation,

312
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,460
but more often,

313
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,770
it represents love.

314
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,490
Ye Sibei,

315
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,940
I love you.

316
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,250
♪Listen to that echo♪

317
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,050
♪Stripping away tears and truth♪

318
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,360
♪A lifetime♪

319
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,880
♪Still can't escape fate♪

320
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:48,120
♪Yet I use all my strength
to hold myself close♪

321
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,050
I was terrified then.

322
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,570
I couldn't see.

323
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,700
My mind was in chaos.

324
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,220
I just kept thinking,

325
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,010
I must survive.

326
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,980
So whatever he told me to do,

327
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,420
I had to do it.

328
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,770
Qin Nan.

329
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,290
If I hadn't called the police at first,

330
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
and just taken the money,

331
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,620
would things be better?

332
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,250
If you hadn't called the police,

333
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,010
they wouldn't have talked about money.

334
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,420
And if I hadn't?

335
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,220
My dad used to be a very timid man.

336
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,290
One year, my parents came back

337
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,530
from working out of town.

338
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,810
When they heard my brother
and me had been bullied,

339
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,420
they went to confront that family.

340
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,020
He.

341
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,020
He.

342
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,377
Come on,
hold the umbrella for your brother.

343
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,810
Is He home?

344
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,810
Oh, it's you.

345
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,700
Qin Fu?

346
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,620
What are you here for?

347
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,050
There's something

348
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,180
I need to talk to you about.

349
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,570
Today, my boys, Qin Bei and Qin Nan,

350
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,822
were playing under that tree.

351
00:25:17,888 --> 00:25:19,050
Your son, He Jie, came over,

352
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,700
and without a word,
started hitting them,

353
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,530
- claiming the tree was yours.
- Wait.

354
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,090
You little brat!

355
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:25,930
- Coming!
- Get over here!

356
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,890
What is it, Dad?

357
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,250
Did you hit Qin Bei?

358
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,700
No, I didn't.

359
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,420
Did you hear him?

360
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,090
You've been working away
all these years.

361
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,530
Have you ever taken care of your kid?

362
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,730
Now he's learned to lie.
Take him home and beat him.

363
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,460
I didn't lie. He's the one who hit me!

364
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,610
He,

365
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,940
Qin Bei isn't the kind
of child who lies.

366
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,288
Look at the bruise on his face.

367
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,770
He Jie isn't telling the truth.

368
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,220
My son said he didn't hit him,

369
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,060
so he didn't.

370
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,900
That tree over there

371
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,050
is ours.

372
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,420
From now on,

373
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,911
(He Family Tree. Keep Away.)
if your son plays here,

374
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:57,711
I'll beat him up.

375
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,620
You're being unreasonable.

376
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,770
Why can your son play here,

377
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,140
but mine can't?

378
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,010
Don't push your luck.

379
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,850
Get him!

380
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,900
(Dad!)

381
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,860
All these years,

382
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,050
that memory has never left my mind.

383
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,090
Every time I close my eyes,

384
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
I still feel

385
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,460
like that same helpless child.

386
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,330
Powerless.

387
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,620
Hearing my father say,

388
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,940
"Son,

389
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,500
close your eyes.

390
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,900
Don't look."

391
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,730
So, Sibei,

392
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,460
calling the police
cuts through the chaos.

393
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
If you don't report it,

394
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,050
you'll keep losing pieces of your life.

395
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,488
You must call the police.

396
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,660
You have to win.

397
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,140
Otherwise, you'll end up like me.

398
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,090
Trapped forever in that moment of shame.

399
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,940
We'll win.

400
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,460
We definitely will.

401
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,530
- You're back.
- You're back.

402
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,370
Lawyer Meng.

403
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,330
Mr. Zhao.

404
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,050
What are you doing?

405
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,140
You've been inside for days.

406
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,420
Let's get rid of the bad luck.

407
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,570
Alright.

408
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,490
I was worried
this case might mess you up.

409
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Brush it off.

410
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,010
How's Wenwen? Is she doing okay?

411
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,220
She's fine, at school.

412
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
Good.

413
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,820
Lawyer Meng.

414
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,090
Thank you.

415
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:40,930
No need to be polite.

416
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,810
- Please, have a seat.
- Sit.

417
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,140
I actually wanted

418
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,530
to discuss a few things with you.

419
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,820
Go ahead.

420
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,010
Although we've requested a postponement,

421
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:52,460
and our submitted evidence

422
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,010
is still under forensic review,

423
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,810
I still believe

424
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,090
that, for this case,

425
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,810
we should perhaps consider

426
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,180
working on other fronts as well.

427
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,900
What do you mean?

428
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,250
Although this trial won't be public,

429
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,860
it has already drawn major attention.

430
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,250
I believe the media

431
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,810
won't let go of this story.

432
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,700
So even if we win in court,

433
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,010
the final outcome
might still hurt both sides.

434
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,650
In any case,

435
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,420
no matter what happens,

436
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,420
we must minimize the damage.

437
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,660
Actually,

438
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,940
there's still a key witness

439
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,380
in this case.

440
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,850
Chuchu.

441
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,250
Hello, Ms. Liu.

442
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,244
I've arrived already.

443
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,380
What would you like to drink?

444
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,900
- I'll order it first.
- Ms. Liu,

445
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,260
I really enjoyed our chat today.

446
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:53,980
I'll definitely
treat you to a meal soon.

447
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,250
You must come, alright?

448
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,180
You're too kind.

449
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,850
Ms. Liu.

450
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,020
Ms. Wei.

451
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,860
Ms. Liu, I was just messaging you.

452
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,700
You arrived first.

453
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,010
Chuchu, what a coincidence.

454
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,244
You're meeting a client here too?

455
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,140
A coincidence?

456
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,490
Chuchu, I'm sorry,

457
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,140
but the flat I wanted to buy

458
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,900
has already been signed
by Miss Sun for me.

459
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,050
Ms. Liu,

460
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,420
didn't we agree earlier
that you'd go through me?

461
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,180
I even brought the contract today.

462
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,380
Alright, sorry, I've got something on.
I'll go first.

463
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
- Alright.
- Ms. Liu.

464
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,266
- Ms. Liu.
- Chuchu, don't do this.

465
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,770
Take care, Ms. Liu.

466
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,780
Ms. Wei,

467
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,180
flat 708 in Xincheng Community
is my listing.

468
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,420
Ms. Liu is my client.

469
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,570
You're stealing my deal outright.

470
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,180
Don't make it sound so harsh.

471
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:49,488
The manager told me
to handle the signing.

472
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,555
If you've got a problem,
take it up with the manager.

473
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,800
What's that supposed to mean?

474
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:54,220
Sun Wei, say it clearly.

475
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,220
I've no time to argue with you.

476
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,044
I've got other clients to show flats to.

477
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:00,860
Do you think I'm that easy
to push around?

478
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:02,700
If you don't explain yourself today,

479
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,010
you're not leaving this room.

480
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,940
The clients all know what you did.

481
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:09,090
If the manager
hadn't told me to take this deal,

482
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:10,866
it would've fallen through already.

483
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,333
You'd be facing a complaint too.

484
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
What did I do?

485
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,460
You stole my client
and still think you're in the right?

486
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,844
If you don't hand this deal
back to me today,

487
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:19,911
I won't let it go.

488
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,660
Chuchu.

489
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,500
What's wrong?

490
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:25,644
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you really not go online?

491
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,810
You left
your drunk sister-in-law in the car.

492
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,900
How irresponsible.

493
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,290
Who would trust you
with a deal after that?

494
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,340
(Convenience Supermarket)

495
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,900
Dad, I'm back.

496
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,420
You're back.

497
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,422
I'll start cooking now.

498
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,300
I'm not eating.

499
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,940
(Chuchu is the accomplice of the rapist
in the Nancheng assault case.)

500
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,155
(You're a sinner. You deserve to die.)

501
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,020
(She left her drunk sister-in-law
in the car!)

502
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,977
(You really can't trust anyone
these days, outrageous.)

503
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,380
Just cut it off here.

504
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Yes, just cut along that line.

505
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,090
Along the edge.

506
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,980
Change it.

507
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,111
Alright, turn on the light.

508
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,740
After the trial's over,

509
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:37,177
shall we quit smoking
and drinking together?

510
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,650
Work out and jog?

511
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,860
And then?

512
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,650
Live a bit longer.

513
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,010
Live longer for what?

514
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,170
To see this world.

515
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,820
To see what it becomes

516
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,380
after all our effort.

517
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,740
Please let us in.

518
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,570
Step back.

519
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,210
Make some space.

520
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,740
Please don't obstruct our work.

521
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,090
Please cooperate with us.

522
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,130
Don't gather here.

523
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,490
We came all this way.
Can't you make an exception?

524
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,330
Comrades,

525
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,880
this place is off-limits.

526
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,888
No photography allowed.

527
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,940
Officer,

528
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,940
today's the hearing
for Ye Sibei's case, right?

529
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,170
I work in legal education.

530
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,740
Please, let us observe.

531
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,010
That's right.

532
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,610
Everyone,

533
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,210
this case is not open to the public.

534
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,130
No spectators allowed.

535
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,650
Please disperse.

536
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,490
Thank you.

537
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,690
Please cooperate with us.

538
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,650
- Thank you.
- Please move aside.

539
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,860
Thank you for your cooperation.

540
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,900
Alright, thank you all.

541
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,690
Let's go.

542
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,900
What a wasted trip.

543
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,820
Exactly.

544
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,740
Let's go.

545
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,860
After the trial,

546
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,650
I'll invite your family for a meal.

547
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,940
Take it as my apology.

548
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,300
Maybe I'll be the one inviting you

549
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,940
to apologize to you instead.

550
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,530
Sibei,

551
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,370
don't be afraid.

552
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,780
It's time for us to go in.

553
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,620
Let's go.

554
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,370
Nan,

555
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,930
Mom, and Dad,

556
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,090
as family members,

557
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,900
please wait here in the reception area.

558
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,533
Sibei, Chuchu,

559
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:58,530
you'll wait outside the courtroom
to be called.

560
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,420
Come in with me first.

561
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,010
