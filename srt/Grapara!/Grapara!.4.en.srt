1
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,660
(cherry blossoms)

2
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,660
I will try my best at gravure!

3
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,660
Don't give up

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,330
(Dokujima) Our Sakura Katsuragi

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,099
I wish I had more followers

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,099
I'll release the AV

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,132
I don't like it anymore...

8
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:18,759
(Mio) In this industry

9
00:00:16,132 --> 00:00:18,759
There is a clear pros and cons

10
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:20,429
I just saw Sakura-chan

11
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,693
There's something fishy about that guy with glasses.

12
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,693
I got in the car and went somewhere

13
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:25,891
(mio)

14
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:25,891
Sakura-chan will let you go

15
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:25,891
If you're going to do something wasteful

16
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,858
I want you to be my manager

17
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:30,693
(Shinobu) I'll definitely reply tomorrow.

18
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:34,231
Congratulations on your AV debut

19
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:34,231
Huh?

20
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:39,264
you are

21
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:39,264
I was fooled by Shinobu-kun, everything.

22
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:44,759
Okay, then let's take a photo.

23
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:44,759
Thin

24
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,099
(Dokujima) Okay, okay, okay.

25
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:50,891
I'm wearing this

26
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,891
facing away from me

27
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,099
Ah, it's me, the actor.

28
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:58,132
Huh?

29
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:58,132
what? Do you want a professional?

30
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,924
How curious are you?

31
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,924
No, that's not right...

32
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,330
(Busujima) You, even just a little bit.

33
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,330
so that you can relax

34
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,330
Well, I have no choice

35
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,330
I thought I'd give it a try

36
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,693
Well, I see. Isn't it better to be a professional?

37
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,693
Well, it takes a budget though

38
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,660
Okay, then call a professional right away.

39
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,660
(Kitayama) Higashi-san

40
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,066
(Busujima) Azuma-san, from the beginning

41
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,066
It's a little too intense

42
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,297
(Kitayama) Well then, Mr. Almond.

43
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:18,297
(Busujima) I think it's Almond.

44
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:23,066
Sorry...um...

45
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:23,066
what?

46
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,858
sorry…

47
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:36,066
Do you like me?

48
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:45,132
yes…

49
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:49,099
OK, I understand, then come here.

50
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:55,033
(Dokujima)

51
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:55,033
copper? Show me this one more time

52
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:55,033
copper? Are you okay?

53
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,231
it's okay

54
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,231
(Busujima) Okay, okay, let's sit down then.

55
00:01:57,231 --> 00:02:00,429
Yes, okay, sit down.

56
00:01:57,231 --> 00:02:00,429
Yes, sit, sit, yes

57
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,495
Well then, can I get your bag? Yes.

58
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:06,066
Okay, okay

59
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,165
No no, just look at me

60
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:12,495
Forcibly

61
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:12,495
It looks like you're doing it, huh?

62
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,165
Yay... Okay.

63
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,825
(Kitayama) Eh, first talk.

64
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,825
Aren't you going to take pictures?

65
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:19,231
It's okay, I'll go in later.

66
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:23,462
Ah hmmm hmmm

67
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,693
Ah, I can't do it anymore

68
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:35,297
♬〜

69
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,594
welcome

70
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,858
Thank you for waiting

71
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:55,660
I'm not particularly excited.

72
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,891
You're going to mess it up, right?

73
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:13,759
♬〜

74
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,594
Sakura-chan!

75
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:19,924
Mr. Shinobu...

76
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:19,924
It's a lie. It's now. I'm crying.

77
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,330
The promises are different!

78
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,528
Ah, Shinobu-san's plan.

79
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,528
Was it after I got more followers?

80
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:30,594
No, hey!

81
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:30,594
(Kitayama) Could you please go home?

82
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:34,462
as promised

83
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:34,462
I'll pay the money properly

84
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,198
Money... money...

85
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:40,099
You're good at acting~

86
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:40,099
I really should go home now.

87
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,759
(Kicking sound)

88
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,396
It's about us and Sakura.

89
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,396
It doesn't matter, right?

90
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:52,627
it doesn't matter…

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,594
I'll pay the money

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,594
...No way!

93
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:00,165
Sakura-chan, let's go home!

94
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:00,165
Hey, hey!

95
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:01,825
Shinobu-san!

96
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:01,825
(Kitayama) Oh!

97
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,825
Have you been fooled again?

98
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:09,825
When you have 500,000 followers

99
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:09,825
We promise not to talk about AV!

100
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:14,627
This guy is mouth-watering~

101
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:14,627
Don't be fooled

102
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:19,000
Sakura-chan is

103
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:19,000
I want to do gravure

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,132
The cover of the magazine...

105
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:26,000
I dream of Sakura-chan

106
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:26,000
I want to support you!

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,957
(Kitayama) Oh!

108
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:33,066
Ah, I understand!

109
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:33,066
Get more followers from this guy

110
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:36,231
you for more money

111
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:36,231
I'm planning on selling it somewhere.

112
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,660
This guy is crazy

113
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:45,264
I… I believe in Shinobu-san!

114
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:49,330
Ah Daru

115
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,627
You're in the way, get out of the way!

116
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:55,561
Sakura-chan!

117
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:55,561
(Busujima) Hey, hey, hey!

118
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,759
Don't disturb me

119
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,033
What is the dream?

120
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:05,099
Whether Sakura wants it or not

121
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,363
What this guy does

122
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,363
The office decided

123
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:10,957
I don't decide

124
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,693
Submit to AV

125
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:19,462
Hey

126
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:19,462
You must be getting carried away too.

127
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't be a piece of trash like this

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,066
There is no right of veto.

129
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,891
Hey!

130
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,363
Did you understand?

131
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:36,957
The words you just said are the worst

132
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,396
Fufufufu…

133
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:46,198
So that I can never talk back to you again

134
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:46,198
I'll do it for you, boy.

135
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:48,561
Fufufufu…

136
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,066
(sound of opening gas valve)

137
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,066
(Kitayama) Come here!

138
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,462
(Busujima) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

139
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,462
Stop it!

140
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:58,891
Oh! Ugh… it stinks!

141
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:58,891
What? this smell

142
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,528
Please stay away from Shinobu-san!

143
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,528
I'll light the fire!

144
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,330
Hey, what are you doing?

145
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,330
Please stay away!

146
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,396
Hey, it's dangerous!

147
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,396
You're in danger too.

148
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:10,660
It's enough, no matter what happens

149
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
I would rather be forced to do it!

150
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,891
(Busujima) I understand, because I understand.

151
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,891
Give me a lighter.

152
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,759
Let's pretend the story about AV never happened

153
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,759
That's good, right?

154
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,660
Oh?

155
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,660
It's fine without it!

156
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,396
I'm quitting my office!

157
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:30,231
I... I understand.

158
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:30,231
Give me the lighter! Close the main valve!

159
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,363
I took a video

160
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,363
(Busujima) Huh?

161
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,462
Including all the horrible things I said earlier.

162
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:37,000
(Busujima) Wait a minute, hey.

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,033
You're terrible

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,033
You're a flycatcher

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,561
Let's go Sakura-chan

166
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,627
Wait a second, hey!

167
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,627
I'll share the video when it arrives!

168
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:54,363
Hey, oh!

169
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:54,363
Ah! Shit! Gah!

170
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,462
Ah, the main valve, the main valve!

171
00:06:56,462 --> 00:07:01,561
Shit!

172
00:06:56,462 --> 00:07:01,561
It's a hit! Shit!

173
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:23,792
thank you

174
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:23,792
for helping me

175
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:33,726
I'm sorry for keeping silent about the promise I made with that person.

176
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:42,165
don't worry

177
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:42,165
You did that for me, right?

178
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:46,429
But in the end

179
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:46,429
Let me put you through such a scary experience...

180
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:51,891
No.

181
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:58,264
I'm talking about Shinobu-san.

182
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:01,660
If only I believed everything from the beginning

183
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:08,594
I was stupid

184
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:10,891
sorry…

185
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:16,000
No, that's not true.

186
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:23,297
The one who deceives me is definitely at fault.

187
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:25,528
Sakura-chan is not bad

188
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:30,198
Not even a little bit, absolutely

189
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:35,231
Sakura-chan is not bad

190
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:46,429

Ah, are you feeling hungry?

219
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:29,627
Once the tension is relieved,

220

Certainly

221
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,198
I wonder if there's a restaurant somewhere...

222
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:39,132
Ah, but I don't have money so I'll make it...

223

(Yano) No... that's terrible.

365
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:39,528
I want to take a photo like that

366
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:39,528
That thing...

367
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:43,264
Hey! That you live with a girl

What do you mean?

370
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:47,891
No, there are various reasons for that.

371
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,594
There's no need to say that.

372
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,594
Then Chico will live with me too!

373
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:54,023
Huh?

374
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:54,023
No, what are you saying?

That person lives

376
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:56,462
What's the reason I'm no good?

377

00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:01,089
I don't understand

380
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,693

Oh, Sakura-chan too

Huh? Oh no

Oh no, the manager

472
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:04,363

Huh?

481
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:33,363
📱We said that entertainment is luck, right?

482
00:21:33,363 --> 00:21:37,594
Well, the entertainment industry depends on who you meet.

483
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:41,122
Because the results are completely different.

484
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:43,462
Who will you meet...

485
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:46,660
Talent is up to the manager

486
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,726
No matter how star you are

487
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,726
It depends on the manager

488
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:54,693

490
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:59,594
Whether you can make your dreams come true

491
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,990
Depends on the manager

492
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,089

493
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,462

505
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,462
Ah, ah, sorry.
