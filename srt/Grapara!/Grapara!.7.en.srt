7
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,330
You can win if you hold down the key players.

(Ayu)

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,957
Will this guy like me?

10
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:19,957
The reason why Chico-chan appeared

11
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:22,858
Is it because you want Shinobu-san to see more?

12
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:24,627
(Chiko) Why aren't you improving in the rankings?

13
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:26,429
What interests me most this time is

14
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,099
It's this kid

15
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,594
To the person my friends rank first

16
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,594
I'm going to see you

17
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:32,264
He's gone

18
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,198
Do you have something in mind?

19
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:37,561
(Chico) If I win the Grand Prix

20
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:37,561
Will Nobu-nii turn around too?

21
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,231
Of course.

25
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,429

(Ayu)

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,198
After all, he brought another woman with him!

28
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:52,462
No, this is...

29
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:54,132

32
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:01,396
What does it mean to win the Grand Prix?

33
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:01,396
I didn't say that!

34
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,858
Why did that...

35
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,858
(Ayu) I was told that

36
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:07,825
I know your tricks very well.

From a friend!

38
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,165
Ah, Chico-chan, wait.

39
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:14,231
(Ayu) It's not "wait"!

40
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:17,165
I won't forgive you anymore

41
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:20,231
Look, look, look, look

(Ayu) I'll let you do it.

47
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,924
Charge a lot!

48
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,825

I'm sure you'll get hit hard though...

137
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:44,561
Even he knows

138
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:44,561

00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,693
I have not been charged for an attempt.

144
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:58,891

someone is out of luck

192
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:29,858
To Shinobu-san

《I am also in that battle.

《Whatever you want! 》

197
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:42,066
《Because I will never lose! 》

"Today's broadcast is

Take a break...”

203
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,891
“Oh, here!”

(Yano) Shinobu! Shinobi!

207
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:22,792
I was surprised~

208
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:26,000
(Yano) Started streaming

209
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:26,000
Huh? why?

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,165
Ah, first of all, Chico-chan.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,165
I'm full of energy!

212
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,957
Stay healthy and smile a lot

00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,957
So cute!

214

look look look look

216
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,330
“Chico-chan?”

217
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,561
I'm a glutton!

218
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,429
my cooking

00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:47,561
“It’s always delicious, it’s delicious.”

220

They will eat a lot! ”

222
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:58,198
Chico-chan is also good at dancing!

223
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:02,957
``With a lively dance

224
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:02,957
I can always smile.”

225
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:06,462
When you want to feel better

226
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:06,462
Look at Chico-chan's dance!

227
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:09,858
That's amazing! I'd love to!

everyone

229
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:13,264
Look at Chico-chan!

230
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm full of energy

231
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:22,000
I love Chico-chan

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,594
Chico-chan's smiling face

233
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:26,726
"I like it the most."

234
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:31,363
``A cheerful Chico-chan

235
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:31,363
Because it’s the cutest.”

236
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,858
that's why…

237
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:40,429
So... please...

238

Get well

00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:47,099
Get well! Chico-chan!

240
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:57,165
I love it

241
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,891
Sakura-chan...

242
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:14,297
Chico⁉

243
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:14,297
(Yano) Eh, wait...

244
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,924
Sakura-chan

245
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,924
Chico-chan?

246
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:31,000
(sob)

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,660
I'm hungry

248
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,957
Huh?

249
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:41,462
I love Sakura-chan's cooking

250
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:48,165
It's kind and cute, I love it!

251
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:55,000
(cry)

252
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,495
"Chico-chan"

253
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,495
(Chiko) “Ehehe…”

254
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,594
What, are you quitting the contest?

255
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:19,528
But a positive one!

256
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:23,165
A positive person

257
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:23,165
I decided to quit

258
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:27,297
Not my gravure

259
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:27,297
Not that I wanted to do it though

260
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:31,891
But I was able to participate in Miss Frank.

261
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:31,891
I think it was good

262
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:38,759
Comments etc.

263
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:38,759
Although I was hurt a lot

264
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,891
Someone who supports me

265
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,891
There are so many

266
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,023
about those people

267
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:50,429
It's so important

268
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:50,429
Because I noticed!

269
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,957
From...Chico as a techie

270
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,957
to try harder

271
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:57,198
miss frank is

272
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:57,198
I decided to quit!

273
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,165
I see.

274
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:02,957
Yeah, extra!

275
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:07,594
yes

276
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:07,594
(Chiko) That's why

277
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,891
Sakura-chan...

278
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,858
good luck!

279
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,660
Yeah

280
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,561
Ah, but not yet

281
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,561
That battle isn't over!

282
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,297
Hehe yes!

283
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:31,165
Nobu-nii too! About Sakura-chan

284
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:31,165
Please support me properly!

285
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,825
I'm still in second place!

286
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:36,231
Because Chico is gone

287
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:36,231
Don't get discouraged!

288
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:38,231
Yeah!

289
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:48,561
Sakura-chan

290
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:48,561
Absolute Grand Prix!

⚟(drum roll)⚞

296
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:15,528
(Moderator) This is Haruna Narumi!

297
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:15,528
It came in first place by far!

298
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:19,660
(applause)

299
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,264
(MC) Well then, here.

300
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,264
I managed to get 1st place...

301
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:30,297
Is it my fault?

302
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:37,264
Because you supported me on the stream

303
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,891
No one understands that.

304
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,891
What?

305
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,297
Yano feels bad.

306
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,297
"Yano-san"

307
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:57,594
Sakura-chan, you did your best.

308
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,990
Ah, me...

309
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,990
Aren't you really tired?

310
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,495
There were a lot of things going on.

311
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,495
With that process...

312
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:12,660
Sakura-chan ended up in 3rd place.

313
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
(Watanabe)

314
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Fans who are used to beauty pageants

315
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,924
wait and see

316
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,924
I'll throw money in on the last day.

317
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:21,132
Having a long-term connection with fans

318
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:21,132
It's strong, isn't it?

319
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,429
≪Relationship with fans

320
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,056
How to compete in a beauty pageant

321
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:33,759
Sakura-chan's strengths≫

322
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,891
≪As a manager

323
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,891
I didn't understand anything≫

324
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:45,693
(Chico) From Chico's point of view, Sakura-chan is

325
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:45,693
I think it was the best

326
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:47,693
(Yano) No, me too.

327
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:47,693
(Chiko) Lie

328
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,363
Yano: You don't think that way.

329
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,363
(Yano) That's why "Mr. Yano"

330
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,198
(Chico) Yano

331
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,198
(Yano) No, no, it's "Mr. Yano"

332
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,858
(Chico) Yano Yano

333
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,858
(Yano) “Yano-san”, right?

334
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:57,231
Mr. Shinobu?

335
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:04,561
Sorry Sakura-chan

336
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:10,056
me as a manager

337
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:10,056
I couldn't let you win.

338
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,561
I'll try harder

339
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:17,198
What are you talking about?

340
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:17,198
That kind of thing...

341
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:24,891
Shinobu-san worries with me.

342
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:24,891
Support me

343
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,396
It was reassuring

344
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:30,957
I'm lacking in so many things...

345
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,693
I have to try harder and harder

346
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:43,924
but…

347
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:47,990
I really wanted to win

348
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,990
(Yano) Hey Shinobu! What are you doing?

349
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,132
Sakura-chan is hungry

350
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:04,429
(Yano) Hurry up

351
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:04,429
Yeah

352
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,297
I'm flattened

353
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,297
(Yano) Hey, run!

354
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,495
Yes, I understand.

355
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,495
Let's go~

356
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,495
hang on

357
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:14,891
What? What do you mean?

358
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:17,858
Why now...

359
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:20,396
Did something happen?

360
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,297
Mr. Watanabe... Mr. Watanabe...

361
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,627
Eh, I couldn't believe I collapsed from overwork...

362
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,023
Mr. Watanabe

363
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,023
Sakura-chan's digital photo book

364
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,099
Only now

365
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,099
It's selling like crazy!

366
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,561
There's an amazing ad!

367
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,858
Huh?

368
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,132
That ad: Chico's fans

369
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,132
Looks like a gimmick

370
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:47,594
Something like Sakura-chan

371
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:47,594
Leave yourself alone

372
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:50,198
Because I supported Chico.

373
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:52,726
Grand Prix because of that

374
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:52,726
I guess I couldn't get it

375
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:54,726
It seems like I thought

376
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:58,528
(Yano)

377
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:58,528
Yeah? But I'm a fan of Chico-chan

378
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:58,528
Weren't you a free fan?

379
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,297
How is this...

380
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:01,297
