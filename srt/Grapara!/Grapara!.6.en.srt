1
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,165
(cherry blossoms)

2
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,165
I want to appear on Miss Frank!

3
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:11,825
(Watanabe) For those who won the Grand Prix

4
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:13,495
the cover of my magazine

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:13,495
I'll have it decorated

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,627
If I win the Grand Prix

7
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,627
Will the world change?

8
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:20,363
(Mutan)

9
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:20,363
You won the grand prize

10
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:20,363
Thanks to whom?

11
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:22,033
Saori-chan

12
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,957
(Lingcai)

13
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,957
You can win if you hold down the key players.

14
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,924
(Mutan)

15
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,924
As promised, I'll put you in first place.

16
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:28,924
The reason why Chico-chan appeared

17
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:31,759
Is it because you want Shinobu-san to see more?

18
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,693
I might not be able to lose that battle

19
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,297
What? It's not selling?

20
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,297
digital photo book

21
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:42,363
Sales haven't increased as much as I expected.

22
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:44,825
It turned out pretty good though.

23
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:48,132
(no call tone)

24
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,924
Oh, what happened, what happened?

25
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:55,825
I'm clearly depressed

26
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:58,858
I see, isn't it selling?

27
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,528
Take lots of off-shots

28
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,528
I really like it

29
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,693
There was so much buzz

30
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,693
I thought it would definitely sell

31
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:09,330
Yeah? Isn't that it?

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,759
reason

33
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,066
We did a lot of off-shots before the release.

34
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,066
Because it went viral

35
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,396
So

36
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,396
I said I didn't have to buy a photo book.

37
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:20,858
Are you satisfied?

38
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:20,858
That's totally my fault

39
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,000
Sorry Sakura-chan

40
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,000
Me, my god...

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,825
No, no, no, no

42
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:28,726
Far from supporting

43
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:28,726
What will you do if I disturb you? I

44
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,132
Ah, ah, but!

45
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:31,132
Awareness may have increased

46
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,759
Thanks to the off-shot buzz!

47
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,759
Because awareness has increased

48
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,627
Online photo voting

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,627
It might be growing!

50
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,627
kind…

51
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:43,363
I'm sure the ranking

52
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:43,363
It's up from 5th place!

53
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:46,231
(Yano) 6th place.

54
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,561
6th place Sakura-chan now

55
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,033
kill me

56
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,033
Mr. Shinobu...

57
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:55,066
It won't work next time anyway.

58
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:59,693
I was also thinking about planning the next distribution.

59
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:59,693
Probably not

60
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:04,198
Is this it?

61
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:08,462
Oh this is good

62
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:08,462
Huh?

63
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,033
I think it would be fun too!

64
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,957
"Sakura's

65
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,957

66
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,627
Well then, right away

67
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,627
I would like to make it

68
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,099
≪Maybe it's better to differentiate yourself from others

69
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,099
I think it's good≫

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,066
≪Idol children etc.

71
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,066
I'm participating

73
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,858

What's going on≫

79
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,495
(whisper) Sakura-chan

80
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:52,495
Sakura-chan

81
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,264
In response

82
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,264
Ah, ah...

83
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,330
(Sound of pot boiling over)

84
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,330
Ah...

85
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,759
(bumping sound)

86
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,759
Ah...

87
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,891
(bumping sound)

88
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,891
Ah...

89
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:05,264
Ah, ah, ah...

90
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,297
Better get a rag

91
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,297
Isn't it okay? Hey hot pot

92
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:09,825
Ah, ah, I see, I see.

93
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:12,891
(whisper) Sakura-chan

94
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:12,891
Sakura-chan

95
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:16,000
Ah... ah, sorry, um.

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,132
I was trying to make Chikuzenni.

97
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,891
Ah, when I tried to talk

98
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,891
I'm nervous...

99
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,561
Usually a little more

100
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,561
It should work fine...

101
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,330
Ah... I'm sorry.

102
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,561
It’s true, hehehe…

103
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,825
good

104
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,825
You can comment properly.

105
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,759
(whisper) Please let me go

106
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,759
Skip it, Sakura-chan

107
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,429
Well...

108
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,561
Huh?

109
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:08,462
Alright~~~!

110
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:14,396
2 people!

111
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:16,627
It's 2nd place!

112
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:16,627
Oh!

113
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,660
Awesome!

114
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,660
That's amazing!

115
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
⚟Not doing well! ⚞

116
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Mio-san!

117
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
Okay

118
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,924
Raw Mio Aisaka...

119
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,924
Huh? Why?

120
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:30,495
The drama was filmed around here.

121
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:30,495
I stopped by on my way to my next job.

122
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,825
I'm watching the drama!

123
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,825
thank you

124
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:35,660
Me too Sakura-chan's broadcast

125
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:35,660
I'm watching it a lot

126
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,627
Wow, it's serious now

127
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,627
Kawakawa's Kawa

128
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,627
thank you

129
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:45,231
Only healing! Existence is healing!

130
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,231
I'll continue on this route.

131
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,066
If this continues like this

132
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,066
There's a grand prize

133
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,825
Are you worried about something?

134
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:58,891
Ah, no, I should say I'm worried...

135
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:07,594
Thank you for coming today too~

136
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:07,594
Chiccorollin!

137
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:10,033
bye bye

138
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:21,660
Sigh… Why now?

139
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,165
Why aren't you ranked higher?

140
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:28,693
(Mio) Hmm, I see.

141
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:32,231
My friend Chico's

142
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:32,231
I'm worried

143
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,231
The number of viewers is by far

144
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,231
I think it's the most common...

145
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:39,924
Well, of course

146
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:39,924
Huh?

147
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:44,627
The key is to have fans who donate money.

148
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:44,627
Because of how many there are

149
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,858
For example, idol fans

150
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:50,297
Buy a ticket and come to the live show

151
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:50,297
They also buy goods

152
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:53,297
Most people expect to pay

153
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:56,792
Certainly, the number one place now is the child of an idol.

154
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:00,330
Race queen fans

155
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:00,330
There are many elderly people who are single.

156
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,099
A high percentage of people have money

157
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,363
Gravure fan base too

158
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,363
I wonder if there are many here

159
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,825
What about TechTocker?

160
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:14,792
no matter how many followers you have

161
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:14,792
The younger the audience, the more free fans there will be.

162
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:19,528
That's why digital photo books don't sell well either.

163
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:19,528
I don't even tip money

164
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,033
It's like this since...

165
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:28,297
More than that...I'm curious~ Ayu

166
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:31,231
Ayu-san

167
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:31,231
It hasn't been distributed yet.

168
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:33,660
I wonder what happened?

169
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,033
⚟📱

170
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,132
Ah, maybe...

171
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:47,066
I'll be streaming it today

172
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:47,066
Please donate money~

173
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,198
Ah~ I'm wrapping it on site.

174
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,198
He says he'll come soon.

175
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:55,264
I'll go to the next gravure photo shoot.

176
00:06:56,363 --> 00:07:00,660
Sorry, I'm busy.

177
00:06:56,363 --> 00:07:00,660
Ugh

178
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:06,165
Sakura-chan, one please

179
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,495
focus on yourself now

180
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,495
It's good that you care about your friends

181
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:14,726
But now I've reached a good place

182
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:14,726
Because it's coming

183
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,264
You want to win the Grand Prix, right?

184
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,759
yes

185
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:27,264
Who are you?

186
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:31,066
now? now⁉

187
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,891
(Cheek) Thank you for the meal.

188
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,825
Chico

189
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,066
what?

190
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,726
something…

191
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:51,231
If there's anything I can do to help

192
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:51,231
Say it

193
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:56,693

Smartphone: “No, it’s okay.”

199
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,429
"Eh?"

200
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,165
Why all of a sudden?

201
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,495
Even though it wasn't distributed at all...

202
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:43,429
If you're rooting for me

00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:43,429
Throw money!

There's something natural about it haha

225
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,594

(Click here) Mu-tan...

232
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,594
Smartphone

233
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,594
“Mu-tan, thank you for the throwing play!”

234
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,726
“Can you throw it like this?”

235
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:17,990
on second thoughts…

236
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:17,990
“You love me already.”

237
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,924
"Hey, thank you."

238
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,891
Huh...

239
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:33,198
As promised, I won first place

240
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:33,198
I did it for you~

241
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:38,891
Well then, it's about time for this kid.

242
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,957
on second thoughts

243
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,957
What interests me most this time is

244
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:44,297
It's this kid

245
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:47,264
The numbers aren't growing either...

246
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:50,891
Ah~ I feel so young

247
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:54,198
I can't help it!

248
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,023
(Male) Yes

249
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,023
(shutter sound)

250
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,429
(male)

251
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,429
Let's open your legs a little more

252
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:05,198
(Male) Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

253
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:05,198
(shutter sound)

254
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,792
(male)

255
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,792
Can you open it a little more?

256
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,330
Just a little more... um...

257
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,660
(Male) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

258
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,759
I apologize for the inconvenience.I will continue to visit Hanada in the future.

259
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,759
Thank you for your support.

260
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,858
ah

261
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:24,198
I don't know if it's Compra or Tempura though.

262
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:24,198
Recent photo shoot

263
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:26,297
Ah, we don't do that at all!

264
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,495
Ah yes

265
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:32,099
Saori-chan, can you spread your legs further?

266
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,924
About that 120 degrees

267
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:38,858
No, no, it's going to be 150 degrees. Yeah.

268
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,297
Ah okay okay okay

269
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,297
Yeah yeah Feels good Feels good

270
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,726
(Mio) Thank you for your hard work

271
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,726
(Saori) Good job

272
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:47,198
Isn't it a long time ago? Saorin

273
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:47,198
(Saori) Maybe so.

274
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,528
Mio: The dramas are amazing right now.

275
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,693
No, no, I'm desperate

276
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:56,099
(Saori) Even if I do a drama

277
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:56,099
You keep doing gravure

278
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:59,363
Yes, to create an image of an actress.

279
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:03,957
Gravure resting thing

280
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:03,957
My office told me...

281
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,891
Well, I like it after all.

282
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,495
If I did that too

283
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,495
It might have changed

284
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:25,528
Just a little bit

285
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:25,528
Is it okay if I complain?

286
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:29,297
please

287
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:33,924
win the grand prize

288
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:33,924
Just after joining the major company? at the time of

289
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:37,693
The agency told me to act as an actor.

290
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:41,198
But don't I have the image of an actor?

291
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,066
No, it's really not good anymore

292
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:48,066
I laughed when I saw my acting.

293
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:48,066
Damn it

294
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:51,231
What should we talk about, like variety?

295
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:51,231
I don't understand it at all

296
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,231
(Mio) Variety is difficult

297
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:57,693
How should I act in my own position?

298
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:57,693
I'm really confused as to whether it's okay or not.

299
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,759
I really respect the artist.

300
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,660
...and I lost my job

301
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,165
My agency told me to go back to gravure this time.

302
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,264
...and I'll be making a comeback to gravure.

303
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:17,726
But I don't have my own seat anymore.

304
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,792
A young boy came in

305
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,858
Lately

306
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:22,858
Because there is a lot of turnover

307
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:26,627
Something else

308
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:26,627
Only exposing herself more intensely than other girls.

309
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,825
There's no way left

310
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:34,627
...Even if I do it or get filmed,

311
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:34,627
I've been thinking about it

312
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:41,132
Eh, why are you doing this?

313
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:41,132
Are you doing it? like me

314
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll hold on to you like this

315
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:46,660
What do you want? That's it

316
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,165
I've been thinking about it lately...

317
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,726
However, the other day, a young child

318
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:58,099
Something like “I have a dream”

319
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:58,099
I talked about it

320
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:07,891
Even though I am like this

321
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:07,891
I told young people about my dreams

322
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:10,792
I don't want to admit that I'm uncool

323
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,594
Well, maybe

324
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:18,429
Like this tight me

325
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:18,429
Do you think it's fine if you become

326
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,297
No, it's me

327
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,528
But if the child sells

328
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,528
I'm jealous to death

329
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:32,990
It's dangerous, really. A guy like this.

330
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,528
It's normal

331
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:43,627
Yeah, that's normal.

332
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:53,726
Chico, do something with Sakura-chan.

333
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:53,726
Would you like to try streaming?

334
00:14:56,858 --> 00:15:00,594
Chico?

335
00:14:56,858 --> 00:15:00,594
(Yano) If it's Chico-chan, no.

336
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:04,726
Huh?

337
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:08,924
Someone who will put me in first place

338
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:08,924
He said he would meet me.

339
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,924
what? that…

340
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:13,693
That guy

341
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:13,693
Because I was kind of cornered.

342
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,726
Something strange...

343
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,858
Mr. Shinobu?

344
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,858
(Yano) Whoa, whoa, whoa...

345
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:23,198
Huh? Huh?

346
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:23,198
Where?

347
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,561
I don't understand!

348
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,561
But I'll try looking for it anyway!

349
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,660
Sakura-chan...

350
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,660
I'm going too!

351
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,924
(Yano) Eh, cho, cho, cho…

352
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,990
No, at my place

353
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,990
Chico-chan hasn't really come yet.

354
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,561
That's right...

355
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,561
Sorry, thank you

356
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:44,297
thank you

357
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:54,132
♬〜

358
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:57,825
(elevator arrival sound)

359
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:57,825
Other places I might go...

360
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,990
Ah...

361
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,990
Ah...

362
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,132
Saori-san!

363
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,132
(Saori) Yeah?

364
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,132
That friend

365
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:11,132
To the person who will put you in first place

366
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:11,132
I'm going to see you

367
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,957
He's gone

368
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,825
1st place in Miss Frank

369
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:18,858
somewhere I was headed

370
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:18,858
Do you have something in mind?

371
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:24,561
Are you going to bother me?

372
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:28,528
Something

373
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:28,528
I'm afraid I'll be in danger

374
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:30,528
why?

375
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:33,693
Because it's his own judgment

376
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:33,693
You headed there, right?

377
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,759
Even that child

378
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,759
Approximately what will be done

379
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,759
I'm sure you've figured it out

380
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,924
If it is decided by the person himself

381
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,924
Isn't it good?

382
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:42,627
(2 people) It can't be good!

383
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:48,297
We're friends, I can't leave you alone.

384
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:55,660
My guess is... I'll find your place.

385
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,924
Is it true!

386
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,924
Where is it?

387
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,561
Hehehe

388
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:06,660
Is it true that you'll put me in first place?

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,726
It's true, I'll put you in first place.

390
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:14,264
please

392
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:34,957
(Mutan)However

393
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:34,957
I wish I could clear all three games.

394
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:36,957
game?

395
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:40,231
Shall I change my clothes first?

396
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:43,396
Ah, hello

397
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,297
Are you in trouble? If it stays like this

398
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,627
≪Why do you teach...≫

399
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,122
this…

400
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:14,023
Loli and nightgown... I can't stand it!

401
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:17,561
Uncle, can't you take a look?

403
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:39,891
(Mutan) Good! Good!

404
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,924
What is a game?

405
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:46,363
Yeah! A pose that satisfies me

406
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:46,363
Clear if possible

407
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:50,363
gravure idol thing

408
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:50,363
Posing is everything!

409
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,155
But it's Chico Tech Tocker.

410
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:56,221
Don't you want to be number 1?

411
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,561
It's a gravure contest.

412
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,561
miss frank is

413
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,990
What should I do?

414
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,264
Yeah

415
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:11,363
You can pose as you like

416
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:20,429
Hun hun

417
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,528
Hun hun hun…

418

Hun hun hun hun hun hun...

Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...

420
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,858
copper? No?

421
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:32,957
good! Good!

422
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:37,330
This feeling... I can't stand it!

423
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,330
Ah~ I can't help it!

424
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:45,122
Clear!

425
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:45,122
Huh? Oh, I did it!

426
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:47,561
Next game!

427
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,396
What's inside the box?

428
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,693
Doesn't it have nothing to do with gravure idols?

429
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,990
gravure idol thing

430
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,990
The contents of the box...

431
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,957
Yeah!

432
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:14,089
Now, guess what's inside the box?

433
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:27,990
♬〜

434
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,462
(Cheek) Yay!

435
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,759
(Mutan) Clear!

436
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:47,495
Next... After clearing the next one...

437
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:51,561
The final game is blindfolded tag.

438
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:55,594
Time limit is 10 minutes

439
00:20:55,594 --> 00:20:57,957
Blindfold...

440
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,759
Chico-chan also blindfolded

443
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,495
(timer sound)

444
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,495
If you miss it, you lose.

445
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:25,561
(Mutan) Where is it?

446
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:28,957
Where are you?

447
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,891
Is it here?

448
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,155
Where?

450
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,264
(Mutan) Is it here?

451
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,462
Ah...

452
00:21:58,462 --> 00:22:00,825
I got stuck

453
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:03,056
(Mutan) I got stuck.

454
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:08,221
(alarm)

455
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:13,056
Too bad it's almost there

456
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:13,056
It was the Grand Prix.

457
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:17,759
But it stays like this

458
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,990
If only it were a little more okay

459
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,693
Even if you make it specially clear

460
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,693
Okay?

461
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:31,188
Huh?

462
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:31,188
You want to win the Grand Prix, right?

463
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:35,693
If I win the Grand Prix

464
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:40,759
Both the fans and Nobu-nii

465
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:40,759
Could you turn around?

466
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,528
Of course.

467
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:50,122
Is that okay?

468
00:22:50,122 --> 00:23:09,089
♬〜

469
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,990
Yeah

After all... Nobu-nii!

Eh...
