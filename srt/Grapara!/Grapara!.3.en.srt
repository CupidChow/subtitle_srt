00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,495
(cherry blossoms)

2
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,495
I will try my best at gravure!

3
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,495
Don't give up

4
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:13,396
(mio) within this month

5
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:13,396
I need to have 500,000 followers

6
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:15,066
You're making your AV debut, right?

7
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,858
After making me a gravure idol

8
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,858
Doing AV sells better.

9
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:19,528
(Shinobi) ≪I want to make it 500,000 people.

10
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,924
20,000 people a day

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,924
I need you to follow me...≫

12
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:25,297
(mio)

13
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:25,297
Connect with people who have a lot of followers other than me

14
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:25,297
Just collaborate

15
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,099
It's a party!

16
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,099
My name is Ayu Shiina.

17
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,099
Invited by a gravure idol

18
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,759
At a dangerous party

19
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,759
It's because I'm a kid who got a job.

20
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,594
Even without Shinobu-san

21
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:39,561
I can't do it properly myself

22
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:39,561
Because I thought

23
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,462
(Female) I want to sell

24
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,462
(Reina) Eh, definitely a good person.

25
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,429
(Female) Huh? Seriously?

26
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,429
Is there one chance?

27
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,165
What floor? What floor?

28
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,165
(Rena) 3rd floor

29
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:49,000
(Female) 3rd floor.

30
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:49,000
(chime)

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,660
(Reina) This is Reina.

32
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,660
(unlock sound)

33
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,627
(Female) I guess I'm really used to it.

34
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:56,000
Eh, who?

35
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:56,000
(Rena) I'm scared though

36
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,759
Isn't it suspicious?

37
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,924
(locking sound)

38
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,924
Ah...

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,792
(All) It's the king!

40
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:08,198
(Miura) Yes, me! Okay then

41
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:11,594
Well then, first of all...

42
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:15,561
Numbers 2 and 5 are hugging!

43
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,759
Yeah~

44
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,759
⚟Who? who? who? ⚞

45
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,429
Number 2 is me~

46
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,627
No. 5 With you?

47
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,627
I liked the neat Sakura-chan.

48
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,495
Huh? Me too

49
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,495
I'm a neat type though~

50
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,165
(Wada) Which one is the neat one?

51
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:33,561
(Miura)

52
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:33,561
Let's go 3.2.1 Go!

53
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh...

54
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:38,000
It really hits my boobs!

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,198
(Miura) Hey, I wasn't playing games just now.

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,198
I was hugging you though.

57
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:43,165
(Wada) Wow, that’s true!

58
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:43,165
I feel like I lost a lot

59
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:48,000
Then from now on

60
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:48,000
There's no point in it unless it's more than a hug

61
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:52,396
(All) It's the king!

62
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:56,363
I~!

63
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:56,363
(Wada) Ayu~ Wayy

64
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:58,429
Well then~

65
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:03,198
Number 3 kisses Number 1 on the cheek

66
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:06,693
Number 3: Me! Number 1: Who?

67
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,462
It's me...

68
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:10,462
Alright!

69
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:13,396
It came, it came~

70
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:20,132
(Ayu)

71
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:20,132
Well then, let's go 3.2.1

72
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:23,792
(Wada) Yay, the neat and clean style is cute!

73
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:23,792
What, does it feel like this on your cheeks?

74
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:27,495
Oh no

75
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:27,495
I feel like I'm doing something really bad!

76
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,660
Shall we go?

77
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:35,396
⚟Wayy⚞

(Ayu) Yes, that's it.

80
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:47,660
(Miura) Don't stop me

81
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,891
(Ayu) Cheeks! I'm the king

82
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,561
(Wada) It’s about time

83
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,561
Shall we level up?

84
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,594
Well, first of all, do you want me to strip you naked?

85
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:07,693
Ah~ Ah, ah, ah... Shit!

86
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,429
I'm too worried!

87
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:12,363
(Male) I'm a mover!

88
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:21,825
(Ayu) Take off the clothes No. 3 is wearing!

89
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:25,858
Fufufu hahaha

90
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:28,231
No, why

91
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:28,231
We are being stripped!

92
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:31,132
It can't be helped, hey?

93
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:36,132
(Miura) Shit yes next next!

94
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:36,132
Let's go! Yes, hold it

95
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,264
(All) It's the king!

96
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,363
Ah~ It's me, it's me, okay!

97
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,429
too excited

98
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:48,957
Then the king and number two...

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,825
Sex

100
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,495
Huh?

101
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:02,528
(chime)

102
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:02,528
(Male) Yes

103
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:05,264
“It’s a mover.”

104
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:09,264
Did someone ask for a mover?

105
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:09,264
(Reina) Put it in...

106
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,330
Yes, yes

107
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,660
please~

108
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,693
No, even if you say it's erotic, that's what it is, right?

109
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,693
Air, right? air etch

110
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:19,561
Ah, but...

111
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:19,561
(Wada) It's okay, it's okay, it's just pretend.

112
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,000
That's naive!

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,033
Ayu-san...

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,033
Already everyone

115
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,495
How much with Sakura-chan

116
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,495
Do you want to get along?

117
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,462
You're sneaky, Sakura-chan.

118
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,462
Huh?

119
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,957
(Ayu)

120
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,957
Everyone is talking about Sakura-chan

121
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,957
I'm glad you liked it

122
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:35,627
Ah, but...

123
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:35,627
It's your chance!

124
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:38,330
Let's have lots of fun!

125
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,825
I'll get you a drink.

126
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,825
let's go together

127
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,561
ＯＫ

128
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:48,132
So shall we go too?

129
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:48,132
I agree

130
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,462
(Miura) Because it's pretend

131
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:55,033
(Ayu)

132
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:55,033
I saw you at a photoshoot the other day.

133
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:58,792
Because it seems naive

134
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:58,792
I thought it looked like it was going to suck.

135
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:02,726
...and when I looked it up, I found someone I knew.

136
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:02,726
It was the manager and this girl.

137
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:07,627
Get in touch

138
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:07,627
I brought him to the toy staff.

139
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:11,363
(Wada) It's still good as always.

140
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:11,363
Don't make a man feel good about you

141
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:13,462
Please give me a good job

142
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:16,726
Tell Take, it's just him

143
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:16,726
Because I don't feel good about it

144
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:21,396
Huh?

145
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:21,396
You're going to do something good now, right?

146
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,396

153
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,264
Um...

Eh, it's air, right?

156
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:03,099
It's a game, right?

157
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,660
If I stay still

158
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,660
I'll do my job properly.

00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:09,396
Did something happen?

190
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:11,759
Are you okay?

191
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:15,891
it's okay…

192
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,726
I couldn't even take a photo.

193
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,726
With Ayu-san

194
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:24,396
sorry

195
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,495
Oh wait, wait, wait

196
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:29,330
Well then, let's go searching together now.

197
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,429
It's impossible

198
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:41,759
I'm sorry... I don't like it anymore...

199
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:49,429
(Busujima) I see, you ran away?

200
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,396
That's right

201
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,396
It's probably quite dented.

202
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:56,759
📱(Ayu) Getting a job

203
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:56,759
I don't think it's possible. I'm sorry.

204
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,198
(Busujima) No, it's fine.

205
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,198
📱What?

206
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:03,858
(Dokujima)

207
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:03,858
Things are progressing well, aren't they?

209
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,264

210
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:27,033
(Yano) I see...

213
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:51,132
I haven't been home for three days now.

214
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,858
at a party

215
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,858
I think it was a terrible experience.

216
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:05,660
I knew it was dangerous.

217
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,561
I couldn't stop

218
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,264
Follower deadline

219
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,264
Only two weeks left

220
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:18,297
Not yet...

221
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,462
Shinobu-kun

222
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:26,198
yes…

223
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:31,363
It's better not to come back like this

224
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:31,363
Might be good, Sakura-chan

225
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:36,099
What are you talking about?

226
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:36,099
You finally saw me, you bastard.

227
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:38,660
Hehehe

228
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,825
But it's not a joke, it's true

229
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:46,495
It's cruel but...

230
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:51,198
In this industry

231
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:51,198
There is a clear pros and cons

232
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:54,825
Some kids find it easier to just fly away.

233
00:10:56,363 --> 00:11:01,693
Better fly away

234
00:10:56,363 --> 00:11:01,693
maybe it's for her

235
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:06,330
Come to think of it, I...

236
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,363
I'm trying to quit gravure

237
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,363
Sakura-chan

238
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:12,099
Forcibly stop me

239
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:12,099
So, do your best, do your best...

240
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:16,792
《Gravure said you would do your best, right?

241
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:16,792
You said you'd do anything, right? 》

242
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm for Sakura-chan

243
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:22,660
I thought so

244
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,000
It's all my ego...

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,033
I...

246
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:35,693
To Sakura-chan

247
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:35,693
I might have made you feel bad...

248
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:38,726
《I don't like it anymore...》

249
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,363
(Mio) I don't understand that.

250
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:47,660
But in my eyes, I tried my best.

251
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:47,660
Shinobu-kun

252
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,198
I understand that, I tried my best!

253
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:55,330
95,000 followers in 2 weeks

254
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:55,330
Did you increase it? That's amazing!

255
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,660
No, that's it

256
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,660
It's mostly thanks to Mio.

257
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:07,396
About me Sakura-chan

258
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:07,396
I'm so jealous

259
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,264
When we first met

260
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:17,396
This guy is next to Sakura-chan.

261
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:17,396
I guess it's for the body.

262
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,429
When you're next to someone like that

263
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:22,792
What is gravure?

264
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:22,792
I guess it won't last long

265
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,165
I tried it with...

266
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:29,264
Eh... then...

267
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:32,429
At that time

268
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:32,429
Were you not really motivated?

269
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,693
《Hey, let's do it.》

270
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:37,429
《Sigh》

271
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:40,627
I have never felt unmotivated

272
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:40,627
Because I was horny

273
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,858
Huh? Yeah? Huh? Yeah?

274
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:45,858
But you refused.

275
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:49,924
《Here, touch Mio too》

276
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:54,033
《Ah, no, no...

277
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:54,033
But! 》

278
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,891
(Mio) I didn't come on board.

279
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,264
At that time

280
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:05,033
Ah, this person is in the entertainment world.

281
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,726
Should be next to the talent

282
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,726
I thought it was a human

283
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:12,429
Don't act for yourself

284
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:17,165
He's a person who can act for others.

285
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,726
Are you coming to my place?

286
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:32,957
to my manager

287
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:32,957
Won't you be there?

288
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:36,132
Mio's...

289
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:39,099
No, why me...

290
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:42,924
Because entertainment is luck.

291
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:51,858
i want you i need you

292
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:04,396
That kind of thing...

293
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:08,594
I've never had anyone say that to me.

294
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:08,594
in life

295
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:12,792
Sakura-chan will let you go

296
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:12,792
If you're going to do something wasteful

297
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,330
I want you to come to me

298
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,165
I want you to be my manager

299
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:26,726
Hey, wait a minute...

300
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:26,726
let me think

301
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:30,957
1 day! wait a day

302
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,726
No more than that

303
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:45,594
Understood

304
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,825
Be sure to reply tomorrow

305
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,231
Yeah

306
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:02,066
≪I wasn't happy...there's no reason≫

307
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:05,627
≪Because until now,

308
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:10,000
not needed

(Mio) ≪Come dressed up! ≫

315
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:02,670
Somehow, I was sleeping over at a cafe.

316
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:02,670
Looks like I don't have any more money.

317
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,967
Yeah yeah yeah

318
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,967
I'm heading to the office now.

319
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,571
Huh? No, not anymore

320
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,571
If I were a little kind

321
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,703
It's Kororotto

322
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,264
Well, I got 100,000 followers.

323
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,264
Site-based underground AV is enough. Yeah.

324
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:17,769
Anyway today

325
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:17,769
I'll take a quick first shot at the office.

326
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,571
Yes, get ready. Yes, yes.

327
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:24,670
Okay

328
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,264
Okay, are you okay?

329
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,264
Aren't you hungry?

330
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes it's okay

331
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:34,000
(Dokujima) OK, good.

Sakura-chan?

333
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,868
Eh, hey, hey, hey

334
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:48,571
Hey Shinobu! Shinobi!

335
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,670
Oh?

00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,670
(Yano) What, are you going out?

337
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,703
Yeah, a little

338
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,703
I just saw Sakura-chan

339
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:57,231
Eh, where?

340
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:57,231
In front of the convenience store in front of the station

341
00:16:57,231 --> 00:17:00,769
There's something fishy about that guy with glasses.

342
00:16:57,231 --> 00:17:00,769
I got in the car and went somewhere

343
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,769
That's...

It might be for her.

《I don't like it anymore...》

(Salesperson) Excuse me.

359
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,165
Ah, I arrived 30 minutes early.

360
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:04,967
I'm not particularly excited.

361
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,637
(Busujima) Ah, cheer up your legs.

362
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,637
yes

363
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,703
(Busujima) Be careful

364
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,703
Ah yes

Congratulations on your AV debut

Huh?

369
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,495
Finally

370
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,495
It's the beginning of a new stage

371
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,297
The stage name remains the same...

372
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,297
Please wait

373
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,297
What are you talking about?

374
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,297
Oh?

00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:57,726
From the man at that photoshoot

00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:57,726
Haven't you heard me?

377
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,792
Are you Shinobu-san? nothing

378
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:04,792
Huh? Seriously? Huh?

379
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:10,155
Ah ah~ Yeah yeah yeah

380
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:14,297
I see, yes yes yes

381
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:18,627
No, this is it

382
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:18,627
That's what he decided

383
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:24,957
That Shinobu-kun? He is

384
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:24,957
I was approached to talk about AV.

385
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,825
Mr. Shinobu

386
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,825
He's the kind of person who would do something like that...

387
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:31,330
After the photo session, I suddenly forced myself to

388
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:31,330
Were you trying to increase your followers?

389
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,858
Do you have any idea?

390
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:36,188
(Yano)

391
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:36,188
《500,000⁉ And in one month》

392
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:41,122
"Are you okay

393
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:41,122
If we keep our current momentum, we can do it.

394
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:45,462
At the photo session, you called out to me.

395
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:45,462
I'll increase my followers here

396
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:48,990
Let me make my AV debut over there.

397
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:48,990
He asked me to give him money.

398
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,023
That kind of thing...

399
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,023
Taken to a suspicious party

400
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,330
I want to get a job there

401
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,330
Didn't you?

402
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,396
Ah... Ah, but that's it.

403
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,396
Shinobu is against it.

404
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,155
That's what I...

405
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,155
(Busujima) No, no, no, no.

406
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,155
I objected once

407
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:06,089
You went to the party voluntarily.

408
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:06,089
It's to make you think

409
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:11,957
I hope you don't lie to me

410
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:11,957
You're doing well, you're smart

411
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:17,231
It was all part of the plan.

412
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:17,231
but…

413
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:20,594
in the first place

414
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:20,594
That's how you and he met

415
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,231
It's all his

416
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,231
Wasn't that a plan?

417
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:26,330
it's completely coincidental

418
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:26,330
(Dokujima) No, no

419
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,122
Coincidences don't happen like that.

420
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:32,528
《Sakura-chan! 》

421
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:36,792
《Somehow, by chance, the knife

422
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:36,792
It looks like it hit the belt.

423
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,924
《By chance》

424
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:43,122
(Busujima) Well, that's it.

425
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:48,858
If you hate me that much

426
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:48,858
I don't mind if you say no.

427
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,759
Ah, then...

428
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,759
10 million

429
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:56,957
I'll have to pay a penalty fee, but is that okay?

430
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,264
Eh, why...

431
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:03,231
Why you?

432
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:03,231
I'm already making a lot of progress.

433
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:06,155
Well, the biggest thing is labor costs.

434
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:08,825
There are quite a number of adults moving.

435
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,858
Well, I'm in a position too.

436
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:11,858
No matter how much it costs

437
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:16,924
Even if you estimate it as low

438
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:16,924
It usually takes that long

439
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,693
Like that...

440
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,726
Shinobu-kun said he would tell you.

441
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,726
I made progress though

442
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:25,858
This is really annoying for everyone.

443
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:30,924
What should we do?

444
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:36,330
Should I just take pictures?

445
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,627
Yeah?

446
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,825
(sound of door opening)

447
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,693
welcome

448
00:21:53,693 --> 00:22:05,363
♬〜

449
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:07,693
Shinobi...

450
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:07,693
I went to a convenience store.

451
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,429
Let me go

452
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,429
Hey, I'll turn it, so get ready.

453
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,759
Thin

454
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:18,660
What should we do? Can you do it?

455
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,330
Or should I pay a penalty of 10 million yen?

456
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,924
Either is fine, you decide

457
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:36,528
you are

458
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:36,528
I was fooled by Shinobu-kun, everything.

459
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:50,363
Are you okay

460
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:50,363
No matter what, I'll protect you

461
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:56,155
From now on

462
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:56,155
You won't have to worry about money

463
00:22:56,155 --> 00:23:00,792
So come with me

464
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:10,155
yes…

465
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:15,231
Let's do our best together

466
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:25,231
I'll make a mess
