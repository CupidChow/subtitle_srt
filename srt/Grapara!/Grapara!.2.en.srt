1
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,165
(Sakura) I want to do it!

2
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,132
Even like me, I can shine

3
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,132
I want to think!

4
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,066
(Mio) Current office

5
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:14,066
It's better to stop

6
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,891
(Dokujima) Our Sakura Katsuragi

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,660
I wish I had more followers

8
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,660
I'll release the AV

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,495
(Shinobu) What should I do?

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,495
Can you continue doing gravure?

11
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:23,396
(Busujima) About Mio Aisaka?

12
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:23,396
I wish I had around 500,000 followers

13
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,660
I'll do it

14
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:26,660
I'll show you 500,000 followers

15
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,330
Deadline is 1 month

16
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,000
It didn't cost 500,000 yen, so it's AV right away.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,858
(Yano) 500,000⁉

18
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:38,363
And it's only been a month

19
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:38,363
I still have 5000 followers

20
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:42,198
It's okay, I can go on as long as I keep my current momentum.

21
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:44,858
Why are you in such a hurry?

22
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,528
I saw Mr. Osaka today.

23
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:53,330
Sakura-chan looks like that soon

24
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:53,330
I just thought I'd like to see it

25
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,891
No, no, no...

26
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,891
No matter how you think about it, it is

27
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,528
Are you okay! Plan properly

28
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,528
Because I have thought about it.

29
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,198
Look at this

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,957
Many likes on SNS

31
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,957
I tried gravure poses

32
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:09,066
I asked the two of you to take the photo here.

33
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:09,066
Please post as many as possible

34
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:12,231
Not only photos but also videos

35
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,297
Many of them are quite extreme.

36
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:20,462
You said you would work hard on gravure, right?

37
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:20,462
You said you'd do anything, right?

38
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:27,363
Understood

39
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:29,594
What are you doing? Shinobu

40
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:33,495
Ah, I...

41
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,726
I'm thinking of making some chili and handing it out.

42
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:36,726
(Yano) Flyer?

43
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:41,033
That's about it

44
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:41,033
Because there's nothing I can do

45
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:45,462
You two please start filming.

46
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:45,462
I'll make flyers too.

47
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:47,231
ah

48
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:53,033

55
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,231

⚟But…⚞

59
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,825

60
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,693
⚟Next, get on all fours

61
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,693

62
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:17,330

Ahh~ So cute! ⚞

66
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:24,132
(Busujima Producer) Hahahaha...

67
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:24,132
⚟(knock)⚞

68
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:26,726
Ah, okay, come in.

69
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:28,693
(Kanon Runa) Excuse me.

70
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:32,726
There are two of my gravure idols.

71
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:32,726
The numbers have increased considerably now.

72
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,660
(Kanon Luna)

73
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,660
thank you!

74
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,297
Please, okay, then take it off.

75
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:43,132
Huh?

76
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:43,132
Huh? Inside You're wearing a swimsuit, right?

77
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,825
Did you wear these?

78
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,825
Ah yes

79
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,165
Hahaha, right?

80
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,165
Sorry, I'm still new.

81
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:50,825
Hahahaha...

82
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,759
(Busujima) Come on, let's go ahead.

83
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,759
Chakichaki

84
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,198
⚟Yes⚞

85
00:02:55,198 --> 00:03:14,297
♬〜

86
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:18,165
(Busujima) Then, let's talk about the charm of the two of us.

87
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:18,165
Please take a look at it to your heart's content

88
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,198
Ah, closer

89
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,198
Please take a look

90
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,858
After all, that's what's attractive about it.

91
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:25,792
I need to see it closer

92
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:25,792
I don't understand, yes.

93
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:37,462
♬〜

94
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:41,858
that…

95
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:41,858
Huh? Not sure about the shape?

96
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:44,825
Ah~ I see.

97
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,693
Okay, then take it off.

98
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,693
Huh?

99
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:51,396
No, what did I misunderstand?

100
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:51,396
Check the shape

101
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:54,726
That's not the case.

102
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:54,726
You're a professional so it's rude.

103
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't get me wrong.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,924
Hahahaha… hehehehe…

105
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,396
yes!

106

107
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:23,429
I'll take care of work

108
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:23,429
Don't worry, okay?

110
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,759
(spoken) Ah...

111
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:27,726
♬〜

112
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:31,198
I'll do my best

113
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,726
Sakura-chan...

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,660
This is Sakura Kuzuki.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,660
thank you

116
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,594
It's bothering me though

117
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:44,528
My name is Sakura Kuzuki.

118
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:44,528
thank you

119
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:48,363
This is Sakura Kuzuki.

120
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:48,363
thank you

121
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:55,429
Um... this kid

122
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,825
Ah yes!

123
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,825
A gravure girl named Sakura Kuzuki...

124
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,726
how much?

125
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,726
Huh?

126
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,099
Where is the shop? Pinsaro?

127
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,462
Ah, no, that's what it is...

128
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,462
(Male) Hey, hey here.

129
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,000
Handing out flyers is prohibited

130
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,000
Ah, sorry

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,924
pink flyers

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,924
Please give me a break!

133
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,594
No, it's not a pink flyer.

134
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:15,924
Make sure to pick up those things over there.

135
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:15,924
yes

136
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:18,330
Sorry!

137
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,594
(Male) I haven't eaten. How about ramen?

138
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,594
(Female) Oh, sure.

139
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,396
Wow!

140
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,396
(Female) Oh, I'm sorry.

141
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:41,594
What? this

142
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:41,594
It's disgusting.

143
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:46,000
(Male) Ah, ah, ah, ah...

144
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:46,000
Please give me a break!

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,099
Make sure to clean it properly

146
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,132
Sorry, sorry

147
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:55,000
(Yano) Oh!

148
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:55,000
Over 10,000 followers

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,231
The number of people increased by 5000 in 3 days.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,231
Oh, there are quite a few comments.

151
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,594
That's amazing!

152
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,594
(Yano) Yeah, I did it!

153
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:04,693
≪No good at all, even though we want to increase the number to 500,000 people.

155
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:08,495
I need you to follow me...≫

156
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,660
Shinobu: That's what I heard.

157
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,198
Hand out 10,000 flyers.

158
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,198
It seems like there is only one person who is effective.

159
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:18,231
Huh?

160
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,528
≪There are only 490,000 people left...≫

161
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:24,561
≪4.9 billion flyers? ≫

162
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:28,495
≪To print one sheet

163
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:28,495
Because it’s 5 yen…≫

164
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:33,660
≪24.5 billion yen for flyers? ≫

165
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:41,132
If it stays like this...

166
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:02,429
《My debut work

167
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:02,429
Freshly picked》

168
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,924
Pick it up!

169
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:07,198
(Yano) What? what? what?

170
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:07,198
i want to eat? Grapes?

171
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:11,957
Do you want to eat grapes?

172
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:11,957
i want to eat? Hey hey

173
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,462
good? good?

174
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:20,429
That DM came.

175
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:20,429
From Mio Aisaka

176
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,726
Is it a private work room?

177
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,726
(Mio) Yeah

178
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:32,330
The swimsuit is on the other side.

179
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,033
Later I

180
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,033
Can I choose Sakura-chan?

181
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,924
I'd love to!

182
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,957
Can I see it?

183
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,957
(Mio) Yeah

184
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,924
Thank you for today

185
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,924
invitation

186
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,264
I saw it on SNS

187
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,264
Ah, thank you very much

188
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,495
Pose first

189
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,495
It was an easy choice, right?

190
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,528
A girl with big breasts

191
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,528
There were only things that looked good.

192
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:58,495
The video is also very obvious

193
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:58,495
Let me do something that makes my heart flutter

194
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,957
Is it no good?

195
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,957
Not at all

196
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:05,033
The video is

197
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:05,033
Pretend you don't have any intention of shaking me

198
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,561
But I was like, ``Oh, it's shaking.''

199
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,561
Embarrassing! ” already

200
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:12,594
The question is how to make it sway naturally.

201
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:12,594
It's a game

202
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,891
What about Sakura-chan?

203
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,891
Especially that one

204
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,924
Type that looks cute

205
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,000
That's better

206
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll definitely accept it

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,528
I see, it's educational.

208
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:27,297
It's only one month

209
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:27,297
I understand the feeling of panic.

210
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:30,825
But Sakura-chan's unique characteristics

211
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:30,825
Let me think about it

212
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,594
yes

213
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:36,924
Yeah? What? One month?

214
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:41,759
Yeah? Because within this month

215
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:41,759
I need to have 500,000 followers

216
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,825
You're making your AV debut, right?

217
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,825
Hey!

218
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,891
Wha... how do you know?

219
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:46,891
Hehe! I heard it

220
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,198
《The deadline is 1 month》

221
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:54,924
《Because it didn't cost 500,000

222
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:54,924
即ＡＶ》

223
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:58,759
《Do your best at best》

224
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:58,759
《Huh~》

225
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,891
Well, that seems interesting.

226
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,891
It's happening

227
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,891
Afun! No, no, really

228
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,891
What are you doing?

229
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,000
Sakura-chan, change into your swimsuit.

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,528
Ah yes please!

231
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,627
What kind of swimsuit do you like?

232
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,627
Yeah~

233
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:17,165
After all, isn't it pink or white?

234
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,693
How do you know...

235
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:25,066
⚟(Mio) Wow~

236
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:25,066

⚟(Mio) Is this one more erotic?

245
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:41,297
This might be cute⚞

246
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:45,264
Huh...

247
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:45,264
１･２･３･４･５･６･７･８･９･10

248

Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, billions, trillions, Beijing, Ga…

249
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:49,066

⚟(Chime)⚞

254

Ah, it's here

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is photographer Hide Morioka.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is Hide

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,297
thank you

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,297
please

259
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:57,462
Nice boobs today too

260
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:57,462
Yay!

261
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:05,957
(Hide) Those are cute boobs.

262
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:10,297
So let's get started

263
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:10,297
(Mio) Yes

264
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,462
Huh?

265
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:15,957
(Hide) Ah, that's nice, more and more

266
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:15,957
Open your drawer, keep opening it

267
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,033
(shutter sound)

268
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,033
nice

269
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,132
Well, let's go sit next time.

270
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,132
(Mio) Yes

271
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,726
Well, Mio, sit there.

272
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,726
Sakura-chan is next to you

273
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,957
yes

274
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,627
(Hide) Yes

275
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,627
(shutter sound)

276
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:30,429
(Hide) Good, good.

277
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,297
Sakura-chan

278
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,297
Should I relax a little more?

279
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:35,660
Is this so?

280
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:35,660
different

281
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,561
A little more like this

282
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,561
It feels like it sticks out more

283
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:41,627
It feels like it's sticking out, okay? yes

284
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,462
(shutter sound)

285
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,462
(Hide) Okay.

286
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,066
Yes Sakura-chan

287
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,066
Put a little more effort into your butt

288
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:51,462
Tight, tight, tight

289
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:55,264
≪A little bit

290
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:55,264
Isn't it too much? ≫

291
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:57,594
(Hide)...Let's open our legs, okay?

292
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:00,429
≪All these weird poses...≫

293
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:04,858
《Many of them are quite extreme》

294
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:09,660
《Gravure said you would do your best, right?

295
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:09,660
You said you'd do anything, right? 》

296
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,528
≪No...

297
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,528
The same thing I was doing too≫

298
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,924
Shine the light on you from below

299
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,924
yes

300
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,297
no…

301
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,297
Just a little more

302
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,165
Because it's in the picture

303
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,165
Yes, it's in the picture

304
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,825
Here… is it like this?

305
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,825
(Hide) Yeah, yeah, yeah

306
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:27,957
yes nice

307
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:27,957
(shutter sound)

308
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:31,891
Next time, let's go with a crab-like feeling.

309
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:31,891
≪Gani crotch⁉≫

310
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:35,561
This is the back of the thigh

311
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:35,561
feeling of coming forward

312
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,528
≪He's touching my butt again≫

313
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,528
(Hide) It feels like it's sticking out. Yes, like this.

314
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,792
≪No matter how many photographers there are,

315
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,792
Something like this...≫

316
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,528
≪Like this

317
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:44,528
It's just sexual harassment! ≫

318
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,759
that!

319
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,396
more normal

320
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,396
Could you do it for me?

321
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,660
Are you dissatisfied with my method?

322
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,528
No, I'm an amateur

323
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:57,429
About this industry

324
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:57,429
I don't really understand

325
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,363
Ah~ wait, wait

326
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,363
but!

327
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:03,693
They are not a product

328
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:03,693
I'm a girl

329
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,726
So more

330
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,726
Please cherish it

331
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,462
Ah~ I'm sorry, I'm sorry

332
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,462
I didn't mention the shooting style.

333
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:17,264
Just when I was changing clothes

334
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:17,264
Tell Sakura-chan

335
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:19,891
Sorry I got the OK!

336
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,561
Huh?

337
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,396
How to be photographed from Miokara

338
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,396
I'm asked to guide you

339
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,660
What?!

340
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,660
(Hide) For example...

341
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,891
The magazine has gravure on the cover

342
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,726
Sales doubled

343
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,726
It's a world that can be cut in half

344
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:38,363
For example, a girl's hand position

345
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:38,363
With just one glance

346
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,891
Sales volume changes

347
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,891
That's the world

348
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,264
Tell me that...

349
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:49,891
The cover has that much responsibility.

350
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:49,891
Please keep this in mind

351
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,759
yes!

352
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,759
That's a good reply

353
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,231
Hide-san has no ulterior motives.

354
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:09,099
Sorry, but I'm not interested in women.

355
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:09,099
It's all about art.

356
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:13,198
Wow! Wow!

357
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:13,198
Wow sorry! Wow!

358
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,726
I made a terrible misunderstanding

359
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,726
I'm so sorry!

360
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:20,165
No, there's no need to apologize.

361
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:25,198
Your passion touched my heart

362
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,198
Wow, that's embarrassing...

363
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,231
Sakura-chan, I'm really sorry too!

364
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,231
Oh no no

365
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,825
Ah, break! Yeah, let's take a break!

366
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,594
I'll make you some tea.

367
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:50,198
I'm really sorry

368
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:50,198
Okay

369
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:58,660
《They are not a product.

00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,033
I'm also followed a lot

377
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:37,165
It looks like there will be 100,000 people soon.

378
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:37,165
Haa amazing

379
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:42,340
Collaborating with someone who has a lot of followers

380
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:42,340
So effective

381
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,231
That Mio-san!

382
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,231
Yeah?

383
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:46,231
If you like, let's be together again

384
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,637
There's no point in being together again

385
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:50,505
Huh?

386
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:54,099
If it's just me

387
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:54,099
Basically, it only reaches my fans.

388
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,099
Followers won't increase

389
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,198
I see

390
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,198
Eh, then what should I do...

391
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,868
Do you want me to tell you?

392
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,868
Yes please tell me

393
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,967
please!

394
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,967
(Mio) I understand, I understand.

395
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:09,670
I'm not that stubborn anymore

396
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:09,670
Ah...

397
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,571
It's easy.

398
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,604
Connect with people who have a lot of followers other than me

399
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,604
Just collaborate

400
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:21,307
for example…

401
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:21,307
That's right! That's right!

402
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:25,703
Is it okay?

403
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:25,703
Hey, really nice photo

404
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:29,231
(Mio) It's okay, hey, this kid.

405
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,373
This girl is also a follower

406
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,373
There are so many

407
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,670
what up?

408
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,340
I thought it would be better if I wasn't there.

409
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,571
Ah, no, please forget it.

410
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,769
(notification sound)

411
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,340
Ah, what about this one?

412
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,264
I'm sure at the photo session the other day too.

413
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,264
You were there, right?

414
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:03,670
(Mio) Ah~ Ayuka

415
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:03,670
Do you know each other?

416
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,132
Eh~ If you like

417
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,132
Even if you introduce me...

418
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:11,637
Hmm... At a dangerous party.

419
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:11,637
It's because I'm a kid who got a job.

420
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,637
With Sakura-chan...

421
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:19,033
Eh, it's dangerous.

422
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:19,033
Maybe that...

423
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,967
Pillow-like?

424
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:26,439
Moreover, this boy has recently become a Minato-ku type of guy.

425
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:26,439
Guess the girl

426
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,340
I heard you're getting a job.

427
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,340
I hear rumors

428
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,901
It's a party!

429
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:36,967
My name is Ayu Shiina.

430
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:36,967
He also participated in a photo session during this time.

431
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:41,165
Invited by a gravure idol

432
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:41,165
That's...

433
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:44,000
No, but Ayu

434
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sure you have a lot of followers

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,198
industry people

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,198
If you're coming to a party

437
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:49,099
As long as we are connected

438
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:49,099
but…

439
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,307
If I could take a photo with Ayu

440
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,307
You can also post it on SNS

441
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:54,439
What will you do if something happens?

442
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:54,439
that…

443
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:58,231
If you protect yourself properly

444
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:58,231
No, that's what you call self-defense.

445
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,066
that!

446
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:04,340
Oh, sorry, Sakura-chan, what?

447
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,198
whether to go or not

448
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,198
I want to decide

449
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,868
No, but...

450
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:14,264
i want to go

451
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:17,198
Well, at least let's be together

452
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:22,934
Even if I don't have Shinobu-san

453
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:27,637
I can't do it properly myself

454
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:27,637
Because I thought

455
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm going

456
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,736
Sakura-chan

457
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:47,165
If you really take a photo

458
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:47,165
You can come back soon.

459
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:53,538
Yes, I'll take a picture properly.

460
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,472
I'm going

461
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:03,307
Take care

462
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,924
Intercom "Yes"

463
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,825
I came by invitation from Ayu-san.

464
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,825
This is Sakura Kuzuki.

465
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,561
"please"

466
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,561

00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,495
Ah~ I'm so glad you came

470
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:03,495
Um, why are you wearing a swimsuit?

471
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:03,495
What? Is this your first time?

472
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,495
It's like this

473
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:08,396
There's a pool too, don't you want to swim?

474
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:13,056
That's right…

475
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:13,056
(Ayu) That's right~

476
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:16,561
Is there something inside?

477
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:21,122
Yeah? Hmm, over there.

478
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:27,495
(Ayu) Fun space!

479
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,297
Mr. Muramatsu

480
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,297
Have you decided which child to choose?

481
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:41,396
Hmm, that's right~ hehe

482
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:43,759
Is this the child?

483
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,759
Hehehe

484
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,726
nice looking

485
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,726

486
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,891

00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,594

488
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,594

491
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,594
Isn't it cute?

492
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,594
So cute~

493

00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,726
As a sign that you are near

497
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,858
