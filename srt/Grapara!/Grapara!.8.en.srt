00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,726
The cover of “Frank” has been decided!

00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,396
(Sakura) ≪To Shinobu-san≫

00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:17,330
≪I am working at a major entertainment agency.

5
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:17,330

6

≪Goodbye≫

7
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:23,363
(Mio) As expected...

8
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:23,363
be my manager

9
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:25,033
To me...

10
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,726
Don't do it.

11
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:36,066
The manager

12
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:36,066
I don't want to do it.

13
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:39,792
I want to support Sakura-chan

14
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,033
Then there's only one thing to do

15
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:03,726
Are you looking for Sakura-chan?

16
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,495
Sakura-chan is

17
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:11,495
I can't believe you're leaving like that

18
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:14,726
That's funny!

19
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:14,726
(Mio) Is that why?

20
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,627
looking for sakura-chan

21
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,627
I'll ask about the situation

22
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,330
If you really want to belong to a major company

23
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,330
That's fine

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,957
But if there's another reason

25
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:27,033
To help Sakura-chan

26
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:27,033
I want to be!

27
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,198
Okay!

28
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:31,132
Sakura-chan I'm sorry

29
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:31,132
(Yano) No, what are you doing?

30
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,957
Something like Sakura-chan

31
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,957
where did you go

32
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:35,066
I wonder if there's anything I can understand?

33
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,396
What do you mean by searching?

34
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:39,396
Find it, meet it, and talk properly!

35
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:44,363
I'm looking for Chico too!

36
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,462
What? No, I was looking for it.

37
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,462
...Just as appropriate

38
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,891
Even if you searched blindly...

39
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,924
Sakura-chan and

40
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,924
You've been working hard so far, haven't you?

41
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,792
Somewhere I think I'll go

42
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:54,792
Don't you understand?

43
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,000
Ah!

44
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,000
How did you find out?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,924
Ah, no.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,924
I can't use Yano at all!

47
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,297
But!

48
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:08,264
Sakura-chan

49
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:08,264
An ally who will search with me

50
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:10,528
There are as many as 200,000 people.

51
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:12,231
to followers

52
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:12,231
Are you asking me to search for you?

53
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,891
Isn't it the result of your hard work?

54
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,891
Wow, Yano is so disgusting!

55
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,792
Ah, no, but suddenly

56
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,792
"Sakura-chan is gone.

57
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:20,825
Please look for me.”

58

61
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,561
Can Shinobu-kun also post?

62
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,528
Yes I'm sharing

63
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,858

Yay! Let's contact this person!

(Yano) This guy

71
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,561
Wasn't he arrested?

72
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:55,561
(Cheek) Huh? Someone you know?

73
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,561
No, I'm not a red-handed offender.

Huh? Who?

77
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:03,462
Sakura-chan's manager

78
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:07,891
Oh no, former manager

79
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,000
《Submit to AV》

Can you give me an autographed photo?

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,165
Sakura-chan too

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,165
We're together, right?

87
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,165
📱 (Busujima) Well, don't be so cautious.

88
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:33,000
Because I'm grateful to you

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,660
what do you mean?

90
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,000
📱 Thanks to your hard work

91
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,000
Sakura became a top gravure idol

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,396
Well, but if you come this far

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,396
It's better to sell orthodox than AV

94
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,396
Because you can earn money

95
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:47,660
with my connections

96
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:47,660
I decided to transfer to a major company.

97
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,957
And Sakura-chan too

98
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,957
You agree, right?

99
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:56,924
(Busujima) Because I understand it.

100
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:56,924
Did he leave you?

101
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,792
📱 Well, don't attack me like that.

102
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,528
📱 I am for you

103
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,528
I just want to show my respects.

Well, let's meet once.

00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:05,825
I'll get some sushi too.

107
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:10,495
Please come to the office.

108
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,033
persistent pest

109
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:20,165

110
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:20,165
Things aren't going well in this industry.

Shinobi! Are you going?

115
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,759
of course

116
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,759
No, it's obvious...

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
It feels like a trap.

118
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,198

I can't do it with Shinobu-san.

Looks like I'll get a big job

141

...and the conditions for transfer are

142
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:40,792
By not having anything to do with Shinobu-san anymore.

143
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:45,693
So... So already...

144
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:55,198

150
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,924

154
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:32,759

I have been saved!

159
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:48,627

00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,858
What did you say?

192
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:55,122
Don't look at me like that

193
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:55,122
Here, thank you sushi, yes.

194
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:59,429
Well, you have a pretty good idea, right?

195
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:02,759
Sakura for you

196
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,660
I chose to walk away from you

197
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,891
It's a contract between us and Sakura.

198
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:11,089
Management of other companies

199
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:11,089
I shouldn't accept it

200
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,231
There are things that are prohibited.

201
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,330
If you violate this, there will be a penalty

202
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,462
To Shinobu-kun who managed

203
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,462
It happens.

204
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,561
10 million

205
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,297
No, no, no, but

206
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,297
Me too Sakura

207
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,264
It has been sold so far

208
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,264
To Shinobu-kun

209
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:33,495
How about I ask for a penalty fee?

210
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:33,495
It hurts me as a person.

211
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,693
That's why I told Sakura.

212
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,396
come back to my house

213
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,396
If you listen to what I say

214
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:43,023
I won't charge Shinobu-kun a penalty.

215
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:45,957
That's a lie, right?

216
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:49,594
Isn't that story about the penalty a lie?

217
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:54,198
There's no way such a contract exists!

218
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:54,198
It's so good!

219
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,924
Eh...

220
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,924
Great answer

221
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:03,330
As expected of Shinobu-kun

222
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:03,330
There is no such contract!

223
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,693
That's it...then

224
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,693
(Busujima) It's already~

225
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:10,462
Why is it so easy?

226
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:10,462
Will I be fooled?

227
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:15,363
Sakura-chan, maybe you're an idiot?

228
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:15,363
Yeah? Are you an idiot? Yeah?

229
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:18,089
Sakura-chan tricked me

230
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:18,089
put it in a major

231
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,561
Sakura-chan's work from a major company

232
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,561
What percentage will you receive?

233
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,792
Hahahaha...

234
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,122
on second thoughts

235
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:35,231
disappointment! big mistake

236
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:37,891
After all, you're an idiot.

237
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:41,858
Let me tell you the correct answer...

238
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:44,759
It's all a lie!

239
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,561
Thank you is a lie!

240
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:51,726
It's a lie that I'm transferring to a major company!

241
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:56,759
There is no such thing!

242
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:56,759
Ahahahaha...

243
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,693
Why is that so...

244
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,693
Hahahahaha...

245
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:10,594
Well...

246
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:14,089
Come out of jail

247
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,693
Like shit

248
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,693
When I'm forced to live

249
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:24,627
I was shocked when I found that...

250
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,858
That's when I thought

251
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:32,089
you guys in the toughest way

252
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,231
Let's take revenge!

253
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:40,660
Ha... So that's what I thought.

254
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,693
The bond between the two

255
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,693
At the deepest timing

256
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:49,528
In front of your eyes...

257
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,231
Sakura-chan, run away!

258
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,165
Hahahaha...

259
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:58,726
If it were you, I would definitely go with Sakura.

260
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:58,726
I thought you were coming to see me!

261
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:01,056
You emotionally persuaded Sakura.

262
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:02,924
This damn stupid woman

263
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:02,924
I'm touched by it

264
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:08,627
The bond between the two becomes even deeper

265
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:08,627
An emotional last look at each other!

266
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:13,056
From ~!

267
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:17,264
while you can't move

268
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:17,264
Stop it!

269
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,495
Look carefully

270
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,660
Stop it!

271
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,660
slowly

272
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,957
If you do more than this!

273
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:29,056
It's better not to!

274
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:29,056
For you too!

275
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:34,594
That's what you're good at

276
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:34,594
Is it because there is a recording strategy?

277
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:37,957
Hahahaha… Barka!

278
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:42,297
The same hand over and over again

279
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:42,297
There's no way I'd get caught.

280
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,297
but! but!

281
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,957
≪A little more≫

282
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,089
while I'm watching

283
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,089
What if I do something strange to Sakura-chan?

284
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,462
You'll get caught either way!

285
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,462
I don't care about that.

286
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,122
≪Just a little more! ≫

287
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,825
If I could take revenge on you

288
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,825
Whatever you want!

289
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,165
≪A little more

290
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,165
If only I could buy some time! ≫

291
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,891
《It feels like a trap》

292
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,957
"but

293
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,957
There's no reason not to go.

294
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:07,198
《So there's some way to help.

295
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:07,198
Could you think about it with me? 》

296
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,990
《Certainly like this

297
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,990
Even if you poke me, I think so too》

298
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,627
``But I definitely want to help!

299
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,627
No matter what happens, no matter what happens to me

300
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,990
"that's why…"

301
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,660
(Mio)《Then become a decoy》

302
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,396
《First of all, you will plunge in alone》

303
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:25,023
《Hide this smartphone

304
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:25,023
Make sure you can track it using GPS

305
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,023
《What if he does something?

306
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:31,693
we called the police

307
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:31,693
Be available to help

308
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:35,023
《You are the decoy.

309
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:35,023
It may be dangerous》

310
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,089
《What should I do? 》

311
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,792
≪Anything is fine, now I'm just buying time≫

312
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:44,726
that!

313
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:44,726
Are you buying time?

314
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:48,561
Hahahaha... That's okay.

315
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,825
you were hiding

316
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,825
Another smartphone before coming here

317
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,363
I threw it away~

318
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:58,957
(Yano) Okay... Okay.

319
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,660
(Yano) It's mine after all...

320
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:03,660
Eh, hey, hey, hey

321
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,056
Didn't this get discovered?

322
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,056
I found out. Isn't it obvious?

323
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,089
What about Nobu-nii?

324
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:09,089
I found out! I found out! I found out!

325
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,495
calm down!

326
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,165
I'll look for it

327
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:19,792
That's right, at the last minute

328
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:19,792
Something like coming to help

329
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:21,528
Hey!

330
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:24,792

Stop it!

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,056
It's been a long time...

336
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,759

00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:22,396
Huh?

380
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:27,462
Then from the beginning

381
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:27,462
Does that mean it was all a strategy?

382
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,297
It's about that pest.

383
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,792
Definitely Sakura-chan again

384
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,792
I thought I'd try my hand at it

385
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:34,858
I asked my friends to help me

386
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,363
Well then

387
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,363
Please say it sooner!

388
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:50,495
(mio)

389
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:50,495
If I say that, you'll come out with some weird shit, right?

390
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:52,198
Hey

391
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:52,198
(Laughs) There's no doubt about it

392
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:54,089
surely

393
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,264
But I'm really sorry.

394
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,264
Sakura-chan

395
00:17:57,264 --> 00:18:01,660
I have to catch him red-handed this time.

396
00:17:57,264 --> 00:18:01,660
I thought I couldn't throw you in jail.

397
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,396
Sorry for making you feel scared!

398
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:10,825
Thank you for your help.

399
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:10,825
thank you

400
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,396
Ah~!

401
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,726
I'm glad there's nothing

402
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:20,594
I can't go anywhere anymore

403
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:20,594
It won't work if you leave!

404
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:23,528
Well, I'm glad you're safe!

405
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,264
Hey Shinobu

406
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,264
Yeah

407
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,495
(Cheek) You haven't done anything!

408
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,495
Huh? I ran

409
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,396
I just ran!

410
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,396
Huh? I ran the fastest

411
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,891
I'll just leave Chico alone.

412
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,891
No, it's because it's late.

413
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,660
Ah! Sakura-chan's

414
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,660
I forgot about the cover party!

415
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,264
That's right, Sakura-chan

416
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,264
Let's go home early

417
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,297
Sorry Sakura-chan

418
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,297
Let's reorganize

419
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:45,396
Okay party

420
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:45,396
(spoken) party

421
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:06,089
that…

422
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:09,264
I thought you didn't say that.

423
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:24,825
If I didn't have Shinobu-san

424
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,429
If we hadn't met

425
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:32,363
I think I would have definitely given up gravure

426
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:36,330
It's hard and I hate it

427
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,221
But since he was Shinobu...

428
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,726
I have to be with Shinobu-san.

429
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,726
It's no good

430
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:56,495
I

431
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:56,495
I don't want to do this job

432
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:01,297
With Shinobu...

433
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:05,188
I want to dream with Shinobu-san

434
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:12,561
It's the same...

435
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,924
that's why…

436
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:24,561
Me too... same

437
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,363
me too…

438
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:36,396
About Shinobu...

439
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:41,297
I like it...

440
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,089
thank you

441
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:53,330
you're welcome

(2 people) Um...

445
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:26,891
Ah, from Shinobu-san.

446
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,495
After all, now...

447
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,627
That kind of relationship is

448
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,990
Maybe it's different

449
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:55,462
I was about to say the exact same thing

450
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:58,990
Ah, now...

451
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,726
It's enough that we feel the same way

452
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:09,660
It's the same

453
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:22,429
(Hide) Like Good

454
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:22,429
A smiling typhoon has arrived. The wind pressure is amazing.

455
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,627
Okay, that smile is amazing.

456
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,561
Yes, we decided to send it to the museum!

457
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,561
Like good

458
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:31,264
