00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:12,924
(shutter sound)

2
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:12,924
(Male) So cute

3
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:15,330
Ah, that's nice

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,132
Next pose please

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,132
(Sakura) Yes

6
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,330
thank you

7
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,330
It's unbearable

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,429
(Shinobu) ≪Wow, it’s real...≫

9
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,066
≪Ah~

10
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:28,066
What should I talk about...≫

11
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,693
≪Say something witty

12
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,693
I want you to remember...≫

13
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:35,363
(Staff) It's time.

14
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:35,363
thank you

15
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:37,891
Next person please

16
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,594
The next one?

17
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,627
Ah, eh, ah, yes!

18
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,627
Sorry!

19
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,000
thank you

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,033
≪Cute≫

21
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,825
Yeah?

22
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,825
Ah...

23
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:01,957
Ah, uh, sorry.

24
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:01,957
Um... wait a minute.

25
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:05,495
Huh?

26
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:05,495
Huh? Not for a while...

27
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:07,726
That cap...

28
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:12,858
Ahahaha... ah yes

29
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:12,858
thank you

30
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,462
≪So cute! ≫

31
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,759
That shooting...

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,132
Ah!

33
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:23,792
It's time

34
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:23,792
(shutter sound)

35
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,132
Eh, eh...

36
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,330
(Staff) Next person please

37
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,759
≪I want to disappear I want to disappear I want to disappear≫

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,495
≪Only “Ah” and “Excuse me”

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,495
I haven't said it, I want to disappear≫

40
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,396
(Male) Isn't he dangerous?

41
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:45,429
≪It sure looks dangerous≫

42
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,792
Do you have one eye?

43
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,792
It's too bad that I didn't take a single photo.

44
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:53,396
≪It was me, I want to disappear≫

45
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:01,363
No matter what I do, it really won't work

46
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:07,759
(Director)《Oi》

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,693
《No matter what you do, you can't do it.》

48
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:18,957
《After all, it's me...》

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,099
⚟📳

50
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,033
Yay... Part-time job...

51
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,165
Sakura-chan!

52
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:42,495
≪Eh, look here...≫

53
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,297
≪Maybe I remember...≫

54
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:52,066
That strange person is following me...

55
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,561
Eh...

56
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:00,495
I've been following you all the time...

57
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:03,198
≪That guy from earlier≫

58
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:13,099
it's okay

59
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,759
I'll be a little careful.

60
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:28,561
♬〜

61
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:32,363
Ah, that...

62
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:37,429
I'm scared

63
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:37,429
You should stop following me...

64
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,462
Huh? What do you mean? Huh?

65
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,462
I don't understand what it means.

66
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,132
No, really

67
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,132
It seems like he hates it...

68
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:44,198
It doesn't matter! Hey!

69
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:49,759
With me! Sakura's! Because it's a problem!

70
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,297
No, no, no, no

71
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,297
Please just stop for a moment

72
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:55,330
(Sunada) Come on! Come on

73
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:55,330
Let's stop it, okay?

74
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,924
Stop it!

75
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:01,792
(Sunada) What are you doing... Oh...

76
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,660
Hana... Go away!

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,957
Oh... don't touch anyone other than me!

78
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,825
What is it? you…

79
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,033
You liked my reply.

80
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,165
I'll be happy if you compliment my photo

81
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,165
"Thank you very much"...

82
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:18,957
≪No, no

83
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:18,957
He's a really bad guy...≫

84
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:24,858
Lick it, fuck it, fuck it

85
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:24,858
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

86
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,825
≪He's a really bad guy! ≫

87
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,429
Who is this?

88
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,429
Fool me!

89
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:32,660
Wow!

90
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,396
≪What should I do? Me≫

91
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:38,792
≪Run away?

92
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:38,792
But Sakura-chan≫

93
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,594
≪Die?

94
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,594
But Sakura-chan! ≫

95
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:44,165
(stinging sound)

96
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,363
≪Is this the end? ≫

97
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,594
≪Hahahaha…≫

98
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:58,297
≪If more

99
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:58,297
If you do what you want to do...

100
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:02,099
Good... ta...≫

101
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,462
(scream)

102
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,924
Yeah, it's no big deal.

103
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,759
Huh?

104
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,264
I'm glad it hit the belt.

105
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,561
That's fine

106
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:21,660
(Doctor) Take care

107
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:31,462
Wow, Oniden from my part-time job...

108
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,396
OK⁉

109
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,396
Eh?

110
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:38,264
Ah, eh, ah, eh!

111
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:38,264
Ah, not at all! It's totally fine!

112
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:42,726
Um, some kind of coincidence, a kitchen knife.

113
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:42,726
Looks like it hit my belt

114
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:47,198
I'm fine by chance

115
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:47,198
I'm really sorry for exaggerating

116
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:50,759
Exaggerating or something like that is my fault...

117
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:55,627
Good really

118
00:05:55,627 --> 00:06:00,099
Oh no, really not at all!

119
00:05:55,627 --> 00:06:00,099
It's totally fine!

120
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,693
Thank you Please allow me to express my gratitude!

121
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,660
Thank you...

122
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:17,924
No, no, no...

123
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:22,561
Ah, then coffee!

124
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:22,561
Even coffee

125
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:27,858
a while ago

126
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:27,858
Find Sakura's SNS

127
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:31,099
It looks like you're trying your best

128
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:31,099
I jerked off

129
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,330
Personal photo session

130
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,330
It was my first time.

131
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,528
I really don't know what to do

132
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,528
Well, that's it...

133
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,528
That's it!

134
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:44,561
I will always support you!

135
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,957
I don't understand what it means...

136
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:53,627
Sorry, that's creepy

137
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:58,858
It's different

138
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,660
I'm happy

139
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,429
but…

140
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:11,231
Actually, I'm thinking of quitting.

141
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:11,231
Thinking about gravure

142
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,330
I came in because I was really looking forward to it.

143
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,330
this world

144
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,660
But at weird drinking parties

145
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,660
just being made to go

146
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,957
I'm running out of money

147
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:27,891
Eh, but a photo session or something?

148
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:27,891
Quite a few people came

149
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,627
I don't get paid at all.

150
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:34,363
Part-time jobs are also prohibited.

151
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:40,099
I had used all my savings.

152
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:40,099
That's about to reach its limit...

153
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,957
a little bit

154
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,957
It's getting tiresome

155
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:50,759
I can't pay the rent

156
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:50,759
It comes around quite a bit.

157
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:58,759
After all, I...

158
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:04,297
《After all, it's me...》

159
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:10,660
Sakura-chan...

160
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,561
Do you want to do gravure?

161
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,627
I was longing for it

162
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,627
I don't have money, so I can't pay rent.

163
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,627
I don't want to quit though

164
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,627
If it feels like

165
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,858
You'll regret it, just like me.

166
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,858
What I want to do

167
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,858
I'm glad it finally happened...

168
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:27,858
Live the life you want before you die

169
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,099
To Sakura-chan

170
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,099
I don't want you to walk!

171
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:40,264
Oh, sorry, I said something strange.

172
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:40,264
the…

173
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,825
I'm so disgusted with myself

174
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,825
Sorry

175
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,462
I want to do it...

176
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:57,957
I want to do it!

177
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:03,429
Even like me, I can shine

178
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:03,429
I want to think!

179
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,132
Well then...

180
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:11,858
Would you like to live together?

181
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,231
Isn't it good? Yano please!

182
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:16,132
Well, there's plenty of room left.

183
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:20,891
Thank you, please

184
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:23,099
This is owned by Yano's relatives.

185
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,528
Cleaning and managing the house

186
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,528
I don't need rent

187
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:28,825
I also shared a room.

188
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,396
(Yano) Well, the gravure industry

189
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,396
I hear it's tough

190
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:37,495
When you are in trouble, we can help each other

191
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:37,495
No problem!

192
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,330
thank you!

193
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,132
(Yano) Itadakimasu!

194
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:53,429
(Yano) Delicious!

195
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,858
That's all there is to it

196
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:55,858
Because I can't

197
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,264
I'm glad it suited your taste.

198
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,033
But I made such a harsh decision

199
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,528
Sakura-chan

200
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,528
What do you want to do with gravure?

201
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:07,033
What...

202
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:13,363
I... I really want to

203
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:13,363
I want to be on the cover of a magazine

204
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,528
(Yano) Huh? A weekly magazine?

205
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,528
yes!

206
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,000
When I saw gravure for the first time

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,660
Bright and cute

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,660
I felt very well.

209
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,264
I want to be like that too

210
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,792
(Yano) But Sakura-chan

211
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:31,792
I don't use SNS much.

212
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,858
I have to work hard now, okay?

213
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:34,858
yes

214
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:38,363
Be proactive in your office as well.

215
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:38,363
That's what I've been told

216
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,528
I can't do it very well...

217
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:43,726
Yeah then

218
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:43,726
I'll take a photo.

219
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,660
Huh?

220
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm a cameraman

221
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,264
The camera this guy had yesterday was mine.

222
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,264
You're a cameraman's assistant.

223
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,726
Ah, but if you could take a picture

224
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,726
Yeah!

225
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:55,198
Okay then...

226
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:58,297
Change your swimsuit

227
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,759
Ah okay okay

228
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,759
Hmm, nice

229
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,561
Okay, then I'll stop by next time.

230
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,099
Okay, ah~ nice, nice

231
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,198
Yeah cute cute cute

232
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,231
Okay, try to get some sleep.

233
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,495
So let's try this

234
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:27,495
(Yano) Ah, sorry.

235
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:27,495
A lot came out

236
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,693
Ah, then below too.

237
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,759
(Yano) It's a sunscreen.

238
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,759
Because you have to balance it

239
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:45,396
Hey, what are you doing!

240
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,660
That's right, this is how you paint the scene.

241
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,660
That's a video!

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Are you painting it?

243
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
Maybe it's the female staff.

244
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,099
My hands look like a woman's

245
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,099
That's often said.

246
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,594
Where is it?

247
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,594
That's not the problem.

248
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:58,264
it's okay

Ah, good morning

291
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:49,198
What, did you clean it?

292
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:49,198
yes!

293
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:51,660

I will try my best at gravure!

Ah, right away...

302
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,429
(Yano) Photo session?

303
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,429
yes

304
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,825
From the manager

305
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,825
I have been contacted

306
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:32,495
It's decided tomorrow, so come.

307
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:32,495
Forcibly screwed it in

(Yano)

309
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:35,726
Hey, it was decided so suddenly.

310
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,660
Hey, it's a pretty big event.

311
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,660
That's right

312
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,594
So somehow

313
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,594
It seems like there aren't enough staff.

314
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:44,594
Is there anyone good?

315
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:48,023
(Yano) Ah~ I'm here.

316
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:48,023
Huh?

317
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:53,099
Shinobu: You got fired from your part-time job, right?

318
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:53,099
Ou

319
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:56,264
Yeah

320
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:56,264
Huh?

321

Lunch box if you like

329
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:41,099
Ah, then I'll take this.

330
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:41,099
Yes yes

Mr. Aisaka, nice to meet you.

339
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,825
Hmm, so cute!

340
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:04,594
Look at photos on SNS

341
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:04,594
I thought it was so gorgeous

342
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,396
at today's event

343
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,396
It's the most beautiful!

344
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:11,627
No, that's it...

345
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:11,627
I don't want to lose either.

346
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:14,297
Ah, lunch box, me too.

347
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:17,264
Ah yes here it is

348
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:17,264
(Mio) Thank you

349
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:20,429
Ah~ Over there

350
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:20,429
Can I have it brought to you?

351
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:23,825
Ah, I understand

352
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:27,990
Sakura-chan see you soon

353
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:27,990
Ah yes!

354
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:39,264
Huh~

355
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,957
(Mio) Sakura-chan's

356
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,957
Are you from the office?

357
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:46,165
Ah, no

358
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:46,165
(Mio) So, your boyfriend?

359
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,726
Eh, no, that's not true!

360
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:52,627
(Mio) Hmmm

361
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:57,056
please

362
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:57,056
Ah, excuse me

363
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:01,264
Ah~

364
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:01,264
It was a separate waiting room.

365
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:06,231
Huh?

366
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:06,231
(Mio) I'm giving you some advice~

367
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:12,264
Sakura-chan current office

368
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:12,264
It's better to stop

369
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:16,396
Because I haven't heard any good rumors.

370
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:16,396
Pinhane is terrible

371
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,759
Daddy life? Something like

372
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,759
Are you forced to do it?

373
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,726
Maybe they don't get paid?

374
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,726
I was told that I couldn't get a part-time job.

375
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:27,825
It's not normal.

376
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,726
(mio)

377
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,726
It could be worse.

378
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:37,023
What, for example?

379
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:41,363
For example, something like this happens...

380
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:43,363
Hey!

381
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:47,429
Things like this have happened too.

382
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:47,429
Maybe it will happen?

383
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,023
Wait!

384
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,023
(Mio) Ah~

385
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:55,363
To many men

386
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:55,363
Because I was looked at with lewd eyes

387
00:18:55,363 --> 00:19:01,023
My body is hot~

388
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:04,924
Hey, let's do it.

389
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,627
Huh, ah, ah...

390
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:12,429
Hey, touch Mio too

391
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:16,693
Oh no no...

392
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:16,693
But!

393
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:20,429
quick!

394
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,594
Ha ha...

395
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,363
⚟Aisaka-san, are you there? ⚞

396
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:28,132
yes!

397
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,891
After this

398
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,891
I have plans for the afternoon...

399
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:41,396
what? what? What was it?

400
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:41,396
Were you made fun of?

401
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:44,198
Shinobu-san

402
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:44,198
Well… Sakura-chan!

403
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,858
Huh, your face is bright red.

404
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,858
OK?

405
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,891
No... it's okay...

406
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:52,594
(Dokujima) Ou Sakura

407
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:52,594
Ah, Mr. Busujima, thank you for your hard work.

408
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:55,363
Thank you for your hard work

409
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:55,363
SNS looks great, doesn't it?

410
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:58,528
Keep up the good work

411
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:58,528
yes! I will do my best

412
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:02,231
Ah Shinobu-san

413
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:02,231
This is Mr. Busujima, the manager.

414
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:04,297
Oh, it's Shinobu Sumida.

415
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,023
Oh, you? That SNS?

416
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,023
Are you helping me?

417
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,132
Ah yes

418
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,132
(Busujima) Ah, thank you.

419
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:11,132
yes

420
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:31,297
(thunder)

421
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,023
(Busujima) Yeah, my Sakura Katsuragi.

422
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,891
I wish I had more followers

423
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,891
I'll put out an AV, so yeah.

424
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:41,363
Some interesting project

425
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:41,363
Just think about it, yes, yes.

426
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:43,924
Yes, Yoroku-chan, yes.

427
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,825
Ah, uh... what we're talking about...

428
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:57,297
Ah~ did you hear that?

429
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,627
Yes, ah, no, uh...

430
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,726
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

431
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,726
Yes now...

432
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:06,023
No no, that's it, yeah yeah

433
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:06,023
That's that, that's bad

434
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,792
(sound of hitting)

435
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,792
Ah!

436
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,056
(coughing)

437
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:14,363
Hey Sakura

438
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:14,363
Don't say anything stupid.

439
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:17,155
Not for business

440
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:17,155
That's all there is to making arrangements.

441
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,330
Do you understand?

442
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,792
What is business...

443
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,330
ban part-time jobs

444
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,330
Even though I haven't even paid my salary!

445
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,363
(Busujima) Amateur is rattled

446
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,363
Don't interfere

447
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,396
Because of my part-time job

448
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,396
If you miss your chance

449
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,396
What should I do?

450
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:34,396
We won't abandon you

451
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:38,924
A job that pays well

452
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:38,924
I prepared it!

453
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,594
That's AV!

454
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:44,528
Even AV

455
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:44,528
Isn't that a great job!

456
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:48,155
Discrimination is not good, me-chan.

457
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:53,858
Right now, after I made her a gravure idol.

458
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:53,858
Doing AV sells better.

459
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:57,858
(thunder)

460
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,891
Sakura-chan...

461
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:03,528
《I will try my best in gravure!

462
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:03,528
Don't give up》

463
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:06,561
《I really want to be on the cover of a magazine.

464
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:06,561
I want to be like that.》

465
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:11,726
《I can shine even like this

466
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:11,726
I want to think! 》

467
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,693
Sakura-chan is

468
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,693
I want to do gravure!

469
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:19,627
(Busujima) Ah? so what?

470
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:24,330
What is the world of adults?

471
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:24,330
Adults are thinking about it.

472
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,396
Get out of here, kid.

473
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,561
What should I do?

474
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,561
Can you continue doing gravure?

475
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:33,155
Good discipline

476
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:37,363
Well, about Mio Aisaka?

477
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:37,363
I wish I had around 500,000 followers

478
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:42,122
Well, 500,000

479
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:42,122
It's easily on the level of a magazine cover.

480
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:45,858
I'll do it

481
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:45,858
I'll show you 500,000 followers

482
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:49,891
Huh? It was decided that it was impossible.

483
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:49,891
You're seriously a kid, temeha

484
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,089
I'll do it!

485
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:57,891
I

486
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:57,891
I will make Sakura-chan famous!

487
00:22:57,891 --> 00:23:03,089
Sakura-chan

488
00:22:57,891 --> 00:23:03,089
I'll show it on the cover of a magazine!

489
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:08,089
That's great. If you can do it, try it.

490
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:12,561
However, the deadline is one month.

491
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:18,660
Because it didn't cost 500,000

492
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:18,660
Immediately AV.

493
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,363
Just do your best, me-chan.

494
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:28,264
Hey, that looks interesting
