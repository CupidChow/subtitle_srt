1
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,165
Nobu-nii~!

2
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,330
That you live with a girl

3
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,330
I haven't heard it though

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,000
Chico will also live together!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,396
(Shinobu) From a magazine person to Sakura-chan

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,396
I'm getting a photo shoot request!

7
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,825
(Mio) Sakura-chan

8
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,825
Whether you can make your dreams come true

9
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,924
Depends on the manager

10
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:24,891
Me, Sakura-chan's manager

11
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:24,891
Could you please let me do it?

12
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,528
(cherry blossoms)

13
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,528
Thank you very much!

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
(Male) I'll take a test.

15
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
(shutter sound)

16
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,792
Wow, that's amazing

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,660
There's such a history

18
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,660
(Watanabe) Hello, I'm Watanabe, the editor.

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,858
Chico-chan

20
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,858
Thank you for this time

21
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:41,627
home~

22
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:44,000
This is Sakura Kuzuki.

23
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:44,000
thank you

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,363
Ma... Um!

25
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:49,429
This is Sumida, the manager.

26
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:49,429
thank you

27
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,957
Sakura Kuzuki

28
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,957
thank you

29
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:54,660
thank you

30
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:10,264
♬〜

31
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:14,297
(Male) Cute Yeah

32
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:14,297
Ah, that's nice, yeah

33
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:17,495
Yes, that's fine, yes.

34
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:17,495
(shutter sound)

35
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:24,165
(Watanabe) Are you nervous?

36
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:24,165
What, ah...

37
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:28,363
A professional shooting site

38
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:28,363
Because it's my first time

39
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,396
No, why

40
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,396
You're saying I'm nervous.

41
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,099
Sorry for being inexperienced

42
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,594
What an experience

43
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,594
All you have to do is step on the scene

44
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,396
The important thing is passion for the talent.

45
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,165
yes

46
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,198
she is

47
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,198
Enough to grace the cover of a magazine

48
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:46,858
Become a gravure idol

49
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:46,858
I support

50
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,528
Sakura-chan cute

51
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:51,594
(Watanabe)

52
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:51,594
Is Chico-chan not interested in gravure?

53
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:54,660
Yeah

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,792
especially

55
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,528
(male)

56
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,528
Well then, please bring your hands on.

57
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,528
Yes, there will be a nipple check.

58
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,264
Ah...

59
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,561
(woman)

60
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,561
Ah... you can see it a little bit.

61
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,627
Ah, sorry

62
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,627
(Female) Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

63
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:16,726
A beauty pageant...?

64
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:20,429
(Watanabe)

65
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:20,429
Yeah, it's called Miss Frank every year.

66
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:20,429
Hold a beauty pageant

67
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:22,132
Through today's shoot

68
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:26,264
Please come to Sakura-chan

69
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:26,264
I thought you would like to participate

70
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,363
For those who won the Grand Prix

71
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:31,693
the cover of my magazine

72
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:31,693
I'll have it decorated

73
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,132
(Watanabe)

74
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,132
Would you like to go and achieve your goals?

75
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,396
good morning

76
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,396
(spoken) Good morning

77
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,594
Ah, Mr. Watanabe

78
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,594
good morning

79
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,264
(Watanabe) Ah, good morning.

80
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:49,528
Yeah, it was just right

81
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:49,528
Let me introduce you

82
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,792
girlfriend 3 years ago

83
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:52,792
Won Miss Frank Grand Prix

84
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,924
Saori Hanada

85
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,165
Nice to meet you.

86
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,165
This is Sakura Kuzuki!

87
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:00,528
I'm watching gravure

88
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,198
(Watanabe) Today at the end of the issue

89
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:06,396
Ah, maybe

90
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:06,396
Do you feel like you can appear as Miss Frank?

91
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,957
Are you free now? office

92
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:12,033
Ah... yes

93
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:16,000
Well then, Mishra may be a good idea.

94
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:16,000
I was also free

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,891
Free is definitely

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,891
Because I'm at a disadvantage in many jobs.

97
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:21,825
We will lose to the big players

98
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:21,825
Is that so?

99
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:24,594
(Watanabe) Well, that aspect too.

100
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:24,594
I can't deny it

101
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:30,363
But this contest is about the size of the office.

102
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:30,363
It doesn't matter if it's free

103
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:35,231
If you win the grand prize, go to a convenience store or something.

104
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:35,231
There are magazines with me on the cover

105
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:39,594
Will there be more jobs and the world will change?

106
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:44,066
Now Saori too

107
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:44,066
I'm working at a major firm.

108
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:48,297
Join a major company and do a big job

109
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:48,297
It's rewarding and fun

110
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:53,858
To the sparkling place that was a dream

111
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:53,858
It feels like it's standing up... maybe?

112
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:58,363
Decorating that cover

113
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:58,363
How do you feel?

114
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,528
Ah hmmm

115
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:05,891
After all, while doing gravure

116
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:05,891
The best part

117
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,825
At the convenience store I usually go to.

118
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,825
When I see a magazine with me on the cover

119
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:12,165
I'm a little nervous

120
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:17,132
stand out a little

121
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:17,132
I ended up rearranging them and things like that.

122
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:32,165
♬〜

123
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,099
What do you want to do? Miss Frank's story

124
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,264
when I first heard the story

125
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:45,561
Grand Prix for me

126
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:45,561
I was thinking

127
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:50,528
But...

128
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:50,528
Yeah

129
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:56,528
I want to appear in Miss Frank!

130
00:04:56,528 --> 00:05:00,528
Yeah! Let's do our best together

131
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:03,363
yes!

132
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:07,594
Why did you decide to come out?

133
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:07,594
Is it because you can aim for the cover?

134
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:13,165
in front

135
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:13,165
The story of the first time I saw gravure

136
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:15,594
Yeah I heard

137
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:20,891
I want to be on the cover too

138
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:20,891
The cover when I first thought of it

139
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,891
My name is Saori.

140
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:26,396
Eh~ Did we meet today?

141
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:33,132
me at that time

142
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:33,132
When I saw the gravure cover for the first time

143
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:38,231
Just in high school...

144
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,792
I was being bullied, right?

145
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,693
Eh...

146
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:45,924
It was because I had a hard time at the sports festival.

147
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:49,825
No, not anymore

148
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:49,825
It's been a long time since I've been unable to do anything.

149
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:54,528
Disgusted with yourself? Is that what you mean?

150
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:59,693
I thought I was already like this.

151
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:59,693
I started crying

152
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,033
At times like that...

153
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:06,759
It's so cute

154
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:06,759
Look at me smiling cheerfully

155
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,924
I simply felt very energized.

156
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:15,462
I thought there was a world like this

157
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:22,000
I met Saori today.

158
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:22,000
I clearly remember that time

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,825
I'm like Saori too

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,825
I wish I could get used to you even a little bit

161
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:38,033
Definitely win the Grand Prix

162
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:38,033
Aim for the cover!

163
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:42,363
I will do my best!

164
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:42,363
Yeah

165
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,825
Won the grand prize and graced the cover

166
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,429
Like Saori

167
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,429
belong to a major company

168
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:50,363
Lots of big work!

169
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:50,363
Hey!

170
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,825
Huh?

171
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:52,825
See, you said that.

172
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:56,231
If you are free, you will lose to the big companies.

173
00:06:56,231 --> 00:07:01,726
That's why I won the Grand Prix

174
00:06:56,231 --> 00:07:01,726
Step up to the big leagues!

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,693
(Chiko) Sakura-chan

176
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,231
Yeah?

177
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,231
I'm hungry

178
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,396
Ah yes

179
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:16,957
Thanks to Chico-chan

180
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:16,957
Because I got Miss Frank's chance.

181
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:19,957
I'll do my best to make it

182
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:29,033
♬〜

183
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,429
(Watanabe) Because we are small in scale.

184
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:36,198
Up to 10 people or less in the editorial department

185
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:36,198
Narrow down the number of people

186
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:39,000
From there it will be the final

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,825
How to select the Grand Prix

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,825
First online photo vote

189
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:46,495
I'll take a digital photo book next.

190
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:46,495
its sales

191
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:51,528
Finally, the largest

192
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:51,528

00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,297
advice

383
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:16,373
📱You can choose the person here, right?

384
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:16,373
Yes, as long as you pay the cost

385
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:20,099
Then that person is the only one, right?

386
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,670
Mio-san, please stand by.

387
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,670
yes

388
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,967
Sorry, I have to go.

389
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,967
I'll keep you in touch.

390
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,340
Sorry if I'm busy!

391
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,340
thank you very much!

392
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,505
📱Yes

393
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:38,769
That person?

394
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,670
(shutter sound)

395
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,670
Ah okay

396
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,604
Okay Sakura-chan next

397
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,604
Shall we jump?

398
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:53,373
Like, like, jump, jump

399
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,571
This way, this way, this way

400
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:57,868
Okay, nice

401
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:57,868
Yes, jump, jump

402
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:01,033
Yes OK!

403
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:05,934
Sakura-chan Sakura-chan

404
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:05,934
Now you can put on a nice face.

405
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:07,934
thank you

406
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:09,637
Look, like this

407
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:29,637
♬〜

408
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:48,297
♬〜

409
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:51,505
That feeling is good, yes, good

410
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:51,505
Yes more...

411
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:55,033
≪It's kind of amazing≫

412
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:58,297
≪You're a professional≫

413
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:03,736
≪Okay, take lots of off-shots.

414
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:03,736
Lots of promotion! ≫

415
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,538
Hide-san is amazing after all~

416
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,538
You were in a good mood today too.

417
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,604
It was fun

418
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:10,604
Ah, that's good

419
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:15,033
Well then, I think it's cold.

420
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:15,033
take a good rest

421
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,099
yes

422
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:31,703
Chico-chan

423
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,340
Ah

424
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:45,023
Is Chico-chan also taking pictures today?

425
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:50,089
Yeah

426
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,627
It was cold, wasn't it?

427
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,759
Yeah

428
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:12,056
Chico-chan photo voting

429
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:12,056
It's definitely number one. That's amazing.

430
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:16,627
thank you…

431
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,495
Sakura-chan hasa

432
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:30,429
My participation in Miss Frank

433
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,627
What do you think?

434
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:39,858
I don't know what to say

435
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:43,396
I'm Miss Frank

436
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:43,396
What's out is

437
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,089
It's all thanks to Chico-chan...

438
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:56,221
But I'm sorry if I'm wrong

439
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:03,089
The reason why Chico-chan appeared

440
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,495
Is it because you want Shinobu-san to see more?

441
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:19,924
If what Chico-chan is looking for is

442
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:19,924
If so...

443
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:26,825
I might not be able to lose that battle either.

444
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:34,297
♬〜

445
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,759
Where you want it!

446
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,792
Because I will never lose!

447
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:46,429
Sakura-chan

448
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:46,429
Sakura-chan Sakura-chan look

449
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:48,693
Achieved 10,000 buzz!

450
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,660
Yay!

451
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,957
Ah...

452
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,957
A lot of people are coming!

453
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,891
Okay

454
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:03,462
Definitely win the Grand Prix!

455
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:06,429
Yaho Chico!

456
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:13,858
on second thoughts

457
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:13,858
What interests me most this time is

458
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:16,264
It's this kid

459
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:21,825
I guess it's about time

460
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:26,056
Ah~ I feel so young

461
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,264
I can't help it!
