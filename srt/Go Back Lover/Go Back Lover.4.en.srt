(2013)

4
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,510
It's said that Wang Youfu
will set the question paper

5
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,980
for our entrance exam again.

6
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,590
This is bad. I'll fail again.

7
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,540
It's not like you'll pass

8
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,990
even if the paper
is set by another person.

9
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,590
You are right.
But it's different this time.

10
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,390
We have a straight-A student this time.

11
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,700
I heard that Shen Xingruo
came top in Huize.

12
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,870
Just you watch. With my charm,

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,820
I'll convince her
to give me the answers.

14
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,820
Beautiful lady, well...

15
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm studying. Go away.

16
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,180
Okay.

17
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,100
You are in my way.

18
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,790
You are the new transfer student, right?

19
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,730
Why did you transfer here
out of the blue?

20
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,300
Were you bullied?

21
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,130
If you were, you can tell me about it.

22
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,020
I can help you.

23
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,820
Shut up.

24
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,750
You have quite the temper.

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,230
You are my cup of tea.

26
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,510
What do you think?

27
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,470
Do you want to be my friend?

28
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,190
Don't talk if you can't speak.

29
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,420
If you want some attention,

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,190
I can call the teacher for you.

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,470
Call the teacher?

32
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,230
Let's see if you want.

33
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,670
Who are you to act tough?

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,950
This is none of your business.

35
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,070
I want to sleep now.

36
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,020
If you make noise again,

37
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,470
don't blame me for being rude.

38
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,700
What's going on?

39
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,980
Do you know Shen Xingruo?

40
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,630
No.

41
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,300
The exam will start soon.

42
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,850
Put everything that's unrelated
to the exam on the lectern in front.

43
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,980
Go back to your seats.

44
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,630
No need to thank me.

45
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,120
It's just a daily act of kindness.

(Best Buddies)

47
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,130
(2024)

48
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,220
Have you really told Xingruo the truth

49
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,550
about the resort?

50
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,990
What do you mean?

51
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,510
The Sun Inn you represent

52
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,310
signed a capital increase
side agreement with Kangte Group.

53
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,700
According to the agreement,

54
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,820
within the three years
after the agreement comes into effect,

55
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,190
the inn has to make an annual profit
of no less than five million,

56
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,140
eight million, and ten million.

57
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,990
The financial reports
of the previous two years showed

58
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,630
a 30% loss.

59
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,750
It's the third year now.

60
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,630
The fourth quarter hasn't started.

61
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,110
Be patient.

62
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,550
Although our occupancy rate
in the first three quarters

63
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,580
did not meet the target,

64
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,750
But our cash and cash equivalents

65
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,070
continue to flourish.

66
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,340
Based on the new side agreement
we signed,

67
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,580
we've fulfilled Kangte's requirements.

68
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,550
You are more mature now
compared to the time

69
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,650
when you were with Xingruo.

70
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,660
Looks like both of you share everything

71
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,950
with each other.

72
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,020
Of course.

73
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,140
Because you are history.

74
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,550
We are so close to each other.

75
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,730
Of course we tell each other everything.

76
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,390
After you broke up with her,

77
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,950
I'm the one who has
always been by her side.

78
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,070
I'm not history.

79
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,210
The collaboration
between Shen Xingruo and I

80
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,950
is in the present.

81
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,820
If Xingruo doesn't agree
to collaborate with you,

82
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,550
there'll be no collaboration.

83
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
It's not

84
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,190
up to us to decide.

85
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,390
It depends on her.

86
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,550
Right?

87
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,950
Another thing.

88
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,990
Ms. Shen's surname is Shen.

89
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,390
Don't keep calling her Xingruo.

90
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,140
What took you so long?

91
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,950
I was on a call to handle something.

92
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,390
Actually, I've prepared

93
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,220
a surprise for you today.

94
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,110
But I couldn't find the chance

95
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,310
to tell you about it?

96
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,310
What is it?

97
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,820
I contacted the TV show director

98
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,310
who you've been so eager to work with.

99
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,750
He's very interested in your project.

100
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,310
And the few companies I know

101
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,460
want to invest in it too.

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,820
They even offer

103
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,430
to increase the budget of the show.

104
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,550
We have enough budget

105
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,220
to film it in Germany.

106
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,260
You can bring your own team there.

107
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,020
As for the couples,

108
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,950
they don't have to be local couples.

109
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,020
You can choose your own

110
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,780
guests as well.

111
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,460
Are you telling the truth?

112
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,550
Of course.

113
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,260
When have I ever lied to you?

114
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,580
Think about it.

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,930
Give me an answer
when you've thought it through.

116
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,140
Let's eat.

117
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,340
Let's eat.

118
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,990
Thank you.

119
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,540
Xingruo,

120
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,420
what's wrong?

121
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,230
Are you unhappy?

122
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,180
Didn't I tell you

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,420
not to mention the past?

124
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm afraid that he'll hurt you again.

125
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,060
What rights do you have

126
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,350
to think that he'll hurt me again?

127
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,230
So much time has passed.

128
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,830
If you keep talking about it,

129
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,830
you'll make it awkward for everyone.
Understand?

130
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,990
Fine. I was wrong.

131
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,630
I didn't take your feelings
into considerations.

132
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,390
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,540
But I really hope
that you can think about my suggestion.

134
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,870
Doing a show is all about business.

135
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,390
You are not fighting alone.

136
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,140
You have a team to take care of.

137
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,940
I'm sure you know what choice

138
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,110
you should make

139
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,900
and what's the best
for you and your team.

140
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,590
What's wrong? Are you upset?

141
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:22,900
No.

142
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,750
Stop acting tough.

143
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,780
Are you worried that Shen Xingruo
will accept Yu Si's proposal?

144
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,020
Why should I?

145
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,420
Yu Si has offered her
such lucrative prospects.

146
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,110
If I were Shen Xingruo,

147
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,000
I would choose the other party too.

148
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,750
Don't you want to try fighting for it?

149
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,390
I don't want to blur the line

150
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,780
between love and career.

151
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,110
In the past, I forced her to do things
in the name of love.

152
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,140
So now,

153
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,870
no matter what choice she makes,

154
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,350
I'll respect her decision.

155
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,260
I suddenly feel

156
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,630
like my child has grown up.

157
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,230
Don't take advantage of me.

158
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,420
I know it well.

159
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,110
You know it well.

160
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,730
But you are still in such a bad mood.

161
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,140
You make me worry about you.

162
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,750
Stop it.

163
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,110
What is it?

164
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,830
I'm just concerned about you.

165
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,870
I'm fine. You can leave now.

166
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,260
Wait.

167
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,750
You keep pacing in the office.

168
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,390
The soles of your feet will catch fire.

169
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,180
This place is luxuriously decorated.

170
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,750
I don't want you to burn the place down.

171
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,750
Shen Xingruo promised
to be here at nine that day.

172
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,420
It's past nine now.

173
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,750
Has she really chosen Yu Si?

174
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,350
No matter who she chooses,

175
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,260
she will give me an answer in person.

176
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,470
Why can't you give up?

177
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,180
I...

178
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,300
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,780
I was stuck in traffic.

180
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,120
You must be waiting for a long time.

181
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,420
It's okay.

182
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,630
Who will you choose

183
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,870
to be your investor?

184
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,140
The Double-Star Team is so popular now.

185
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,750
There's no reason for us
not to take advantage of that.

186
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,470
You are indeed a professional producer.

187
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,300
Please have a seat.

188
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,230
Mr. Xu, are you going to join us too?

189
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,230
As the company's...

190
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,020
Are you done with your work?

191
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,590
Isn't it tiring for you
to squat like this?

192
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,420
I better get back to work.

193
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,470
I'll leave you to it.

194
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,060
Thank you.

195
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,870
Let's start.

196
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,660
Okay.

197
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
I'm here today

198
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,420
to talk about the detailed planning

199
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,780
of the program.

200
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm curious.

201
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,260
Why did you choose me?

202
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,990
Actually, when it comes to many things,

203
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,990
a higher price doesn't mean

204
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,260
that something will be better.

205
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
I've contacted Yu Si's company as well.

206
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,990
But I realized

207
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,140
that it'll take a long time

208
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,630
to build up trust between us.

209
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,660
So,

210
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,420
I still want to work
with someone I'm familiar with.

211
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
After so many years,

212
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,060
no matter what
the relationship between us is,

213
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,060
we trust each other the most.

214
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,540
I don't betray your trust.

215
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,830
And I won't let
your investment go to waste.

216
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,260
Today,

217
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,830
we are business partners
we trust each other the most.

218
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,230
I hope that we can
have a great collaboration.

219
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,470
I'll send you the detailed schedule
of the show

220
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,420
and the publicity proposal
for the resort later.

221
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,990
Okay.

222
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,940
Actually, I'm here today
to discuss the issue

223
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,630
of our invited guests for the show.

224
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,420
We have quite an array
of candidates to choose from.

225
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,630
But I think we lack
a topic of discussion.

226
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,470
If we have a divorced couple
as our guests,

227
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,470
will that create a topic of discussion

228
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,830
for the show?

229
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,660
I think we are thinking

230
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,300
about the same candidates.

231
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,900
You said that we could
still be friends after the divorce.

232
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,750
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

233
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,180
Who is it?

234
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,710
Me.

235
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,900
Why are you still awake?

236
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,870
Why are you here?

237
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,060
You've been working so hard

238
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
for the resort lately.

239
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,020
So, I'm here to comfort you.

240
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,430
Looks like you still have a conscience.

241
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,900
I have more than a conscience.

242
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,300
Recently,

243
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,140
many new skins
have been launched, right?

244
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,750
I remember that smile.

245
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,540
Last time, I lost six million
because of you.

246
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,470
What are you trying to do this time?

247
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,060
Do you want

248
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,140
to participate

249
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,030
in Go Back Lover?

250
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,700
You want to invite me?

251
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,070
With who? Xu Chengzhou?

252
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,460
Do you have other ex-lovers?

253
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,500
He's not an ex-lover.

254
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,030
He's an ex-husband.

255
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,110
Besides, I can't believe
that you would want

256
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,490
to invite both of us to your show.

257
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,500
I've just become single for a few days.

258
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,230
And you want me to enter
the grave of love again?

259
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,070
No. That's not what I'm saying.

260
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,630
Don't think that all separated couples

261
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,350
are like your Double-Star Team.

262
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,070
After your separation,

263
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,130
the two of you still work together
to create a super topic

264
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,900
and mourn for your lost love

265
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,980
from time to time.

266
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,830
The divorce between

267
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,270
Chen Zhu and I

268
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,110
is clean with no strings attached.

269
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,660
Do you think

270
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,110
I'll go back to him?

271
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,350
I'm not spineless.

272
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,830
I'll say goodbye
and look for the next man.

273
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
Actually, I'm here today

274
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,270
because Xu Chengzhou asked me to.

275
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,220
What did he say?

276
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,310
He said he realized that he was wrong.

277
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,630
She was always acting like a princess

278
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,070
and got mad at you.

279
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,930
But after being away from you,
she realized

280
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,700
how important you were to her.

281
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,310
Continue. Anything else?

282
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,180
She said

283
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,700
that in this world, other than you,

284
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,350
no one would be able to tolerate her.

285
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,030
That's right.

286
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,030
He also vowed

287
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,830
that from today onward,

288
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,030
you'd be the most important person
to him in this entire world.

289
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,660
His friends and games

290
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,030
wouldn't matter anymore.

291
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,700
He said that he would love you forever.

292
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,310
He would love you even if you turned

293
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
into a desk lamp.

294
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,660
But there's something
I don't understand.

295
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,870
What did he mean about the desk lamp?

296
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,940
That day, I came home from work.

297
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,350
I was exhausted

298
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,900
from working the whole day.

299
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,500
And I saw her

300
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,900
wiping off her tears secretly.

301
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,740
I thought something bad had happened.

302
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,030
But what did she say?

303
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,310
She kept asking me

304
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,830
if I would still love her
if she turned into a desk lamp.

305
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,310
Doesn't he know
how sensitive and fragile

306
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,630
a woman's mind is?

307
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,420
Who else could I ask

308
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,700
other than him?

309
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,460
I understand. You have my support.

310
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,270
So,

311
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,140
do you want to be my show's guest?

312
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,310
Since she has sincerely begged me
for my forgiveness.

313
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,390
I'll be kind and
give him another chance.

314
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,660
Let me experience a big change for once.

315
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,660
But let me warn you in advance.

316
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,900
If he let me down.

317
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,630
I will leave the show.

318
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
- Okay.
- Okay.

319
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,600
(Lu Xingyan)
(Tell her)

320
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,030
(that even if she becomes a desk lamp,)

321
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,180
(Xu Chengzhou will still love her.)

322
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,910
(Shen Xingruo)
(Done.)

323
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,340
(Lu Xingyan)
(Okay.)

324
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,630
I gave it another thought yesterday.

325
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,310
I think there's someone else
who's suitable for the show.

326
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,220
Who?

327
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,290
(Sun Inn)

328
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,070
(He Siyue's Personal Information)

329
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,500
Isn't he our class representative
during high school,

330
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,590
He Siyue?

331
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,590
Yes.

332
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,140
He's managing a public account

333
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,390
about popular science.

334
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
He has amassed quite a lot of fans.

335
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,270
He published a book lately

336
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,500
and the reviews are great.

337
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,740
I've been keeping in touch with him.

338
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,390
If you think he's suitable,

339
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,130
I'll invite him as soon as possible.

340
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,700
Indeed.

341
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,700
His career

342
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,940
is way different from us.

343
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,550
We can have a guest
from a totally different world.

344
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,350
He's better than those candidates
I've listed out.

345
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,630
Thank you

346
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,660
for doing so much
to find the perfect guests.

347
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
We agreed

348
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,110
to be business partners
who trust each other, right?

349
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,030
The success of your show

350
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,940
will benefit our resort too.

351
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,500
So, just tell me if you need anything.

352
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,110
If you say that,

353
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,590
I won't be shy with you.

354
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,350
Here.

355
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,460
Note these down.

356
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,180
Send this information to my e-mail
as soon as possible

357
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,350
together with his personal information.

358
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,740
I want his photo

359
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,110
and a video of him.

360
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,500
I'll go back and propose this
to Zhang Xu.

361
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,220
Hurry up and contact He Siyue.

362
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,350
I'll wait for your good news.

363
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,220
Who's working for who?

364
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,830
(He Siyue's Personal Information)
Lu Xingyan, Xu Chengzhou, Chen Zhu,

365
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,500
and He Siyue.

366
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,550
You were classmates and
they were each other's exes.

367
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,030
Isn't the scope too small?

368
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,140
They will think
that this show is scripted.

369
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,030
Actually, I've thought about it.

370
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,140
I think if we can get He Siyue to agree,

371
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,310
we can consider

372
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,220
adjusting

373
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,740
the theme of the show.

374
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,310
We don't have to focus

375
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,700
on exes only.

376
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,180
It can become a romance variety show
between acquaintances.

377
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,420
That way, it can become nostalgic

378
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,630
and touching.

379
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,830
I think it's a great idea.

380
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,070
We can also do a special episode,

381
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,740
reminiscing about school life.

382
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,110
It'll make the show more interesting.

383
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,030
Yes. From school to society.

384
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,590
From being childish to being mature.

385
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,310
This kind of long-term couple
relationship is quite popular.

386
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,980
I think we can use that

387
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,180
as our theme for publicity too.

388
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,450
We can get the best from both worlds
from youthful to urban life.

389
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,220
Then we can have a wider variety
of target viewers.

390
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,420
That sounds like a good idea.

391
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,830
Hurry up and contact He Siyue.

392
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,030
(He Siyue's Personal Information)
Don't get ahead of ourselves

393
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,420
until he has agreed to participate.

394
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,350
Don't worry.

395
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,900
I've sent someone to contact him.

396
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,500
I'm sure we'll have an answer soon.

397
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,670
- Here.
- Good.

398
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,590
Okay.

399
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,490
Over there.

400
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,310
Stop him.

401
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,870
Continue.

402
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,030
Goo shot.

403
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,870
Come. Continue.

404
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,450
Keep up.

405
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,900
Have you thought

406
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,800
about what I told you last time?

407
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,030
Xingyan, I'm thinking

408
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,630
that I shouldn't participate.

409
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,110
You know

410
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,270
that I've always been bad

411
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,900
at socializing.

412
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,500
To escape from having to socialize,

413
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,590
I've been writing books.

414
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,390
It's a variety show.

415
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,270
I'll have to face
so many strangers at once.

416
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,180
I have to socialize and make friends.

417
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,740
And I need to act

418
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,140
like a warm and cheerful man.

419
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,420
To be honest,

420
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,790
I'm a bit scared.

421
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,180
Actually, you don't have to act.

422
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,790
You just have to be yourself.

423
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,870
You don't have to force yourself

424
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,500
to become someone you don't like.

425
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,310
I get what you are saying.

426
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,590
But after all,
this is a romance variety show.

427
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,590
My love life

428
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,830
is like a piece of white paper.

429
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,590
I can't just find a girl

430
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,940
and ask her to act
as my girlfriend, right?

431
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,390
I have an idea.

432
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,940
You don't want to socialize

433
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,840
and you want him to participate
in the variety show.

434
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,070
So, you can just bring your new book

435
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,830
with you.

436
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,390
Being deeply in love
with the book you write

437
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,790
is like romance with an object.

438
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,030
It's a form of love too.

439
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,350
Okay.

440
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,500
If you are not willing to participate,

441
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,630
we won't force you.

442
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,390
But if you've changed your mind,

443
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,630
you can message me at any time.

444
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,420
- Wait.
- Okay.

445
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,630
Aren't you going
to consider my suggestion?

446
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,350
Let's go.

447
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,350
Before this, I saw a piece of news

448
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,460
about an English girl
falling in love with a tree.

449
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,590
And they got married.

450
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,420
Wait.

451
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,070
I'll...

452
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,220
I'll show you that piece of news now.

453
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,400
Over here.

454
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,870
Xingruo, are you okay?

455
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,220
Why are you sighing?

456
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,350
It's because of work.

457
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,630
Now, another male guest

458
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,220
has rejected us.

459
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,110
Who?

460
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,350
We've changed the course of our show

461
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,870
to make an acquaintance variety show.

462
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,460
So, I asked Lu Xingyan

463
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,630
to approach our high school
class representation today.

464
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,420
Our class representative, He Siyue?

465
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,220
Why did he refuse?

466
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,030
He said that his love life is empty.

467
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,220
It's empty.

468
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,390
Qin.

469
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,180
What happened?

470
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,310
He Siyue was Qin's
romantic partner in high school.

471
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,630
Don't you know?

472
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,500
No, I don't.

473
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,420
No. Don't listen to her.

474
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,110
That's not true.

475
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm telling the truth.

476
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,870
I remember that back then,

477
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,070
He Siyue would visit her
as soon as the class ended.

478
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,700
Qin, what happened?

479
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,140
Tell me.

480
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,830
Shi Qin.

481
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,180
Can you lend me your Chinese test paper?

482
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,020
I heard that you got full marks
for your essay again.

483
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,550
I want to learn from you.

484
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,590
Okay.

485
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,030
Thank you.

486
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,980
But I didn't spend any effort
in writing the essay.

487
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,350
There's nothing to learn from me.

488
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,410
Before we got separated into
the art and science streams,

489
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,790
I read about your essays.

490
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,180
One really stood out to me.

491
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,140
In your essay, you wrote

492
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,070
about your dream of becoming a lawyer.

493
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,350
All the important points
were clearly written in that essay

494
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,140
and there were a lot of allusions.

495
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,460
It was very well written.

496
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,510
I couldn't forget about it.
It has had a great impact on me.

497
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,790
Shi Qin.

498
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,940
I believe

499
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,740
that your dream will come true.

500
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,740
Thank you.

501
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,550
We did have some interactions
after that.

502
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,700
But we just talked about homework.

503
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,870
So, there was nothing between us.

504
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,870
That's not right.

505
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,550
If it was about homework,
why didn't he discuss it with us?

506
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,140
Why did he keep going back to you?

507
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,870
But the interaction between
the two of you

508
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,220
was so well hidden.

509
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,740
I didn't notice at all.

510
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,140
How about this?

511
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,660
Both of you can participate in my show.

512
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,140
And the relationship
between the two of you

513
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,350
will be called lovers-in-progress.

514
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,310
What do you think?

515
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,110
I think it's a great idea.

516
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,870
Good.

517
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,140
You don't have to do that.

518
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,140
He Siyue is so successful.

519
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,390
I'm not worthy of him.

520
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,390
What's the point of
getting in touch with him?

521
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,830
Besides,

522
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,790
I already know that things
won't end well between us.

523
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,660
I rather not start anything with him.

524
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,310
What will you think like that?

525
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,590
How are you not good enough?

526
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,270
Don't be so negative

527
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,900
toward yourself, okay?

528
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,270
The two of you

529
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,030
are my best friends for so many years.

530
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,390
You are biased toward me.

531
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,740
You also said

532
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,980
that He Siyue has
zero romantic experience.

533
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,900
But I'm divorced.

534
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,390
I think he won't be able to accept it.

535
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,390
Forget it.

536
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,140
I just want to focus on
becoming better right now.

537
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,740
I don't want to think
about anything else.

538
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,310
By the way,

539
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,310
Has Li Qi been harassing you lately?

540
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,180
He's living in the county.

541
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,270
I don't think he's come here.

542
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,550
Actually, I think Qin is right.

543
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,940
Instead of finding
emotional support from others,

544
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,460
it's better to spend more time

545
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,030
to explore our own value.

546
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,460
Your internship at the law firm

547
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,700
is going to end soon, right?

548
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,310
One week left.

549
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,830
Congratulations.

550
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,030
Congratulations to Ms. Shi Qin

551
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,940
from getting closer
to becoming a great lawyer.

552
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,740
She doesn't need a man.

Here. Let's make a toast
for our lawyer friend.

554
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,110
Cheers.

555

Thank you.

557
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,420
Goodbye, Ms. Lin.

558
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,140
Goodbye.

Shi Qin.

560
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,550
Have you read the terms
of that contract?

561
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,660
Yes, Ms. Lin.

562
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,110
I've also marked the risk factors.

563
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,690
I'll double-check it and
send it to you later.

564
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,830
Okay. Thank you.

565
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,180
Thank you to you too.

570
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:23,590
Honey.

571
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,460
Li Qi, why are you here?

572
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,140
No.

573
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,500
Honey, you've become more beautiful.

574
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,700
I know that you are still angry.

575
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,630
I was wrong.

576
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,460
I promised you that I wouldn't
be like that again, okay?

577
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,180
Let's go home.

578
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,900
I won't go back with you.

579
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,660
Why?

580
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Li Qi, we are divorced.

581
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,180
Come.

582
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,750
Come here.

584

Listen to me.

585
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,460
That was a court decision.

586
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,790
I didn't agree. Do you understand?

587
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,740
Let go of me.

588
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,110
Let go of me first.

589
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,110
Let me tell you.

590
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,140
All of your colleagues are here.

Let's talk at home, okay?

592

Come.

593
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,070
Come with me!

Let's go.

Qin.

596
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,550
Let go of her.

I'm her friend.

(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

601
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,230
How did the three of you
know each other?

602
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,370
When we were in high school,

603
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,490
I was the most ordinary person.

604
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,810
So, I wouldn't take the initiative

605
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,330
to approach anyone.

606
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,210
Even when I got into trouble,

607
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,890
I faced it myself.

608
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,770
Until the two of them

609
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,090
showed up in my life

610
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,650
and changed my life.

611
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,850
It was in year two of high school.

612
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,740
Wait. Where are you going?

613
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,070
Has the PE class ended?

614
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,390
Where are you going?

615
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,460
I need to go back to the classroom.

616
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,140
If you don't tell me the reason,
I won't let you go.

617
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,940
Here. Wear this.

618
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,420
Go away.

619
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,800
Let me take you back to the classroom.

620
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,940
Actually, it wasn't a big deal to be.

621
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,030
Because it was a very common incident

622
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,110
that would happen to most young women.

623
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,270
I just did

624
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,590
what was right.

625
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,270
Shen Xingruo!

626
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,900
If you don't have proper attire
during the PE class,

627
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,010
your marks will be deducted.

628
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,900
Do it. I don't care.

629
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,310
You can deduct mine.

630
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,070
What do you mean?

631
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,110
I'm the one without a proper attire.

632
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,010
You can deduct my marks.

633
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,550
Do you feel proud?

634
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,270
Interesting.

635
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,890
(How did the three of you meet?)
Those boys didn't know better.

636
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,690
They liked

637
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,410
to gain attention

638
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,490
by making fun of others.

639
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,450
If we

640
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,130
felt ashamed,

641
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,690
they would achieve their goal, right?

642
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,810
So, we need to fight back with courage.

643
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,050
Let them know that I...

644
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,410
Let them know that I can't be bullied.

645
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,250
Actually,

646
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,250
not only do I want to thank them
for standing up for me,

647
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,690
but I also want to thank them

648
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,370
for bringing me hope

649
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,850
when I was hopeless.

650
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,930
So since then,

651
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,770
the three of us
have become best friends.

652
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,250
Look at you.
