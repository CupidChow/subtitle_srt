Fourth Year of University)

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,970
(Lu Xingyan)

5
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,860
Why do you look so pale?

6
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,980
Do you feel unwell?

7
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,340
It's that time of the month.

8
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,030
Did you drink brown sugar water?

9
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,620
If it doesn't work,

10
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,260
do you want to visit the doctor?

11
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,030
Lu Xingyan,

12
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,510
I miss you.

13
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,030
I'm here.

14
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,510
I won't hang up.

15
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,100
I'll be with you.

16
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,670
Just lie down

17
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,830
and sleep for a while, all right?

18
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,700
I didn't hang up.

19
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,540
Xingruo, I think
your boyfriend is downstairs.

20
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,230
He seems to be calling someone.

21
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,510
Is he calling you?

22
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,690
(Lu Xingyan)

23
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,390
Wear a jacket!

24
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,350
You wear so little.

25
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,670
You didn't change your shoes
and even wear a pair of socks.

26
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,580
Do you want to get worse?

27
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,910
Do you feel cold?

28
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,230
Yes.

29
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,980
Why are you here?

30
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,460
You said you miss me

31
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,700
so I bought the earliest flight here.

32
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,990
Do you feel better?

33
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,220
Do you need to visit the doctor?

34
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,210
No.

35
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,950
I'm fine when I see you.

36
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,460
Don't be silly. I'm not a doctor.

37
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,430
You are.

38
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,850
=Episode 21=
(Going to you because you miss me.)

39
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,130
(Year 2024)

40
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,290
(Operating Theatre,
Do not enter unless being called)

41
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,990
Lu Xingyan's family member.

42
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,660
Me!

43
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,190
The patient had an accident

44
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,220
causing a rib fracture
and pleura puncture.

45
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,120
He needs surgery immediately.

46
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,510
We need his family's signature.

47
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,190
I'll sign it.

48
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,110
This is the risk notice.

49
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,070
Are you the patient's wife?

50
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,900
I am his girlfriend.

51
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,730
Hold on.

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,190
The surgery consent form
should be signed by a family member.

53
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,750
Girlfriends are not
immediate family members in law.

54
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,920
Does he have other family members?

55
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,460
All of them are not around.

56
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,870
His parents are abroad.

57
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,750
This is an emergency.

58
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,430
Can't we help them sign it?

59
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,750
This is against the rules.

60
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,460
Rules are fixed

61
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,760
but we are flexible as humans. He...

62
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,990
Doctor, this is about life and death.

63
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,700
Please.

64
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,820
All right. I'll inform the superior

65
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,750
and apply for a green channel
for immediate surgery.

66
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,830
We can wait until his parents are here
to sign the consent form.

67
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,550
- Sure. Thank you.
- All right.

68
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:14,170
(Star City People's Hospital,
Out-patient)

69
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,020
(In Operation,
Operating theatre, Do not enter)

70
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,660
Xingruo.

71
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,020
Don't worry.

72
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,070
Lu Xingyan will be fine.

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,750
The scene of the accident
has almost been cleared.

74
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,360
Xu Chengzhou and the rest
are rushing here.

75
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,700
We are here. Don't worry.

76
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,690
(In Operation)

77
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,140
The operation is quite successful.

78
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,990
The rib fracture
and pneumothorax surgery

79
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,820
have been completed.

80
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,580
However, his intracranial haemorrhage

81
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,220
did not meet the indications
for surgical intervention.

82
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,070
The patient is in a coma.

83
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,630
In the next 24 hours,

84
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,510
the haemorrhage might get worse.

85
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,340
Are you saying

86
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,310
that it might get worse for him?

87
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,220
Which is why
he has to be observed closely.

88
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,900
Usually, if the situation remains,

89
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,260
he will wake up after a day or two.

90
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,150
However, there's also a possibility
that it might get worse.

91
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,260
So, we will observe his vital signs
and state of consciousness closely.

92
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,630
We will also follow up

93
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,360
with a brain CT scan

94
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,390
to monitor the amount
of bleeding in his brain.

95
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,660
If the situation gets worse,

96
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,310
we will have to intervene surgically,

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,820
which is a craniotomy.

98
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,110
Lu Xingyan.

99
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,970
Family members, make way.

100
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,560
Xingruo.

101
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,170
Xingruo.

102
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,970
(In-patient Department)

103
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,750
I've troubled all of you today.

104
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,700
I can just stay here alone.

105
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,110
All of you should go home and rest.

106
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,900
I can also stay here.

107
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,430
The hospital only allows one person
to stay with him.

108
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,820
I should stay.

109
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,190
I'll come tomorrow to replace you.

110
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,950
You can't handle this alone.

111
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,460
You should let Xu Chengzhou replace you.

112
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,510
Actually,

113
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,340
I just want
to be with him for a while longer.

114
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,510
If something happens,

115
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,190
I'll call all of you.

116
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
Xingruo, you must take care of yourself

117
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,900
when you are alone.

118
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,850
(Love House)

119
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,990
Everything is damaged?

120
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,900
All right. Thank you.

121
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,630
Is everything all right?

122
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,060
What did the insurance company say?

123
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,940
They say the car
suffers from serious damage.

124
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,260
They will compensate
according to the car damage

125
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,230
after the traffic police's
accident report is released.

126
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,900
What's wrong?

127
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,590
I think this incident is strange.

128
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,390
Don't you feel it?

129
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,470
Zhai Jiajing borrowed the car from me.

130
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,990
Right after she returned the car,

131
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,660
Lu Xingyan had an accident
when he drove it.

132
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,900
Zhai Jiajing?

133
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,590
Why did she borrow the car from you?

134
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,420
I still have something to tell you.

135
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,300
I want to tell Shi Qin

136
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,110
about us.

137
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,390
I don't want her to misunderstand

138
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,540
because of this.

139
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,830
I will only tell Shi Qin.

140
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,710
I believe

141
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,180
she will never tell others.

142
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,780
I'll ask you for one last time.

143
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,540
Have you considered it thoroughly?

144
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,140
I have.

145
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,690
Fine.

146
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,420
I understand.

147
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,420
Can you do me one last favour?

148
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,630
Tell me.

149
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,110
I need to pick up a client
for the law firm.

150
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,750
Can you lend me your car?

151
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,180
Are you going to refuse me
for such a small favour?

152
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,350
All right.

153
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,780
We are all just assuming things.

154
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,180
Let's talk when the police release

155
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,520
the investigation report, all right?

156
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,420
The whole car was burned to the ground.

157
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm afraid they won't find anything.

Just now,

189
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,830
when I got the informed consent,

190
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,060
every article on it made me feel scared.

191
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,300
I've never thought about

192
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,510
you being so far away from me.

193
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,630
Lu Xingyan.

194
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,990
I beg you.

195
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,470
Wake up.

196
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,780
He hasn't woken up. It's me.

197
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,140
Have you stayed here all night
without eating and drinking?

198
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,350
I don't have any appetite.

199
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,420
You should eat something.

200
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,590
If this goes on,

201
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,590
I'm not sure if he will wake up or not,

202
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,350
but you might faint first.

203
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,390
He will wake up.

204
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,000
Then,

205
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,260
you should go back and rest.

206
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,710
I'll accompany him for one day.

207
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,420
No need.

208
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,350
I want to accompany him myself.

209
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,870
I know
both of you love each other a lot.

210
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,510
But how long have you been here?

211
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,830
You haven't taken a bath for days.

212
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,900
You need to take a bath
and come back at least.

213
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,990
I've asked the doctor.

214
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,020
Lu Xingyan's brain haemorrhage condition

215
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,830
is under control.

216
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,260
He will wake up soon.

217
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,110
Do you want him

218
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,530
to see how unkempt you look
when he wakes up?

219
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,710
Don't worry.

220
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,660
As soon as he wakes up,
I will tell you immediately.

221
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,630
I'll go back to take a shower

222
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,260
and return immediately.

223
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,020
I'll leave

224
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,630
Lu Xingyan in your hands.

225
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,790
I wonder how is Xing now.

226
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,790
Calm down.

227
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,530
Are you still worried
when Xingruo is there with him?

228
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,790
Hospitals now are so bad.

229
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,230
They only let one person
accompany the patient.

230
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,550
Otherwise, I'll also
go and accompany Xing.

231
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,590
Xingruo, why are you back?

232
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,980
I've come back to take a shower.

233
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,660
Then...

234
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,980
I'll go there now.

235
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,870
No need.

236
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,390
Don't worry.

237
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,830
Yu Si is there.

238
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,830
What? Yu Si?

239
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,700
You let Yu Si accompany Xing?

240
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,410
Aren't you afraid that he might
remove Xing's life support?

241
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,230
I'll head over immediately.

242
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,590
Calm down.

243
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,900
It's the 21st Century now.

244
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,550
People don't hurt someone
in broad daylight.

245
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,180
I'm just worried about Xing.

246
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,870
I know you are anxious.

247
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,740
We will follow Xingruo's orders.

248
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,830
Don't worry.

249
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,980
He will be fine.

250
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,500
I'll trouble you two again later.

251
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,590
Go and rest for a while.

252
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,460
I'm going upstairs.

253
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,030
Lu Xingyan.

254
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,630
Look what has happened to Xingruo

255
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,870
because of you.

256
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,660
I'm telling you.

257
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,500
You better wake up immediately

258
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,940
and give her a normal life.

259
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,900
If you die like this,

260
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,500
I'll bring Shen Xingruo
to Germany immediately.

261
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,350
Do you hear me?

262
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,660
Do you hear me?

263
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,660
Thank you for taking care of him.

264
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,800
Sorry for troubling you.

265
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,980
Why don't you rest for a while?

266
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,660
I couldn't stay put at home,

267
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,790
so I thought about coming
to accompany him.

268
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,290
(In-patient Department)

269
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,500
Mr. Yu.

270
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,350
Lawyer Zhai.

271
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,940
Are you here to visit Lu Xingyan too?

272
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,550
Yes.

273
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,070
Xingruo has been busy in recent days.

274
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,030
I came here to help her.

275
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,550
Help her?

276
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,700
I help Xingruo because I like her.

277
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,390
Are you helping her
because you like someone?

278
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,270
Mr. Yu, you are good at joking.

279
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,030
Xingruo and I were classmates.

280
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,550
What are you talking about?

281
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,500
If there's nothing else, I'll go in first.

282
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,730
I think there's no need
for you to go inside.

283
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,030
The hospital only allows
one person to accompany the patient.

284
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,140
Xingruo is already inside.

285
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,310
Sometimes, the ward

286
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,140
is the same as a relationship.

287
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,220
Having one more person is too many.

288
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,420
What are you trying to say
by beating around the bush?

289
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,110
I want to say
that I know you like Lu Xingyan.

290
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,420
But I advise you
not to waste your effort.

291
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,310
They will get married soon.

292
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,980
It's no use no matter what you do.

293
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
What I do

294
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,420
is none of your business.

295
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,140
Of course.

296
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,870
What you do is none of my business

297
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,070
but I only have one goal

298
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,550
which is to make Xingruo happy.

299
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,390
Her happiness now

300
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,630
is being with Lu Xingyan

301
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,140
so anyone who tries to break them up

302
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,550
will suffer.

303
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,700
I hope you are not against me.

304
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,550
Hello. This is the nurse's station.

305
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,590
The patient at Ward 51 is awake.

306
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,390
Okay.

307
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,940
Lu Xingyan.

308
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,590
Lu Xingyan.

309
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,350
The doctor is coming soon.

310
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,500
How do you feel?

311
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,390
Do you remember

312
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,980
that you had a traffic accident?

313
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,830
You were in a coma

314
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,900
for two whole days.

315
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,310
I had

316
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,830
a very long dream.

317
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,870
In my dream,

318
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,660
I couldn't find you.

319
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,110
I walked

320
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,220
towards a very bright place.

321
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,350
However, the more I walked,

322
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,660
I felt the further you were to me.

323
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,420
However, I...

324
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,500
Stop talking.

325
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,740
I thought you won't wake up anymore.

326
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,350
You scared me to death.

327
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,740
Don't move.

328
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,630
Don't cry.

329
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,590
Don't cry.

330
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,590
I'm fine.

331
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,420
Don't cry anymore.

332
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Promise me.

333
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,980
Don't leave me again in the future.

334
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,740
Understand?

335
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,790
Silly Girl.

336
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,420
How can I bring myself to leave you?

337
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,870
I will always be with you.

338
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,900
I will always be with you.

339
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:21,900
Don't cry.

340
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,180
You shouldn't cry anymore.

341
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,500
I've finally found you.

342
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,550
I want to hold your hand.

343
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,310
Aren't you holding my hand?

344
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,090
(Star City People's Hospital,
Out-patient)

345
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,390
Ward 51's patient woke up last night.

346
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,140
He is the male lead

347
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,390
of the recently famous Double-Star CP
in the romantic variety show.

348
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
I watched the show.

349
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,220
I wonder if they will
get back together in the end.

350
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I think they got back together.

351
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,310
Shen Xingruo was by his side
in the last two days.

352
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,980
Ward 51, it's time
to take your temperature.

353
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,070
Have I gone straight to the finale?

354
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,350
You want to take my temperature, right?

355
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,500
It's all right. Keep resting.

356
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,140
Take your temperature.

357
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,420
It's not what you think.

358
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,110
My parents are busy,
so she is here to take care of me.

359
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,070
She is my ex-girlfriend
but we are still friends.

360
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,220
We understand.

361
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,270
I read an online article

362
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,230
saying that both of you
are childhood friends.

363
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,390
I guess.

364
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,900
On the internet,

365
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,270
they said you had a big argument
when you broke up.

366
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,310
Is it true?

367
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,500
I think this should be done.

368
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,460
36.8 degrees. You are fine.

369
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,830
Let's go.

370
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,870
Let's go.

371
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,980
Does Chen Zhu really have a bad temper?

372
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,310
Let's go quickly.

373
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,980
Why did you shake my hand off?

374
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,830
The show isn't over yet.

375
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,110
We can't let them see us like this.

376
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,500
When did you start
to concern about the show?

377
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,940
I am the investor of the show after all.

378
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,590
I need to be responsible for the show.

379
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:49,830
The main reason

380
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,630
is no spoilers.

381
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,500
My head hurts.

382
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,590
It really hurts.

383
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,220
It hurts.

384
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,270
Hand.

385
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:18,870
Hold your hand?

386
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,460
It doesn't hurt if you hold my hand.

387
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,030
It doesn't hurt anymore.

388
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,180
Baby Zhou, are you awake?

389
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,310
Good morning.

390
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,870
I've prepared your breakfast.

391
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,140
You can eat at any time.

392
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,700
It hurts.

393
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,180
This isn't a dream?

394
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,460
What are you doing?

395
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,140
Sit down and eat.

396
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,170
Come here.

397
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,700
You...

398
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,350
Chen Zhu?

399
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,870
You woke up early
to make breakfast for me?

400
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,220
Are you Chen Zhu?

401
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,590
I am.

402
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,940
I am your dear wife, Chen Zhu.

403
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,550
I know it.

404
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,110
You have a parasite in you.

405
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,830
Sun Hotel is going to be invaded
by aliens.

406
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,870
My Baby Zhou is so cute.

407
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,420
Stop talking. Eat quickly.

408
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,270
It'll get cold later.

409
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,830
Tell me what you want.

410
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,140
I just want to treat you well.

411
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,350
From today onwards,

412
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,740
I'm going to work hard
to be a virtuous and gentle wife.

413
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,110
I will comprehensively take care

414
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,870
of your life and relationship.

415
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,550
I gave you my card and all my money.

416
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,110
I have no more money, Dear.

417
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,140
Be at ease today.

418
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,630
I want to treat you well.

419
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,900
I want to change.

420
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,830
I know I was too fierce
towards you previously.

421
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,140
No matter what you say or do
from now on,

422
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,660
I will not get angry.

423
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,070
I'll go and clean the floor.

424
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,980
It's too hot. Get me another glass.

425
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,830
How can you say it's hot
without drinking it?

426
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,140
I touched it.

427
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:21,900
Sure.

428
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,940
It's too cold.

429
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,220
I don't want to drink milk.

430
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,980
I want cola.

431
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,980
Yes, Young Master.

432
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,030
This is iced.

433
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,700
This is room temperature.

434
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,660
This is warmed.

435
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,270
I want a glass of sugarless cola.

436
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,900
Xu Chengzhou,
can you not take this for granted?

437
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,630
What's wrong?

438
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,700
You...

439
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,070
Don't cry.

440
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,030
Don't cry.

441
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,550
I was just teasing you.

442
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,310
I was just teasing you.

443
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,180
Don't cry.

444
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,180
I'm angry.

445
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,830
Don't be angry.

446
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,550
I was too bad.

447
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,830
I'm not angry at you.

448
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,390
I am angry at myself for being angry.

449
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,070
I'm angry at being angry.

450
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,030
I'm angry because
I'm not supposed to feel angry.

451
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,110
I'm angry because I feel angry.

452
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,070
What are you talking about?

453
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,490
No matter how I treated you in the past,

454
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,390
you only compromised,

455
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,350
and spoiled me.

456
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,830
However,
I couldn't hold my anger anymore

457
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,270
because you asked me
to get you a few drinks.

458
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,700
The bullet comments
on the show were right.

459
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,550
I'm fierce towards you

460
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,830
and like to lose my temper around you.

461
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,790
I don't treat you well at all.

462
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,590
Not well at all.

463
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
All right.

464
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,790
I even swore this morning

465
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,110
to change.

466
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,220
I will never get angry at you.

467
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,310
I must hold it in.

468
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
But I failed.

469
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,140
I got angry at you again.

470
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,070
I couldn't even do such a small thing.

471
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,870
What should I do?

472
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,420
All right.

473
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,030
I just need to know
that you are nice to me.

474
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,180
I was too much.

475
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,500
I apologize.

476
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,830
No.

477
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,500
I knew you were teasing me

478
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,660
but I still got angry.

479
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,550
Sorry.

480
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,790
I, Xu Chengzhou,
like Chen Zhu who behaves like this.

481
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,500
I love to spoil Chen Zhu.

482
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,390
It's no use no matter who says anything.

483
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,270
Dear,

484
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,900
I will

485
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,590
never get angry at you for no reason.

486
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,700
I will change.

487
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,030
I will do my best to change, all right?

488
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,410
(Outpatient)

489
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,220
You recover well after the surgery.

490
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,220
You can be discharged today.

491
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,590
I've read

492
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,420
your examination report.

493
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,980
The brain haemorrhage situation
is under control now.

494
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,660
The rest is also recovering.

495
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,790
However, the patient will feel

496
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,670
that he cannot exert
any strength in his right hand

497
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,980
in the next month.

498
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,980
So, family members need to help him

499
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,230
with functional recovery training
for grasping and holding.

500
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,460
What else do we need to take note of?

501
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,100
After he is discharged
from the hospital,

502
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,710
he shouldn't do anything strenuous
for a month.

503
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,900
You must recuperate.

504
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:32,890
All right.

505
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,670
If there are no more questions,

506
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,620
just come back

507
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,500
for a re-examination in three months.

508
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,940
Thank you, doctor.

509
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,890
You're welcome.

510
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,580
Thank you.

511
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,230
You've worked hard.

512
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,830
I can finally be discharged.

513
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,770
Let me bring you back home.

514
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,790
How are you?

515
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,830
Let me see.

516
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,190
Are you all right, son?

517
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,190
It's all right.

518
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,870
I'm fine.

519
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,100
Brat.

520
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,230
What did the doctor say?

521
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
The doctor said he is recovering well.

522
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,540
How old do you think you are?

523
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,350
You can't even drive carefully.

524
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,980
You are really making people worried.

525
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,680
What did I tell you?

526
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,310
He is fine because he is lucky.

527
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,830
It's all your father's fault.

528
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,940
He was worried about you

529
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,150
and rushed back.

530
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,060
Speak with a conscience.

531
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,040
You were rushing back here
while dragging me along.

532
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,230
Son, let me tell you.

533
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,850
When we couldn't come back
a few days ago,

534
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,230
she was so anxious that she cried.

535
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,190
I didn't.

536
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,790
You can be at ease now.

537
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,830
I'm fine.

538
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,810
All my limbs are intact as well.

539
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,580
I'm not worried about you.

540
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,020
I'm worried about Ruo.

541
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Look at her face.

542
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,970
She lost weight
because she was worried about you.

543
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,100
Let's go. Go back and rest immediately.

544
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,620
I'll make something nourishing for you.

545
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,980
I'm still here.

546
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,750
Who are you actually picking up?

547
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,420
Lu Shan, what are you doing?

548
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,310
Hold your son.

549
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,350
All right.

550
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,390
Be careful.

551
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,390
Slowly.

552
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,540
Why are you so careless?

553
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:53,860
(Door is unlocked.)

554
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,540
Be careful.

555
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,190
We are back home.

556
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,870
Change your shoes.

557
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,039
Xingruo,

558
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,790
I'll ask Liu to send you back home.

559
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,130
You've suffered in the last few days.

560
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,670
Go back and rest.

561
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,620
It's all right, Uncle Lu.

562
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,980
I know you care about me.

563
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,190
You and Aunt Pei have suffered as well
for rushing back here.

564
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,270
I'll stay

565
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,870
so I can take care of Lu Xingyan.

566
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,150
Xingyan is our son.

567
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,150
I must take care of him.

568
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,500
Lu Shan, be clear.

569
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,540
Who can take care of this brat?

570
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,670
Fine. You should rest.

571
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,870
I'll take care of him. How's that?

572
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,750
Dad, you should leave.

573
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,830
Where can I go?

574
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,100
I am your father.
I need to take care of you.

575
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,540
I'll stay to take care of him too.

576
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,420
Aunt Pei is also unwell.

577
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,670
It'll be too busy for you.

578
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,620
I can stay and help you out.

579
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,239
Yes.

580
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,900
What's wrong?

581
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,500
I rushed here the whole day

582
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,790
and felt dizzy probably.

583
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,750
I think my blood pressure is up again.

584
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,870
Go back and sit down.

585
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,390
What are you talking about?

586
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,620
I...

587
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,230
I can't hold on anymore, Xingruo.

588
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,790
It's like this.

589
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm so dizzy now.

590
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,750
I can't help you.

591
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,900
I need to go rest
in the mountains for a few days.

592
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,940
On the mountains?

593
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,580
Let's go!

594
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,150
- Be careful.
- Just leave us alone.

595
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,150
Why are you going to the mountains?

596
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,940
Leave us alone.

597
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,020
Goodbye, Aunt Pei.

598
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,100
Let's go to the emergency room.

599
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,490
I'm fine now.

600
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,540
You're fine?

601
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:29,980
You scared me.

602
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,940
Let's go back.

603
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,150
You fool.

604
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,830
You are so senseless at your age.

605
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,670
Don't you know what was happening?

606
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,710
Not so loud.

607
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,540
Tell me. Where are we going now?

608
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,980
We'll stay at the mansion
outside the city for two days to relax.

609
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,190
Sure.

610
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,900
Turn around. Let me shave it for you.

611
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,500
Don't laugh.

612
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,060
Lift your chin.

613
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:20,900
It's done.

614
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,540
Why are you staring at me?

615
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,620
I was thinking.

616
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,790
Back in the hospital,

617
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,870
I thought

618
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,940
I missed out on

619
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,790
many opportunities to be with you

620
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,630
so

621
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,940
I want to make up

00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,390

(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

643
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,050
What was your last thought

644
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,810
at the moment of the accident?

645
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,970
(Your thoughts
during the moment of the accident)

646
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,810
It happened too quickly.

647
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,050
I felt nothing at that moment.

648
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,090
I didn't feel pain at all.

649
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,890
I only felt that everything around me
became slow.

650
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,490
Many moments of Shen Xingruo and I

651
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,290
flashed past my brain.

652
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,450
Just like a quick running

654
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,890
Back then,

655
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,330
I was afraid, to be honest.

656
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,730
I was afraid

657
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,850
that I'd die just like that.

658
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,530
I was afraid of leaving Shen Xingruo.

659
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,290
After experiencing
the accident and hospitalization,

660
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,130
do you have a new view of love?

661
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,090
(Any new views about love
after the accident?)

662
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,730
I realised I love Lu Xingyan

663
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,050
more than I imagined.

664
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,330
What about marriage?

665
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,930
Actually,

666
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,930
I also have
some new thoughts about marriage.

667
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,650
On the day of the accident,

668
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,090
I couldn't sign the informed consent

669
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,410
because I wasn't his family member.

670
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,670
I remember
I was very helpless back then.

671
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,250
Later, I thought about
many things alone.

672
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,250
I have some new understanding

673
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,530
about marriage now.
