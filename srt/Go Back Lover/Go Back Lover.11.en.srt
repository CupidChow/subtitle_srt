(I Gently Take A Sip Of Your Love For Me)

4
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,970
(Year 2014)

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,660
When we were about
to leave home just now,

6
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,970
why did you change your clothes?

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,270
I wanted to match with you a little.

8
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,540
What's this outfit called again?

9
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,870
Sibling outfit.

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,180
Try to think some more.

11
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,230
Can you think of any other outfit
that's the same?

12
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,030
I can't think of any.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,710
Turn yourself around.

14
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,150
Look at the camera.

15
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,740
Smile.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,740
What are you doing?

17
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,020
This is our first time
on a Ferris wheel.

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,460
Be happy, don't be upset.

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,230
I'm not upset.
This is just my facial expression.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm practically a photography genius.

21
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,730
I took such great photos.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,460
Let me show you.

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,420
I won't let you see it.

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,940
I'll keep it for myself.

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,520
I can't even see the face in the photo.

26
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,630
Your photography skills are
as bad as your academics.

27
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,830
You are really not good at conversation.

28
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,300
You do?

29
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,460
Our home is over there. Can you see it?

30
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,710
In that direction.

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,940
Our home?

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,230
Yeah.

33
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,730
I heard if you kiss
at the highest level of the Ferris wheel,

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,630
you'll stay together forever.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,030
We'll only be at the highest level
for just a brief moment.

36
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,380
How do you know

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,700
when we are at the highest level?

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,380
Come closer, I'll tell you.

39
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,890

50

The Ferris wheel
is just descending now.

51
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,910
So we must have just
passed the highest level.

52
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,420
We'll stay together forever.

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,050

(Year 2024)

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,180
(Go Back Lover)
(Here's the task for the third date.)

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,790
(Task 3)
(This round, we'll have two challengers with us.)

59
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,860
(Chen Zhu, Xu Chengzhou)
(One male and one female)

60
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,980
(Shen Xingruo, Lu Xingyan)
(In the following episodes,)

61
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,860
(Shi Qin, He Siyue)
(the challengers will take turns)

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,740
(Female Challenger)
(going on dates with the guests.)

63
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,470
(After three rounds of dates,)

64
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,270
(their continuous participation
will be decided by their crush.)

65
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,470
(If the challenge succeeds,)

66
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,180
(the challenger will substitute
the partner of the current pair)

67
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,590
(and move into the Love House.)

68
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,350
(Next up,)

69
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,180
(the challengers)

70
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,500
(will send an invitation letter)

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,790
(to the person they want to date
in the first round.)

72
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,950
(The selected guest)

73
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,660
(must cooperate and complete the date.)

74
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,600
(It cannot be refused.)

75
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,350
(Love House)

76
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,150
Why haven't
the challengers arrived yet?

77
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,100
Stop putting on makeup.

78
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,910
If you keep going, the corners of
your mouth will reach your ears soon.

79
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,470
I'm putting on makeup
for a date with the challenger.

80
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,420
Why are you wearing a suit?

81
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,830
To welcome them?

82
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,830
How is that possible?

83
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Anyone with eyes would choose me, okay?

84
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,020
After all, I have
so many good qualities.

85
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,430
Let's see what will be going on.

86
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,030
Did you know there are challengers?

87
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,930
No, I didn't know that.

88
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,150
After the filming of this show started,

89
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,940
I didn't participate
in the planning anymore.

90
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,830
They probably made new adjustments

91
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,130
based on our previous dates condition.

92
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,740
I wonder

93
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,740
if I would get replaced
by the challenger.

94
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,540
No, you won't.

95
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,470
I'm such a boring person.

96
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,150
No one would choose me.

97
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,790
I think so too.

98
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,150
No, no, no.

99
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,620
That's not what I meant.

100
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,470
I meant that I'm also a boring person.

101
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,660
No, wait, no, not right.

102
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,270
The 'also' I added means...

103
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,590
The 'also' I added

104
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,500
means that

105
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,590
I'm boring and you're interesting.

106
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,790
Yeah, you're interesting.

107
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,540
That's fine.

108
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,500
If no one chooses us,
it's actually good.

109
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,030
In that way,

110
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,420
we can keep going on dates together.

111
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,180
Miss X is inviting me.

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,910
Miss X?

113
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,150
That's a cross, okay?

114
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,350
Don't make me laugh.

115
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,710
Come on, let me show you

116
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,980
what it means to be chosen.

117
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,500
Yours is also a cross.

118
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,270
You know nothing.

119
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,660
The true hunter

120
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,830
often appears as prey.

121
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,500
A good man never just offers himself up.

122
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,830
Women have to make the first move.

123
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,860
Alright.

124
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,150
As an outstanding man,

125
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,980
I'll wait for the female challenger
to take the initiative.

126
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,300
Always daydreaming.

127
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,910
Thank you.

128
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,500
Who is that?

129
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,470
Xingruo.

130
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,980
Do you miss me?

131
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,350
Yu Si?

132
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,230
I tell you,

133
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,860
I specifically chose you.

134
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,270
Why are you here?

135
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,910
You two are having so much fun
filming the show.

136
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,300
Of course, I have to join in.

137
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,540
Can you stop messing around?

138
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm not messing around.

139
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,950
Am I right, Mr. Lu?

140
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,350
I didn't expect Mr. Yu

141
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,530
to be interested in
joining a dating show.

142
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,230
I'm not interested in
joining a dating show.

143
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,670
I'm only interested in Xingruo.

144
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,380
Does this make you jealous?

145
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,140
No, I don't.

146
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,430
As an investor in the show,

147
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,500
if Mr. Yu wants to join,

148
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,310
you are more than welcome.

149
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,190
That's great then.

150
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,190
By the way, Xingruo, did you know

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,830
the people online aren't just shipping

152
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,230
for the two of you,
the 'Double-Star CP'.

153
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,060
Our 'Rainbow Encounter CP'

154
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,070
has a lot of fans too.

155
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,770
Who is shipping for it?

156
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,590
Myself.

157
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,230
I even started a super topic for us.

158
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,930
We are in the second place
for the Today's Check-In.

159
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,550
So now,

160
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,780
I can take Xingruo on a date, right?

161
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,950
Alright. I guess Mr. Lu
wouldn't want to come along.

162
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,140
Since you dislike me so much.

163
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,260
If you want to hit me again,
you can't do it with the cameras around.

164
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,460
You had better avoid seeing
it to have a peace of mind.

165
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,900
You worried too much.

166
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
I'm leaving now.

167
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,140
Mr. Lu.

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,780
Today's filming isn't over yet.

169
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,950
They have already gone on dates.

170
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,080
That means I am given a bye.

171
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,900
What else can I do?

172
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,860
The guest who isn't
participating in a date

173
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,140
has to observe the challenger's date

174
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,780
from behind the scenes.

175
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,930
We're ready to do
a live stream for that.

176
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,690
Mr. Lu,

177
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,230
please have your seat.

178
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,550
Well.

179
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,380
Why is Yu Si always hanging around?

180
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,710
Xing's jealousy jar is going
to spill over this time.

181
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,430
Isn't being jealous very normal?

182
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,550
After all, Yu Si is so outstanding.

183
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,190
What do you mean by that?

184
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,780
Nothing.

185
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,950
It's been a long time since we met,
my old classmates.

186
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,900
Zhai Jiajing?

187
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,070
Why are you here?

188
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,310
I heard you were all here,

189
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,860
so I had to show up too.

190
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,950
We haven't seen each other
in so many years.

191
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,380
I missed everyone though.

192
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,830
Am I right, Qin?

193
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,830
Did you miss me?

194
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,140
Long time no see.

195
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,670
Our law firm has some
business relations with Zhide.

196
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,470
I even heard Ms. Lin mention you.

197
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,550
She said that you have
solid professional skills,

198
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,190
and will soon become
the fastest promoted intern lawyer.

199
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,410
How impressive you are!

200
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,590
You're the amazing one.

201
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,100
You're already
a professional lawyer now.

202
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm just about to get promoted.

203
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,920
It's all because I entered
this field earlier than you.

204
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,100
You're way more awesome.

205
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,860
Don't bully the veterans.

206
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,710
Let's meet in the court next time.

207
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,890
Please go easy on me in the future.

208
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,830
Hey, no, don't say that.

209
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
The production team

210
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,710
has already sent me the dating location.

211
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,860
Let's go ahead for a date.

212
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,190
I'm going to date with Qin today,

213
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,830
and He Siyue will be our companion.

214
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,830
Let's go.

215
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,620
No. Aren't you two going?

216
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,830
The rules are fixed,
but we are flexible.

217
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,380
Am I right, the scenarist?

218
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,670
I just wanted to meet Qin today.

219
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,310
How is it? Are you coming with us?

220
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,810
Let's go.

221
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,530
Get Qin's bag along with you.

222
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,550
Lawyer Zhai.

223
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,130
Why didn't you pick me for the date?

224
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,230
Is that because we're
too familiar with each other?

225
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,900
How could I not pick you, Director Xu?

226
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,500
We are old classmates.

227
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,780
We've got to date one by one.

228
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,230
Just get yourself ready.

229
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,490
Alright, I'm waiting for you.

230
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,140
We're going on a date now.

231
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,310
Go ahead.

232
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,830
K, does that mean we're off now?

233
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,780
Yes.

234
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,190
As the non-participating guests
for this round,

235
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,590
you can do whatever you want today.

236
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,950
Otherwise,

237
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,900
you can choose to have your own date.

238
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,620
Who would want to date him?

239
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,140
Do you think I wish to?

240
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,500
K.

241
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,980
What's Xing doing later?

242
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,590
According to the rules,

243
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,780
Mr. Lu has to observe the date

244
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,550
between the challenger and his partner.

245
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,310
Can I go watch it together?

246
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,780
Feel free.

247
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,430
What did we come here for?

248
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,780
Weren't we here for a date?

249
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,230
Let's interact, then.

250
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,070
How do we interact?

251
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,190
Teach me archery.

252
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,350
I don't want.

253
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,510
I don't know how to do it.

254
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,230
Whether you know it or not,
I just won't teach you.

255
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,470
Scenarist.

256
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,860
I don't know archery. Let her teach me.

257
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,090
(Teach him)

258
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,730
(Teach him)

259
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,370
(Ms. Xing, please teach him.)

260
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,170
Stand with your feet
parallel to your shoulders.

261
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,590
Grip this with three fingers.

262
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,230
Pull it back from your jaw and release.

263
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,930
So, tell me, why did you
turn up in my show?

264
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,470
Be a challenger to obtain you.

265
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,190
(Don't joke around. We're just friends.)

266
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,230
But, it's true

267
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,350
that you are

268
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,020
not my type.

269
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,950
However,

270
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,260
as your friend,

271
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,350
no matter why

272
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,260
I came to the show,

273
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,310
I'm here for your own good.

274
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,780
I'm warning you,

275
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,310
don't mess with me.

276
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,550
I've never had
bad intentions towards you.

277
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,350
But, as the producer of the show,
you should know

278
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,740
that a uni-dimensional flow

279
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,020
won't make the show stand out.

280
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,740
My participation

281
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,380
adds a little spice to the show.

282
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,230
I don't wish my show
to become dramatic and trashy.

283
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,430
The most dramatic part
is the two of you, okay?

284
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,230
Breaking up and getting back together
for so many years

285
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,780
is quite boring.

286
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,230
If you want the show to stay fresh,

287
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,230
I recommend you

288
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,670
kick him off immediately.

289
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,380
I'm sure you can make

290
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,620
the right judgment and choice.

291
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,860
Mr. Lu, do you feel any sense of crisis?

292
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,590
No, I don't.

293
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,190
If they were going to be together,

294
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,220
they would have gotten together long ago
during those years in Germany.

295
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,920
What crisis could there be?

296
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,220
Look,

297
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,950
Yu Si and Xingruo are well-matched

298
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,310
standing next to each other.

299
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,780
Who can resist a man like Yu Si?

300
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,550
If I were Xingruo, I'd choose Xing.

301
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,860
Yu Si is incomparable to Xing.

302
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
I'd pick Yu Si.

303
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:49,950
You have no taste.

304
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,950
5·3!

305
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,430
(5 Years of College Entrance Examinations,
3 Years of Simulated Tests)

306
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,100
Come here!

307
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,820
This brings back memories of our youth.

308
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,340
I came across a post recently

309
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,430
which stated "If you only had
eight years left in life,

310
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,060
what would you do?".

311
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,630
Do a set of '5 Years of College Entrance
Examinations, 3 Years of Simulated Tests'.

312
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,150
Did you come across that too?

313
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,910
I remember when we were
in high school,

314
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,780
you even gave me a copy of '5·3'.

315
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,570
(Did you know the whole class receive it?)
I thought

316
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,690
that He Siyue only gave me that book.

317
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,430
Actually, I only wanted
to give it to Shi Qin.

318
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,050
(Why did you give '5·3' to the whole class?)
But I was so sheepish.

319
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,850
So, I bought everyone in the class

320
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,850
a copy of that.

321
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,630
You were really
an awesome class monitor.

322
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,500
To encourage everyone to love study,

323
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,020
you gave everyone a copy of '53'.

324
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,710
Back then, I just...

325
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,710
You helped me, the class rep,

326
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,740
share the workload.

327
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,230
I'm thankful for that.

328
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,740
Why did you choose me

329
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,150
as your first date?

330
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,820
There are only three male guests.

331
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,500
If I chose Lu Xingyan,

332
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,210
I was afraid
Xingruo would misunderstand.

333
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,020
If I picked Xu Chengzhou,

334
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,740
I think only Chen Zhu could handle him.

335
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,500
So, that just left you.

336
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,190
Qin,

337
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,930
you don't mind, right?

338
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,150
Not at all.

339
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,110
That's good then.

340
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,580
I was worried that you'd hate me for it.

341
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,050
(Do you dislike Zhai Jiajing?)
No, not at all.

342
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,370
I don't dislike her.

343
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,490
I really like her.

344
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,130
Back in school,

345
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,290
He Siyue was the class monitor,

346
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,690
and she was the class rep.

347
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,590
They are such a perfect match.

348
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,370
She's got such a great personality,

349
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,410
and she gets along
so well with He Siyue.

350
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,850
If I were He Siyue,

351
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,930
I'd choose her too.

352
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,740
He Siyue, come here.

353
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,780
Is this your book?

354
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,680
What a great author, Mr. He!

355
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,020
The cover is pretty nice.

356
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,110
My friend designed it for me.

357
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Okay.

358
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,470
Today

359
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,950
is the first day
the challengers are with us.

360
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,230
First of all, let's welcome them.

361
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,740
To celebrate their participation,

362
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,910
the production team

363
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,670
has prepared

364
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,870
a special game of Truth or Dare.

365
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,950
For the Truth session,

366
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,630
we have already done filming.

367
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,780
Everyone has answered
the same question, which was

368
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,390
'Besides your own partner,

369
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,710
who else would you want
to go on a date with?'.

370
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,470
Regarding your answers,

371
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,020
we've tallied the results.

372
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,230
So, what's coming next

373
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,110
(Revelation Moment)

374
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,740
is the announcement of the results.

375
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,020
Please watch it.

376
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,710
If I have the highest votes,

377
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,160
please don't be too shocked by that.

378
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,470
I won't be shocked,

379
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,870
because my votes will definitely
be higher than yours.

380
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,500
Stop dreaming!

381
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
According to the votes,

382
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,950
(Revelation Moment)
(the male guest with the highest votes is)

383
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,470
Xu Chengzhou.

384
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,230
(1: Lu Xingyan, Yu Si; 0: He Siyue)
Congratulations on having two votes.

385
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,700
How is this possible?

386
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,020
What makes him stand out?

387
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,910
Everyone must have chosen me
because of my handsome, adorable,

388
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,110
sporting and cheerful look.

389
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,870
They must be obsessed with my charisma.

390
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,390
Do you even believe that yourself?

391
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,870
Then, why do you think it is?

392
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,330
(Xu Chengzhou)
I just randomly picked.

393
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,090
(Aside from your partner,
who would you like to date?)

394
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,890
(Xu Chengzhou)
We are brothers.

395
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,260
They chose you

396
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,980
because you are a safe option.

397
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,230
Are you not aware of that?

398
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,910
Two people didn't choose me.

399
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,820
Apart from you,

400
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,580
there's one more.

401
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,910
Who's that person?

402
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,050
(Lu Xingyan)
I chose Lu Xingyan.

403
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,690
(Aside from your partner,)
I'm curious

404
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,650
(who would you like to date?)
about how Mr. Lu is in private.

405
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,780
Who did you choose?

406
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,230
I chose Yu Si.

407
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,980
I know everyone too well.

408
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,340
I need a bit of freshness.

409
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,190
Thank you.

410
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,500
Alright, let's look
at the big screen now.

411
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Now, revealing

412
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,580
the female guests
with the highest votes.

413
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,670
She is...

414
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,410
(Revelation Moment)

415
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,340
(1: Shen Xingruo, Chen Zhu)

416
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,980
(0: Shi Qin)
Zhai Jiajing.

417
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,980
Congratulations.

418
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,250
(Shen Xingruo)
She is Chen Zhu's best friend.

419
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,970
(Aside from your partner,)
If I choose someone else,

420
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,530
(who would you like to date?)
Chen Zhu would kill me.

421
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,170
(Zhai Jiajing)
We've always kept in touch.

422
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,970
We are old friends,

423
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,050
so being together like today

424
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,330
wouldn't be too awkward.

425
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,290
(Zhai Jiajing)
If I had to choose, I'd pick Lawyer Zhai.

426
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,720
We've worked together
for a long time.

427
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,250
(Chen Zhu)
I like her personality.

428
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,500
Alright, this round is over.

429
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,150
The guests who voted for each other

430
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,430
will be paired for the upcoming date.

431
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,300
Now, let's proceed
to the Dare session of the game.

432
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,540
Lawyer Zhai, I didn't get a chance
to ask you earlier.

433
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,700
Why are you participating in this show?

434
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,190
Because

435
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,340
among the male guests here,

436
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,300
there's someone I like.

437
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,710
Who is it?

438
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,580
I won't answer that.

439
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,910
The Truth session is already over.

440
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,600
So, let's stop chatting about it.

441
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,300
K, are we moving on
to the Dare session?

442
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,110
What are the rules?

443
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,230
The rules are simple.

444
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,340
There are eight cards here.

445
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,910
Two of them are hearts.

446
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,300
The two guests who draw the hearts

447
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,230
will complete a task together.

448
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,540
As for the task,

449
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,820
the guests will draw it themselves.

450
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:49,870
Let's begin.

451
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,630
Okay.

452
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Everyone, please draw your cards.

453
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,060
Alright.

454
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,260
Show it to the camera.

455
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,950
Who got the heart?

456
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,820
Me.

457
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,430
What about the second heart?

458
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,260
Who's got it?

459
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,740
Qin.

460
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,910
Oh my goodness, the two hearts
which are getting closer.

461
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Qin, don't be nervous.

462
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,820
So, who will draw the task?

463
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,430
You do it.

464
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,060
Read it out loud.

465
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,580
Read it.

466
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,190
Open it and read.

467
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,300
The task is

468
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,670
the two guests must eat a single

469
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,870
finger biscuit together.

470
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,060
The final length must not
exceed three centimeters.

471
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,870
That's so intense!

472
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,820
Pick a biscuit.

473
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,700
Their ears are turning red.

474
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,390
Stop stalling, just start.

475
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,390
The distance looks about right.

476
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,020
Wait.

477
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,020
Less than three centimeters.
Task completed.

478
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,340
Congratulations.

479
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,910
This round ended smoothly.

480
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,120
Let's move on to the next round.

481
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,160
Everyone draw your cards.

482
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,390
I've got a heart.

483
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,780
Come on.

484
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,020
Let me see who the lucky one is

485
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,260
with the other heart.

486
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,430
Could it be you?

487
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,260
Yes, are you not happy?

488
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,710
Why would I?

489
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,340
So, who's drawing the task card?

490
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,300
I'll draw it.

491
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,230
I'll take control of my own fate.

492
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,820
Act like a tumble dryer for 30 seconds.

493
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,230
What does that mean by
acting like a tumble dryer?

494
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,390
It means you two have to hug each other

495
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,580
and roll on the ground

496
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,300
like a tumble dryer for 30 seconds.

497
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,470
The highlighted point
is to hug each other tightly.

498
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,250
(Game Instruction:
Both act like a tumble dryer)

499
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:29,950
(and roll on the ground
together for 30 seconds.)

500
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,540
Wait.

501
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,630
Isn't this task a bit too over?

502
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,020
A bit too over in terms...

503
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,780
I think so.

504
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,150
I think this can't be aired though.

505
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,950
Let's change it.

506
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,020
Letting Xu Chengzhou roll on the ground.

507
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,780
He has no guts for that.

508
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,340
Do you mean I dare not to?

509
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,540
Do you think I can't handle it?

510
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,910
Come on, let me show you.

511
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,020
Alright, let's do it here.

512
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,780
Let's do it. Why not?

513
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,630
Lie down.

514
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,910
Get the timer ready.

515
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,770

516
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,290

♪We run away from the crowd♪

527

Xu Chengzhou seems like quite
the gentleman at this moment.

528
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,110
I could do it too.

529
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,430
If only the production team
would give me the chance.

530
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,470
Alright.

531
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,630
Time's up. Task completed.

532
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,190
How was it?

533
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,340
That's good.

534
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,340
What's wrong?

535
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,670
Your hair is messy.
Let me fix it for you.

536
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,490
Do whatever you want.

537
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,910
Alright, the task
was completed smoothly.

538
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,500
Congratulations to both of you!

539
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,020
Now, let's move on to the final round.

540
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,340
What did you get?

541
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,260
What are you doing?

542
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,580
I want to be involved more in the game.

543
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,500
Hurry up, you are the last one left.

544
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,870
For the final round,

545
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,430
who's got the two hearts?

546
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,580
Hearts, hearts, hearts.

547
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,440
Is it?

548
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,150
Why is it a diamond again?

549
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,630
Where's the other heart?

550
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,470
Of course, it's with me!

551
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,630
Alright.

552
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,780
Now, the two of you,

553
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,500
decide who will draw the task.

554
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,980
How about letting Xing draw it?

555
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,910
Give him a bit
more involved in the game.

556
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,870
But, Mr. Lu seems unhappy now.

557
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,950
It's just a game.

558
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,340
Why would I be unhappy?

559
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,190
Come on.

560
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,500
Come on, please draw the task for us.

561
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,720
Anyway, whatever the task is,
we are all looking forward to it.

562
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,730
You may be looking forward to it,
but I'm not.

563
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,020
I'll draw the task.

564
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Alright, the task for this round is

565
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,260
the two guests gaze into
each other's eyes for 30 seconds.

566
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,980
This... This...

567
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,430
This task is pretty nice.

568
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,150
Come on.

569
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,980
Is 30 seconds too long?

570
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,260
That's right.

571
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,630
Producer Shen, you're trying to ruin
the game rules of the show.

572
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,540
Let's do it then.

573
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,580
Please.

574
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,020
The timer is ready at any time.

575
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,630
K, is it...

576
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,740
An affectionate gaze?

577
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,470
Yes.

578
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,230
An affectionate one.

579
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,980
Time starts.

580
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,260
What are you doing?

581
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,870
This will enhance
the effect of the show.

582
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,710
Alright, please start the timer now.

583
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,500
30.

584
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,390
29...

585
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,260
29.

586
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,580
28.

587
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,870
27.

588
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,780
26.

589
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,670
Let me tell you clearly today,

590
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,670
I like Xingruo.

591
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,910
I've had a crush on her for years.

592
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,630
I've been getting close to her
under the guise of friendship.

593
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,670
(Aren't you afraid
that I'll tell her everything?)

594
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,190
(Of course, you can tell her.)

595
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,020
(But, how do you think
about her reaction?)

596
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,020
(She'll definitely think)

597
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,110
(you're saying these things)

598
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,670
(out of your jealousy)

599
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
(and insecure feelings.)

600
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,300
(So...)

601
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,950
(So, I hope you would tell her.)

602
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,020
25.

603
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,670
24.

604
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,820
23.

605
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,110
This is for you. Wipe it off.

606
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,110
Thank you.

607
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,050
(Go Back Lover Love House)

608
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,260
Just now, Zhai Jiajing said
her crush is one of the guys here.

609
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,340
What do you think it is?

610
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,500
Could it be He Siyue?

611
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,580
They seemed to get along
pretty well this afternoon.

612
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,470
That's not certain.

613
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,060
It could also be Xu Chengzhou.

614
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,020
He is happily chatting

615
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,150
with Zhai Jiajing there.

616
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,870
Stop guessing it.

617
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,630
Everyone has their own thoughts.

618
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,190
Maybe she's just doing it
for the show effect.

619
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,820
Didn't you notice?

620
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,740
I did.

621
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,150
I know.

622
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,020
Because I was...

623
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,470
Because I was nervous too.

624
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,300
No, I tell you...

625
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,540
- He cares a lot, but he...
- Pass me the pasta.

626
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,360
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

627
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,020
When I look at Shi Qin,

628
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,340
I can't even speak a word.

629
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,110
Don't even mention
being that close to her.

630
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,060
It was really...

631
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,460
Why are you drinking here alone?

632
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,820
I couldn't sleep.

633
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,030
I came out to get some fresh air.

634
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,740
Why haven't you slept yet?

635
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,820
I saw you leaving the villa,

636
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,590
and I followed you here.

637
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,150
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

638
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,990
Of course not.

639
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,990
Do you want to have a drink together?

640
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,150
Sure.

641
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,190
Thanks.

642
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,070
For what happened tonight...

643
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,110
Thank you.

644
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,420
Thanks me?

645
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,550
Thanks for helping me out.

646
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,740
The game tonight

647
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,590
had me so embarrassed

648
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,020
that I didn't know how to handle it.

649
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,630
I'm sorry.

650
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,860
Tonight

651
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
I still couldn't control my emotions.

652
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,260
Do you still care about Yu Si?

653
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,190
Yes.

654
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,380
I can't stop myself from that.

655
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,420
Seeing you with him

656
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,590
makes me feel uncomfortable.

657
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,230
Before this, I told you

658
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,670
to keep a distance from him,

659
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,630
saying it was to avoid being filmed
and affecting the show.

660
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,670
I lied to you.

661
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,300
I'm sorry for that.

662
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,900
Lu Xingyan.

663
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,190
Yu Si and I are just friends.

664
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,630
When I was struggling in Germany,

665
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,190
he helped me a lot.

666
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,230
But,

667
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,230
he's just a friend to me.

668
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,590
Nothing inappropriate

669
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,900
ever happened between us.

670
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
I trust you.

671
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,030
In fact, my feelings for Yu Si

672
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,110
is more of jealousy,

673
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,550
rather than envious.

674
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,630
It's because
when you were alone in Germany,

675
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,300
I wasn't there for you.

676
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,380
But, he was by your side.

677
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,900
That's something
that I can't make up for.

678
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,710
At that time, I always wanted
to visit you in Germany.

679
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,710
But, most probably

680
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,940
due to the reason that I entered
the police station there before,

681
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,110
I was rejected to travel there.

682
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,380
I tried...

683
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,900
I tried not to think about you,

684
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,590
but I just couldn't make it.

685
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,740
I keep thinking,

686
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,510
if...

687
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
If I hadn't upset you that day,

688
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,190
would we still be together now?

689
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,510
Do you know?

690
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,710
After that fight,

691
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,670
I regretted it so much.

692
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,110
I was too aggressive

693
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,940
and said so many hurtful things.

694
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,030
Then,

695
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,260
I tried to call you.

696
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,110
I called you twice,

697
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,460
but you hung up both times.

698
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,150
I hung up?

699
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,410
(Shen Xingruo)

700
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,650

(Shen Xingruo)

702
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,190
When I woke up that day,

703
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,300
I was already in a hotel.

704
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,550
(Phone)

705
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,710
(Missed Call)
I checked my call records,

706
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,030
but I couldn't find any from you.

707
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,070
I thought it was just another

708
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,940
dream about you.

709
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,940
Lu Xingyan.

710
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,070
It's been so many years

711
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,740
we went through
all the twists and turns.

712
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,380

and see you,

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,990
that would probably be

732
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,230
the happiest thing in this world.

733
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:43,940
(Planning Team)
At 10 o'clock this morning,

734
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,260
all the department heads,

735
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,020
please go to the meeting room
to review the footage.

736
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,710
What's wrong? Are you leaving?

737
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,780
It's...

738
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,610
Don't be like this. I know...

739
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,620
I know I didn't do well. I'm sorry.

740
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,900
If I did something wrong,

741
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,560
please just tell...

742
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,780
Look, what's that?

743
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,590
A camera.

744
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,670
Don't be mad. Listen to me...

745
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,740
It's a camera.

746
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,860
Last night, the two of us were here...

747
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,900
The camera recorded everything.

748
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,910
They are going to review
the footage in ten minutes.

749
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,860
Let's leave here quickly.

750
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,670
How come there's a camera there?

751
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,380
That camera is used to record

752
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,000
the guests when they
pass through the corridor.

753
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,780
But, we didn't close
the curtains last night.

754
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,900
Well, we were in a hurry.

755
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,550
I was about to close the curtains,
and you...

756
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,150
Stop talking.

757
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,190
Shut up.

758
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,990
Thank goodness.

759
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,940
We came early.

760
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,000
Why are you two doing here?

761
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,110
We...

762
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,030
Mr. Lu and I are both
staying in the villa.

763
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,070
Isn't it normal for us

764
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,670
to appear here?

765
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,300
That's not right.

766
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,300
I just saw you coming from outside.

767
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,990
We went for a morning jog.

768
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,900
Any problem with that?

769
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,150
Why are you here so early?

770
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,520
The production team will be
reviewing last night's footage.

771
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,340
I came here with He Ming
to check it over first.

772
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,260
Alright then, you guys carry on.

773
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,190
I'll go inside
and take a look at it first.

774
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,300
No way.

775
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,460
What do you mean?

776
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,510
Of course not.

777
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,550
You can't work on an empty stomach.

778
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,900
Let's go have breakfast.

779
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,070
Breakfast?

780
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,830
Yeah.

781
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,510
Aren't we having it right now?

782
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,670
We haven't eaten yet.

783
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,730
Ms. Xing.

784
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,780
I bought extra today.

785
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:44,940
I can share it with you.

786
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,190
I want to eat spicy crayfish.

787
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,110
You want to eat spicy crayfish
in the early morning?

788
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,260
I've been feeling stressed lately.

789
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,820
So I want something spicy
to lift my spirits.

790
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,260
Me too.

791
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:12,750
Ms. Xing.

792
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,710
Look at this.

793
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,150
He has everything you want.

794
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,060
Hold on.

795
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,710
I'd like to have a barbecue.

796
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,860
She's stressed.

797
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,900
And, how about you?

798
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,550
After a morning jog, we need some
protein as our post-workout meal.

799
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,460
What a coincidence!

800
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,860
I feel like having that today too.

801
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,510
You...

802
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,260
Thank you.

803
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:45,780
Wait a moment.

804
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,780
The two of you...

805
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,780
One wants crayfish, one wants barbecue.

806
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,070
Something is off here.

807
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,260
I get it now.

808
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,150
You two are waiting here
very early in the morning,

809
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,480
and stopping us from getting inside,

810
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,550
is that because...

811
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,420
You're worried about
the outcome of the footage, right?

812
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:07,460
Am I right?

813
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,110
Yes, you're right.

814
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,030
Yes, you're right.

815
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:10,590
Am I right?

816
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,380
Yes.

817
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,070
I know you two well.

818
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,780
You are the producer and the investor.

819
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,070
It's normal to review the footage.

820
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,230
I'll call the creative team
here right now.

821
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,670
So, we can work together

822
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,740
to make your storyline

823
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,260
extra compelling.

824
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,780
Come on, please come in.

825
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,130
What could we do now?

826
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,110
Go with the flow then.

827
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,110
He Ming, where will you start reviewing?

828
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,630
There aren't many cameras
on the corridor.

829
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,190
So I'll start reviewing from there
to see if there's any usable footage.

830
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,780
Let me help you.

831
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,340
Xingruo, Mr. Lu.

832
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,940
The art team sent me some scenes.

833
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,820
Come take a look.

834
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,630
Come here.

835
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,380
Since both of you are here,

836
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,230
please take a look.

837
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,260
These scenes are

838
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,740
definitely good spots for filming.

839
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,550
He Ming,

840
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,710
are you sure you don't want
to take a look too?

841
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,900
After all, you're also a scenarist.

842
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,150
Hang on.

843
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,260
I see a footage

844
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,150
of a guest room on the corridor.

845
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,740
But no one should have been
in that room last night.

846
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:31,940
What guest room?

847
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,890
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

848
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,370
What do you find most attractive
about this show?

849
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,570
(What is the most attractive part
of this show for you?)

850
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,570
I particularly like the
mechanism of this show.

851
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,930
I believe with my efforts,

852
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,010
I can be the last one left.

853
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,130
What do you find most attractive
about this show?

854
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,770
The show mechanism.

855
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,850
Because it allows for dates

856
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,330
with all the female guests.
