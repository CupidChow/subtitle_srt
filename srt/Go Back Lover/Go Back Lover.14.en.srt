He cries on purpose.

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,940
It happens every half an hour.

9
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,140
He's targeting me.

10
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,660
Can you stop nagging?

11
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,830
Hurry and comfort him.

12
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,930
Why haven't my mom
and his grandma come back yet?

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,110
Dear baby. Rui, be good.

14
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,110
Rui, drink some water.

15
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,780
Drink some.

16
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,380
What should I do? He won't drink.

17
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,380
Come and calm him down.

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,860
You speak nicely to him,
but you're harsh with me.

19
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,710
This is unfair!

20
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,340
Is it fair now?

21
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,710
Maybe.

22
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,950
Hurry and calm him down.

23
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,910
Wait.

24
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,620
It's not enough.

25
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,670
Since you're asking for my help...

26
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,390
Lu Xingyan,

27
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,900
you're just making up excuses.

28
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,960
You have no choice.

29
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,860
You need my help.

30
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:16,170
=Episode 14=
(I make up excuses to get closer to you.)

31
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,610
(Year 2024)

32
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,390
Well done.

33
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,140
Ms. Xing, there's chemistry
between you two.

34
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,330
The photos turned out great.

35
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,630
Let me see.

36
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,950
This set of photos is nice.

37
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,060
Remember to warm the photos.

38
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,940
This is the first publicity
for the show, after all.

39
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,740
Let's keep the youthful vibe.

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,180
Understood. No problem.

41
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,860
This set is pretty good.

42
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,180
But I think

43
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,510
we're not close enough.

44
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,580
If we could be bolder,

45
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,270
perhaps the effects would be better.

46
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,020
Not close enough?

47
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,230
What do you mean?

48
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,660
Like this.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,740
What's wrong, Producer Shen?

50
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,860
This level of intimacy

51
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,990
doesn't suit the theme.

52
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,150
We're in school uniforms.

53
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,430
It's a bit risky.

54
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,180
If you want,

55
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,300
let's save it
for the workwear photo shoot.

56
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,180
You're right.

57
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,350
He Ming.

58
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,380
Ms. Xing,

59
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,940
don't worry.

60
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,620
Mr. Lu predicted your concern.

61
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,230
He asked me to prepare
some business attire.

62
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,700
You're quite thorough.

63
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,590
It's all for the show.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,590
As long as it helps promote the show,

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,470
it's my duty.

66
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,500
This is just an excuse.

67
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm an investor in this show.

68
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,470
I need you to cooperate with me.

69
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,060
Fine.

70
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,690
They look like strangers

71
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,350
in this photo.

72
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,380
This is scarier.

73
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,030
I feel that He Siyue
is trying to kill Shi Qin.

74
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,150
The photos aren't good?

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,620
No. They are perfect.

76
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,740
You both portray your characters well.

77
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,700
Something's wrong with the lighting.

78
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,500
How about we take a break?

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,110
Sure.

80
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,990
Good.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,940
Thank you.

82
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,530
Thank you.

83
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,180
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,110
Both of them

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,030
are very shy.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,350
We can't force them.

87
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,670
We can take a few candid shots

88
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,670
while they rest later.

89
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,230
Perhaps they'll come out better.

90
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,700
Let's sit here.

91
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,910
Time flies.

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,110
It feels like we were still high school students
not long ago.

93
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,300
Right.

94
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,820
I remember that year on sports day,

95
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,790
you were reciting scripts
at the podium.

96
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,350
I did.

97
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,700
I remember

98
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,230
the teacher wanted both of us
to recite it together,

99
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,260
but you refused.

100
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,060
That's because

101
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,060
I don't like speaking
in front of people.

102
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,110
That makes me feel uncomfortable.

103
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,910
To be honest,

104
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,930
I feel the same.

105
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,060
Going out with my mom

106
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,210
used to be  the thing I feared most
when I was little.

107
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,260
Why is that?

108
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,790
Because my mom

109
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,300
knows everyone in the neighborhood.

110
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,300
Every time we went out,

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,470
we'd run into many of her friends,

112
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,110
and she'd forced me

113
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,790
to greet them.

114
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,940
That was awkward.

115
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,820
They all looked the same

116
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,300
to me.

117
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,300
I could never differentiate them.

118
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,130
Once I got a name wrong,

119
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,740
she'd scold me.

120
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,990
It was a vicious cycle.

121
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,030
I became more and more

122
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,380
nervous and scared.

123
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,860
So what did you do?

124
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,350
Later, I found a way.

125
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,620
I called all female adults "missus"

126
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,300
and all male adults "mister".

127
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,820
Well done.

128
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,700
That helped me a lot.

129
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,350
Until one time,

130
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,500
I messed up.

131
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,350
What happened?

132
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,470
At that time, there was this person
who often came to my house,

133
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,110
and I always called her "missus".

134
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,180
She didn't seem to like me

135
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,860
and would roll her eyes at me.

136
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,060
Later, I found out

137
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,590
that she was still a high school student.

138
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,700
A high school student?

139
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,130
Yeah, she was a high school student,
and I called her "missus".

140
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,300
You see, in the workplace,

141
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,340
you can address coworkers

142
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,180
by their surname

143
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,700
and position,

144
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,870
like Producer Shen
and President Lu.

145
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,980
Right.

146
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,870
I used to call people by their given names,

147
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,870
like Xingyan and Chengzhou.

148
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,270
I can't do that.

149
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,550
I think

150
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,180
that's kind of risky.

151
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,390
Imagine this.

152
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,150
If someone is older than you,

153
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,580
it's disrespectful

154
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,700
to use their given name.

155
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,500
True.

156
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,150
If it's someone

157
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,630
with a higher position,

158
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,300
you might worry they get the wrong idea

159
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,730
that you're trying to get close to them.

160
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,940
That doesn't work for me.

161
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,300
But luckily,

162
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,870
we share the same struggles.

163
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,670
I never knew

164
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,390
who to talk to about things like this.

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,220
Lu Xingyan and Xu Chengzhou

166
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,100
don't know about my struggles.

167
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,390
They won't understand that.

168
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,670
Actually,

169
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,270
if you have similar problems,

170
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,870
you can talk to me.

171
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,910
We...

172
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,030
We can

173
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,180
criticize those awkward rules

174
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,790
together.

175
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Yes, that's what I mean.

176
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,770
Let's make a promise.

177
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,550

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,270
We're almost done here.
Everything looks fine.

193
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,230
Let's switch to the outdoor set
for a few more shots.

194
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,670
- All right.
- Clean up the place.

195
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,820
All done.

196
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,910
I'll put this here, Lawyer Zhai.

197
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,700
Thank you, Mr. Huang Bing. Good job.

198
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,670
Not at all.

199
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,580
Are you all right?

200
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,080
You look unwell. Didn't get enough rest?

201
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,510
No.

202
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,670
I'm just

203
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,100
a bit tired.

204
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,940
Here you go.

205
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,700
No, no thanks.

206
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,700
I don't drink this.

207
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,700
Don't be so courteous.

208
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,870
Everyone gets one.

209
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,790
Well, take this

210
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,870
and find a place to rest.

211
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,810
Health is more important.

212
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,680
Sure. Thank you so much.

213
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,980
Well, the rest...

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,910
I'll distribute the rest to them.

215
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,630
Sure.

216
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,180
Lawyer Zhai.

217
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,100
Thank you.

218
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,390
You bought all of this?

219
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,550
Yes.

220
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,390
You've been working with me
all day.

221
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,630
That's something I should do.

222
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,100
Here.

223
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,220
That's very kind of you, Lawyer Zhai.

224
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,510
It's our responsibility.

225
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,460
I have to cozy up to you,

226
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,030
so you'll take nice photos of me.

227
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,060
Of course.

228
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,790
Ms. Jiaming, Mr. Zhang Tao,

229
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,720
please help yourselves.

230
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,630
Lawyer Zhai,

231
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,220
you're so considerate.

232
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,430
You remember all our names.

233
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,580
They deserve respect.

234
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,430
But I also enjoy working

235
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,430
with everyone.

236
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,910
I like everyone,

237
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,150
especially you.

238
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,710
Me?

239
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,340
You take your work

240
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,910
seriously and responsibly.

241
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,980
I remember when the three of us
went on that date,

242
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,510
you wrote that prompt, right?

243
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,270
It was really good.

244
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,910
If I were the audience,

245
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,820
I'd be really curious
about those answers.

246
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,460
Right?

247
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,030
I also thought it was a good idea.

248
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,220
But I'm a bit curious

249
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,820
about how the show works.

250
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,510
Do the guests have to answer questions

251
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,460
based on your prompt?

252
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,790
Generally,

253
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,820
the guests cooperate with us

254
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,180
for the show.

255
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,580
But some are difficult to handle.

256
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,580
Producer Shen.

257
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,940
She has a mind of her own.

258
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,430
It's quite challenging on her part.

259
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,750
I think

260
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,750
Xingruo has her own principles

261
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
as she has handled many shows.

262
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,460
What principles?

263
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,910
She wants to make money

264
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,060
without revealing
too much about herself.

265
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,150
Getting everything in her favor

266
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,150
without making sacrifices.

267
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,030
That's not how things work.

268
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,630
True.

269
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,820
That's why crews working behind the scenes
have the toughest job.

270
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,980
Anyway, keep up the good work.

271
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,910
I have faith in you.

272
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,820
I believe you will definitely become
a great scenarist.

273
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,530
Well,

274
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,820
I'll buy you a meal next time

275
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,060
as encouragement.

276
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,430
Let's meet up sometime.

277
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,340
Sure.

278
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,300
I'll head over to prepare
for the outdoor set.

279
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,910
Come over when you're ready.

280
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,630
I'll be quick.

281
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,180
Why aren't you drinking?

282
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,700
You had a nice chat.

283
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,400
What were you talking about?

284
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,340
Girls talk.

285
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,180
No sugar.

286
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,980
Frankly, I'm curious

287
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,430
about your true intention

288
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,580
to participate in this show.

289
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,940
I said it before.

290
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,910
There's someone among the guests

291
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,060
that I like.

292
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,230
I don't buy that.

293
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,300
Why not?

294
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,180
You are excellent in every way.

295
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,790
You also knew
the other three guests before the show.

296
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,940
If you really liked one of them,

297
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,410
why would you need to join this show

298
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,550
to approach him?

299
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,200
That's impossible.

300
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,790
Do you think

301
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,220
that instead of the three of them,

302
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,220
I like you?

303
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,100
If you liked me,

304
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,400
you certainly wouldn't need
to go to great lengths.

305
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,150
Right? We could've met in private.

306
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,060
That'd be much faster than this.

307
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,700
Can I take that

308
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,940
as a confession?

309
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,460
It seems like you have

310
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,300
some expectations for me.

311
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,390
All right,

312
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,750
I need to head out.

313
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,820
I look forward to our date.

314
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,700
No need to rush it.
We still have a long way to go.

315
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,239
Bye.

316
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,220
You've been smiling
since the shoot ended.

317
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,870
Why? You're happy about the shoot?

318
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,790
Of course.

319
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,460
As an investor,

320
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm glad to see how much effort

321
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,430
you've put into promoting this show.

322
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,060
I appreciate that, Mr. Lu.

323
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,630
I'll work harder.

324
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,220
Keep up

325
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,940
the good work.

326
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,780
We should be

327
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,060
more intimate.

328
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,830
All right.

329
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,820
Ms. Xing,

330
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,930
something bad has happened.

331
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,610
Huang Bing fainted after the shooting.

332
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,580
Huang Bing?

333
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,290
(Outpatient Department,
Xingcheng People's Hospital)

334
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,220
Xingruo, where's He Ming?

335
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,630
I asked him to head back to the set.

336
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,610
How's Huang Bing's condition?

337
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,670
The doctor says
his condition is stable now.

338
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,510
That's a relief.

339
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,980
Why do you think
such a thing has happened?

340
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,790
You look tired, too. Go back and rest.

341
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,820
I'll go and talk to him.

342
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,390
No need.

343
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,030
I've already talked to them.

344
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,060
We'll compensate them
according to the contract.

345
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,270
Huang Bing and his wife agreed.

346
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,300
All right. Got it.

347
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,940
However, the doctor mentions

348
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,550
Huang Bing's myocarditis

349
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,750
is caused by overly fatigue.

350
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,910
Why is this happening?

351
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,460
Have we overworked our crews?

352
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,060
It can't be right.

353
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,510
We didn't push
our shooting progress hard.

354
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,030
This can't be happening.

355
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,470
How about this?

356
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,270
I'll go and talk to the craft service.

357
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,790
Everyone takes a break today.

358
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,150
Health is more important.

359
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,580
Actually, I've sent He Ming
to look into

360
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,100
Huang Bing's family.

361
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,220
They're in a financial pinch,

362
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,910
so aside from the compensation agreed
in the contract,

363
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,790
I'd like to offer him a payout
on behalf of the production team.

364
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,500
About the extra payout, the production team
will take care of that.

365
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,390
Our budget

366
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,350
includes the contingency costs, right?

367
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,460
Well, I'll handle that.

368
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,670
Let's go.

369
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,230
Okay.

370
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,390
What happened with Huang Bing?

371
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,530
Why does he suddenly want to sue us?

372
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,220
I have no idea either.

373
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,590
We've already reached an agreement.

374
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,350
Somehow, this happened this morning.

375
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,540
How about I go talk to them again?

376
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,500
No need. It's useless.

377
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,430
They're screening my calls.

378
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,070
When I visit them at the hospital,
they shut me out, saying he needs rest.

379
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,450
Obviously, they don't want to meet us.

380
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,460
What does he want?

381
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,670
He demands to rest for at least a year

382
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,130
and that we pay his salary
for twelve months,

383
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,070
120,000 yuan in total.

384
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,590
It's not about the money.

385
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,940
Once the lawsuit starts,

386
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,500
whether we win or lose,

387
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,590
we've already lost.

388
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,020
If the lawsuit is filed,

389
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,500
let alone the show's reputation
will be ruined after airing,

390
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,430
we're not even sure it can air at all.

391
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,940
What's more important now is

392
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,180
that our show might soon be suspended.

393
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,180
Why?

394
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,740
Several crews close to Huang Bing

395
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,310
took leave this morning,

396
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,220
claiming we mistreated Huang Bing
and refused to compensate him.

397
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,350
They're demanding an explanation.

398
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:20,910
What should we do?

399
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,350
It looks like someone
wants to stir things up.

400
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,020
Huang Bing and his wife must be trying

401
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,390
to pressure us this way.

402
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,150
I didn't know

403
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,070
Huang Bing was this kind of person.

404
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,590
Calm down. We'll follow the procedure.

405
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,730
As long as everything is
reasonable and legal,

406
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,150
we have nothing to fear.

407
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,110
The problem can be solved.

408
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,700
I'll ask He Ming to contact

409
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
their lawyer

410
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
for a negotiation to see
if we can settle this privately.

411
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,020
I'll hire a lawyer.

412
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,630
Sure.

413
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,110
Speaking of lawyers,

414
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,350
I could ask Lawyer Zhai.

415
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,540
Is it really fine?

416
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,390
After all, this doesn't concern
your hotel.

417
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,260
Whether the show airs successfully
affects our investment,

418
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,740
so it does concern the hotel.

419
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,980
But

420
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,540
I feel bad asking her for help

421
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,870
when she's already the guest.

422
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,780
It's fine.

423
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,950
Lawyer Zhai has worked
with us for a long time,

424
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,830
and she's familiar
with the show's situation.

425
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,740
I believe we can't find anyone

426
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,140
more suitable than her
in such a short time.

427
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,980
How about this?

428
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,500
The production team
will pay for her services.

429
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,910
Let's treat this as a business.

430
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,940
I don't want to trouble her as a friend.

431
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,740
Okay. I'll tell her.

432
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,310
Also,

433
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,350
I'll reach out to the hotel staff

434
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,230
to speak to the crews
who are close to Huang Bing

435
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,670
and pacify them.

436
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,700
Thank you.

437
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,350
This isn't your responsibility.

438
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,460
Don't be so courteous.

439
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,350
The show's success affects
the hotel's publicity,

440
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,390
and that concerns me, too.

441
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,150
Hello.

442
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,830
Is Mr. Huang Bing not coming today?

443
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,910
My client is resting

444
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,780
due to health reasons,

445
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,830
so his wife is attending the negotiation

446
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,150
on his behalf.

447
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,180
Qin?

448
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,220
I'm Huang Bing's lawyer.

449
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,870
I didn't expect you to be here.

450
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,540
Since everyone is here,

451
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,630
shall we start?

452
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,110
Sure.

453
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,260
All right. We're gathered here today

454
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,430
to negotiate

455
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,540
Mr. Huang Bing's compensation.

456
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,830
While we agree

457
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,910
that his myocarditis

458
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,150
is related to his work,

459
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,430
it's not the direct cause.

460
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,870
Besides, his condition

461
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,310
doesn't meet the standard
of work-related injury

462
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,110
under insurance terms.

463
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,260
I believe you're aware of that.

464
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,630
I am.

465
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,870
In that case,

466
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,940
we can't agree

467
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,910
to the 120,000 yuan compensation
you requested.

468
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,940
However,

469
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,780
concerning Mr. Huang Bing's
financial situation,

470
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,310
the production team is willing
to pay off the compensation quickly.

471
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,700
In my opinion,

472
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,830
the best solution for both parties
would be

473
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,070
to pay the agreed compensation amount
stated in the contract,

474
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,780
along with an additional 20,000 yuan
for recuperation.

475
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,940
Since Mr. Huang Bing's condition

476
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,390
doesn't meet the standard
of the work injury insurance terms,

477
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,780
we will not pursue

478
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,180
compensation for work injury.

479
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,700
We request 120,000 yuan

480
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,500
from the production team

481
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,980
as humanitarian compensation.

482
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,350
Humanitarian compensation

483
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,630
is financial compensation offered

484
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,460
out of consideration and sympathy

485
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,780
without legal responsibility

486
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,390
or obligation.

487
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,070
Generally,

488
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,590
humanitarian compensation

489
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,780
doesn't have a fixed amount.

490
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,670
It's determined

491
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,230
based on the seriousness
of the incident.

492
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,020
Given Mr. Huang Bing's
financial difficulties

493
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,830
as his future income is affected

494
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,350
and the medical bills

495
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,630
he incurred during hospitalization,

496
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,590
we request 120,000 yuan
of compensation.

497
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,700
Humanitarian compensation

498
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,020
isn't legally enforceable.

499
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,980
We can reject it.

500
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,700
But the show will eventually air,

501
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,910
and for this reason,

502
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,780
we hope

503
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,630
you will consider our suggestion.

504
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,220
Why are you being so polite to them?

505
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,590
Anyway, I have nothing to fear.

506
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,310
Please calm down.

507
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,630
We should present our demands

508
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,020
in a reasonable way.

509
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,870
Next,

510
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,350
we can discuss the details
of the compensation.

511
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,540
Thank you so much, Lawyer Shi.

512
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,500
You were amazing.

513
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
You intimidated them so much

514
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,020
they couldn't say a word.

515
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,910
Please calm down and listen to me.

516
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,460
A strong voice

517
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,940
won't help us

518
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,020
win the case.

519
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,220
I proposed the humanitarian compensation

520
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,830
to them just now,

521
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,070
but I believe

522
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,410
they will come up
with a corresponding solution soon.

523
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,980
As your lawyer,

524
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,020
I must clearly present
your demands to them.

525
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,540
But I have to remind you

526
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,020
that 120,000 yuan

527
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,540
is the upper limit
for humanitarian compensation.

528
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,180
It's quite a large amount.

529
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,150
Not at all.

530
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,460
The investment for the show

531
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,460
is huge,

532
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,490
and the daily expenses
for the entire team

533
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,910
are also high.

534
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,590
If the show is suspended,

535
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
I can wait, but can they?

536
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,500
I didn't expect you to know so much
about the production team.

537
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,500
It's nothing surprising.

538
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,540
After all, my husband has joined
many projects,

539
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,310
I'm not clueless at all.

540
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,740
Stop pacing.

541
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,070
You're making me dizzy.

542
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,150
This is too bad.

543
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,180
The crew insisted
on suing the production team,

544
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,780
and the lawyer was Qin.

545
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,150
Isn't that a fight between my friends?

546
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
What's wrong with Shen Xingruo?

547
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,500
The compensation
doesn't mean much to her.

548
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,600
Why can't she just pay them?

549
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,870
It's the public comment that matters,
understood?

550
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,910
If the crew gets the public
on their side,

551
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,310
they would demand  120,000 yuan.

552
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,590
You have a point.

553
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,980
What's wrong with Shi Qin?

554
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,830
Why didn't she check who she's suing?

555
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,220
She has to confront her own friend now.

556
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,940
How can she do that to her friend?

557
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,350
Don't criticize Qin.

558
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,310
She just became official

559
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,180
and finally got a case.

560
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
How could she possibly turn it down?

561
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,030
What if her superior
gives her a hard time later?

562
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,350
That makes sense.

563
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,540
After all your analysis,

564
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,780
this is unsolvable.

565
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,180
Do you think

566
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,350
they will fight over this matter?

567
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,980
Don't worry.

568
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,310
I'm on your side.

569
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,630
You're not helping at all.

570
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,390
You're not as important as they are.

571
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,020
You're mad again.

572
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,260
What should I do to make you happy?

573
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

574
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,180
I didn't mean to shout at you.

575
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,980
I was too angry just now.

576
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,770
It's my fault. I won't do that again.

577
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,500
Sorry.

578
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,120
Calm down, all right?
Don't be mad at me.

579
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,940
Do you want a kiss?

580
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,670
Fine. What can I say? I like you.

581
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,350
Xingruo's home.

582
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,500
You go back first.

583
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,910
I'm going to have a proper talk
with them.

584
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,110
Ugh, bummer.

585
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,590
You are back. Are you tired?

586
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,780
Not really.

587
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,980
Anything?

588
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,310
Yes.

589
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,020
I would like to talk to you both.

590
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,630
Us?

591
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,020
Is Qin back?

592
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,090
Qin.

593
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,500
Qin is home.

594
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,070
The three of us

595
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,260
can have a talk tonight.

596
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,910
Didn't we just talk yesterday?

597
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:14,980
Yeah.

598
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,350
It's been 24 hours.

599
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,180
I miss you very much,

600
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,500
so let's talk.

601
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,260
I brought a bottle of fine wine.

602
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,220
Look.

603
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,540
We can drink it while talking.

604
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,130
Let's go.

605
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,910
Come on.

606
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,150
I'll go first.

607
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,780
We are best friends.

608
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,740
You are the most important people to me,

609
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,940
so I don't wish you to fight

610
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,390
over anything.

611
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,260
I called you both here

612
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,540
because I want all of us to sit together

613
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,700
and express our thoughts

614
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,260
sincerely

615
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,260
and then make peace with each other.

616
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,630
I will drink this up.

617
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,020
You can't regret it.

618
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Well, who's going first?

619
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,870
Wait.

620
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,150
Say something.

621
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,870
If you're still angry,

622
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,070
I'll bring Xu Chengzhou out right now,

623
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,150
and you two can take it out on him.
Beat him to a pulp.

624
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,690
All right?

625
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,390
I think you have some misunderstanding.

626
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,500
Qin and I

627
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,460
didn't quarrel.

628
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,780
Really?

629
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,630
You scared me!

630
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,180
I thought something had happened.

631
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,460
Why did you look unhappy
when you arrived home just now?

632
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,500
I was thinking about something
on my way back.

633
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,390
I find it strange.

634
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,220
Strange?

635
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,740
How so?

636
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,540
(Lin Xiaochen, Partner)
Ms. Lin, I told you before.

637
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,430
The owner of the defendant company

638
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,210
is the person in charge
and producer of this show.

639
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,350
She is my best friend.

640
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,260
I know.

641
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,910
However, the client specifically

642
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,310
asked you to take this case.

643
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,260
Did they say why?

644
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,130
No.

645
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,239
Shi Qin,

646
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,540
you've just become official,

647
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,590
you can't always do
the assistant's jobs.

648
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,180
You need to deal with the clients,

649
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,020
negotiate, or even
go to the court yourself.

650
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,390
What you need now is
to accumulate experience.

651
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,630
Don't give up this opportunity.

652
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,310
I know.

653
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,430
But I think

654
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,910
it's only right if I avoid this case,
isn't it?

655
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,870
The client doesn't mind,

656
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,220
so you don't have to feel awkward.

657
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,350
In this industry,

658
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,310
there will be more conflicts

659
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,870
you'll soon learn to face

660
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,030
between personal relationships
and professions.

661
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,070
Besides, you're kind of
involved in this case,

662
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,020
and you know the conditions
of both parties.

663
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,910
It's a great opportunity to learn.

664
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,180
All right.

665
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,630
What Ms. Lin says does make sense.

666
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,180
However, I'm not
an experienced or famous lawyer.

667
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,430
Why would the client specifically
ask for me

668
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,830
to handle this case?

669
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,150
So

670
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,830
I think the only possible reason is

671
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,260
that someone hopes to drive a wedge
between Xingruo and me

672
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,590
through this matter.

673
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,110
Right.

674
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,110
Why didn't they hire

675
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,670
a more experienced lawyer?

676
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm not saying that you're bad, Qin.

677
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,790
I understand.

678
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,590
There's another thing
that strikes me as odd.

679
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,940
Huang Bing said he would sue us.

680
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,110
But before we responded to it,

681
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,730
rumors started spreading
among the crews,

682
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,180
saying that we bullied him.

683
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,910
We had no other choice

684
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,020
but to put the show on hold.

685
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,500
Could it be that he

686
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,780
spread the rumors himself?

687
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,940
It shouldn't be.

688
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,670
I met with them twice.

689
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,980
Huang Bing and his wife
are simple folks.

690
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,220
Even if they ask for high compensation,

691
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,940
I don't think they'd come up
with a thorough plan like this.

692
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,630
So I believe

693
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,110
money isn't the only goal
in this matter.

694
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,020
Are you saying

695
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,350
that he's trying to ruin the show?

696
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,220
I don't know.

697
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,630
I'm worried I'm overthinking.

698
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,460
But my dear Zhu, no worries.

699
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,150
Qin and I won't grow apart

700
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,430
because of this.

701
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,070
I'll try my best to uncover the truth.

702
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,180
Qin and I are just standing

703
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,780
on our own viewpoint.

704
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,840
We just need to do our jobs,
and that's good enough.

705
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,430
I'm relieved to hear that.

706
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,700
You know what?

707
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,260
I was breaking out in a cold sweat
from fear just now.

708
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,150
Come. Drink it and relax.

709
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,700
Relax.

710
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:11,910
Who's it?

711
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,580
It's me, Lu Xingyan.

712
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,030
I have something to show you.

713
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,810
(Go Back Lover)
(Interview Time)

714
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,650
I'm truly grateful

715
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,090
(Any message for Producer Shen?)
to Xingruo this time.

716
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,330
She really cares about my feelings.

717
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,050
This incident is serious,

718
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,650
but she didn't blame me at all.

719
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,850
I'm truly grateful to her

720
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,130
for being so supportive.

721
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,690
(Do you mind the fact
that Shi Qin is the plaintiff's lawyer?)

722
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,730
As her friend,

723
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,290
I'm very happy

724
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,650
that she finally got her first case.

725
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,090
But if I say I don't mind it at all,

726
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,330
it's not possible.

727
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,850
After all, it's not me she's suing,

728
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,290
it's the entire production team.

729
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,090
Besides,

730
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,010
if anything goes wrong,

731
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,490
everyone's hard work could go to waste.

732
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,690
Why didn't you tell Shi Qin

733
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,690
what you truly thought?

734
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,250
(Why didn't you tell Shi Qin
what you truly thought?)

735
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,490
It's because I don't want
my personal feelings

736
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,370
to affect Qin's professional judgment.

737
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,250
I want her to do her job fairly.

738
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,640
