=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,450
(February 14, 2015, Valentine's Day
During Freshman Winter Break)

4
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,500
Why are you so slow?

5
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,710
It's Valentine's Day.

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,530
I took some time to freshen up myself.

7
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,630
Happy Valentine's Day.

8
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,940
Thank you.

9
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,740
Is this a postcard?
Where did you find it?

10
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,140
The postman just delivered it.

11
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,570
Aren't you the one who wrote this?

12
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,630
It is me!

13
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,380
Unexpectedly, they'd be so punctual,

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,900
that it arrived at the right time.

15
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,830
This is a postcard from two years ago.

16
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,740
Do you still remember what you wrote?

17
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,630
Of course, I remember.

18
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,380
To my future girlfriend, Shen Xingruo.

19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,190
Today is our first
Valentine's Day together.

20
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,190
We must be happily in love.

21
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,940
Meeting you...

22
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,380
You'd read it yourself.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,380
I wrote it all there.

24
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,690
(Meeting you is my lifetime's fortune.)

25
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,890
(Loving you is the
most wonderful thing.)

26
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,110
But,

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,830
how did you know back then

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,780
that we'd end up together?

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,660
I have a knack of reading people.

30
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,910
The first time I saw you,

31
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,170
I found we both have a couple look.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,270
So, I made a secret vow

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,550
that I must pursue you.

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,020
Childish.

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Yes, I'm childish.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,830
Anyway, my wish came true.

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,740
But, I still have another wish.

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,060
Do you want to hear it?

39
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,950
What wish?

40
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,230
Do you want to marry me?

41
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,110
What?

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,270
I said,

43
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,300
Happy New Year.

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:52,900
Impossible.

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,670
You must have said
more than just four words!

46
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,060
I said,

47
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,890
Happy New Year. Wishing you cheerful
and promising in all things.

48
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,710
If you don't answer me directly,

49
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,990
I'll take it as a yes.

50
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,020
Shen Xingruo agreed to marry me!

51
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,510
Shen Xingruo agreed to marry me!

52
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,890
=Episode 15=
(The eraser in my mind.)

53
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,490
(Year 2024)

54
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,570
(Guest: Shen Xingruo)

55
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,990
Who is that?

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,090
I want to show you something.

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,900
Where did you get this?

58
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,110
Didn't I tell you I asked some employees

59
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,990
to reach out to the people
around Huang Bing?

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,110
They found this in the trash bin
outside his place.

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,860
According to them,

62
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,020
they found that this clinic

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,120
has been sending Huang Bing
this medication for a very long time.

64
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,460
That means,

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,390
before Huang Bing's condition flared up,

66
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,710
he has been on medication.

67
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,900
He had myocarditis
before joining the team,

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,300
but he concealed his medical history

69
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,510
and took medicine
to control his condition.

70
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,470
That's what I'm thinking.

71
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,740
But,

72
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,990
we are currently unable to determine

73
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,820
what medicine the clinic sent him.

74
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,230
If we want to figure out that,

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,990
why don't we call and ask?

76
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,470
Hello, is this Evergreen Clinic?

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,530
Yes.

78
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,670
Hello, I'm a deliveryman
for your parcel.

79
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,470
We seem to have lost

80
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,990
one of your parcels

81
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,130
and we would like to compensate you
according to the price.

82
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,550
Could you tell me

83
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,550
what was in the parcel?

84
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,620
It was bullets.

85
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,590
Bullets?

86
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,230
Are you sure
the parcel contained bullets?

87
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,110
Shenzhi went to the battlefield.

88
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,910
I knitted 200 bullets
for him with yarn.

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,990
Shenzhi is off to war.

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,380
He can't go without bullets, right?

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,820
I don't know when Shenzhi
could come back here.

92
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,380
I'm sorry. You...

93
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,150
She hung up.

94
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,910
What bullets does she mean?

95
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,620
I'll call again.

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,380
It's unreachable now.

97
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,300
This approach doesn't work.

98
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,500
Let me think of something else.

99
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,260
All we have right now
are just assumptions.

100
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,180
We need to get hard evidence

101
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,350
that Huang Bing has been
on medication recently.

102
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,860
Yes, you're right.

103
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,620
For this, and the one just now.

104
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,980
Please help me take a screenshot.

105
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,800
Okay.

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,770
How's the footage search going?

107
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,030
Just as we thought,

108
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,060
the footage is available
from the first filming day.

109
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,590
From the first filming day

110
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,620
until Huang Bing was hospitalized,

111
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,790
we observed that he's always carrying
a thermos with him.

112
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,910
What about your side?

113
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,380
How's everything going?

114
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,550
I also asked someone
to ask Huang Bing's roommate.

115
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,500
They said that
since joining the film crew,

116
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,500
Huang Bing has been regularly
drinking traditional Chinese medicine.

117
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,940
He always kept it in that thermos.

118
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,180
He would drink it even during work.

119
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,670
Did they say

120
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,790
what the medicine was for?

121
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,790
Huang Bing only told them
it was for body nourishment.

122
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,010
And, they didn't ask further.

123
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,740
If we can't prove

124
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,910
that the medicine is for myocarditis,

125
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,740
all our previous evidence

126
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
is useless.

127
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,940
The only way

128
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,790
is to go to the clinic

129
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,230
in the Changqing Village,

130
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,380
and get his medical records
from the doctor,

131
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,110
so that we can have the solid proof.

132
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,790
You're right.

133
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,820
Lu Xingyan.

134
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,230
It's cold in the mountains.
Didn't I tell you to wear more layers?

135
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,910
I did change into a sweater.

136
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,110
Isn't this low-key enough?

137
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,990
By the way, I've been thinking

138
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,110
that a medical record might not
be enough proof.

139
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,940
You're right.

140
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,910
We need the doctor

141
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,110
to testify as a witness.

142
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,860
That would be best.

143
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,110
I checked earlier,

144
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,470
it's not far
to Changqing Village from here.

145
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,030
It will take around
four hours to arrive.

146
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,940
Let's drive there.

147
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,310
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

148
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,470
Why do you keep looking at me?

149
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,060
Why didn't you let me drive today?

150
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,620
You spent all night
going through the footage.

151
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,740
You didn't get enough rest.

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,150
You'd take a nap now.

153
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,110
But, didn't you barely sleep either?

154
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,180
I took a short nap this morning.

155
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,110
Don't worry about me.

156
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,030
Are you feeling sorry for me?

157
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,300
Alright, I'll sleep now.

158
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,530
I'll wake you when we get there.

159
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,550
Okay.

160
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,750
Let's park here and walk in there.

161
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,980
Otherwise, it's too obvious.

162
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,940
Alright.

163
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,820
The signal here is not very good.

164
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,340
The map shows that it is here.

165
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,390
This village is not big.

166
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,820
We should be able to find where it is
if we ask around.

167
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,670
Someone is over there. Let's ask them.

168
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,340
Alright.

169
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,300
Excuse me.

170
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,430
Can we ask something?

171
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,030
What do you want to know?

172
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,390
We're looking for Evergreen Clinic.

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,460
Do you know where it is?

174
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,630
We have the address.
Could you take a look?

175
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,530
(Wang Shenzhi, Evergreen Clinic, Changqing
Village, Star City, Yongzhou District)

176
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,550
What are you going
to the clinic for?

177
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,550
We heard that

178
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,030
Doctor Wang Shenzhi is very skilled,

179
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,670
so we came all this way

180
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,670
to see him.

181
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,220
Yeah.

182
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,390
Doctor Wang moved away a few years ago.

183
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,460
You should go back.

184
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,790
Do you know where he moved to?

185
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,460
Sorry, we don't know that.

186
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,670
How about you?

187
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,970
(Evergreen Store)

188
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,390
I'm thirsty. Let's go get some drinks.

189
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,150
Okay.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,890
Sorry for disturbing you.

191
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,750
Thank you.

192
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,670
Do you think what he said is true?

193
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,750
Definitely not.

194
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,530
The parcel was just delivered
a few days ago,

195
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,150
and I even got through
on the phone yesterday.

196
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,790
That's impossible they
could have moved so fast.

197
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,460
Then, there's only one possibility left.

198
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,300
He didn't want to tell us.

199
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,060
Why?

200
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm not sure.

201
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,130
Let's ask around some more.

202
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,730
Let's go get some drinks.

203
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,330
(Cigarettes & Alcohol)

204
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,550
You've bought a lot.

205
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,270
You don't look like locals.

206
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,500
Are you just passing through?

207
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,930
I've just paid for these.

208
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,460
We are just passing through.

209
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,100
The scenery here is amazing,

210
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,770
so we thought we'd stay
and explore a bit.

211
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,390
The scenery here is absolutely amazing.

212
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,510
There's a Dock Hotel nearby.

213
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,580
If you're interested,

214
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,750
you might check it out there.

215
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,180
Alright, thank you, boss.

216
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,150
We wanted to ask you something.

217
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,870
Are there clinics nearby?

218
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,650
I had an upset stomach
after having something on the way here,

219
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,830
and now I have a stomach ache.

220
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,510
There's a small hospital
by the Dock Hotel.

221
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,150
It's half an hour away.

222
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,750
If you can wait,

223
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,150
you could hear over there.

224
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,180
I can't wait any longer.

225
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,910
Is there any other place
which is nearer?

226
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,220
There is,

227
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,460
but it's in a more remote area
and harder to find.

228
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,870
You know, I can't leave here right now.

229
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,550
How about I find someone

230
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,580
to take you there in a bit?

231
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,790
That'd be great! Thank you.

232
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,460
No problem.

233
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,390
You can wait and have a seat over there.

234
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,460
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you, boss.

235
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,390
You're welcome.

236
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,670
Hello, Huang! Get over here quickly.

237
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,550
Someone is asking about the clinic.

238
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,580
Hurry up.

239
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,180
It's the two of them.

240
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,230
You two are the ones
looking for the clinic?

241
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,030
Who are you?

242
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,910
Who am I? I'm Huang Bing's brother.

243
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,030
Didn't you get enough
to bully my brother in the city?

244
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,450
Are you coming to the village
to bully him again?

245
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,150
Yeah!

246
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,060
We didn't bully Huang Bing.

247
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,030
We're just trying to get to the truth.

248
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,700
If we are in the wrong,

249
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,940
we'll pay the full compensation.

250
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,030
Truth?

251
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,320
It was just a small amount of money.

252
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,920
If you want to compensate,
you would've paid up long ago!

253
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,790
Don't you ever think
you can push us around.

254
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,030
Get out of here now.

255
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,150
What do you want?

256
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,300
Lu Xingyan.

257
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,630
Talk nicely.

258
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,750
Please stay calm.

259
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,800
We're sorry for that.

260
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,970
We'll leave here.

261
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,300
(Evergreen Store)
Don't let me see you in this village again.

262
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,940
Are you okay?

263
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,550
I'm fine. Let's think of another plan.

264
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,220
Okay.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,100
I thought you were going
to start a fight back there.

266
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,430
There were so many villagers filming us.

267
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,940
If a fight broke put
and it got posted online,

268
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,610
it would be even harder
to explain ourselves.

269
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,180
Are you still the Lu Xingyan

270
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,220
I used to know?

271
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,730
Same person, no doubt about it.

272
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,870
Ms. Shen said
we should keep a low profile.

273
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,580
I must always obey it.

274
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,700
But it is obvious now

275
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,580
that Huang Bing's family knows

276
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,180
we're looking into him now.

277
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,700
We got the address
from the delivered parcel.

278
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
But, how did they know we'd be coming?

279
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,790
Is it possible someone saw us

280
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,670
checking the security footage

281
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,940
and tipped off Huang Bing?

282
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,460
It's possible.

283
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,940
But, who could have done that?

284
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,430
Could it have been
some of his fellow villagers?

285
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,790
I'm not sure.

286
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,340
Are you okay?

287
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,150
This won't hurt me.

288
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,940
I'm so sorry

289
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,750
that my brother accidentally hit you.

290
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,790
If it hurts, just say so.

291
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,910
We're really sorry for that.

292
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,700
I'll let my brother apologize to you.

293
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,530
We really didn't mean to do that to you.

294
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,060
Girl, what's your name?

295
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,030
I... I'm Miao Miao.

296
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,430
Miao Miao, let me tell you,

297
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,700
my friend

298
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,270
was born with a bad waist.

299
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,700
So, it's not your fault
for what happened just now.

300
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,980
But if you could take us

301
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,940
to the clinic in the village,

302
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,460
we won't hold the accident against you.

303
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,150
Is that okay?

304
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,300
There's a clinic here.
Doctor Wang is very skilled.

305
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,870
He can definitely
treat your friend well.

306
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,460
Alright, please bring us there.

307
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,790
No problem. Just follow me.

308
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,160
Let's go. You can
stop acting now, drama king.

309
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,800
Since when did I have a bad waist?

310
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,920
Isn't that what I've been
saying to you since high school?

311
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,030
Aren't you used to it yet?

312
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,300
Well.

313
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,700
My waist hurts. Please walk slowly.

314
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,970
(Star City People's Hospital,
Outpatient)

315
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,060
(In-patient Department)

316
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,890
Hello, sister-in-law.

317
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,940
Tell Bing to focus on recuperating.

318
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,610
As long as I'm here,
they won't set foot in the village.

319
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,910
Just endure this for a few more days.

320
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,130
They can't afford to wait any longer.

321
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,580
Yeah, you too, take care of yourself.

322
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,430
Alright.

323
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,220
My dear,

324
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,750
are we going to get
in trouble doing this?

325
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,890
What trouble could we possibly get into?

326
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,150
You just rest assured and stay here.

327
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,030
We have to get that 120,000 yuan.

328
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,980
But I think...

329
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,580
Lawyer Shi, you're here.

330
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,750
Come in, have a seat.

331
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,750
Have some oranges.

332
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,150
Thank you.

333
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,100
Is there anything
that brings you here today?

334
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,080
Is there any update
for the 120,000 yuan compensation?

335
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,220
I came today

336
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,700
to discuss a few things with you.

337
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,550
I've looked into a lot of information

338
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,630
on Huang Bing's situation,

339
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,690
and I have to say, the chance of getting
that 120,000 yuan in compensation

340
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,220
is very slim.

341
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,110
And, for this case,

342
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,310
the production team
has all the leverage.

343
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,630
If they decide
to delay the payout,

344
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,150
there's not much we can do.

345
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,310
That's just shameless!

346
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,530
Then, let's take them to court.

347
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,830
For us,

348
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,940
the worst-case scenario
would be going to court,

349
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,780
because the lawsuit alone

350
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,460
could take a year or two,

351
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,910
especially for civil cases,

352
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,310
it takes a lot of time.

353
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,430
But,

354
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,390
I'm just giving you
the worst-case scenario now

355
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,740
so you're prepared,

356
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,430
but I'll still try my best

357
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,350
to get the best result.

358
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,460
By the way, I also wanted to ask

359
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,500
you two what is the lowest amount
you're willing to accept?

360
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,630
My husband, Huang Bing's illness

361
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,110
was caused by overwork
from the production team.

362
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,310
Why won't they compensate?

363
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,390
I want the full 120,000 yuan,
not a penny less.

364
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,630
Alright, I got it.

365
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,350
Huang Bing, are you
feeling better lately?

366
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,910
I'm getting better.

367
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,540
Getting better?

368
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,640
Don't add to the mess here.

369
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,310
Lawyer Shi,

370
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,670
Huang Bing's illness

371
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,910
isn't too serious,
but it's not light either.

372
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,310
It all depends on good care.

373
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,540
I'm

374
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,940
not well educated

375
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,110
and can't find a decent job.

376
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,630
My entire family only

377
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,940
depends on his income.

378
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,220
If he collapses,

379
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,700
what are we supposed to do?

380
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,540
I understand your situation.

381
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,700
I'll do my best

382
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,260
to help you fight for your rights.

383
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,260
Thank you so much, Lawyer Shi.
Thank you.

384
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,180
It's nothing.

385
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,150
By the way, I noticed

386
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,220
a strong smell of traditional medicine
when I walked in.

387
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,500
Did the hospital prescribe it?

388
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,630
No.

389
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,430
It's just a tonic
I've been making for him.

390
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,490
Does this have anything
to do with the case?

391
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,930
No, don't worry. I'm just
asking as part of my routine.

392
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,630
But do make sure

393
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,980
to tell me everything

394
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,430
about your situation honestly,

395
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,540
so I can help you
fight for your greatest benefits.

396
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,780
Alright, no problem.

399
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,180
Grandpa Wang.

400
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,070
Miao Miao,

401
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,180
why are you here?

402
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,260
Grandpa Wang, this person is injured.

403
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,220
Please take a look at him.

404
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,350
Where are you hurt?

405
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,460
My waist.

406
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:48,700
Let me check it.

407
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,870
You don't look injured.

408
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,700
Doctor Wang, we actually

409
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,590
came to see you specifically.

410
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,700
To see me?

411
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,799
Yes.

412
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,670
Do you know Huang Bing?

413
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,150
I don't know him.

414
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,180
Doctor Wang,
we're colleagues of Huang Bing.

415
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,350
We know that you treated him.

416
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,870
Could you please tell us

417
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,220
what his illness is?

418
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

419
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,010
- Doctor, we are...
- Here they are.

420
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,430
It's them.

421
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,820
Hurry up.

422
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,350
Aunt Zhang, take the kids away.

423
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,700
Come on, leave here.

424
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
Didn't I tell you

425
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,820
I didn't want to see you
in the village again?

426
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,870
Once we get to the truth,

427
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,070
we'll leave.

428
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,230
What truth do you need to find?

429
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,780
- Lu Xingyan.
- Hold on, don't get physical.

430
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,260
Stop! Stop! Stop!

431
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,940
Don't fight.

432
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,830
- Hold on.
- Hit me instead of him.

433
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,940
I'm the one who wants to be with him.

434
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,260
Aunt, please don't make chaos.

435
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,590
Let me battle with you.

436
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,670
Yuzhi, what's going on with you?

437
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,350
Why are you hitting people?

438
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,150
Mr. Wang, please take her away.

439
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,940
- I must stay with Shenzhi.
- Yuzhi.

440
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,020
Come on, let's go inside.

441
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,940
- Yuzhi.
- Get away! Don't touch me.

442
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,940
I want to be with Shenzhi.

443
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:05,980
Shenzhi?

444
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,670
You're confused.
That man is your husband.

445
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,150
No, he is not.

446
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,310
He is Shenzhi.

447
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,310
You can't fool me.

448
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,150
No one will separate us ever again.

449
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,150
I tell you!

450
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,980
Yuzhi.

451
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,630
This Aunt isn't in good health.

452
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,520
Let's not make a fuss.

453
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,460
Yeah, just let it go. Don't upset her.

454
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,670
You two, come out here.

455
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,070
Shenzhi, don't leave me.

456
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,740
Forget it.

457
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,260
What if her condition worsens?

458
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,070
We couldn't bear it.

459
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,590
That's right.

460
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,910
I'll wait right here.

461
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,390
Yuzhi, Yuzhi.

462
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,220
You, get away from me!

463
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,030
- Let's go. You're confused.
- Get away from me!

464
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,940
Huang,

465
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,460
please let everyone leave first,

466
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,700
so that she could calm down.

467
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,540
I'll make sure they leave later.

468
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,940
Don't worry, I won't say anything.

469
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,020
Let's leave, guys.

470
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,670
Let's go.

471
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,980
Miao Miao. Miao Miao.

472
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,390
Miao Miao, let's go home.

473
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,430
Alright, Yuzhi.

474
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,590
Come on with me, okay?

475
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,780
- Get away from me.
- Just come home with me.

476
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,220
Yuzhi,

477
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,910
I'm a doctor.

478
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,110
Shenzhi is hurt.

479
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,730
I need to apply some medicine to him.

480
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,220
Yeah, I need to treat my wound now.

481
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,030
I'll come back for you in a bit.

482
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,940
Go quickly.

483
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,260
Alright. I'm fine.

484
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,940
Make sure to take a proper look at him.

485
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,310
Thank you, doctor.

486
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,460
Hurry, go take a look for him.

487
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,670
Alright.

488
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,830
Look, they've gone inside.

489
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,780
Let's go in too.

490
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,220
Who are you?

491
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,070
Have you forgotten me?

492
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,670
Guess, who you think I am?

493
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Are you Xiufang?

494
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,870
Yes, I am.

495
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,940
Xiufang,

496
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,590
you're finally here.

497
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Are you here to help
plan my wedding with Shenzhi?

498
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,870
Yeah.

499
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,540
Xiufang, I've got everything
ready for the wedding.

500
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,460
Come inside, I'll show you.

501
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,460
Let's go.

502
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,250
(Evergreen Clinic)

503
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,590
Look.

504
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,820
This is the "Double-Happiness"
character that I cut.

505
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,020
Is this nice?

506
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,540
It is very great.

507
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,700
Have a look at this.

508
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,830
I made these boutonnieres for us.

509
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,020
You're welcome. No need to thank me.

510
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,740
Come this way.

511
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,460
Alright.

512
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,180
Come in.

513
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,460
- I also made these.
- Come in.

514
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,590
I stitched them thread by thread.

515
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,540
Yuzhi, they've traveled a long way.

516
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,590
Let them rest a bit.

517
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,540
No way.

518
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,630
She hasn't seen the wedding gown yet.

519
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,260
I'm getting married tomorrow.

520
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,070
I want Xiufang
to give me advice on them.

521
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,310
Let's take a look at it tomorrow.

522
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,110
No, I want to see them now.

523
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,980
Alright, let's see them now.

524
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,460
You don't know,

525
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,630
our house gets thieves often.

526
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,590
The clothes I made before

527
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,070
were all stolen.

528
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,460
I clearly remember

529
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,670
putting them in this wardrobe.

530
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,670
I wrapped them up carefully.

531
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
But when I turned around,

532
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,120
they were all gone.

533
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,020
No wonder you hid them so well.

534
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,700
Where are my clothes?

535
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,110
My clothes are gone again.

536
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,700
Yuzhi.

537
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,350
- Yuzhi, calm down.
- My clothes were stolen again.

538
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,590
Calm down. Think about it again.

539
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,540
Do you remember it wrong?

540
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,500
Where are my clothes?

541
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,630
- Yuzhi, calm down and think it over.
- My clothes are gone.

542
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,220
It must be somewhere.

543
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,540
Are you sure you didn't misplace them?

544
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,500
No.

545
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,150
I remember I put them in the wardrobe

546
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,540
and wrapped them up carefully.

547
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,260
The thieves came again and stole them.

548
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,540
Let's see the wardrobe.

549
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,870
I put them in the big wardrobe.

550
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,540
Now they're gone again.

551
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,780
Okay.

552
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,220
- My clothes are gone again.
- Alright, let's think it over.

553
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,540
Calm down. Calm down.

554
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,740
Will this one do?

555
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,540
It's not this one.

556
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,180
This is not nice.

557
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,150
Shenzhi won't like this.

558
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,670
I think this looks nice.

559
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,500
Really nice.

560
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,590
Look, Shenzhi said it looks great.

561
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,260
You'll look beautiful in it.

562
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,150
It's our big day,

563
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,510
and you should wear something like this.

564
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,870
Shenzhi,

565
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,430
do you think it looks good?

566
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,540
It looks great.

567
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,020
That's good.

568
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,150
As long as you like it.

569
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,740
As long as Shenzhi likes it.

570
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,910
If Shenzhi says it's good,
then it's good.

571
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,260
We've got everything ready now.

572
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,630
Do you want to take a rest first?

573
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,500
It's all ready.

574
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,390
I've been thinking

575
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,540
about this day for so long.

576
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,740
Back then, my parents

577
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,150
didn't allow me to be with Shenzhi.

578
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,830
They locked me in a room.

579
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,590
That room was so dark

580
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,870
and I was very scared at night.

581
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,700
So,

582
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,670
I would sit by the candlelight,

583
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,540
thinking about Shenzhi

584
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,540
as I sewed these things,
stitch by stitch.

585
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,780
But,

586
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,700
why didn't your parents
let you two be together?

587
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,740
You're right.

588
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,350
Why?

589
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,150
Why didn't they let us be together?

590
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,700
Why?

591
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,940
Why didn't they let us be together?

592
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,430
Because back then,

593
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,540
I had to go to the front lines.

594
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,830
Her family was afraid

595
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,430
I wouldn't come back.

596
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,540
So, they didn't allow

597
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,460
Yuzhi to be with me.

598
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,540
I thought that would be
the end of our relationship.

599
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,020
But,

600
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,540
on the day I left,

601
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,870
she came to send me off.

602
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,830
She told me,

603
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,870
"no matter how their opinion is,

604
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,020
I'll always wait for your return."

605
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,250
(Double-Happiness)

606
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:17,050
(Double-Happiness)

607
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,630
After that, I moved around a lot.

608
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,910
I quickly lost contact with the village.

609
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,350
The people in the village
assumed I was dead.

610
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,460
Then, her family forced her
to marry someone else.

611
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,460
By the time I came back,

612
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,870
she was already married.

613
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,740
After she got married,

614
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,110
we didn't keep in touch anymore.

615
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,870
Later,

616
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,670
I moved to the neighboring village

617
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,530
and learned with
an old Chinese medicine doctor.

618
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,740
We avoided each other for many years,

619
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,020
and never meet each other.

620
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,630
We feared seeing each other again

621
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,900
would stir up memories of
everything we'd been through together.

622
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,150
Until four years ago,

623
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,070
she was diagnosed

624
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,910
with Alzheimer's.

625
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,020
She didn't have any children,

626
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,590
and her husband had
passed away long ago.

627
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,150
No one was there to take care of her.

628
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,260
Her relatives eventually contacted me.

629
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,150
After all the twists and turns,

630
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,360
we finally found our way
back to each other.

631
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,150
But, she often

632
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,460
can't remember who I am.

633
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,220
So,

634
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,110
for all these years,

635
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,500
Aunt has always wanted

636
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,910
to have a wedding ceremony with you,
hasn't she?

637
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,110
You're right.

638
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,460
For the past two years,

639
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,870
she's been talking
about a wedding ceremony.

640
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,210
Perhaps it's the one thing
she can't let go in her life.

641
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,020
But, it's also good in a way.

642
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,220
Maybe

643
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,180
she's still waiting for

644
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,110
her Shenzhi to return

645
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,940
and marry her.

646
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,430
(Double-Happiness)
For her,

647
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,670
this may seem to be a good sign.

648
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:27,450
(Love House Dining Area)

649
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,510
Hello.

650
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,239
Hello.

651
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,590
You're here.

652
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,540
Have you had dinner?

653
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,070
Not yet, I'll just
order a food delivery later.

654
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,700
If you don't mind,

655
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,310
you can try my cooking.

656
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,260
I made a whole pot.

657
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,980
Really? Thanks.

658
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,310
Do you usually cook at home?
It's delicious.

659
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,540
To be honest, I'm not much of a cook.

660
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,830
This simple noodle dish
is all I can manage.

661
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,070
I cook at home pretty often.

662
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,310
If there's a chance,
you can try my cooking too.

663
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,350
Sure.

664
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,540
Then, we may go
grocery shopping together.

665
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,460
That way, I can
contribute to the meal too.

666
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,700
Why haven't I seen
Xingruo and Lu Xingyan?

667
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,870
I called Lu Xingyan this afternoon.

668
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,540
They went to Changqing Village.

669
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,260
They mentioned that Huang Bing has been
taking some kind of medicine lately.

670
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,450
So, they went to investigate.

671
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,390
Do they mean Huang Bing
is taking Chinese medicine?

672
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:51,910
How did you know?

673
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,870
When I went to the hospital
to visit them at noon,

674
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,670
there was a thermos
full of Chinese medicine

675
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,940
by Huang Bing's bed.

676
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,070
Huang Bing's wife explained

677
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,430
that it was a tonic for Huang Bing,

678
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,590
but I felt something was off.

679
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,500
That sounds weird.

680
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,700
You're their lawyer.

681
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,110
Why would they lie to you?

682
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,590
I don't know.

683
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,430
But, I feel like

684
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,020
the key to all this is

685
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,700
figuring out exactly
what kind of medicine he's taking.

686
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,430
I don't know.

687
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,740
I've got it.

(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

689
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,490
It's been some time
since the show started.

690
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,250
Producer Shen, do you have
any new insights?

691
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,090
After a recent trip
to Changqing Village,

692
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,450
I have a new perspective

693
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,810
on love.

694
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,090
Before, I always believed

695
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,010
that love shouldn't be
the only thing in one's life.

696
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,490
If you become too absorbed in it,

697
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,770
you might end up with nothing.

698
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,250
But after seeing the relationship

699
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,490
between Doctor Wang and his wife
in Changqing Village,

700
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,170
They showed me

701
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,530
another example of love.

702
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,030
They went through
all the twists and turns,

703
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,690
and they ended up

704
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,190
finding their way back to each other.

705
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,690
So, I think

706
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,170
growing old together
with someone you love

707
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,650
can be a very happy thing.

Mr. Lu, do you have
any new insights?

00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,490
It's made me even more certain

711
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,590
that as long as you can be
with the person you love,

712
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,250
that's the happiest thing

713
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,330
