00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,130
(Year 2013, Winter)

4
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,710
See you tomorrow.

5
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,350
Bye-bye.

6
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,940
Hey. Little sister.

7
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,070
Who are you calling little sister?

8
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,430
You accepted my cotton candy last time.

9
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,860
I thought you had already agreed.

10
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,500
Call me brother.

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,710
I've finished my homework.

12
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,190
I also did the math test sheet.

13
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,860
Help me check it.

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,860
Really?

15
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,300
Of course not.

16
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,500
I knew you weren't that diligent.

17
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,740
I don't want to be serious.

18
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,140
If I got serious,

19
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,110
you bookworms wouldn't stand a chance.

20
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,220
How about you test me
on my English vocabulary?

21
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,860
From A to L.

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,230
I've already memorized everything.

23
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,270
Is that a lie too?

24
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,470
No, this is true.

25
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,490
Why are you looking at me?

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,510
I'm admiring your handsome face.

27
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,130
I got it.

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,510
This is true.

29
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,550
You said, you've memorized
all the vocabularies from A to L, right?

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,770
Yes.

31
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,140
Then, translate a sentence.

32
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,740
You're the apple of my eye.

33
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,510
Apple.

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,340
Eye.

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,110
You're the apple in my eye.

36
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,130
You're just doing a literal translation.

37
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,930
That's incorrect.

38
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,100
Incorrect?

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,230
Then, what does it mean?

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,860
Look it up yourself.

41
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,140
You are the one I cherish the most?

42
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,180
Shen Xingruo,

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,060
is that how you really feel?

44
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,860
Yes.

45
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,620
Really?

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,510
Guess it yourself.

(Today, we will officially begin)

53
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,110
(Task 1)
(our first task.)

(Within 24 hours,)

55
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,460
(Specific Location B)
(during a date at specific locations,)

56
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,740
(Specific Location C)
(you have to tell one truth)

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,830
(and one lie to your ex.)

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,620
(And, you cannot tell them)

59
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,460
(which is which.)

(Classmates, Paired Guests, Best Friend)
(the sparks between our guests.)

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,060
Why aren't you going on the date?

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,300
I don't need to leave here.

65
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,000
The dating location today
is in this villa.

66
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,560
By the way, I'd like to ask you,

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,230
what is meant by the
"one truth and one lie" thing?

68
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,230
I didn't participate
in the show's planning,

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,620
but I can roughly guess their intention.

70
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,850
When falsehood becomes truth,
truth can become falsehood too.

71
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,430
Whether you love or hate someone,

72
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,260
it's often hidden
in a mix of truth and lies.

73
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,130
You can take it as a way to vent,

74
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,430
or as a confession.

75
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,700
Treat it as a little game

76
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,230
the show runners are playing with us.

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,230
We've known each other for so long.

78
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,740
We can take the chance of the game

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,300
to stir things up a bit.

80
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,110
I see.

81
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,230
Alright.

82
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,330
Where's Lu Xingyan?

83
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,860
He left a while ago.

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,870
He's probably waiting for you
at the dating location.

85
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,230
Thanks.

86
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,030
The wind is quite strong right now.

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,150
Look at our setup here.

88
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,380
There's a fire here.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,020
Another fire over there,
and another over there.

90
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,530
We need to be wary
of the fire safety issue.

91
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,430
Don't worry. It's fine.

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,230
The sun is still pretty strong now.

93
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,740
He Ming.

94
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,550
Mr. Lu.

95
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,230
Has Shen Xingruo arrived yet?

96
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,130
Ms. Xing is under
Yang Tianjiao's supervision.

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,920
She hasn't arrived yet.

98
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,230
Maybe she would be here soon.

99
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:34,990
Alright.

100
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,590
Mr. Lu.

101
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,830
Where's Shen Xingruo?

102
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,230
Why are you here alone?

103
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,860
I've already contacted
the driver just now.

104
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,140
Producer Shen has already departed
from the designated location.

105
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,430
Let's take this time
to do a quick interview.

106
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,990
Alright.

107
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,090
Please come here.

108
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:01,950
Ready?

109
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,180
Keep up.

110
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,530
Shi Qin!

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,930
I didn't expect you
to get here before me.

112
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,500
You are quite early too.

113
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,990
Why aren't they talking to each other?

114
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,530
(He: Start a conversation)

115
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
The weather today

116
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,300
is quite nice.

117
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,500
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

118
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,010
(Shi: Offer the water)

119
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,910
Thank you.

120
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,690
(He: Be more specific
for your thankfulness)

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,380
This water tastes very good.

122
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,030
The texture is particularly great.

123
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,380
Does water have a taste?

124
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,230
The mineral content in the water

125
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,150
is the most important factor
for its taste.

126
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,010
The water with low water hardness
doesn't have a sweet taste,

127
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,620
and water with high water hardness
tastes bitter and sticky.

128
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,790
This bottle of water is very pure,

129
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,230
with a balanced mineral content,

130
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,060
which is why it tastes so refreshing.

131
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,670
Is he doing an ad for water now?

132
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,060
What is he talking about?

133
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,410
(Shi: Respond to him)

134
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,990
Maybe you're just lucky

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,030
to have gotten some
good-tasting mineral water.

136
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,260
Shi Qin.

137
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,550
Do you think I'm

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,300
a boring person to talk to?

139
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,940
No, I don't.

140
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,430
I'm very happy to listen to you talk.

141
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,430
Oh my goodness.

142
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,100
Producer Shen,
the car can't get through.

143
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,060
It's in there.

144
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,300
That's fine.

145
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,580
I'm a guest this time.

146
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,110
So, I'll just follow
the arrangement of the show.

147
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,030
Then, this is for you.

148
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,460
Thank you.

149
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,030
Thank you for sending me here.

150
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,790
It's my job.

151
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,940
Lu Xingyan.

152
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,550
Let's get started.

153
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,870
Alright.

154
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,300
Back then, who confessed first
between you and Producer Shen?

155
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,990
It was me.

156
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,100
I am surprised by this.

157
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,930
I thought it would have been
Producer Shen.

158
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,870
You are handsome

159
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,980
and smart.

160
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,910
You must have been popular
among the girls, right?

161
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,750
You missed one point.

162
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,980
My greatest strength

163
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,630
is my taste,

164
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,580
which is why I fell in love
with Shen Xingruo.

165
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,220
So, at that time, did Shen Xingruo

166
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,790
give you any signals

167
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,870
that made you take action?

168
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,200
No.

169
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,430
She was quite cold to me,

170
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,270
but I didn't know why.

171
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,270
I was just drawn to her,

172
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,630
so it was always me who made
the first move towards her.

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,580
When will Shen Xingruo arrive?

174
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,910
The driver just messaged me
that he has dropped off

175
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,700
Producer Shen
at the specific location.

176
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,910
Sorry, the person you call...

177
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,820
She is not far away.

178
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,010
I think she will be here soon.

179
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,980
Let me ask you two more questions.

180
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,670
Why did they pick
such a remote location?

181
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,790
Lu Xingyan.

182
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,390
Lu Xingyan, where are you guys?

183
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,630
Keep going, bro! Go to the tower.

184
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,430
How rare it is!
You don't do advertising today.

185
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,150
I'm not that silly.

186
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,460
The footage that I record alone
will just get cut.

187
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,430
You know the show well, huh?

188
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,510
When we signed the
promotion agreement for the resort,

189
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,270
I did my research.

190
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,770
(Win)

191
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,870
Nice!

192
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,900
So, you came to complete
the task with me?

193
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,820
Otherwise?

194
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,820
Each person has to tell one truth

195
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,700
and one lie.

196
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,370
You have to complete the task with me.

197
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,710
Why are you carrying a case of alcohol
here in such a broad day?

198
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,550
Alcohol helps cowards get brave.

199
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,110
I'm afraid that you won't
say anything truthful.

200
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,270
What a joke!

201
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,180
I've already been through a divorce.

202
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,120
What would I be afraid of?

203
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,050
Open the bottle.

204
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,510
You go first.

205
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,630
Ladies first.

206
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,980
Are you trying to be a gentleman now?

207
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,100
Fine, I'll go first.

208
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,300
When I reported the wedding expenses,

209
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,550
I reported an extra 10,000 yuan
to buy a bag.

210
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,510
Guess if that's true or false.

211
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,500
It sounds like something you would do.

212
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,220
It's true.

213
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,220
Now you listen to mine.

214
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,530
Every time I told you
I needed to work overtime,

215
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,220
I was hiding in the car playing games.

216
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,100
I'd play a while before going home.

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,830
This is true.

218
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,830
That's exactly the thing you would do.

219
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,460
Fine. What about this?

220
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,790
Among the friends I played games with,
one of them was a girl.

221
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,750
That's true.

222
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Because the girl

223
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,510
was hired by me as a practice partner

224
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,180
to test you.

225
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,820
You...

226
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,250
(One statement is enough!!!)

227
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,910
Fine.

228
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,870
After we divorced,

229
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,230
I had dinner alone with another woman.

230
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,850
A fake one.

231
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,130
Who else would be blind
enough besides me?

232
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,190
What are you laughing at, Xu Chengzhou?

233
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,510
Was that the truth?

234
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,910
Have we ever been divorced
for 100 days yet

235
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,230
and you're already finding someone new?

236
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,730
What I laugh at is
none of your business.

237
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,790
Truth or lie, you figure
it out yourself.

238
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm obeying the game rules.

239
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:26,870
Well.

240
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,820
I also had dinner alone
with another man.

241
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,790
Chen Zhu, how dare you comment me!

242
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,030
You also dated another man for dinner.

243
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,710
What happened?

244
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,110
Did you guys go further?

245
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,940
Guess it yourself.

246
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,100
We're divorced.

247
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,060
Why would I tell you?

248
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm following the game rules.

249
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,630
That's fine.

250
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,730
Then, I can keep dating other women
to have dinner alone.

251
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,030
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

252
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,820
I didn't hinder you.

253
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,580
Fine. I'll do it right away.

254
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,130
When I remarry, I'll invite you
to the wedding banquet, okay?

255
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,220
I tell you,

256
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,670
you better get married
right this second!

257
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,820
If you remarry,

258
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,790
I'll definitely attend the wedding
and send you a wreath!

259
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,820
You should return that 10,000 yuan to me
and I gift that bag to my future wife.

260
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,580
- How's that?
- Sure.

261
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,100
These two's argument
could fill ten episodes.

262
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,750
So, do we still need to film it?

263
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,790
Film what?

264
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,230
Can any of this even be broadcast?

265
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,790
It's all nonsense.

266
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,430
Where do you get

267
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,580
all these questions?

268
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,790
All these questions

269
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,550
were decided together by

270
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,790
our planning team.

271
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,230
Why?

272
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,820
Who decided on the dating location?

273
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,930
It's so late now,
and Xingruo still hasn't arrived yet.

274
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,580
Are you sure she is on her way?

275
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,220
Yes.

276
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,910
We've already sent
the location to Producer Shen.

277
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,910
Who sent it to her?

278
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,180
I'm the one sending her.

279
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,010
Show it to me.

280
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,530
Show your phone to me.

281
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,750
This is the arrangement
of the production team.

282
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,390
You should trust us.

283
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,790
Trust is the foundation of cooperation.

284
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,270
The location is not even here.

285
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,030
What are you trying to do?

286
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,100
How could that be?

287
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,980
I received that this morning.

288
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,060
It is the correct address.

289
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,670
Could it be...

290
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,100
If something happens to Shen Xingruo,

291
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,720
you won't get away with it either.

292
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,050
(Low battery)

293
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,070
Shen Xingruo!

294
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,150
Why is there such a big hole here?

295
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,940
Shen Xingruo!

296
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,110
Shen Xingruo!

297
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,590
Shen Xingruo!

298
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,830
Lu Xingyan!

299
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,020
Shen Xingruo!

300
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,630
Lu Xingyan!

301
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,010
♪With you♪

302
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,210

♪Hold me into♪

307
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,780
Wait a moment.

308
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,020
Do you even have a heart?

309
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,230
How can you still be laughing
at a moment like this?

310
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,230
Hurry and give me a hand.

311
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,180
Be careful.

312
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,590
Can you walk on your own?

313
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,350
Yes, I can.

314
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,740
No problem.

315
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,830
You always pretend to be strong.

316
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,180
Let me hold you.

317
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,670
What are you laughing at?

318
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,910
I thought I could have a moment

319
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,980
to play the hero
and save the beauty just now.

320
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,010
Isn't this already
a hero-saving-the-beauty moment?

321
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,700
Yes. What Producer Shen says is correct.

322
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,150
You're always correct.

323
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,350
Anyway, where is
the exact filming location?

324
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,740
I've been wandering around
this forest all afternoon

325
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,630
and couldn't find it.

326
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,220
The location chosen by the
production team is way too remote.

327
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,350
The location Yang Tianjiao
sent you were wrong.

328
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,350
I suspect she has ulterior motives.

329
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,260
Let's head back to the filming scene.

330
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,910
Xingruo, how are you?

331
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,940
I've been so worried about you.

332
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,910
The driver took me to the wrong place.

333
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm curious now

334
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,020
what exactly happened.

335
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,110
I don't know.

336
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,220
I sent the driver several location pins.

337
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,350
Maybe he made a mistake.

338
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,110
Is that really his mistake?

339
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,940
Do you think I didn't see the message?

340
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,970
Obviously, you only sent
one location pin.

341
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,020
Show me your phone.

342
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,150
What's going on here?

343
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,980
Why are you crying?

344
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,150
Uncle Zhang, I feel wronged.

345
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,350
What happened today should not blame me.

346
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,260
I just called the driver,

347
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,380
and it's confirmed
that he got the location wrong.

348
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,950
You shouldn't put all the blame on Jiao.

349
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,500
Obviously, this is
Yang Tianjiao's fault.

350
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,260
But, what to do?

351
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,690
She's the investor's daughter.

352
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,130
It's impossible to openly offend her.

353
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,020
Uncle Zhang, the driver

354
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,980
put Xingruo in such danger today.

355
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,670
We must fire him.

356
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,590
Right.

357
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,420
Where is the driver?
We have to fire him.

358
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,460
Firing him is not necessary.

359
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,390
Everyone is just making a living.

360
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,010
It's not easy for everyone.

361
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,350
We can just remind him

362
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,540
to be more careful next time.

363
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,830
Xingruo, have you eaten yet?

364
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,980
I've prepared steak for you.

365
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,940
Come and eat something.

366
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,260
Xingruo, please calm down.

367
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,830
Xingruo...

368
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,260
Today is the first time
our production team

369
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,430
has done an outdoor shooting.

370
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
So, it's normal
for a few things to go wrong.

371
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,830
But I want to remind everyone here,

372
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,590
for the coming work,

373
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,460
I expect all of you
to put in more effort.

374
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,430
Know your position well,

375
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,150
and be clear

376
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,460
about what's appropriate to do

377
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,500
and what is not.

378
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,390
If anyone lets their personal issues

379
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,260
affect the shooting of the show,

380
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,390
I don't care who you are

381
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,940
or what position you hold,

382
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,310
I won't tolerate it.

383
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,150
Thanks for the steak today.

384
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,780
Come on, everyone, let's get ready.

385
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,830
We'll start the filming
of the show soon.

386
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,230
Come on.

387
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,230
Jiao.

388
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,540
You may leave first.

389
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,180
Mr. Lu, let's touch up your makeup.

390
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,910
Okay.

391
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,740
Xingruo, for today's incident,

392
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,030
I understand it better than anyone.

393
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,230
I'm sorry for what you experienced.

394
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,480
But, I hope you don't take
her fault to your heart.

395
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,940
From now on,

396
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,110
I let her only handle the camera work,

397
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,180
nothing else in the production team.

398
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,830
Is that okay?

399
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,630
It's not a big deal.

400
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,780
Don't we encounter things
like this so often?

401
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,310
I know she has never
been wronged at home,

402
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,540
and she treats this work as fun.

403
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,630
As long as she doesn't disrupt

404
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,230
the filming progress
of the production team,

405
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,740
she can do whatever she wants.

406
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,930
Ms. Xing is always so generous.

407
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,130
Let me help with this.

408
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,110
That's okay. Let me do it.

409
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,460
After all, you saved me today.

410
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,940
You're my hero.

411
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,740
Hey, don't tease me.

412
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,870
I'm not teasing you.

413
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,460
You came looking for me today.

414
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,940
I was genuinely touched by that.

415
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,700
Consider this

416
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,670
a little repay for your kindness.

417
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,700
It seems like this is
a blessing in disguise.

418
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,180
After so many years,

419
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,150
I finally get to have
Shen Xingruo grill meat for me.

420
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,220
They are certainly
the star of our show.

421
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,110
They do have great chemistry
as a couple.

422
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,980
Absolutely.

423
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,110
They are so sweet together.

424
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,530
I'm indulged in
the overloaded sweetness.

425
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,530
What's wrong with you?

426
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,020
I had a stiff neck a few days ago

427
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,930
and accidentally stretched it again.

428
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,150
I'm fine now.

429
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,360
Pass me the chilli flakes, please.

430
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,070
Sure.

431
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,740
I meant to ask,

432
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,460
when did you become so good
at eating spicy food?

433
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,150
I remember Aunt Pei's cooking

434
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,430
was always pretty mild.

435
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,940
The first time I had hotpot with you,

436
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,310
I realized that you
really love spicy food.

437
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,540
I thought to myself,

438
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,700
if we get to live together
in the future,

439
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,230
we'd at least have to agree
on the taste preferences.

440
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,740
So I started practicing,

441
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,410
eating spicy food every day.

442
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,070
And, gradually I found

443
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,590
that spiciness isn't a flavour.

444
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,020
It's a form of pain.

445
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,590
It stimulates the brain,

446
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,780
releasing a hormone called endorphins.

447
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,540
Lu Xingyan.

448
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,590

What do you think?

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,570
♪Always love you♪

461
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,540
Xingruo and Mr. Lu really
have such great chemistry.

462
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,120
Ms. Xing is indeed an experienced producer.

463
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,830
Her words pushed the show effect
to its full potential.

464
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,590
Is it just a show effect?

465
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,500
I think that is real.

466
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,220
After all, it's the first episode.

467
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,220
There must be a climax in it.

468
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,600
Besides, who will suddenly
confess like that?

469
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,430
Initially, I thought this part was fake,

470
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,740
but after watching it,

471
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,110
I'm not so sure.

472
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,460
This is the footage
from the GoPro in the car

473
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,590
before we set off.

474
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,310
Don't move.

475
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,780
I'm checking your wound.

476
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Be gentle.

477
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,500
I know.

478
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,390
Don't move.

479
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,980
This must be real.

480
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,070
It's understandable
if it's just for the show,

481
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,630
but the interaction
off-camera feels genuine.

482
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,980
No wonder the fans were begging
for the 'Double-Star' to appear on the show.

483
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,150
I'm shipping for them.

484
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,830
Are you that excited?

485
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,450
Stop being fascinated
by this coupling ship.

486
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,530
The highlight of a dating show
thrives on emotional ups and downs.

487
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,150
Alright, the truth and lies session is over.

488
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,310
It's time to reveal the answers now.

489
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,740
You can interview the guests now.

490
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,930
How was it? Everything is good, right?

491
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,830
That's great.

492
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,260
Thank you.

493
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:55,940
Ready.

494
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
It's time to reveal the truth and lies.

495
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,830
What's your truth?

496
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,450
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)
My truth is

497
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,770
'I'm very happy to listen to you talk.'

498
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,290
When he asked me

499
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,090
if his conversation was boring,

500
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,610
it was not.

501
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,930
I was really happy.

502
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,130
I'm not sure

503
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,290
if something I did or said

504
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,940
gave him the misunderstanding,

505
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,820
but that wasn't the case at all.

506
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,220
Most of the time, I want to talk to him.

507
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,370
I even prepare a few topics

508
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,370
ahead of time before seeing him.

509
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,690
But, when we meet,

510
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,850
I still can't say anything.

511
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,810
What do you think He Siyue's truth is?

512
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,730
I think He Siyue's truth is

513
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,490
'This water tastes good'.

514
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,450
Because that's his expertise.

515
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,490
He wouldn't lie about that.

516
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,310
What do you think Shi Qin's lie is?

517
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,330
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)

518
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,610
I think Shi Qin's lie is

519
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,650
'I'm very happy to listen to you talk'.

520
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,500
I can never find the right topic.

521
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,940
I get nervous when I see people,

522
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,250
especially Shi Qin.

523
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,250
When I look into her eyes,

524
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,570
I honestly don't know what to say.

525
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,830
Then, what's your truth?

526
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,970
My truth is

527
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,330
'This water tastes good'.

528
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,740
The water itself tastes good,

529
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,370
but it's not really
about the water quality.

530
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,810
It's because Shi Qin gave it to me,

531
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,930
so it tastes very good.

532
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,130
Being able to participate
this show with Shi Qin,

533
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,530
I am very happy.

534
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,730
But, I just don't know how to express

535
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,890
my inner joy and gratitude.

536
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,730
I've tried to find topics to talk about,

537
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,290
to keep the atmosphere lively,

538
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,010
but I don't know why

539
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,650
it feels like every time I talk,
the atmosphere just cools down.

540
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,670
If I could,

541
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,050
I'd love to be an interesting person
in front of her.

542
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,220
Then, what is your truth?

543
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,290
(I'll definitely send you a wreath.)
If Xu Chengzhou remarries soon,

544
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,610
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)
I'll definitely buy 120 wreaths

545
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,130
and deliver them to his wedding,

546
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:42,930
to let him mourn for

547
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,890
our marriage which lasted
less than 100 days.

548
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,810
The reason I say that

549
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,210
isn't because I care about him.

550
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,250
It's because I can't stand
his smug and opportunistic behavior.

551
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,030
I can't even remember
what she said yesterday.

552
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,870
Chen Zhu talked so much.

553
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,410
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)
She came over with the alcohol,

554
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,450
and we drank it together.

555
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,370
She rambled on
about all kinds of things.

556
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,850
My head was spinning.

557
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,090
Her biggest issue is she talks too much.

558
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,090
I can't even tell
what she is trying to say.

559
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,070
I couldn't catch her point.

560
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,170
Chen Zhu predicted your answer,

561
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,870
and let us remind you

562
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,700
that you mentioned
having dinner with other girls

563
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,980
and considering remarriage.

564
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,630
That was just nonsense
in the heat of the moment.

565
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,410
If I have dinner with any woman,
it's either Chen Zhu or a client,

566
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,450
or my mom.

567
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,570
There's no way I have dinner
with any other women.

568
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,130
I finally

569
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,490
escaped from Chen Zhu's jail,

570
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,130
why would I jump into another grave?

571
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,610
No way.

572
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,500
Xu Chengzhou,

573
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,710
was everything you just said the truth?

574
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,580
I...

575
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,020
Don't answer.

576
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,230
The interview content can only be revealed
after the first episode airs.

577
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,540
Please don't spoil anything
for each other until then.

578
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,810
Does guessing right or wrong
affect us in any way?

579
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,940
We'll use your performance in this round

580
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,830
to tailor the dates for the next round.

581
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:15,570
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)

582
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,290
(Lu Xingyan, let's start over.)

583
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,870
Is this a lie?

584
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,210
No.

585
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,250
This is a truth.

586
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,020
Before the show started,

587
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,820
Lu Xingyan was with me
for the preparation process.

588
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,610
During that time, the memories of us

589
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,730
kept flooding back to me bit by bit.

590
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,650
The night when he sprained
his ankle because of me,

591
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,610
my feelings of gratitude
surged to the peak.

592
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,390
At that moment,

593
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,580
I really wanted to start over with him.

594
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,130
But soon after I said it out loud,

595
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,930
I came back to my sanity.

596
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,170
For either of us,

597
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,890
that's not a good choice.

598
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,050
Staying as we are now

599
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,970
is the best state for both of us.

600
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,490
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)

601
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,250
This line.

602
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,330
(Lu Xingyan, let's start over.)

603
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,500
Do you think this is Shen Xingruo's lie?

604
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,570
A few nights ago,

605
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,130
she told me herself

606
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,090
that we would only be friends
from now on.

607
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,010
So, the chances of us
getting back together are very slim.

608
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,690
What is your truth, then?

609
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,170
All of those.

610
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,530
I've never lied to Shen Xingruo.

611
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,570
When we were together back then,

612
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,010
we promised never to lie to each other.

613
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,970
That hasn't changed, I won't lie to her.

614
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,330
So, everything I've said to her
is the truth.

615
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,270
What do you think Lu Xingyan's lie is?

616
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:02,490
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)

617
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,290
Lu Xingyan once told me,

618
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,290
he would never lie to me.

619
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,250
So, to this day,

620
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,770
I still believe he wouldn't lie to me.

621
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,390
This is what the director
just sent over.

622
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
After the breakup,

623
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,940
did you try to contact each other

624
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
to start over again?

625
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,690
(Revelation Moment Of Truth And Lies)

626
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,490
No.

627
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,910
Why not?

628
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,850
Did something specific

629
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,770
lead to your breakup?

630
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,830
Shen Xingruo can't go back,

631
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,190
but I can.

632
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,870
I'm already outside
her hostel right now.

633
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,530
This is our tenth time reunion
in a foreign country.

634
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,830
Let me see what she is doing right now.

635
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,620
Is it convenient for you to answer?

636
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,890
Not really.

637
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,020
"Go Back Lover" first episode
filming has ended.

Yes. Okay.

I don't see any issue.

690
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,750
Let's keep moving forward.

691
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,940
You guys go ahead.

692
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,140
Why are you here?

693
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,230
I'll be here for some time.

694
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,230
Are you done with your work?

695
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,720
Come with me
to the furniture store, okay?

696
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,780
No.

697
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,030
If you want to go, go by yourself.

698
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,830
It's just that this hotel,
their product selection is terrible.

699
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,100
The pillows are so high.

700
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,230
My neck feels like it's going to break.

701
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,940
Come with me if you're free.

702
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,060
You're buying a pillow?

703
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,450
Fine. Let's go.

704
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,000
Let's go.

705
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm coming.

706
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,460
It's still very early. What's up?

707
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,410
Shen Xingruo has left early
in this morning.

708
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,080
I heard from Chen Zhu that she went
to the furniture store with Yu Si.

709
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,230
Do you want to go check it out?

710
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,500
No.

711
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,750
She went to the furniture store
with Yu Si.

712
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,350
Why would I go?

713
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,540
She didn't invite me.

714
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,310
That's true.

715
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,830
But, are you not jealous?

716
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,500
No.

717
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,530
Why would I be jealous?

718
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Just pretend yourself.

719
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,050
(Yang Tianjiao)

720
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,830
Mr. Lu, we reviewed

721
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,980
the filming footage from this week

722
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,310
and we think
that you're missing some scenes.

723
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,230
So, today, we might need you
to be with us

724
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,060
reshoot a few things.

725
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,630
I've got a task now.

726
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,040
I get to go.

727
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,230
Still don't want to go?

728
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,620
This is soft and comfortable.

729
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,580
This is more supportive.

730
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,310
Xingruo, which one
do you think I should choose?

731
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,430
You said that buckwheat pillows
help with stiff necks?

732
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,020
Yes.

733
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,430
My neck hurts a bit,
but I don't have a stiff neck.

734
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,330
I don't need that.

735
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,540
I'm not buying it for you.

736
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,350
Lu Xingyan had a stiff neck
a few days ago.

737
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,530
I'm buying this pillow for him.

738
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,600
I'll take this one, thanks.

739
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,140
When I invited you before this,

740
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,460
you found every excuse not to come.

741
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,870
Today, I barely had to ask,

742
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,830
and you came right over.

743
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,530
So you are buying
something for Lu Xingyan.

744
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,790
Are you losing your mind again?

745
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,270
Can't you be a little more clear-headed?

746
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,430
I'm just buying a pillow.

747
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,390
What's the big deal?

748
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:20,940
My neck still hurts.

749
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,140
I'm not sleeping well either.

750
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,500
Can't you show some concern for me?

751
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,030
In our store,
we have the aromatherapy scent

752
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,060
that calms the mind.

753
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,350
It's great for sleep.

754
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,310
Do you want to check it out?

755
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,580
Sure, where is it?

756
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,580
This is pretty nice.

757
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,390
I think this smells good, too.

758
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,160
Really?

759
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,460
Yeah, this is nice.

760
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:50,030
Am I right?

761
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,080
I like whatever you like.

762
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:52,870
Alright.

763
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,790
I'll get two of this type.

764
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,460
Why did you choose to film here?

765
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,580
It's to show

766
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,140
Mr. Lu's impression
as a perfect family man,

767
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,430
to gain more audience's attention.

768
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,390
What do I need to do?

769
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,750
Just pretend to shop, that's all.

770
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,540
Alright.

771
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,060
Mr. Lu, how about we move over here?

772
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,390
The light seems better here.

773
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,540
Let's step back a bit

774
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,790
and capture his most natural reactions.

775
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,339
Okay.

776
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,580
Thank you.

777
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,500
Here's your thing.

778
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:20,980
How much is it?

779
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:22,680
Let's pay separately.

780
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,270
Don't mention it.
You're too polite with me.

781
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:24,790
No.

782
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,430
I'm buying this aromatherapy scent
for Lu Xingyan.

783
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,430
So, we should pay separately.

784
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,830
Even the aromatherapy scent is for him?

785
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,870
I don't know what to say to you.

786
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,350
If it's for Lu Xingyan,

787
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,710
you should have told me earlier.

788
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:43,750
Now,

789
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,100
we've got the matching couple's items.

790
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
Lu Xingyan, why are you here?

791
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,870
I'm reshooting some footage.

792
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,870
Xingruo.

793
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,750
You brought him here?

794
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:16,940
What a coincidence.

795
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,270
I didn't expect to run into you here.

796
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:20,750
Have you done filming?

797
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,790
Almost done.

798
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,940
I'll head back
and organize the footage.

799
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,350
How could this happen?

800
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,350
Are you tailing us?

801
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,910
Didn't he just say?

802
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,130
He's filming for the show.

803
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,190
Of course, that could be
just coincidental.

804
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,060
Otherwise, I wouldn't know
you guys got matching couple's items.

805
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Matching couple's items?

806
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,230
Didn't you have poor sleep
and had a stiff neck?

807
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,910
I bought you a buckwheat pillow
and aromatherapy scent.

808
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,030
Well,

809
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,870
no good deed goes unpunished.

810
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,940
Maybe you can just
gift it to me directly.

811
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,500
I'm sorry.

812
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,430
I misunderstood you before getting to know
the exact situation.

813
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,020
It's okay.

814
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,830
You have been always
emotionally unstable.

815
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,130
It's not the first time we see it.

816
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,750
We are used to it.

817
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,980
Can you please stop talking?

818
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,140
I'm answering a call.

819
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:47,020
Hello, Zhang Xu?

820
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,100
You seemed so anxious just now.

821
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,940
I thought you were going
to hit me again.

822
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,460
Hit you?

823
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,430
That's unnecessary.

824
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,190
Moreover, I trust her.

825
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,120
I know nothing is going on
between you two.

826
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,830
How do you know

827
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,100
nothing is going on between us?

828
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,270
Let me tell you clearly today,

829
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,620
I like Xingruo.

830
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,430
I've had a crush on her for years.

831
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,630
I've been getting close to her
under the guise of friendship.

832
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,710
Aren't you afraid
that I'll tell her everything?

833
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,100
Of course, you can tell her.

834
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,230
But, how do you think
about her reaction?

835
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,620
She'll definitely think

836
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,750
you're saying these things

837
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,190
out of your jealousy

838
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,390
and insecure feelings.

839
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,310
And then, the two of you...

840
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:43,940
So...

841
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,060
So, I hope you would tell her.

842
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,030
What are you guys talking about?

843
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,460
Nothing much.

844
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,100
Zhang Xu just called me,

845
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,390
said there's a meeting tonight
to discuss the publicity plan.

846
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,790
We should get to go now.

847
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,430
Alright.

848
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:26,850
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

849
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,770
On the first day of shooting,

850
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,410
(What did Producer Shen tell you?)
when Shen Xingruo was washing dishes with you,

851
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,610
she turned off the microphone.

852
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,890
What did she tell you?

853
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,940
I think I've fallen
for Lu Xingyan again.

854
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,790
Are you okay?

855
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,060
After we broke up,

856
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,140
I kept thinking

857
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,620
about how bad things were between us.

858
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,870
How poorly he treated me.

859
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,620
But only now I realize

860
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,100
he was so good to me.

861
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,540
Between us,

862
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,430
the closeness and the heart-fluttering feelings,
are things no one else can give me.

863
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,530
(What did Producer Shen tell you?)

864
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,290
You should ask Xingruo that.

865
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,330
Why do you ask me?

866
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,930
We asked her,
but she wouldn't reveal it.

867
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,130
If Shen Xingruo didn't reveal,
then I shouldn't say anything either.

868
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,410
Please stay tuned
for the next episodes of our show.

869
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,810
Who knows, there will be a related plot.
