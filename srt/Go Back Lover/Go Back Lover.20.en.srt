=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,090
(Year 2016. Before New Year's Eve.)

4
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,380
What are you doing?

5
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,660
Chatting with my roommates.

6
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,710
We're going to be seniors soon.

7
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,220
Our lecturers asked us

8
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,550
to think about our internships.

9
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,710
Where do you want to intern?

10
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,270
Actually, I haven't thought about it.

11
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,580
I've always been attending classes
in a disciplined manner.

12
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,020
Now that it's time to think about work,

13
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,110
I don't know what I want.

14
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,710
I didn't expect you to be lost.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,780
You usually look resolute.

16
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,630
You're not as good as me at this.

17
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,660
My goal in life is clear.

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,070
What's your life goal?

19
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,220
Marrying you.

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm talking about work.

21
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,660
Is marriage considered work?

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,140
You don't need

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,660
to be too anxious or stressed

24
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,940
about work.

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,190
When you graduate,

26
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,270
we'll get married.

27
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,530
I'll support you financially.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,550
You'll support me financially?

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,070
Are you Stephen Chow
from King of Comedy?

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,270
I don't want you
to support me financially.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,830
You'll ruin me

32
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,020
and dislike me,

33
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,580
and then you'll kick me out.

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,180
How is that possible?

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,580
How could I dislike you?

36
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,510
This is impossible.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,300
Let me tell you.

38
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,300
The point of this matter

39
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,990
isn't whether you like me.

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,460
The point is that I can't pin my value

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,900
on others.

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,620
I need to create value myself.

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,580
Value that belongs only to me.

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,580
Do you get what I mean?

45
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,430
Yes.

46
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,230
Not really.

47
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,300
But it doesn't matter.

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,230
Anyway,
no matter what decision you make,

49
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,900
I'll support you unconditionally.

50
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,230
In conclusion,

51
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,860
I'll like you forever.

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,950
Are you some hopeless romantic?

53
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, I am.

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,460
You don't like it?

55
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,830
Yes.

56
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,830
Aunt Pei.

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,140
How dare you complain?

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,230
Aunt Pei.

59
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:18,450
=Episode 20=
(The name engraved in my heart.)

60
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,850
(Go Back Lover)

61
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,270
(After recording six episodes,)

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,510
(New Chapter, New Dates)
(our program has entered a new chapter.)

63
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,620
(Shen Xingruo. Lu Xingyan.)
(Tomorrow,)

64
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,790
(Zhai Jiajing. He Siyue.)
(we'll start a new round of dating.)

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,340
(Chen Zhu. Xu Chengzhou.)
(This time,)

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,430
(the male guests
will ask the ladies out.)

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,110
(What kind of sparks)

68
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,300
(will there be
between the newly paired guests?)

69
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,950
(Please look forward to it together.)

70
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:54,970
Hi.

71
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,140
Sit.

72
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,230
I want to talk to you

73
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,460
about the next date.

74
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,620
Do you have any special ideas

75
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,300
for your next date?

76
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,580
Actually...

77
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,510
Actually, I don't want
to date Zhai Jiajing.

78
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,790
He Siyue.

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,790
I really don't understand
what you're thinking anymore.

80
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,910
Do you remember what you told me

81
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,550
before we started filming?

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,230
When Lu Xingyan approached you,

83
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,740
you said you didn't have an ex,
so it's inappropriate.

84
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,940
What's the matter?
You found your ex now?

85
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,790
It's not like that.

86
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,670
I want to participate
in the show with Shi Qin.

87
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,740
Shi Qin?

88
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,060
Why?

89
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,740
When we reunited that day,

90
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,030
it felt like we were back in our youth.

91
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,740
I think she felt the same as I do.

92
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,350
After we met again,

93
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,260
it was the first time I saw her smile.

94
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,230
So I was thinking

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,350
I would help her move on
as soon as possible

96
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,060
if I participate in the show with her.

97
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,670
But I want to ask you a question.

98
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,150
Why do you care so much about Qin?

99
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,110
Is it just because
you two are classmates?

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,620
I've

101
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,740
been secretly paying attention to her

102
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,260
since high school.

103
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,430
I'm not particularly good

104
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,910
at expressing my feelings.

105
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,910
I never expressed

106
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,740
my feelings,

107
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,790
so

108
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,180
I want you to help me.

109
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,910
I really want to reconnect with Shi Qin.

110
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,350
I want her to find out my feelings

111
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,470
through this show.

112
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,060
Okay.

113
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,790
Thank you.

114
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,620
Have you forgotten

115
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,990
all the things you said?

116
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,110
No.

117
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,180
I really like Shi Qin.

118
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,740
Then why do you keep doing things

119
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,550
that hurt Qin?

120
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,930
I don't want to do this either, but...

121
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,700
I promised Zhai Jiajing

122
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,860
to keep her business a secret.

123
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,350
Keep the secret for Zhai Jiajing then.

124
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,700
Stay away from Qin.

125
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,670
He Siyue.

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,060
Stop being such a pushover, okay?

127
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,700
We have no control

128
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,180
over any agreement or secrets

129
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,230
between you and Zhai Jiajing,

130
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,740
But please stop hurting Qin.

131
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,670
If you really like Qin,

132
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,110
you should fight to get her back.

133
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,110
Just explain to her
and clear up your misunderstanding

134
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,910
instead of dwelling on it.

135
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,860
How come you don't understand

136
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,590
such a simple thing?

137
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,230
Sorry.

138
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,700
I didn't handle all this well.

139
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,430
I'll make up for my mistakes.

140
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,590
Shen Xingruo.

141
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,740
Thank you for telling me these,

142
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,230
but

143
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,740
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

144
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,180
What favor?

145
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,850
(Xingruo)

146
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,470
Hello, Xingruo?

147
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,260
Hello, Qin.
What are you doing? Are you busy?

148
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,150
I'm all right. What do you
want to talk to me about?

149
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,350
I'd like you to come back

150
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,910
and reshoot
some of the variety show's footage.

151
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,550
I thought

152
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,550
I've finished filming.

153
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,860
You don't need to go on dates.

154
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,590
I mainly want you to come back and shoot

155
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,940
some scenes
between you, me and Chen Zhu.

156
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,700
You also know

157
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,230
that the theme of our show

158
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,430
is Old Friends Reunion.

159
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,700
So the interaction
between the three of us

160
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,860
is important.

161
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,230
Well, Qin.

162
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,740
Do you have time?

163
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,030
No problem.

164
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,380
Okay.

165
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,110
I'll send you

166
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,180
the shooting location and time in a while.

167
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,380
Okay.

168
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,620
- I'll hang up now. Bye.
- Bye.

169
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,060
Thank you.

170
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,180
We'll film according to this.

171
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,470
This is the location
where we'll film today.

172
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,300
This way.

173
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,820
Is the mic on?

174
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,220
Yes.

175
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,670
Why are Xingruo and Chen Zhu
not here yet?

176
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,270
They're

177
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,180
almost here.

178
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,430
Wait there for a while.

179
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,510
What brings you here?

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,390
Aren't I filming

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,510
with Chen Zhu and Xingruo?

182
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,150
I...

183
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,820
I asked Shen Xingruo to lie for me.

184
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,030
Shi Qin.

185
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,340
I really want to see you again

186
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,150
and explain everything to you.

187
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,510
I think we've made it clear.

188
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,870
If there's nothing else,

189
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,220
I'll leave first.

190
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,180
Shi Qin.

191
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,340
I'm really sorry.

192
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,750
It's my fault
for the thing with Zhai Jiajing.

193
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,220
I shouldn't have been such a pushover,

194
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,180
but there's really nothing between us.

195
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,060
Why do you meet every week then?

196
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,870
That's because...

197
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,580
Your mic.

198
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,910
Why did he turn off the mic?

199
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,940
Xing specifically said

200
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,060
that this scene won't be included.

201
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,030
It doesn't matter.

202
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,100
Okay.

203
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,670
I see.

204
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,750
Does Zhai Jiajing know

205
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,430
that you told me everything?

206
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,910
I've already informed her in advance.

207
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,100
Don't worry.

208
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,910
I wanted to tell you that day

209
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,980
that I think

210
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,340
we're only
old classmates and old friends.

211
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,980
Other than that,

212
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I don't have any other ideas about you.

213
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,510
I saved you at the beach that year

214
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,430
just out of friendship
between classmates.

215
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,460
I accompanied you
to psychological counseling

216
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,300
just to help you
get better as soon as possible.

217
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,340
Zhai Jiajing.

218
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,870
Shi Qin's the one I like.

219
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,060
There's no place
for anyone else in my heart.

220
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,670
I have one more thing to tell you today.

221
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,750
I plan to tell Shi Qin about us.

222
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,060
I don't want her
to have any misunderstandings

223
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,150
about this matter.

224
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,910
You said
you would keep it a secret for me,

225
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,510
but you saw my ugly side

226
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,180
and wanted to expose it to the public.

227
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,510
He Siyue.

228
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,750
Have you considered how I'll feel?

229
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,750
I've helped you for so many years.

230
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,390
I don't owe you anything.

231
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,700
And I'll only tell Shi Qin.

232
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,180
I believe

233
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,750
she won't tell anyone else.

234
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,390
Sorry.

235
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,870
I shouldn't have asked.

236
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,030
It's not your fault.

237
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,790
I've been wondering lately

238
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,870
why I never had the courage

239
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,430
to say all this.

240
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,670
The most fundamental reason

241
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,980
is that I've been avoiding

242
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,910
telling you that I like you.

243
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,910
Do you remember?

244
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,670
I told the production team
at the beginning of the show

245
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,300
that I could keep pretending
to have a crush on you.

246
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,700
I lied.

247
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,790
I don't need to pretend.

248
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,980
I've liked you

249
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,300
secretly

250
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,460
since a long, long time ago.

251
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,430
In fact,

252
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,180
I don't remember exactly

253
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,430
when this fondness started.

254
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,460
But I keep wanting to see you.

255
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,820
I can't help looking at you.

256
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,510
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

257
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,910
I finally have the chance
to speak to you for the first time,

258
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,910
but what you don't know

259
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,910
is that I've rehearsed this scene

260
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,700
in my mind countless times.

261
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,750
Nothing is impossible
for a willing heart.

262
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,870
But I was still very nervous

263
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,180
when I met your eyes.

264
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,340
Shi Qin.

265
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,060
Can I borrow your Chinese test paper?

266
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,980
I heard you got full marks
for your essay.

267
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,630
I want to study it.

268
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,670
Okay.

269
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,790
Is the physical education class over?

270
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,630
Where are you going?

271
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,300
I want to go back to the classroom.

272
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,910
Why?

273
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,670
But when you're in trouble,

274
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,870
I don't have the courage
to stand in front of you.

275
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,670
I really hate myself

276
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,270
for being such a coward.

277
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,580
Why can't I be braver?

278
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,820
So I made up my mind

279
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,510
that I would tell you
all this in person

280
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,300
when we graduated.

281
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,670
(Turn your dream into motivation
and don't waste your youth.)

282
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,180
(Nothing's impossible.)
The statement "Nothing's impossible"

283
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
is encouragement for myself.

284
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
I've been blaming fate.

285
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,180
I blame it
for making us go around in circles

286
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,670
and miss out on so many years.

287
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,180
But I now understand

288
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,980
what we missed out on

289
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,220
was never because of fate.

290
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,980
It's because of my timidity.

291
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,870
It's because of my cowardice.

292
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,750
It's because I found

293
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,180
all kinds of excuses for myself.

294
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,300
Actually,

295
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,750
I'm grateful

296
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,220
that we had this misunderstanding.

297
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,180
It made me more confident

298
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,270
in my beliefs

299
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,910
and no longer timid.

300
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,460
Shi Qin.

301
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,100
You're my childhood dream.

302
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,910
Are you willing to be with me?

303
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,390
But

304
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,870
I had a failed marriage.

305
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,100
Do you really not mind?

306
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,510
What era is this?

307
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,790
It's normal to have past relationships.

308
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,220
You don't need to worry.

309
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,700
All that matters it that you're willing

310
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,180
to be with me.

311
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,300
Sometimes I really want to ask God

312
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,340
why only my fate is so chaotic,

313
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,300
but today

314
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,940
I think I found the answer.

315
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
It turns out that God has already

316
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,940
given me the best gift.

317
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,340
I just never realized it.

318
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,270
He Siyue.

319
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,940
Over the years,

320
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,220
I've actually
been secretly in love with you too.

321
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,790
Since we met,

322
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,180
you have always been

323
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,430
my unattainable first love.

324
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,790
Thank you for coming into my life.

325
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,870
And thank you

326
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,980
for helping me heal my wounds

327
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,270
when I was at my lowest.

328
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,580
If it weren't for you,

329
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,430
I don't think I would have been able to

330
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,100
move on so quickly,

331
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,940
nor would I have started a new life

332
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,940
so quickly.

333
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,390
So He Siyue,

334
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,340
thank you for liking me.

335
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,700
I'm willing to be with you.

356
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,500
Sorry.

357
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,910
I'm late.

358
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,150
My parents are traveling abroad,

359
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,540
so I saw them off at the airport.

360
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,590
It's fine.

361
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,020
Before I came here, I was wondering

362
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,740
why you decided to have a date

363
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,940
at the art exhibition.

364
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,980
I came here and found out

365
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,220
that my dad's
holding an art exhibition here.

366
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,390
I just found out either.

367
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,630
Chen Fei
sent me two tickets two days ago,

368
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,020
saying that your dad
had asked his friend

369
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,780
to exhibit these paintings.

370
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,430
It's considered his last wish.

371
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,870
I thought

372
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,180
we could
take this opportunity to check it out.

373
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,870
Do you want to go in and take a look?

374
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:22,010
(Father And Daughter. See It, Hear It.
Shen Guangyao.)

375
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,780
These large paintings
are really beautiful.

376
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,330
(Shen Guangyao.
You Are Five This Year.)

377
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,870
Which artist

378
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,980
created this small drawing?

379
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,390
The artist

380
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,590
is standing next to you right now.

381
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,020
I guessed it.

382
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,700
I didn't expect

383
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,830
your dad to keep this drawing
after all these years.

384
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,670
Maybe these memories

385
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,110
are important to him.

386
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,870
You are five this year.

387
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,430
You are six this year.

388
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,310
Seven years old.

389
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,450
(Shen Guangyao. You Are Two This Year.)

390
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,890
(Shen Guangyao.
You Are Three This Year.)

391
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,540
Three years old.

392
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,180
I found out that you started learning
to draw when you were three.

393
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,150
Is this my house?

394
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,500
This is the day

395
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,910
my dad sent me to your house.

396
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,180
Call me if anything happens.

397
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,220
My biggest wish at that time

398
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,780
was to leave him completely.

399
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Now,

400
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,110
my wish finally came true.

401
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,310
This was during "Race Against Time".

402
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,980
So your dad was there that day.

403
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,980
I refused to meet him at that time,

404
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,980
so

405
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,180
he chose to record it this way.

406
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:47,530
(Shen Guangyao.
You Are Seventeen This Year.)

407
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,110
After I left home at 16,

408
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,630
I never drew for him again.

409
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,430
Maybe

410
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,390
he was waiting for me

411
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,590
to fill these canvases myself.

412
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,220
Lu Xingyan.

413
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,460
Thank you.

414
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,020
I know

415
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,910
you've been trying

416
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,540
to repair my relationship with him.

417
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,700
If it weren't for you,

418
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,780
I probably wouldn't have met him

419
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,830
before he passed away.

420
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,630
We both talked it out

421
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,460
before he passed away.

422
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,220
I don't have any regrets

423
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,910
with my dad.

424
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,980
Xingruo.

425
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,630
It's late.
Are you still working overtime?

426
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,460
Yes.

427
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,870
The variety show still needs
a proposal to attract investment.

428
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,150
Why are you two here?

429
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,940
You can tell her.

430
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,180
I have some news for you.

431
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,980
What news?

432
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,180
He Siyue

433
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,220
confessed his feelings to me today.

434
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,910
We're

435
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,540
officially a couple now.

436
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,940
Good.

437
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,940
Hurry. Tell me all about it.
I want to know.

438
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,110
Good wine and good food.
Let's chat over the meal.

439
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,150
Let's go.

440
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,540
I didn't expect it.

441
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,260
He Siyue is usually quiet,

442
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,590
but he said such touching words

443
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,430
when confessing his feelings.

444
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,700
Right? I didn't expect it either.

445
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,630
However,

446
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,670
we're elated

447
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,020
that you two can get together.

448
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,830
Great.

449
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,700
Shen Xingruo, let me ask you.

450
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,220
Have you always known

451
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,540
that He Siyue
has always had a crush on Qin?

452
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,390
You didn't say anything

453
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,700
when things got so chaotic before.

454
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,220
How dare you not tell me now?

455
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,980
This can't be
entirely blamed on Xingruo.

456
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,980
He Siyue told me

457
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,740
he asked Xingruo to keep it a secret.

458
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,110
No, Zhu.

459
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,020
This is my fault too.

460
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,780
I was wondering

461
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,980
what if He Siyue backs off

462
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,940
if I make this matter public?

463
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,460
I don't want to get too involved
in their relationship.

464
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,500
It won't happen again.

465
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,310
I'll never make such a mistake again.

466
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,430
I know you did it for our own good.

467
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,830
So, Zhu...

468
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,780
Fine, I'll forgive you this time.

469
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,980
Think carefully
about how to compensate me.

470
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,460
I'll treat you two to a delicious meal.

471
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,700
Can we eat now? I'm hungry.

472
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,350
Is it spicy?

473
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,980
Speaking of which,

474
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,220
how was your date
with Xu Chengzhou today?

475
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,830
Let me tell you.

476
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,830
Xu Chengzhou really surprised me.

477
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,830
Let me show you
the photos he took of me today.

478
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Did Xu Chengzhou take all these for you?

479
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,630
He took these photos.

480
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,700
Look at these.

481
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:38,740
Good job.

482
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,910
But

483
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,150
it's because the model's pretty.

484
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,350
You're so smug.

485
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,020
Earlier,

486
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,110
isn't he bad at taking photos of me?

487
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,020
I'm always angry with him about it.

488
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,700
He also went to the photographer
in our team

489
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,390
to learn some photography techniques.

490
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,940
Next, let me tell you. It's simple.

491
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,350
Let's first use the tripod
to determine your shooting height

492
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,430
and your shooting position.

493
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,430
From the camera, we can predict

494
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,390
that we need to place the person
on the third line on the left

495
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,120
to shoot their whole body.

496
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,110
Then, step into the camera

497
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,700
and take a photo
with our Bluetooth shutter first.

498
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,430
After checking
the photo you just took,

499
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,500
if you find
that the person is too small,

500
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,540
you need to
stand closer to the camera.

501
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,780
Follow this method once or twice,

502
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,090
you'll be satisfied
with your position.

503
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,430
He had always thought

504
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,780
that taking photos was trivial.

505
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,780
So no matter
how many times I scolded him,

506
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,180
he didn't take it to heart.

507
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,980
But he understands now.

508
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,910
All big things

509
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,870
are accumulated bit by bit

510
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,460
from these trivial things.

511
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,780
So

512
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
this is his first step to change.

513
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,220
Things will get better.

514
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,940
What's the matter?

515
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,630
I can't describe it,

516
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,390
but I feel like you and Xu Chengzhou

517
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,780
have both grown up.

518
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,870
Indeed.

519
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,070
You were willing

520
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,500
to apologize for him.

521
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,430
He's also willing to change for you.

522
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,980
This was something I never dared
to think about before, okay?

523
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,830
At the end of the day,

524
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,670
we still have to thank Producer Shen.

525
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,980
Producer Shen

526
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,980
brought us all together

527
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,460
and helped Qin find He Siyue.

528
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,780
You also made my ignorant ex-husband

529
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,700
grow up overnight,

530
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,870
so

531
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,460
let's raise a toast

532
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,910
to Producer Shen.

533
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,110
Who was scolding me just now?

534
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,630
Why are you so vindictive?

535
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,780
Cheers.

536
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,430
(Today,)

537
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,430
(the much-anticipated "Go Back Lover")

538
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,830
(will premiere online.)

539
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,180
(Go Back Lover)
(The eight guests of the show)

540
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,150
(will witness this moment
with all the audience.)

541
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,420
(How will everyone react)

542
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,700
(Go Back Lover starts airing at 12.)
(when they see themselves)

543
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,700
(on the screen?)

544
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,460
(Let's look forward to it.)

545
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,550
It's on.

546
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,910
He Siyue.

547
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,310
Thank you for your car.

548
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,670
I saw the car parked outside.

549
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,930
I thought you had already arrived.

550
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,780
No.

551
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,630
I was exhausted
after seeing a client off yesterday

552
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,630
that I parked my car outside

553
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,670
and took a taxi home.

554
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,830
All done. Thank you, Mr. He.

555
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,590
Okay, thank you.

556
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,940
I'll go in first.

557
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,220
Let me do it.

558
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,970
(Go Back Lover
officially starts airing at 12 today.)

559
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,040
Thank you.

560
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,690
It's all right.

561
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,880
Quite similar.

562
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,390
What are you doing?

563
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,460
No.

564
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,390
I... I'm afraid you'll hit me.

565
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,260
No, I wanted to apologize to you.

566
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,260
I was too impulsive.

567
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,460
I hit you
without understanding the situation.

568
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,350
Sorry.

569
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,700
It doesn't matter.

570
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,910
You did it for Qin.

571
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,740
I can understand.

572
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,910
You can understand, right?

573
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,020
So I really can't bear

574
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,390
to see Qin suffer any injustice.

575
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,310
I apologize to you this time,

576
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,590
but

577
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,940
if such a thing happens in the future,

578
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,260
you've seen what I'm capable of doing.

579
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,670
What are you guys talking about?

580
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,220
Hurry, sit.

581
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,020
We're talking about

582
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,940
sending you both some blessings

583
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,740
and remind He Siyue.

584
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,540
What did they remind you?

585
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,430
Nothing.

586
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,540
Sorry.

587
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,700
I'm late.

588
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,700
Welcome.

589
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,910
Thank you for cooperating
with our campaign.

590
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,180
It's my job.

591
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:49,980
After all,

592
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,310
I signed a contract
with your production team.

593
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,500
I know a bit about the law.

594
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,500
Besides,

595
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,540
no one knows what the result will be

596
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,500
until the end of the show.

597
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,430
Now that everyone's here,

598
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,980
let's look at the trailer.

599
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,910
We'll film
some footage of everyone together.

600
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,590
Okay?

601
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,150
Let's start.

602
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,170
(Go Back Lover)

603
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,830
I'm Lu Xingyan.

604
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,070
I'm Shen Xingruo.

605
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,180
I'm Xu Chengzhou.

606
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,220
I'm Chen Zhu.

607
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,020
I'm He Siyue.

608
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,910
I'm Shi Qin.

609
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,700
(Youth isn't a period of time)

610
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,150
(for them,)

611
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,350
(but a person.)

612
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,910
(It's someone they'll fly)

613
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,830
(thousands of miles to see)

614
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,150
(and someone they can only see)

615
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,460
(by taking a time machine.)

616
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,980
This is the first time
we meet in Germany.

617
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,740
The production team is really attentive.

618
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,430
They even found
footage from "Race Against Time".

619
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,910
I provided this material.

620
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,150
I'll definitely be there

621
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,110
for every important moment
of Xing's life.

622
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,110
Good shot.

623
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,540
Lu Xingyan.

624
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,310
Tell me the truth.

625
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,910
Did you already plan

626
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,350
to win Xingruo back

627
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,830
when you went on the show?

628
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,350
No, really.

629
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,540
Really.

630
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,910
I just wanted to cooperate at that time.

631
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,350
Listen to his lies.

632
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,940
Won't I know about his business?

633
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,630
The first time
the production team called him,

634
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,870
he was so nervous.

635
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,870
It's like he was going on a blind date.

636
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,590
He spent a long time
choosing just two outfits.

637
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,740
He ended buying an entire outfit.

638
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,730
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

639
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,110
Enough.

640
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,740
Tell me. I want to hear about it.

641
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,980
Tell me.

642
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,260
Okay, I'll tell you one more thing
since you want to hear.

643
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,020
Didn't Mr. Yu come?

644
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,150
We had a meal with Mr. Yu.

645
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,910
Mr. Yu said

646
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,630
he wants to move the show to Germany.

647
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,670
Gosh.

648
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,540
Lu Xingyan's face turned pale with fear.

649
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,540
You don't know
how barren the entire resort was

650
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,150
those two days.

651
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,150
You're quite good
at pretending to be calm.

652
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,640
I didn't expect you
to be like this in private.

653
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,740
I knew you were emotionally unstable.

654
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,310
My emotions
toward grass aren't that stable.

655
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,220
So many things happened at that time,

656
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,430
why didn't you tell me?

657
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,630
Why should I tell you?

658
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,670
You have more pressure
producing the show than I do.

659
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,740
There are many things
he didn't tell you.

660
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,350
Tell me.

661
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,190
Since you want to know, I'll tell you.

662
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,910
Go on.

663
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,540
Didn't you break up with him
at that time?

664
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,750
He kept asking me to drink with him.

665
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,750
I asked him
to drink less and stop drinking.

666
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,060
He said: "No.

667
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,980
Only when I am intoxicated

668
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,460
can I forget Shen Xingruo."

669
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,020
You guys can chat.

670
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,580
I know a cake shop that's delicious.

671
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,830
Ask the driver to pick me up.

672
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,910
My car is being serviced.

673
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,790
Isn't your car at the entrance?

674
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,760
Yes, my car is at the entrance.

675
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,710
Here.

676
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,790
Thanks.

677
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,890
Why did you
turn your right face 45 degrees

678
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,010
to the camera just now?

679
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,620
I did it for the audience to...

680
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,910
Be safe.

681
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:51,910
Bye.

682
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,870
Hurry back.

683
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,390
Besides...

684
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,140
By the way...

685
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,830
How disgusting.

686
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,060
How am I disgusting?

687
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,830
Qin.

688
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,870
Why are you talking about me again?

689
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,980
Everyone says shows are fake.

690
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,730
- You two are real.
- Qin.

691
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,530
Hurry and record
the behind-the-scenes footage.

692
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,940
Her ears are red.

693
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
No.

694
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,360
=Go Back Lover=
