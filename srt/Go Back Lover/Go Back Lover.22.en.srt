What are you doing?

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,900
You're awake.

6
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,070
Are you doing something

7
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,790
behind my back?

8
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,430
No.

9
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,510
Is there anything I can hide from you?

10
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,340
What's this?

11
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,790
This is

12
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,950
hair.

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,870
Lu Xingyan.

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,820
You're not secretly
measuring my finger, are you?

15
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,310
No, definitely not.

16
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,670
I

17
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,620
heard online

18
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,670
that if two people's hair
can be tangled together,

19
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,260
they can be together forever.

20
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,350
That's what they say online.

24
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,670
How is Lu Xingyan?

25
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,980
He almost recovered.

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,860
It won't affect our final shoot.

27
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,860
The popularity of our show

28
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,630
has now reached 18 thousand.

29
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,100
We'll soon surpass our rival,

30
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,070
"Love Diary".

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,540
Amazing, this is great news.

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,670
Speaking of, there's something

33
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,100
I want to discuss with you.

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,420
We found a new pre-show advert client,

35
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,580
which is L Trip app.

36
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,580
The person who contacted us

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,860
thought our show is good

38
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,190
and popular.

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,230
But they just couldn't get
their boss, Mr. Zhou, to approve it.

40
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,100
Why is Mr. Zhou in our way?

41
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,510
He thought that our show

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,470
isn't popular enough.

43
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,790
I think Mr. Zhou might not be
the target audience of our show.

44
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,540
His circle

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,470
might not be our target audience.

46
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,140
In order to make him feel

47
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,790
the popularity of our show,

48
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,100
we should let him
have more physical experience.

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,070
Physical experience?

50
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,670
Let him see our ads

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,390
wherever he goes.

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Let's bombard him

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,630
with our show from all angles.

54
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,630
He'll feel our popularity.

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,300
But our funding is limited.

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,580
Then let's invest our money

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,790
where Mr. Zhou can see it.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,070
Do you have his home address?

59
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,700
Yes, let me check.

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,230

He said our show is very good.

88
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,310
Not only his employees are watching,

89
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,070
but his nephews and nieces
are also watching it.

to sign the contract tomorrow morning.

in advertising for us.

reached 19 thousand.

00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,190

Among the netizens'
many comments on our show,

146
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,140
the most popular one

147
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,700
is that they hope
we can hold a livestream

148
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,660
so that the CPs can answer questions
and interact online.

149

Do you have any ideas
for the livestream's location?

153
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,220
We basically filmed the show

154
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,220
in the villa.

155
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,700
If we're holding a livestream,

156
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,700
we can find

157
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,750
a place
that's quite different from the villa

158
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,630
so that the audience
can see something different.

159
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,190
Sure, no problem.

160
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,870
Okay, let's start preparing then.

161
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,070
We'll invite
three pairs of permanent guests

162
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,310

with the netizens online.

163
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,550

164
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,190
Shall we invite them?

165
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,110
If we've already
aired the third episode,

166
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,660
it would be best
if the challengers can come.

167
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,310
In these two days,

168
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,990
sort out
the guests' relationship progress.

169
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,660
See what state their relationships is in
in the third episode.

170
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,990
Here's a reminded.

171
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,460

from interfering with each other

during the livestream.

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,390
what the audience will ask,

188
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,630
so we can't unify the answers.

189
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,830
The only thing I need to remind everyone

190
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,390
is that we have only aired
the third episode

191
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,900
on the platform.

192
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,300
I hope you can maintain

193
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,420
the status of your CP
in the third episode.

194
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,990
The challengers will appear
in the third episode.

195
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,940
Follow PD

196
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,510
will give you a brief recap later.

197
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,630
Ms. Xing.

198
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,180
At this time,

199
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,830
you're having a date
with Mr. Yu at the archery hall.

200
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,260
Let me remind you

201
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,470
that you argued with Mr. Lu
during your last date.

202
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,110
Mr. Lu even stopped filming
because of it.

203
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,390
Okay, you two

204
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,660
are waiting to be chosen
by the challengers in the third episode.

205
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,260
You even argued with each other.

206
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,780
You dressed up and stood at the door.

207
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,020
She said you looked like a doorman.

208
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,780
She

209
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,060
looked forward
to being chosen by her challenger.

210
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,230
Be mindful

211
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,020
of the scale of your interaction.

212
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,420
This episode

213
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,390
is about you two
and your challenger, Zhai Jiajing,

214
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,490
going to a bookstore together.

215
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,940
Shi Qin, you're still unsure

216
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,830
whether He Siyue likes you.

217
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,780
Be careful

218
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,390
about your words and actions
in the livestream.

219
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,630
Maintain the state of your CP.

220
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,180
Don't reveal

221
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,630
the final coupling.

222
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,180
Okay?

223
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,510
Fellow Follow PDs.

224
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,020
Take our guests over.

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,140
This way.

226
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,110
- Let's go.
- We haven't started yet.

227
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,060
What are you doing?

228
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,710
The countdown for the livestream begins.

229
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,830
Five.

230
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,180
Four.

231
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,420
Three.

232
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,420
Two.

233
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,630
One.

234
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,540
Welcome to the first livestream
of "Go Back Lover".

235
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,990
Thank you

236
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,660
for your continued support of our show.

237
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,350
So far our show

238
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,660
officially has over 20 thousand hits.

239
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,140
To satisfy the audience's curiosity

240
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,660
about our guests,

241
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,660
(Go Back Lover)
we have invited all the guests here today.

242
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,630
This include three pairs of couples

243
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,020
and two of our new challengers.

244
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,300
Firstly, let them say hello to everyone.

245
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,750
Hello everyone, I'm Shen Xingruo.

246
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,300
Hello, I'm Lu Xingyan.

247
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,020
- We're Double-Star CP.
- We're Double-Star CP.

248
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,180
Hello, I'm Chen Zhu.

249
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,110
Hello, I'm Xu Chengzhou.

250
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,710
I'm from the Sun Inn

251
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,630
that warms you and me.

252
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,630
On this bright

253
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,780
and sunny day,

254
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
welcome

255
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,900
to the special livestream

256
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,300
of "Go Back Lover",

257
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,710
exclusively sponsored by Sun Inn.

258
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,870
Welcome everyone.

259
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,510
Chen Zhu and I are Congee Cooking CP.

260
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,060
Hello everyone, Shi Qin.

261
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,630
Hello, I'm He Siyue.

262
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,180
We're When CP.

263
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,830
Hello everyone, I'm Zhai Jiajing.

264
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,900
Hello everyone, Yu Si.

265
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,470
The two of us...

266
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,300
Aren't a CP.

267
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,590
But I hope you'll continue
watching our show

268
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,110
to find out who we'll couple up with.

269
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,750
Okay, that's all for the introduction.

270
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,660
Let's move on to the interactive part.

271
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,470
I hope you

272
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,630
will be active in the comments section.

273
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,350
Comment, like,

274
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,830
and chat with our guests online.

275
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:13,990
Firstly,

276
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,590
Double-Star CP will answer
questions from the audience.

277
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,300
The first question is for Mr. Lu.

278
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,260
This question is a bit harsh.

279
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,660
The netizen asked

280
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,940
if you felt used by your ex-girlfriend

281
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,390
who is the producer

282
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,630
to participate in a dating show?

283
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,060
Every choice I make

284
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,940
is the result
of weighing the pros and cons.

285
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,510
The same goes
for participating in the show.

286
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,590
I don't know if she's using me,

287
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,110
but at least it proves

288
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,510
that I'm still valuable.

289
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,660
So ​​did you two team up this time

290
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,260
to make money together?

291
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,990
Producers are different.

292
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,390
You can even
use your relationship for money.

293
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,180
Since the show started filming,

294
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,470
I haven't participated

295
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,230
in setting the rules for the show.

296
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,830
So compared to other guests,

297
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,870
I just have

298
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,420
the title of producer.

299
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,420
It was very difficult
to find guests for this show

300
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,630
at the beginning.

301
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,140
I remember
that there was a lot of demand

302
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,420
for Double-Star CP online.

303
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,590
After careful consideration,

304
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,390
I chose Lu Xingyan

305
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,870
to be a guest on the show.

306
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,260
(They're so sweet. No way.)
A netizen asked again

307
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,390
if you and Lu Xingyan
are pretending.

308
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,060
Do you have a script for the show?

309
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,830
It's impossible that a variety show

310
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,020
doesn't have a prerequisite setting.

311
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Because we have to decide
the dates' location

312
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,390
and the dating rules.

313
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,780
Under these premises,

314
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,180
we won't interfere

315
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,540
with the guests' relationships.

316
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,110
So please don't worry.

317
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,590
The guests' reactions
you see in the show

318
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,990
are all real.

319
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,470
Last question.

320
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,020
(Double-Star CP)
I saw Lu Xingyan hospitalized.

321
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,390
(You got back together, right?)
Shen Xingruo took care of you.

322
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,110
Have you gotten back together?

323
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,660
I was indeed hospitalized
for some reasons

324
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,110
some time ago.

325
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,660
My parents weren't at home at the time.

326
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,060
and and I had no other relatives around.

327
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,390
So her taking care of me

328
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,390
should be considered

329
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,180
a humanitarian concern.

330
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,020
Actually,

331
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,390
friends who know both of us

332
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,590
know that our families are old friends.

333
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,390
He's not only my friend,

334
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,060
but also a guest on my show.

335
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,180
If anything happens to him,

336
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,780
I won't be able
to continue filming my show.

337
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,140
Producer Shen's statement

338
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,710
made us anticipate how Double-Star CP

339
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,830
will turn out.

340
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,390
Netizens in the livestream

341
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,990
are calling on Double-Star CP
to follow the instructions

342
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,630
and take
three sweet consecutive photos.

343
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,710
Let's fulfill everyone's wish.

344
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,590
Camera, get ready.

345
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,390
Peace.

346
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,830
Heart shapes.

347
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,180
Fingers interlocked.

348
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,780
Okay.

349
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,300
Let's move on to When CP.

350
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,900
A netizen wants to ask He Siyue

351
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,020
why you have a crush on Shi Qin
for ten years,

352
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
but never told her?

353
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,830
I'm not expressive.

354
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,510
Many times,

355
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,710
I don't have the courage
to express my fondness and ideas.

356
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,810
That's how I missed
the best time to confess my feelings.

357
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,300
A netizen wants to know

358
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,590
when do you think is the best time.

359
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,420
I think

360
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,590
one is to see
whether the other person's state

361
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,590
is suitable for me
to express my feelings

362
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,990
and

363
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,390
whether I planned a future

364
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,990
for her.

365
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,110
The netizen asked

366
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,060
if you

367
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,180
hadn't planned for the future
in the past ten years.

368
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,630
Or is it because

369
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,020
Shi Qin was in a relationship.

370
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,180
It's my problem.

371
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,140
Your problem?

372
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,180
What problem?

373
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,230
I...

374
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,630
It's not him.

375
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,420
I was in a failed relationship.

376
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
I know this person.

377
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,870
The woman was divorced.

378
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,540
Shi Qin was divorced?

379
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,990
It's better not to listen
to rumors about such a thing.

380
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,780
It's better to hear
the answer of the person involved.

381
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,660
She works
at the law firm next to mine.

382
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,940
I also saw her ex-husband visiting her.

383
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,350
- Is she divorced?
- Why is she quiet?

384
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,490
Ignore them. Talk about other stuff.

385
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,510
Yes, I was divorced.

386
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,110
A divorced woman in a dating show?

387
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,020
What is she doing there?

388
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,510
Can't a divorced woman
take part in a dating show?

389
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,470
Do you want a married woman
to join a dating show?

390
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,060
Do divorced women

391
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,300
have no right to seek happiness again?

392
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,940
Firstly,

393
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,710
no show
seems to have explicitly rule out

394
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,060
divorced women.

395
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,590
Besides, I never thought

396
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,260
of deliberately hiding this matter.

397
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,780
Because I also know

398
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,460
that a failed relationship

399
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,110
isn't something I can just deny

400
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,310
and pretend that it never happened.

401
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,350
I used to be troubled,

402
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,070
guilty and insecure
because of this identity.

403
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,550
But my friends told me

404
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,700
that it's better

405
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,270
to accept the past and move on bravely

406
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,070
than to stay where I am.

407
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,030
That's why I came to this show.

408
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,500
He Siyue has always been single
and has never been in a relationship.

409
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,310
Wouldn't you feel at a disadvantage

410
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,870
to be coupled up
with a divorced woman?

411
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,180
Did you travel through time
from the Qing Dynasty?

412
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,310
Listen to what you're saying.

413
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,980
I think

414
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,070
we shouldn't be prejudiced
against divorced women.

415
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,350
Everyone has their past

416
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,980
and past relationships that have ended.

417
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,940
It's no big deal.

418
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,590
Instead of focusing on the past,

419
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,590
think more about the future.

420
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,700
It's almost time.

421
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,310
At the end of the Q&A session,
I would like to ask Shi Qin a question.

422
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,460
As a divorced woman,

423
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,180
is there anything
you want to tell everyone?

424
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,740
I want to tell everyone that

425
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,980
you have the right to pursue happiness,

426
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,460
no matter what you've been through.

427
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,900
Besides, we should encourage women

428
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,140
to break free from these shackles.

429
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,530
(I support Shi Qin. Good luck.)

430
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,790
(I support Shi Qin. I wish you luck.)
I saw a lot of friends supporting me

431
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,030
(Shi Qin, good luck. I support you.)
in the comments.

432
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm grateful
that there are so many kind people.

433
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,460
Thank you for giving me
strength and courage.

434
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,460
Okay.

435
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
I see that netizens

436
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,660
have changed their focus
to our Congee Cooking CP.

437
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,700
The comment section
is already full of questions,

438
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,070
so is our Congee Cooking CP

439
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,870
ready?

440
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,500
Come on, everybody.

441
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,870
Calm down.

442
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,350
The first question is for Chen Zhu.

443
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,980
Okay, let's check out the first one.

444
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,140
(Chen Zhu is so pretty,)
Chen Zhu, you're pretty and rich.

445
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,660
(Unemployed internet addict)
Why do you have to get involved

446
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,270
with an internet addict
like Xu Chengzhou?

447
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,530
No, who are you
calling an internet addict?

448
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,030
What man doesn't play games?

449
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,350
I just like playing games.

450
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,220
If I were younger,

451
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,500
I would have gone pro.

452
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,830
Besides, I'm not unemployed.

453
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,740
I'm the vice president
and financial director

454
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,740
of Sun Inn.

455
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,270
Calm down.

456
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,900
This question is for Chen Zhu.

457
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
It'll be your turn soon.

458
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,350
You can answer as much as you want.

459
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,550
I think

460
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,940
Xu Chengzhou sometimes

461
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,420
seems a little

462
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,740
nonsensical and unreliable,

463
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,110
he's actually
very gentle and considerate to me.

464
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,900
So there's no problem.

465
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,790
And I think

466
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,390
I actually have a lot of shortcomings,

467
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,500
so I'm also working hard
to correct them

468
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,310
and try to get better slowly

469
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,630
so that I can get closer to him.

470
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,740
(What happened? Didn't they argue? )
Is Congee Cooking CP back together?

471
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,420
Didn't they
just have a fight at the judo gym?

472
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,740
Chen Zhu doesn't sound right.

473
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,590
Did I miss an episode?

474
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,610
(Play along!)

475
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,030
But

476
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,550
as I gradually improved and got better,

477
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,500
I realized

478
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,310
that he couldn't keep up with me.

479
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,140
A man like him

480
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,070
whose mouth is faster than his brain

481
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,140
needs me
to spend a lot of time and energy

482
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,110
to train him.

483
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,110
It will cause me to become irritable
and easily angry.

484
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,350
Okay, another netizen said,

485
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,900
Xu Chengzhou,

486
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,900
Chen Zhu scolds you every day,

487
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
you're so pitiful.

488
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,660
I'm so pitiful.

489
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,980
I consider it doing a good deed.

490
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,310
Another netizen said since you said so,

491
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,140
your relationship exists only in name.

492
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,700
Why join the show?

493
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,790
(Xu Chengzhou answered so quickly!)
This actually happened

494
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,110
(These two will argue again later.)
before we join the show.

495
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,030
(They're really dramatic.)
He asked Xingruo to ask me.

496
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,900
He also swore to Xingruo

497
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,660
that from now on

498
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,030
I'm the most important person to him.

499
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,070
He also said his buddies and games

500
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,350
will have to step aside.

501
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,590
He said
he'll be faithful to me till death.

502
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,870
He said he will still love me

503
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,980
even if I turn into a lamp.

504
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,790
No, come on.

505
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,140
It was you who found Xing and said

506
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,550
that you always
acted like a spoiled brat with me

507
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,500
and was always angry with me.

508
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,350
Only after we separated
did you realize how important I was.

509
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,980
Besides, you also said
that no one in this world

510
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,790
can stand you except me.

511
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,870
Didn't you say these?

512
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,070
No, how could you...

513
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,550
No, you said it yourself that...

514
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,550
Are... Are you really so mad at me
that you vomited?

515
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,180
I... I'm trying to be dramatic.

516
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,030
No.

517
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,830
I didn't vomit out of anger.

518
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,390
My stomach is just a little upset.

519
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,940
Sorry.

520
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,350
We had a small issue just now.

521
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,180
Sorry.

522
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,700
The questions in the comments section

523
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,180
are now directed to our challengers.

524
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,590
A netizen asked,

525
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,980
Yu Si, are you here for Shen Xingruo?

526
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,630
Of course.

527
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,180
I also occasionally read some comments

528
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,590
about my and Xingruo's
Rainbow Encounter CP

529
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,500
over the years.

530
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,980
I know what you're thinking.

531
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,350
But as to whether I'll succeed.

532
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,870
Again.

533
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,830
Just watch the show.

534
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,070
Another netizen asked Zhai Jiajing.

535
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,270
Why did you join the show?

536
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,180
The setting of this show
is Old Friends Reunion.

537
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,500
I really like this idea.

538
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,390
It lets me get back together
with the people I loved

539
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,660
back then.

540
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,350
(Mingli High School Year 2, Class 1
Entrance Exam Results)

541
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,310
They accompanied me through my youth

542
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,390
and are deeply engraved
in my memories.

543
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,700
Shen Xingruo is amazing.

544
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,310
She pushed He Siyue to second place.

545
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,070
Zhai Jiajing is third place now.

546
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,830
I'm fourth.

547
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,870
Mr. Wang.

548
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,070
Jiajing.

549
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,500
I came here

550
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,660
to talk to you about this year's
school anniversary performance.

551
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,270
Don't worry about it.

552
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,590
I've already practiced the songs.

553
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,220
This year's
school anniversary performance

554
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,870
is different from previous years.

555
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,980
Each class can only
participate in one performance.

556
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,790
Besides that,

557
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,940
all performances
after the school anniversary performance

558
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,180
will be ranked.

559
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,070
How about this? Every day after school,

560
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,390
I'll practice for two more hours
after finishing my homework.

561
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,310
There will be no problem.

562
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,940
Look.

563
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,310
I know you're hardworking

564
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,420
and that you play the piano well,

565
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,270
but I want Shen Xingruo to go this time.

566
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,740
Shen Xingruo
is also a grade 10 piano player.

567
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,870
Besides,

568
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,270
she has also won awards
in some major competitions.

569
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,310
I think she's more suitable.

570
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,420
You know

571
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,980
this concerns the class' honor.

572
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,350
I hope you can understand.

573
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,270
Especially Xingruo and me.

574
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,070
We later joined
"Race Against Time" together.

575
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,390
I witnessed the moment
when she won the competition

576
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,590
and also saw the touching moment

577
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,630
when Xingyan proposed to her.

578
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,590
I thought

579
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,790
we would go our separate ways

580
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,460
after graduating from university.

581
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,630
I didn't expect
the world to be so small.

582
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,550
After everything,

583
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,590
we were brought back together.

584
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,870
Xingruo.

585
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,590
So I'm grateful to the production team

586
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,110
for giving me this chance.

587
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,980
I'm willing

588
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,500
to work

589
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,070
with my old friends

590
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,550
to make our show a success.

591
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,870
What's the matter?

592
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,310
Mr. Yu, do you
have any comments about my answer?

593
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,420
I just didn't expect you
to change so quickly.

594
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,700
I never like

595
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,740
to make unnecessary efforts.

596
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,830
Mr. Yu's words last time enlightened me

597
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,590
and made me make my choice.

598
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,370
(We wish the show success.
The show gets better.)

599
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,530
(We exceeded 20 thousand hits.
Double-Star CP, get back together!)

600
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,590
(The show will get better. Good luck!
I wish the show success.)

601
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,790
Thank you very much
for supporting our show

602
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,070
all this while.

603
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,140
Our show
has exceeded 20 thousand hits.

604
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,590
We hope

605
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,630
you can continue to support

606
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,630
our show.

607
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,740
I wish "Go Back Lover" a great success.

608
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,550
Qin.

609
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,500
You slut.

610
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,420
Did you divorce me
to become a couple with another man?

611
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,900
What are you doing?

612
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,700
Hold him down!

613
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,220
He Siyue.

614
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,830
Everyone.

615
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,110
(This is so exciting.)
Turn off the livestream. Turn it off.

616
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,890
What's going on?

617
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,250
Give me.

618
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,220
Let me go.

619
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,900
Who are you? Do I know you?

620
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,830
Li Qi.

621
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,940
Someone provided your company
with information

622
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,230
and reported you for domestic violence,

623
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,140
so you were fired.

624
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,420
Who are you?

625
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,310
How did you know?

626
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,110
I'm a classmate
of Shi Qin and Shen Xingruo.

627
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,830
I came to you
to talk about your business.

628
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,420
Okay, now tell me

629
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,110
who took the information

630
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,550
to our company to report me.

631
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,500
I can't say who it is.

632
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,500
Logically speaking,
this is between you and Shi Qin.

633
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,830
If you two don't tell others,

634
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,270
who else would know?

635
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,830
Shen Xingruo.

636
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,180
It's her.

637
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
The show that Shi Qin is filming

638
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,140
is indeed produced by Shen Xingruo.

639
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,980
She met someone new

640
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,140
on the show

641
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,140
and had a great time every day.

642
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,980
I got it.

643
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,310
I've always wanted a child with her,

644
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
but she refused.

645
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,590
I got it now.

646
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,830
She just wants to be a slut, right?

647
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,030
Yeah.

648
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,070
If she

649
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,500
wants to spend her life with you,

650
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,390
how could she
not want to have children with you?

651
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,030
Yes.

652
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,790
So she started having an affair

653
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,550
with that guy from then.

654
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,980
Li Qi.

655
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,590
I really sympathize with you.

656
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,900
You had a job and a wife,

657
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,270
but now you lost your job
because of someone else.

658
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,940
Your wife left too.

659
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,180
If I were you,

660
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,830
I can't accept it.

661
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,870
If I can't accept it,

662
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,900
what am I supposed to do? Right?

663
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,270
Give them a taste

664
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,500
of their own medicine.

665
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,900
I'm telling you.

666
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,460
Without their meddling,

667
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,830
we wouldn't have turned out like this.

668
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,390
Let me go.

669
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Let go!

670
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,590
Stay still.

671
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,070
I gave you everything.

672
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,110
I married you and gave you everything.

673
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,590
But what did you do?

674
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,310
You fell for another guy, didn't you?

675
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,870
Where's your shame?
Where's your conscience?

676
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,830
He Siyue, don't.

677
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,900
Let the police handle this.

678
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,310
- Everyone, please take the guests away.
- He Siyue.

679
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,390
Hurry. This way.

680
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,270
- Hurry.
- Listen to me.

681
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,030
Take him away.

682
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,590
Shen Xingruo!

683
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,980
You're good.

684
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,180
You went to my company and reported me,
didn't you?

685
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,900
- I won't spare you.
- Go.

686
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,220
Come back!

687
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,940
Did I let you go? Come back!

688
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,830
Hurry, take him away.

689
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,790
Come back!

690
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,870
Go.

691
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,660
How did this guy get in?

692
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,420
What have the stagehands been doing?

693
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,420
We only fenced off
one side of the beach.

694
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,270
He came in from the other side.

695
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,870
He seems to be familiar with our venue.

696
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,790
Now that this matter has become a fact,

697
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,420
let's think about it later.

698
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,590
Everyone heard

699
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,870
what Li Qi said.

700
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,270
And the incident
of He Siyue beating Li Qi.

701
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,590
Let's think about what
to do with this first.

702
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,630
We've communicated with the platform

703
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,270
about the livestream playback.

704
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,310
The part where Li Qi barged in

705
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,180
has been cut out.

706
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,830
Okay.

707
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,270
Our rival
has caught on to this incident.

708
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,510
Several relevant official accounts
have published articles.

709
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,180
Our publicity team has contacted them

710
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,870
and asked them to delete
the relevant videos and articles.

711
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,980
Ms. Xing, look at this.

712
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,980
Didn't we

713
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,590
already turn off the livestream?

714
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,700
This angle

715
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,390
doesn't look like our camera.

716
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,220
Did Li Qi arrange it in advance?

717
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,500
Li Qi can't do so much by himself.

718
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,660
I think someone must be helping him.

719
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,030
Who is it?

720
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,940
Calm down.

721
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,030
Go on with the meeting.

722
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,870
I'm going outside to call Lawyer Zhai.

723
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,180
(Go Back Lover's)
Hello.

724
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,550
(Male Guest, He Siyue,)
I'm a guest on "Go Back Lover".

725
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,420
(Publishes Apology Video)
He Siyue.

726
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,460
I published this video today

727
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,070
to express my deepest apologies

728
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,900
to everyone.

729
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,180
During the last livestream,

730
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,790
I lost control of my emotions

731
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,900
and hit Mr. Li Qi.

732
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,900
Regardless of the purpose,

733
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
hitting someone is definitely wrong.

734
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,500
(Lawyer's Statement)
(Star City Daoming Law Firm)

735
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,870
The official account
has debunked the rumors.

736
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,870
I guess Li Qi was the troublemaker.

737
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,550
Shi Qin is really scheming.

738
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,550
She looks soft-spoken,

739
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,790
- but she already found someone new.
- Does Li Qi have any other evidence?

740
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,460
(Li Qi received death threats.)
Lawyer Zhai Jiajing was appointed.

741
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,030
Hereinafter referred to as our lawyer.

742
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,500
(Li Qi released)
Gosh.

743
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,940
(a video of himself being threatened.)
Ask for proof, and you'll get it.

744
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,460
- (Variety shows now have no limits.)
- Aren't these the guests?

745
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,740
This is a gang crime.

746
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,030
How disgusting.
They even sent a lawyer's letter.

747
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,350
(I knew Shen Xingruo and Lu Xingyan)
Just two hours

748
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,350
(coupled up to make money.)
since "Go Back Lover"

749
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,940
released the lawyer's letter,

750
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,420
Li Qi released a video

751
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,140
of himself being threatened.

752
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,420
The video is quite blurry.

753
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,110
Who is lying?

754
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,310
How did it go?

755
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,550
Less than two hours
after we sent the lawyer's letter,

756
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,500
Li Qi released the video.

757
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,350
There are even an analysis video online.

758
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,180
With such procedures and operations,

759
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,350
someone must have planned this
to ruin our show.

760
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,460
Don't panic.

761
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,830
I'll think of a solution.

762
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,110
No, we have to hurry up.

763
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,390
Public opinion is unfavorable to us.

764
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,900
The platform producer

765
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,490
just arranged a meeting with me
tomorrow morning.

766
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,870
They must want to talk about this.

767
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,110
I think the blogger
who made the analysis video

768
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,590
must have been instructed by someone.

769
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,030
Then they must have met
with whoever put them up to it.

770
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,980
How about this?

771
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,830
I'll get someone to contact that blogger

772
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,830
and see if we can find out anything.

773
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,070
But I don't think

774
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,030
Li Qi alone

775
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,980
can cause trouble,

776
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,390
plant a camera at the venue,

777
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,740
and getting video bloggers

778
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,830
to edit videos.

779
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,630
Do you mean...

780
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,740
What I mean

781
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,870
is that I think someone on the show
is working with him.

782
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,110
We need to find a way
to find that person.

783
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,940
Have you come up with a plan?

784
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,700
Best actor, it's showtime for us.

785
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,810
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

786
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:43,090
