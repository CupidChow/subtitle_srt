00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,490
=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,970
(2013)

4
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,350
Aren't there two people on duty today?

5
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,740
Why is Shen Xingruo alone?

6
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,300
Did Lu Xingyan go home?

7
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,450
No.

8
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,660
I just saw Lu Xingyan playing basketball

9
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,140
at the basketball court.

10
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,230
It must be because Shen Xingruo
can't bear to see Lu Xingyan on duty,

11
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,580
so she does all the work herself.

12
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,910
Why?

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,990
Shen Xingruo also likes Lu Xingyan.

14
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,580
I think so, too.

15
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,630
Xingruo and Xingyan.

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,740
Actually,

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,300
they're a good match.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Let's go.

19
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,730
(Duty students:
Shen Xingruo, Lu Xingyan)

20
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,690
(Lu Xingyan)

21
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,710
Come again.

22
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,910
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,550
It's the two of us

24
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,630
on duty today.

25
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,270
I know.

26
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,230
Just leave me what I have to do.

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,460
I'm sure I'll do it.

28
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,550
Sweep up the rubbish
from the 3rd, 4th floor

29
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,860
and the podium.

30
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,740
Since you said you'd do it,

31
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,620
do it now.

32
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,300
It doesn't matter what you say,

33
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,510
it's what you do that counts.

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,270
What?

35
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,390
You don't want to do it?

36
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,300
I'll do it.

37
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,700
He's really sweeping it.

38
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,930
=Episode 5=
(I never dare to tell you I'm in love.)

39
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,810
(2024)

40
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,020
Wait, who are you?

41
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm her friend? What's up?

42
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,230
Her friend, huh?

43
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,390
Well,

44
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,020
I'm her husband.

45
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,300
We had a fight.

46
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,740
Give us a minute, will you?

47
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,950
Can't you tell?

48
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,110
She doesn't want
to talk to you right now.

49
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,060
And as far as I know,

50
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
you two are divorced now.

51
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,180
She has

52
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,620
nothing to do with you now.

53
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,580
Listen,

54
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,020
mind your own business.

55
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,790
Let me tell you something.

56
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,300
Do you know what this place is?

57
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,140
There's a camera up there.

58
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,020
If you lay a finger on me,

59
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,110
I'll make you suffer.

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,180
Understood?

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,110
No.

62
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,470
How would I do that?

63
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,590
Honey, I'm leaving.

64
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,700
I'll wait for you.

65
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,500
I'll be waiting for you in Xingcheng.

66
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,620
Are you all right?

67
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,740
Are you hurt anywhere?

68
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,670
Don't be afraid. I'll take you home.

69
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,860
It's all right now.

70
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,350
Don't be afraid.

71
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,620
It's all right now.

72
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,380
You're perfectly safe here now.

73
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,030
Xingruo,

74
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,670
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,670
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,550
I didn't know that I'd almost

77
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,030
get you involved in this.

78
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,550
Don't say that.

79
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,110
It's not your fault.

80
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,820
Stop crying.

81
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,430
He's

82
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,620
like that sometimes.

83
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,380
He can't control his emotions.

84
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,790
Sometimes,

85
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,030
he hits me.

86
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,030
It's all right.

87
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,260
Actually,

88
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,790
Chen Zhu and I wonder why

89
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,060
you chose to be with Li Qi
in the first place.

90
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,180
Actually,

91
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,620
he was nice to me at first.

92
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,990
He was always

93
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,550
there for me,

94
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,230
helping me out.

95
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,030
Since I was a kid, I've always been

96
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,700
the least noticeable person
in the crowd.

97
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,860
He spotted me in the crowd.

98
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,380
I thought

99
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,620
it would be hard to meet someone
who would treat me so well,

100
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
so we got married soon after.

101
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,740
I just didn't expect him

102
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,430
to be a different person

103
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,990
after we got married.

104
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,180
I couldn't stand it anymore

105
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,670
so I initiated a divorce.

106
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,820
But since then,

107
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,820
he's been going to my house
and pestering me.

108
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,300
Once, he even got into a fight
with my parents.

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,180
That's intentional assault.

110
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,350
You should have called the police.

111
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,260
Our county is so small,

112
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,590
we always bump into each other.

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,820
To be honest,

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,670
I'm really afraid he'll do

115
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,260
something extreme

116
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,180
and

117
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,790
I don't want my family to be affected

118
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,230
because of me.

119
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,500
Well,

120
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,790
what are your plans for the future?

121
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Xingruo, don't worry.

122
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm definitely not going back with him.

123
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,030
He works in the county

124
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,740
and I'm now in Xingcheng.

125
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,230
I'm sure he'll give up

126
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,700
when he's had enough

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,230
and thinks there's nothing more
he can do.

128
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,030
And I'm working in a law firm.

129
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,030
He won't dare to do anything.

130
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,820
Okay.

131
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,910
Then promise me

132
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,110
you'll call me right away

133
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,260
if he comes to harass you again.

134
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,940
Besides,

135
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,300
you're

136
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,620
moving in tomorrow.

137
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,940
I'll feel more at ease

138
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,460
with you next to me.

139
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,700
Stop crying. It breaks my heart.

140
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
Don't cry.

141
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,460
The places we've just seen

142
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,300
are very good.

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,030
The art department can start

144
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,400
setting up the places
in the next two days.

145
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,390
Okay, no problem.

146
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,630
Director Jun,

147
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,270
since this is a variety show
with familiar faces,

148
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,270
we'd like the overall color
scheme to be warm and cozy.

149
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,220
You can talk to the art department

150
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,060
to see

151
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,300
how to fix

152
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,430
some of the heavier parts.

153
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,550
No problem.

154
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,910
If you have any suggestions,
please tell me.

155
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,870
Okay.

156
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,230
Take another look over there.

157
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,100
Okay.

158
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,700
Here's the main setting we've chosen.

159
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,910
(Erya Pavilion)
This villa is surrounded by mountains,

160
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,100
which makes it quieter
and more suitable for filming,

161
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,980
and also shows

162
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,510
the natural beauty of our inn.

163
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,100
Let's go in and take a look.

164
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,180
Let's go.

165
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,150
On the ground floor,
there are two large rooms

166
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,430
that can be used as studios
for the filming crew.

167
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,820
It's quite spacious here.

168
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,100
Anyway,

169
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,220
if it's to be used as a studio,

170
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,150
these glasses should be changed
to one-way mirror glasses.

171
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,980
Or it's easy to ruin the filming.

172
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,700
Yes.

173
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,300
We'll just install
the surveillance cameras here.

174
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,150
Over there and there.

175
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,940
All four corners.

176
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,870
Take the measurements later.

177
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,700
There's another room over here.

178
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,030
The style of this room

179
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,940
doesn't go well with our variety show.

180
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,820
I also find it a bit old-fashioned.

181
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,430
But we can

182
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,670
add some furnishings

183
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,790
to make it look more modern.

184
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,700
Zhang, jot down.

185
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,390
Okay.

186
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,870
All the furniture now
needs to be moved out.

187
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,270
We need to replace them
with something cozier.

188
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,100
And the color of the roof above

189
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,300
is too monotonous.

190
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,790
We need to add more colours

191
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,670
to make it look better.

192
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,580
I got it.

193
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,390
We'll go back and redesign it
and give you the drawings tonight.

194
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,030
Okay.

195
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,670
Let's go up to the first floor.

196
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,820
Okay.

197
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,870
The view from the first floor
is a more open.

198
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,670
This is a tea room.

199
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Take a look

200
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,890
and see if you want to change anything.

201
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,430
I think it would be good

202
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,910
to unify this floor
with the ground floor.

203
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,630
No problem.

204
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,430
There are six rooms here.

205
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,030
One for each of the six guests.

206
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,870
Not bad.

207
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,180
There is a large terrace in front

208
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
with a nice view.

209
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,630
Feel free to look around.

210
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,820
I think an island can be made

211
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,790
for guests to cook here

212
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,300
and eat over there.

213
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,150
In this row, I think we can put

214
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,390
some nice greenery

215
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,580
with light strips on it.

216
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,550
It'll give a sense of ambiance at night.

217
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,750
- No problem.
- Jot it down.

(Happy Girls' Day!)

223
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,920
For me? What is this?

224
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,220
Happy Girls' Day, Shi Qin.

225
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,580
Thank you.

231
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,870
Li Qi, how did you find this place?

232
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,340
You didn't switch accounts

233
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,580
when you shopped online,

234
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
so I checked.

235
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,670
Honey, open the door.

236
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,980
Leave now.

237
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,630
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

238
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,820
Open the door. Come on.

239
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,580
Open the door!

240
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,940
Open the door!

241
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,750
Honey,

242
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,150
calm down.

243
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,910
Honey,

244
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,980
listen to me.

245
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,030
Let's stop messing around.

246
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,550
I've really missed you lately.

247
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,910
Li Qi,

248
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,510
we're divorced.

249
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,700
This is my home.

250
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Please go out.

251
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,700
No, don't say that.

252
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,940
Please don't say that.

253
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,750
I... I know I was wrong.

254
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,300
Listen to me.

255
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,790
I shouldn't have scolded you

256
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,220
and I shouldn't even have hit you.

257
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,430
Give me another chance.

258
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,220
Let's get married again.

259
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,180
I promise, I swear.

260
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,580
I'll never lay a hand
on you again, okay?

261
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Listen to me.

262
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,870
No.

263
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,820
How about this? Come on.

264
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,340
You hit me until you're satisfied.

265
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,180
Come on, hit me.

266
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,870
Come on, hit me.

267
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,150
Are you satisfied now?

268
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,430
Don't do this.

269
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,820
Don't do this.

270
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,580
I get it.

271
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,300
No matter how much I do

272
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,910
or what I do now,

273
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,270
you just won't forgive me,

274
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,060
right?

275
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,250
(Shen Xingruo)

276
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,700
What are you doing? Give it to me!

277
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,270
Go away.

278
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,700
Give it to me!

279
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,100
Hello, Qin.

280
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,790
Who allowed you to make a phone call?

281
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,750
Hello, Qin.

282
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,730
Who allowed you to make a phone call?

283
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,060
What's the matter?

284
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,550
Something seems to have happened to Qin.

285
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,440
I'll give a you a lift.

286
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,700
I'm going to ask you one last time.

287
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,340
Do you

288
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,180
still want to leave me?

289
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,460
All right.

290
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,220
Fine.

291
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,300
Leave.

292
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,020
You want to leave me, huh?

293
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,940
Come on.

294
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,260
How dare you leave me?

295
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,540
How dare you leave me?

296
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,870

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,070

He Siyue, why are you here?

306
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,620
I brought him here to show him around.

307
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,460
Where are you going?

308
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,630
Something's happened to Shi Qin.

309

Shi Qin?

310
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,780
What's happened to her?

311
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,740
Go! Go out!

312
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,390
Show everyone what a disgrace you are!

313
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,180
Are you leaving?

314
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,940
Not bad, huh?

315
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,590
You can fight back now, huh?

316
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,180
I'll beat you to death today!

317
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,780
Stop it!

318
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,030

Qin.

320

What are you doing?

321
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,350
Don't fight.

322
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,110
Don't fight.

323
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,180
Are you all right?

324
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,210
Shi Qin.

325
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,910
Stop chasing.

326
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,390
Why don't you guys

327
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,590
go outside for a minute?

328
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,540
Shi Qin.

329
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,790
Let's go.

330
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,110
Are you okay, Qin?

331
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,740
Sorry I'm late.

332
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,350
I'm sorry.

It's the first time

337
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,020
someone's come to my rescue
when I've been beaten up.

338
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,180
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,670
It's all right now.

341
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,780
Shi Qin,

342
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,460
you can stay here for the time being.

343
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,110
The room is ready.

344
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,870
You should also pack your things
and move in here

345
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
to keep Shi Qin company.

346
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,540
Okay, thank you.

347
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,590
Let me take you inside.

348
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,430
No need.

349
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,670
We'll be fine on our own.

350
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,430
Let's go.

351
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,350
It's all right now.

352
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,980
It's done.

353
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,670
Are you sure this is all right?

354
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,230
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

355
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
I'm fine, Xingruo.

356
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,590
You go ahead with your work.

357
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,870
I can rest for a while.

358
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,020
Okay.

359
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,780
I'll go home and pack my things,

360
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,230
then I'll come
and stay with you tonight.

361
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,540
Qin,

362
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,500
don't worry, we're all here.

363
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,910
I'm leaving the medicine here.

364
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,590
I'm leaving.

365
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,670

to let that scumbag go?

00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,940
Of course not.

374
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,630
Please enjoy it.

375
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

376
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,980
Xingruo, thank you for taking me out.

377
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,260
I feel much better.

378
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,780
Qin,

379
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,700
actually, I've always wanted to ask you

380
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,390
why you haven't thought

381
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,590
of fighting back
after what Li Qi did to you?

382
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,630
I have,

383
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,430
but I don't dare.

384
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,310
He knows my family.

385
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,260
He knows my relatives.

386
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,110
I'm really scared
that they'll all get hurt

387
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,070
because of me.

388
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,700
But have you ever thought

389
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,630
that sometimes

390
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,830
you imagine him to be too strong?

391
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,310
You don't know him.

392
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,180
He's capable of anything

393
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,110
when he gets worked up.

394
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,020
That's why we mustn't fight him.

395
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,460
We must wait until he's calmed down.

396
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,740
Don't worry.

397
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,310
As long as I don't go back with him,

398
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,020
there's nothing he can do.

399
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,940
Is that really what you think?

400
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,700
In fact,

401
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,390
I brought you here today

402
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,430
to show you

403
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,020
what kind

404
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,020
of person Li Qi is.

405
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,350
What are you doing?

406
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,590
Li... Listen here.

407
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,940
You're breaking the law now,

408
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,500
you know that?

409
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,390
Break the law?

410
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,780
If you're not afraid,

411
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
why should we be?

412
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,590
I haven't practiced for years,

413
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,110
so let me practice on you today.

414
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,830
Scum like you

415
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,780
should be crippled.

416
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,540
Don't be impulsive.

417
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
If you hit me,

418
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,260
you'll be criminally liable.

419
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,180
It's okay if you hit me,
just provide for me from now on.

420
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,940
Okay?

421
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,540
How can you let Shi Qin go?

422
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,590
Bro,

423
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,110
it's not me who should let her go,

424
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,980
it's you who should let me go, okay?

425
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,460
This is between us as a married couple.

426
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,540
It's none of your business.

427
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,940
Don't you dare try
to twist the truth here.

428
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,180
It's domestic violence, you know?

429
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,530
That's because she makes a mistake.

430
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,940
After we got married,

431
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,500
she said she'd come to work in the city.

432
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
What about me?

433
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,310
What about my family?

434
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,500
I've given her everything to marry me.

435
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,150
Moreover,
there are no couples who don't fight.

436
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,500
There are no couples who don't fight.

437
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,670
Why can't she stand it?

438
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,740
She's just pretentious.

439
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,110
Shameless!

440
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,390
Fine.

441
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,870
You're righteous,

442
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,180
you're amazing.

443
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,310
But listen here,

444
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,870
she's my wife.

445
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,500
She's my wife for life.

446
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,390
She can't get away,

447
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,310
you know?

448
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,700
See, Qin?

449
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,310
He has no intention of letting you go.

450
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,430
It's because you keep backing down

451
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,310
that he's getting worse.

452
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,260
I know

453
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,630
it's hard to take
the first step sometimes.

454
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,590
But if you don't even

455
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,910
take the first step,

456
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,460
you're really stuck where you are.

457
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,500
What should I do?

458
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:13,980
Don't worry.

459
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,530
You've got your concerns,

460
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,070
he's got his.

461
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,830
All right.

462
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,630
I've said all I need to say.

463
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,870
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

464
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,020
By the way,

465
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,940
just a word of advice.

466
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Mind your own business.

467
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,260
Who the hell are you?

468
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,630
Honey, have you...

469
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,780
Honey,

470
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,870
have you made your mind up?

471
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,870
I heard everything you just said.

472
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,110
Li Qi,

473
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,670
you disgust me.

474
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,780
Did I give you...

475
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,020
I think Qin is right.

476
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,780
You're out to please your superiors,

477
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,740
but at home you're a bully.

478
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,150
You take it out on people
who are weaker than you.

479
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,910
Don't you think you're disgusting?

480
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,260
You think you're the only one
who can threaten people?

481
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,940
After our investigation,

482
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,740
you've been

483
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,430
an outstanding staff
for three consecutive years.

484
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,390
But your company has an explicit rule.

485
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,780
(Outstanding Staff, Li Qi, Marketing)
Zero tolerance for offences.

486
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,830
Immediate termination

487
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,430
of the labor contract upon discovery.

488
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,540
What do you think

489
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,540
your superiors would do

490
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,140
if they knew
that you committed domestic violence

491
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,310
during your marriage
and harassed your ex-wife like a fly

492
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,540
after your divorce?

493
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,260
You investigated me, huh?

494
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,180
What's wrong?

495
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,110
Your company's outstanding staff

496
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,150
are posted on the Internet.

497
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,740
We just checked it out.

498
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,110
Of course,

499
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,020
we also found the contact information
of your human resources department.

500
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,740
We're talking nicely to you now

501
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,670
because

502
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,460
we want you to know what to do.

503
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,980
It's all just your talk, isn't it?

504
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,110
When did I ever domestically abuse her?

505
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,870
Did you see it?

506
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,590
Evidence. You have to show me evidence.

507
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,150
Get it?

508
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,910
Li Qi,

509
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,180
here's the report on my injuries.

510
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,980
It's a diagnosis of the injuries

511
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,940
you inflicted on me during our marriage.

512
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,150
Subdural fluid on the face,

513
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,020
brain contusion on the left frontal lobe
and left temporal lobe.

514
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,540
According to the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China,

515
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,780
your behaviour constitutes the crime
of intentional injury.

516
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,110
I'm going

517
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,220
to sue you.

518
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,700
The firm has CCTV footage

519
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,540
of you harassing me

520
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,830
and of you breaking
into my house without permission,

521
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,500
and I'm going to the management's office
to get the CCTV footage.

522
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,390
These are all the evidence
that you've been harassing me.

523
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,500
Did I make things too easy for you?

524
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
What are you trying to do?

525
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,940
We're giving you two ways out now.

526
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,460
Either you disappear completely,

527
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,350
or we'll show you what we're capable of.

528
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,940
Fine.

529
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,740
I'll leave.

530
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,020
I'll leave.

531
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,500
It's over too soon.

532
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,310
I didn't even get a chance
to show it off.

533
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,150
Cover it up.

534
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,980
You're showing everyone

535
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,260
how childish you are, aren't you?

536
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,390
You think you can really fool people
with this crap?

537
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,980
Qin,

538
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,830
you've really impressed me today.

539
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,630
That was

540
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,390
a very professional speech.

541
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,430
Did you prepare that speech?

542
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,390
Actually,

543
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,980
I've rehearsed it in my mind

544
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,430
a million times.

545
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,780
Every time Li Qi hit me,

546
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,460
I imagined that one day

547
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,150
I could stand up in front of him

548
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,260
and sternly point out

549
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,590
these accusations to him,

550
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,260
but I never had the courage to do so.

551
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,110
So

552
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,180
thank you all very much for today.

553
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,740
Thank you for helping me.

554
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,020
Don't worry.

555
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,070
We'll always be there for you.

556
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,590
I have a small doubt.

557
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,780
Why is He Siyue here today?

558
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,540
I want to help Shi Qin

559
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,540
and I want to see you all.

560
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,220
This is the first time

561
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,590
we've worked together
since we graduated.

562
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,220
I like the feeling
of being around you guys.

563
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,180
Who do you mean you like to be around?

564
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,940
You guys.

565
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
To be specified, who...

566
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,540
Chen Zhu,

567
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,500
if that's the case,

568
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,540
why don't you join us
for a variety show?

569
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,500
By then,

570
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,220
you'll be able
to feel this way every day.

571
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,670
I'll think about it.

572
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,980
Feel free to contact me anytime.

573
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,070
Okay, thank you.

574
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,500
What's important now

575
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
is to match He Siyue
with the right girl.

576
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,430
Is there anyone around you

577
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,630
who likes someone like He Siyue?

578
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,260
Shi Qin, why are
they all looking at you?

579
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,390
You know someone like that?

580
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,220
Keep your mouth shut.

581
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,350
Go, go away.

582
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,350
You called me childish?

583
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,670
How much better are you?

584
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,780
Xu Chengzhou,

585
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,740
how dare you challenge me?

586
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,310
Come here!

587
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,700
Xu Chengzhou!

588
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,590
Stop there.

589
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,430
They haven't changed a bit.

590
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,500
They're exactly the same as before.

591
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,430
Yes.

592
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,500
You've changed a lot.

593
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,310
You've learnt to control your temper.

594
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,430
If you really hit Li Qi just now,

595
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,430
we don't know how to put an end to it.

596
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,420
It's a compliment to you.

597
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,830
Teachers used to take us away
for hitting,

598
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,020
but now we'll be taken away
by the police.

599
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,150
I'm long past that impulsive age.

600
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,150
As I get older,

601
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,700
maybe my brain is redeveloping.

602
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,670
Xingruo,

603
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,780
why don't we go and have a look?

604
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,540
I'm afraid they'll really fight.

605
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,310
Okay.

606
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,670
It's getting late.

607
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,700
Let's go back.

608
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,110
Come on, let's go home.

609
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
(He Siyue)
(I'm He Siyue.)

610
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,790
(I'm in the vicinity of your office.)

611
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,430
(I'd like to talk to you
about something.)

612
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,690
(Are you available after work?)

613
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,010
(Go Back Lover: Interview Time)

614
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,090
Why did you take part in this show?

615
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,410
(Why did you take part in this show?)

616
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,410
I enjoy spending time

617
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,450
with my friends.

618
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,090
They bring back memories

619
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,010
of a time when things

620
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,490
were simple and good.

621
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,010
Anything else

622
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,570
besides that?

623
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,440
If

624
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,490
you're asking me for anything else,

625
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,890
I'm here specifically for Shi Qin.

626
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,160
