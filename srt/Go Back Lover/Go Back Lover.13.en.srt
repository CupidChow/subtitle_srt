00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,120
(Year 2014, Freshman year in college)

4
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,880
The door is open.

5
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,630
Aunt Pei, I'm back.

6
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,440
You're back.

7
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,800
Come on, it's pouring.

8
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,910
Where's Lu Xingyan?

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,080
He's not home?

10
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,190
He went out early in the morning.

11
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,240
I thought he was picking you up.

12
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,030
Picking me up?

13
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:25,970
The door is open.

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,830
He's back.

15
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,910
Lu Xingyan, where have you been?

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,600
Look at you, you're all wet.

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,000
Get up and wipe it off.

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,670
Lu Xingyan!

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,390
Ignore him. He's out of his mind.

20
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,360
Lu Xingyan.

21
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,030
Don't you have anything
to explain to me?

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,440
I went to pick you up.

23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,910
I saw you leave with someone else.

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,120
Put your clothes on first.

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,350
No.

26
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,070
I need an explanation.

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,450
An explanation for what?

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,280
You didn't tell me

29
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,160
you were coming to pick me up.

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,720
It's raining outside.

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,790
Is it wrong for my senior

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,880
to hold an umbrella for me
and let me get a cab?

33
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,840
But I went to pick you up

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,230
and you left with someone else.

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,570
I came back alone
and got caught in the rain.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,680
Get to the point.

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,350
I need a compensation.

38
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,840
What compensation?

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,230
Lu Xingyan, what are you doing
in your room?

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,350
Come down and eat.

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,270
Go and put on some clothes.

42
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,660
=Episode 13=
(Your hug is the best compensation.)

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,900
(Year 2024)

44
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,560
305.

45
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,790
303.

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,960
308.

47
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,190
Who's there?

48
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
Xu Chengzhou.

49
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,720
Open the door.

50
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,120
Xu Chengzhou?

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,630
Why is he here?

52
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,360
I have no idea.

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,070
Get him out of here.

54
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,270
He can't know about this.

55
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,040
No. Why can't he know?

56
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,830
If he knows,

57
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,150
the whole world knows.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,510
Is our relationship so shameful?

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,150
It's not our relationship.

60
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,240
It's the fact
that I'm not dressed right now.

61
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,070
Can he see this? Go.

62
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,240
Coming.

63
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,590
Why are you so drunk?

64
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,150
Bro.

65
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
My best friend.

66
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,190
My only friend.

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,950
How did you know I was here?

68
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
Because I need you.

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,480
I needed your comfort,

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,360
but I couldn't find you.

71
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,000
I had to contact the hotel manager.

72
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,750
He said you booked a suite here today.

73
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,040
That's why I came all the way here.

74
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,270
It's because of Chen Zhu again,
isn't it?

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
This time is different.

76
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,240
I went to her date with Yu Si today.

77
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,320
Do you have any idea
how hurtful her words were?

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,240
Let me in.

79
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,710
You can't go in.

80
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't... Don't touch me.

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,570
Don't touch me. I'm going to throw up.

82
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,150
I thought you were going to throw up.

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,480
It's okay. I don't want
to throw up anymore.

84
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,800
What's with this room?

85
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,510
Could it be that you...

86
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,830
This room is for you.

87
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,590
For me?

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,390
When I saw you and Chen Zhu at the villa,

89
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,800
I knew you were going to fight again.

90
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,000
I thought of having a drink with you.

91
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,070
Then why didn't you let me in?

92
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,320
I couldn't finish decorating,

93
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,830
so I let you in when it's done.

94
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,240
You're really my good friend.

95
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,680
I'm touched

96
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,240
but the atmosphere is too romantic.

97
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,750
I hope we can still maintain

98
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,150
a pure brotherhood.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,430
I will take note of it next time.

100
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,190
Okay.

101
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,390
I will take note of it next time.

102
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,540
I will definitely
take note of it next time.

103
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,920
You... You drank too much.

104
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,560
Hold it in!

105
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,390
I want to throw up.

106
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,270
Hold it in!

107
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,680
Go, go, go.

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
Lu Xingyan.

109
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,360
Quick.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,940
Don't just stand there.

111
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,270
Come on, drink with me.

112
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,360
I feel terrible.

113
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,040
I'll drink.

114
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,270
We should stop drinking now.

115
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,280
It's finished so soon.

116
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,870
Come on, I'll take you back.

117
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,830
No, it's just the beginning.

118
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll go to the toilet

119
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
and we'll drink more.

120
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
Quick, come out.

121
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,440
I'm finally out. I was suffocating.

122
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,830
It's all my fault.

124
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,920
I don't blame you. I'm leaving anyway.

125
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
I'll send you a message.

126
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,830
Okay.

127
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,540
What are you looking for?

128
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,590
Where's my shirt and singlet?

129
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,230
Shirt?

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,760
We just went from there

131
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,680
to here,

132
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,230
to there,

133
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,320
and back to bed.

134
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,040
Are you looking for this?

135
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
Go change your clothes first.

136
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
Lu Xingyan, you're too much.

137
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,870
What's wrong?

138
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,440
That's normal.

139
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,970
Didn't you and Chen Zhu
ever stay in a hotel?

140
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,070
Is that the same thing?

141
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,640
First, you said you'd be a guest,

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,160
no problem,

143
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,070
it's just publicity for the hotel.

144
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,870
Then, you offered to fund the show,

145
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,440
no problem.

146
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,230
You'd be spending money
on publicity anyway.

147
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,640
But now,

148
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,110
you've got yourself into it.

149
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,560
You're totally committed.

150
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,560
What are you thinking?

151
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,990
Are you sober?

152
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,760
Your logic is so clear now.

153
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,520
Don't interrupt me.

154
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,640
So you now...

155
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,520
You're now already

156
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,450
going back
to being boyfriend and girlfriend?

157
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,760
What does it mean?

158
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
You're not a couple,

159
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
but you do things that only couples do?

160
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,160
Isn't your relationship too messy?

161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,870
Whatever our relationship is,

162
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,350
it's just a statement.

163
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,470
She's the only one in my heart.

164
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,950
And I don't want anything else

165
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,470
to tie us down emotionally.

166
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,280
Xing,

167
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,230
you're a lovesick man
who's brainwashing yourself.

168
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,870
Are you done?

169
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,160
Right away.

170
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,710
Do me a favour.

171
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,920
No one else must know

172
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,830
about tonight,

173
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,640
including Chen Zhu.

174
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,950
No way.

175
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,230
This is ridiculous.

176
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,800
Ten Epic Skins.

177
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
It's really unbelievable.

178
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,560
20.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,520
I can understand a little bit.

180
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,350
30.

181
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,230
Buy them now,
I'm sure I didn't see anything.

182
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,320
It's settled.

183
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,470
I'll pay for the 30 skins.

184
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,230
No way.

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,230
What?

186
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,470
Not only is he not smart,
but sometimes he doesn't keep his words.

187
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,400
Buy them now.

188
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,520
So I'll be relieved.

189
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,640
What's your hurry?

190
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,950
If you're not responsible
for each other,

191
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,660
how can I expect you
to be responsible for me?

192
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,550
Buy now.

193
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
(Welcome to a new week)

194
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,230
(of dates with challengers.)

195
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,520
(Third Challenge Mission)
(The third round is coming up.)

196
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,040
(Is the calmness
of the first two rounds)

197
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,870
(All guests will reselect)
(building up to this round?)

198
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,520
(the ones they want to be paired with.)
(What kind of chemistry)

199
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,350
(will the challengers
create in this round of dates?)

200
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,440
(In the next episode,)

201
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,320
(all guests will reselect)

202
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,870
(the ones they want to be paired with.)

203
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,680
(In the end, it decides
whether the challengers)

204
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,040
(succeed or not.)

205
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,440
(The next episode)
(Once the challenger succeeds,)

206
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,440
(a new couple will be formed.)

207
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,110
(The left out guest
will leave Love House.)

208
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,980
(We'll see who stays and who leaves)

209
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,400
(in the new round of voting.)

210
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,870
I've told you many times

211
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,770
not to come into my room
without permission.

212
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,160
I came to say goodbye.

213
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,760
Say goodbye?

214
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,520
Where are you going?

215
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,760
I'm leaving the show.

216
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,560
What do you mean?

217
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,990
Chen Zhu asked me to go
to the Civil Affairs Bureau

218
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,450
in three days to apply
for a divorce certificate.

219
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,710
After I'm gone,

220
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,040
you'll be responsible
for the publicity of Sun Hotel.

221
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,710
I know you don't want to do the talking,

222
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,920
so I've customized this shirt for you.

223
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,680
(Sun Hotel)
You can wear it on the show.

224
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,480
Wait.

225
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,640
You two haven't made up yet?

226
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,590
I've been looking for a chance to talk

227
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,640
to Chen Zhu all week,

228
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,830
but she's been ignoring me.

229
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,070
I thought a marriage certificate

230
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,270
would keep the relationship going,

231
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,160
but she's taking away the legal title.

232
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,560
So you're just going to give up?

233
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,350
The initiative's out of my hands now.

234
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,320
She's close to Yu Si.

235
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,160
They got along fine on their last day.

236
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,190
If they vote for each other
in the next vote,

237
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,800
Yu Si will take my place,

238
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,470
and I'm automatically out.

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,070
I wonder why Yu Si

240
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,570
hasn't been bothering
Shen Xingruo lately.

241
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,110
It turns out he's seeing Chen Zhu.

242
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm tired of apologizing.

243
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,040
Chen Zhu won't change her mind.

244
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,640
And this time, there's Yu Si.

245
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,520
It's all over

246
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,760
between us now.

247
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,520
(In the third round of dates,)

248
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,160
(the challenger, Zhai Jiajing's date)

249
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,870
(is Xu Chengzhou.)

250
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,590
(The venue is the seaside cafe.)

251
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,280
What's going on?

252
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,760
My next date will be at Chen Zhu's cafe?

253
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,440
This is God giving you a chance.

254
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,600
What does it mean?

255
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,760
Sorry

256
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,590
to keep you waiting.

257
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,990
I'm glad you're here.

258
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,960
It was a little jammed on the way.

259
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,400
I didn't expect you
to set the date here.

260
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,230
Stop looking around.
Chen Zhu isn't here yet.

261
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,640
How do you know
I'm looking for Chen Zhu?

262
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,920
Although you look like
you're happy-go-lucky every day,

263
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,190
you can't fool your old friend

264
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,800
with your condition.

265
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,460
Is it that obvious?

266
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,440
Let me guess.

267
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,920
You must have had a conflict
with Chen Zhu,

268
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,870
but you haven't resolved it yet,

269
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,710
and then you found out

270
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,870
that Chen Zhu is getting along well
with Yu Si,

271
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,800
so you're wondering
whether to let go or not.

272
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,560
Yeah, we had a big fight a while back.

273
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,950
I regretted it right after.

274
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,110
So I asked you here today

275
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,680
to tell you

276
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,320
that if you still love Chen Zhu,

277
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,870
you should give her and you a chance.

278
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,710
If there's any misunderstanding,
just talk it over.

279
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,590
Thank you for thinking of us.

280
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,520
I plan to talk to her

281
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,280
after the show.

282
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,160
I've specially prepared this today.

283
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,190
A champagne rose.

284
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,680
Champagne roses are her favourite.

285
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,110
I've always been confused
between yellow roses

286
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,110
and champagne roses.

287
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,520
Today, I'm going
to apologize with a rose.

288
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,920
You can do it.

289
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,560
Chen Zhu.

290
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,320
How could you do this, Xu Chengzhou?

291
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,070
You couldn't tell the difference before,

292
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,280
but now that we're getting
a divorce certificate,

293
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,500
you can tell the difference, right?

294
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,040
It's not what you think.

295
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,590
I've specially prepared this today.

296
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,520
For me?

297
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,830
Then tell me

298
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,040
why she held it.

299
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,910
Don't you think it's funny

300
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,110
that you're saying that?

301
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,630
Let's talk this over, okay?

302
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,910
I have nothing to say to you.

303
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,270
Bye.

304
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,480
Sorry.

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,430
Go ahead.

306
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,520
Get lost. Don't follow me.

307
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,350
You've got the wrong idea.

308
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,170
I've prepared this flower
to apologize to you.

309
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,110
Apologize to me?

310
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,760
You bought one to apologize to me?

311
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,110
I looked it up on the Internet.

312
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,430
One means loyalty.

313
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Chen Zhu, I know I'm not doing enough.

314
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,670
I've been ignoring
what you really want for so long,

315
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,760
never getting to know you better.

316
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,270
I... I'm sorry.

317
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,000
Can you give me a chance to make amends?

318
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,450
I don't want to give up
our relationship so easily.

319
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,240
Are you done?

320
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,590
You apologized, and then what?

321
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,760
Xu Chengzhou, we've been arguing

322
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,910
about the same thing for years,

323
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,720
quarrelling, apologizing, arguing again,

324
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,480
and repeating the same thing
over and over again.

325
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,960
I've had enough.

326
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,830
The day after tomorrow at 9:00 AM,

327
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,280
see you in front
of Civil Affairs Bureau.

328
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,480
Sorry.

329
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,430
Let's start now.

330
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,590
I can never get anything right.

331
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,390
I screw up again.

332
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,660
This time, it's all because of me.

333
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,910
I've caused you to have a problem
with Chen Zhu again.

334
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,630
Now, I've thought it through.

335
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,070
I may not understand

336
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,870
what Chen Zhu wants.

337
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,870
I'd better really let go.

338
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,110
No one wants a failed ex-husband.

339
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,670
I can't do anything right.

340
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,590
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,430
I hope it doesn't affect your mood.

342
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,760
Don't say that.

343
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,000
Xu Chengzhou, you used to be the one
who livened up the atmosphere

344
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,800
when we met clients.

345
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,390
You're really direct, cheerful, sporty.

346
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,590
And you've been influencing

347
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,960
everyone around you.

348
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,150
Everyone has a bright side

349
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,630
and a dark side.

350
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,520
So as a friend,

351
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,320
I'm really happy that you can show me

352
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,150
this side of you.

353
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,150
If you don't want to go on
with today's date,

354
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,150
we can end it at any time.

355
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,110
No pressure.

356
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
One more time, come on.

357
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,960
Three, two, one, go.

358
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,590
One more time, come on.

359
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,430
Three, two, one, go.

360
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,040
You're here.

361
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,870
Look at this dog.

362
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,200
It's a good dog.

363
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,390
Dried Fish.

364
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
Its name is Dried Fish.

365
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,200
Feed it.

366
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,390
Come here.

367
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,110
One more.

368
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,830
- You feed it.
- Thank you.

369
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,830
I heard from Xingruo

370
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,110
that you used to feed stray dogs
in the park

371
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,560
when you were in high school.

372
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,200
When I was in school,

373
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,630
I wanted to get a puppy,

374
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,150
but my mom wouldn't let me.

375
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,560
Then one time
I was walking through the park

376
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
and there were so many stray dogs,

377
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
they were so cute.

378
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,390
So I used to bring them treats.

379
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,870
Girls who love animals are very caring.

380
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,040
Maybe it's just because I like it.

381
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,870
You don't talk much,

382
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,110
but I can feel you're kind.

383
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,910
You're kind to animals
that are weaker than you,

384
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,200
let alone people.

385
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,800
I don't talk much
because I'm not very good with words.

386
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,240
No, we're having a good conversation.

387
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,800
That's because you talk a lot.

388
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
Am I right?

389
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,000
You think I'm talkative, huh?

390
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,390
Some people in this world

391
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,070
are good at talking,

392
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,520
but some

393
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,830
are good at listening.

394
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,800
Just be yourself.

395
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,910
Good morning.

396
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,270
Good morning.

397
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,000
I wonder when they're coming.

398
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,200
- Sit down.
- You sit first.

399
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,110
No, there's a seat here.

400
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,720
Sit down.

401
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,970
No, I'll stand for a while.

402
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,320
I... I'll just stand here.

403
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,200
I'll just stand here.

404
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,520
Well, I... I'll sit.

405
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,070
Go ahead.

406
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,670
Everyone is here.

407
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,590
We've gathered you all together

408
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,390
because we have an announcement to make.

409
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,800
Our third round of dates

410
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
has come to an end.

411
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,380
According to the show's schedule,

412
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,520
we're going to shoot the poster

413
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,560
for the first round of Go Back Lover
from tomorrow.

414
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,870
The location will be
at Mingli High School.

415
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
The theme is love from school.

416
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,480
I hope you're all wearing
your school uniforms.

417
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,590
For the rest of the day,

418
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,670
you should take a good rest.

419
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,670
Besides, you need
to prepare your own uniforms.

420
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,450
All right?

421
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,150
- That's all?
- That's it?

422
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,000
Have a good rest.

423
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,060
Let's go.

424
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,150
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

425
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,200
My uniform's at home.

426
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,170
I have to go back and get it.

427
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,590
We'll go back with you.

428
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,630
I'm going home
to get my uniform tonight.

429
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,620
I don't want to see you at home.

430
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,590
I'll get it for you.

431
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,040
Don't worry. I won't be a nuisance.

432
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,670
I got it!

433
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,590
This is my diary. Don't read it.

434
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,000
Qin and I

435
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,910
have been your laborers
all night today.

436
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,480
Qin, open it.

437
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,630
No way.

438
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,520
- That's so embarrassing. Don't read it.
- Let me see.

439
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,430
All right.

440
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,040
Let me see.

441
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,480
So many.

442
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,720
Why did you keep a diary?

443
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,870
Didn't we all keep diaries
when we were in school?

444
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,770
Didn't you ever keep one?

445
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,280
Off-mainstream period.

446
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,070
I did.

447
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,960
I remember now.

448
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,720
Yes.

449
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,760
Look at this.

450
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,960
It's a cloudy day,

451
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,430
and I'm in a bad mood.

452
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,390
Sometimes, I feel like I'm a candy

453
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,590
and I feel sad when I'm sweet.

454
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,000
So you're so unorthodox.

455
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,430
Why didn't I notice?

456
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,430
Of course.

457
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,040
I've always been a trendsetter.

458
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,480
And this one.

459
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,590
It's your birthday today.

460
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,520
The future me,

461
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,480
you must be very happy.

462
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,150
Very happy.

463
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,910
Skip it. Stop reading that.

464
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,720
What's this?

465
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,820
(I promise
that as long as I'm still breathing,)

466
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,460
(Chen Zhu will have ice-cream cake
every year for her birthday.)

467
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,260
(If I go back on my word,
I'll be struck by lightning.)

468
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,910
This is the pledge

469
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,630
Xu Chengzhou made with me

470
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,800
back then.

471
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,720
(I promise)

472
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,970
(that as long as I'm still breathing,)

473
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,150
(Chen Zhu will have ice-cream cake)

474
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,270
(every year for her birthday.)

475
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,060
(If I go back on my word,
I'll be struck by lightning.)

476
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,040
Xu Chengzhou.

477
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,630
I'm here.

478
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,150
What are you doing here?

479
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,630
Hey, man.

480
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,320
Thank you.

481
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,870
What is this?

482
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,200
Isn't it your birthday today?

483
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,430
I wanted to celebrate for you,

484
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,830
so I ordered a takeaway cake.

485
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,430
Why did it have to be delivered
at this time?

486
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,390
It's an ice-cream cake. It melts easily.

487
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Get down now.

488
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,170
The headmaster will come
to catch you later.

489
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,910
Come on.

490
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,960
Coming.

491
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,830
Are you okay?

492
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,430
I'm fine.

493
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,480
My head hurts a bit.

494
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,280
Let me see.

495
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,000
It's injured.

496
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,150
Come on, let me clean it for you.

497
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,800
I'll clean it for you.
It will hurt a bit.

498
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,070
Let me do it myself.

499
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,630
Look at you.

500
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,910
Simple minded, underdeveloped limbs,

501
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,200
can't you get down properly?

502
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,670
If I come down properly,
could I get this effect?

503
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,070
Look, the wall is cracked.

504
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,060
What do you call this?

505
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,870
It's called a powerful blessing
for your birthday.

506
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,590
Stop it. You're still joking.

507
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,150
Here, I'll put it on you.

508
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,900
All right.

509
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Remember this.

510
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,070
As long as I'm still breathing,

511
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,520
you will have ice-cream cake

512
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,760
every year for your birthday.

513
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,870
You say that

514
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,280
like you're the only one
who'd give me an ice-cream cake.

515
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,970
So if you don't buy me one,
I don't get to eat it?

516
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,380
That won't happen.

517
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,070
If that day ever comes,

518
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
I'll be struck by lightning.

519
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,110
I knew you wouldn't have the heart
to make me swear.

520
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,200
You're wrong.
Of course you have to swear.

521
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,970
What's the point of saying it?

522
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,000
You have to write it down.

523
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,150
What?

524
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,070
You can't take it just for a while?

525
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,110
No, I have no problem with it.

526
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,110
Are you done?

527
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,910
Why don't I post it?

528
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,630
No, I'll do it myself.

529
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,110
Why isn't this sticky note sticking?

530
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,430
I've got an idea. Use this.

531
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,560
Your vow is on the wall.

532
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
From now on,

533
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,430
you'll be watched by the world.

534
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,520
If you go back on your word...

535
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,970
I'll do what I said I'd do.
I won't go back on my word.

536
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,520
We've taken a blood vow.

537
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,150
I never thought

538
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,670
we'd be separated.

539
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,040
As your friend,

540
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,040
I've seen how you two have been together

541
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,430
for so many years.

542
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,590
I think there are actually problems
with both of you.

543
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,960
Why are you like this?

544
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,960
Why do you side with the outsider?

545
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,150
I side with you,

546
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,660
that's why I'm telling you the truth.

547
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,430
You know what?

548
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,870
Affection can be consumed.

549
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,150
A relationship is like a credit card.

550
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,200
The deeper the affection,
the higher the limit,

551
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,040
but that doesn't mean

552
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,670
it can't be overdrawn.

553
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,240
I know

554
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,240
that Xu Chengzhou
always ignores your feelings,

555
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,000
but think carefully,

556
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,870
is it true that every time
the two of you have a fight,

557
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,920
he takes the initiative to go
to you and apologise for his mistakes?

558
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,960
He works so hard,

559
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,970
but you have never given him
anything in return.

560
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,390
What would he feel?

561
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Yu Si told me the same thing.

562
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,280
Maybe I'm just being really

563
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,590
too demanding of him.

564
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,590
Do you think

565
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,150
he's still willing to make up with me?

566
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,000
I think

567
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,960
while the love between you two

568
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,390
is not completely gone,

569
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,110
if you really care about him

570
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,350
and really want to see him,

571
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,200
then go bravely to get him back.

572
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,390
You've been enjoying
his contribution for years,

573
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,520
it's time to pay off your debts.

574
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,910
Yes, Zhu.

575
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,480
I think he'll forgive you

576
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,070
if you're willing to lower yourself.

577
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,040
Look, if you're so sad,

578
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,520
he must be sad too.

579
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,240
Okay.

580
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,800
I can give and take.

581
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,040
I'll lower myself this time.

582
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,430
Guys, our main task today

583
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,070
is to take our publicity photos

584
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,590
at this lovely Mingli High School.

585
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,910
You... Why are you dressed differently
from us?

586
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,630
I didn't go to the same school as you.

587
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,110
The two challengers, you're a team.

588
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,150
Follow PDs,

589
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,110
lead our guests
to start taking pictures.

590
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,960
Mr. Yu, Lawyer Zhai,

591
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,170
we'll stay in this classroom.

592
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,670
Guys,

593
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,670
keep your spirits up.

594
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,170
I'm looking forward to your pictures.
Let's go.

595
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,670
All right.

596
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,200
One foot forward.

597
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,070
Okay, nice.

598
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,240
All right.

599
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,970
Make-up artist, fix her make-up.

600
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,670
How did you do that?

601
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,520
How could you make her legs look so long?

602
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,620
To make her legs look long,

603
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,590
make sure the legs

604
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,670
are next to the bottom border.

605
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,110
This way, the proportions will be good

606
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,060
and her legs will look long.

607
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,150
Wait, let me jot it down.

608
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,070
Please repeat.

609
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,450
What? You're interested in photography?

610
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm not interested,

611
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,520
but scared.

612
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,110
I took a lot of flak for that.

613
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,630
Just do this.

614
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,910
I have an account,

615
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,630
and it's full

616
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,240
of photography tips that I share.

617
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,560
Just learn from it.

618
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,970
I'll share it with you.

619
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,670
Over time,

620
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,070
your skills will get better, okay?

621
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,480
Thank you so much.

622
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,480
Okay, we're done with the singles.

623
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,380
Next, we're going to do the team shots. Okay?

624
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,320
Okay.

625
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,200
Thank you.

626
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,770
Come on, you two together.

627
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,870
Stand close.

628
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,480
A little intimacy, okay?

629
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,720
Closer. Stand a bit closer.

630
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,960
All right, be intimate.

631
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,000
Okay, let's answer some questions
while we're taking pictures.

632
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,110
Chen Zhu,

633
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,200
why did you pick this spot

634
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,110
for the shoot?

635
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,760
Actually, I chose this place

636
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,040
because it's so special to me.

637
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,590
Do you still remember?

638
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,590
Of course I do.

639
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,930
I gave you a cake here
for your birthday that year.

640
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,070
Today, we're back here again,

641
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,150
and I have something
very important to say to you.

642
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,720
What's going on?

643
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,450
Is this still going on?

644
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,150
Wait for me here.

645
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,240
You... What are you doing?

646
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,760
What are you doing?

647
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,240
I... You got down from here

648
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,070
for my birthday

649
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,560
and brought me an ice-cream cake.

650
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,150
So today,

651
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,760
I have to choose

652
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,280
to be here

653
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,800
to express my

654
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,040
deepest apologies to you.

655
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
Enough.

656
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,720
Don't do what you're not capable of doing.

657
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,350
In fact, for the past few years,

658
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,240
I've hoped you'd understand me

659
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,200
while not telling you

660
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,080
what I really wanted.

661
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,870
I've always let you guess, understand,

662
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,950
and become a perfect husband yourself.

663
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,760
But I realize now

664
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,240
that this was very wrong.

665
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,680
Relationships require two people

666
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,550
to work together.

667
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,350
Today I, Chen Zhu, swear

668
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,080
that from now on,

669
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,280
I won't be unreasonable

670
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
and childish again.

671
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,280
I will try my best to be a good wife.

672
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,390
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

673
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,350
Actually, I've never blamed you.

674
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,680
It's my fault
for not being a good husband,

675
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,910
for not being able
to give you what you want.

676
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,120

(Go Back Lover: Interview Time)

703
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,780
The first time Chen Zhu apologized to you,

704
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,820
how did you feel?

705
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,620
(How did you feel
when Chen Zhu apologized to you?)

706
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,740
To be honest,

707
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,700
this is the first time
she apologized to me

708
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,340
in all the years we've been together.

709
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,420
I was in a daze.

710
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,460
I should've put on an action camera

711
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,740
and recorded everything she said

712
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,940
and gone home and reminisced about it.

713
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,020
I regret it when it comes to this.

714
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,220
Right, K.

715
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,140
I'm sure you guys got some footage
on your cameras.

716
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,460
Make me a copy.

717
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,510
How did you feel

718
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,970
the first time you apologized
to someone?

719
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,820
(How did you feel)
It wasn't an apology.

720
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,100
(the first time you apologized?)
It was another way of controlling him.

721
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,980
In fact, the aggression
in the relationship

722
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,180
is not only the harsh command

723
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,740
but also the compromise
of pretending to be gentle.

724
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,780
There are times

725
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,340
when showing a man a vulnerable
and tender side

726
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,500
is more likely to arouse their desire
to protect us.

727
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,620
Such as this,

728
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,380
which man can resist it?

729
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,080
