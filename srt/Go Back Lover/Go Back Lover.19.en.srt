=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,740
(January 2016, second semester of
sophomore year)

4
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,100
Your mother and I were both 20
when we first met.

5
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,430
At that time, we truly loved each other.

6
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,510
Truly love each other?

7
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,900
Then why did you do that to her?

8
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,460
The thing about love is

9
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,510
it won't always stay the same.

10
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,230
We have indeed loved each other.

11
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,820
But our feelings have faded.

12
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,790
That is also a fact.

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,790
Everyone has the right to pursue love.

14
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,900
It has nothing to do with status, age,

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,340
or any other differences.

16
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,390
As for whether a couple
can make it to the end?

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,900
Only time can tell.

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,980
Then have you considered my feelings?

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,390
I am your daughter.

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,590
I have always thought

21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,590
you have a heart-to-heart connection
with me.

22
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,900
If you can calm down

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,590
and think about this carefully,

24
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,740
you'll definitely be able
to figure it out in the end.

25
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,070
I don't think you are worried

26
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,150
about my remarriage.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,150
You are worried

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,310
that my love for you
has diminished, right?

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,980
Xingruo.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,430
Well.

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,230
Let me send you out.

32
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,490
That's unnecessary.

33
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,570
=Episode 19=
(Forget the past, cherish tomorrow.)

34
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,570
(Year 2024. Outpatient Clinic,
Xingcheng People's Hospital)

35
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,470
Lu Xingyan.

36
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,630
If you don't want me to hate him,

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,950
over his dead body.

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,070
Why?

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,230
Why are you so stubborn?

40
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,790
Because my mom didn't die of sickness.

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,510
She was killed.

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,230
She was killed my dad.

43
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,950
Are you satisfied with this answer?

44
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,300
Shen Guangyao

45
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,700
is a murderer.

46
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,910
Why do you say that?

47
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,140
Because my mother's death

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,470
has everything to do with him.

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,350
Shen Guangyao,

50
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,950
if you ever mention divorce to me again,

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,260
I will die in front of you.

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,390
Do we have to get into
such an ugly fight?

53
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,260
It's not ugly at all.

54
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,670
Why would I want a divorce?

55
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,420
I have such a nice home

56
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,070
and such a lovely daughter.

57
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,700
Why would I want a divorce?

58
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,510
How many times have I told you?

59
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,860
There is no love between us anymore.

60
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,070
Could you please,

61
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,580
for the sake of our daughter,

62
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,980
keep our separation civil?

63
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,910
Our feelings are no more.

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,750
You said you would only love me
in your life!

65
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,390
Why would you want a divorce?

66
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,230
I admit that I loved you.

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,790
But the one I loved

68
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,190
was that dazzling pianist.

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,860
Do you think I wanted
to give up the piano?

70
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,390
Do you think I wanted to stop playing?

71
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,950
I had to give it up for this family!

72
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,390
You want to hear the piano, don't you?

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,950
Stop talking.

74
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,070
I'll play it for you.

75
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,950
I don't want to listen!

76
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
I know you like me playing the piano.

77
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,580
I know you like it.

78
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,630
Listen, I'll play it for you.

79
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,950
Listen to me.

80
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,950
Listen, I'll play it for you, Guangyao.

81
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,780
How can this be?

82
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,700
That's enough! Stop playing!

83
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,310
Guangyao.

84
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,310
I've said everything
that needs to be said.

85
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,310
It's over.

86
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,990
Guangyao!

87
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,820
Don't go, Guangyao!

88
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't go!

89
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,700
Guangyao!

90
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,850
(Xingruo, Mommy loves you.)

91
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,950
(But losing Dad's love,
I can't live anymore.)

92
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,950
(Xingruo,)

93
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,070
(Mommy loves you.)

94
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,310
(But losing Dad's love,)

95
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,660
(I can't live anymore.)

96
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,990
I've told you everything now.

97
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,510
Are you satisfied?

98
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
Tell me, how can I forgive him?

99
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,700
Sorry.

100
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I'm really sorry.

101
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,580
I didn't know what you've been through.

102
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,430
All these years,

103
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,990
I refused to see him

104
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,430
because I didn't dare to see him at all.

105
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,870
The memories

106
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,110
are like a thorn in my heart.

107
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,110
I tried so hard to pull it out,
again and again,

108
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,300
but it pierced deeper and deeper
into my heart.

109
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,230
Teach me.

110
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,630
What do you think I should do?

111
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,230
I'm exhausted today.

112
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,110
Just leave me alone for a while.

113
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,390
Alright.

114
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,990
I won't bother you anymore.

115
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,710
Contact me if you need me.

116
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,390
I'll always be here.

(Lu Xingyan)
(If you have time,)

157
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,590
(can you check out Xingruo for me?)

158
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,890
(Outpatient Clinic,
Xingcheng People's Hospital)

159
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,470
Why are you here?

160
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,660
Can't I come?

161
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,590
I heard from Lu Xingyan that the hotel

162
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,300
was in a chaotic mess yesterday.

163
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,140
Someone was even injured.

164
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,510
I'm worried that she won't eat well,

165
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,180
so I came to take a look.

166
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,900
As a bonus, I get to witness

167
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,630
her embarrassing moment.

168
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,750
I was wrong to expect something nice
from your foul mouth.

169
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,630
Is your head alright?

170
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,140
I think it's fine.

171
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,420
Are you okay?

172
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,110
Lu Xingyan caused such a big trouble
this time.

173
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,400
Do you still plan to forgive him?

174
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,300
He didn't cause any trouble.

175
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,780
This is just between me and my dad.

176
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,870
He just happened to be caught up in it.

177
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,470
I don't know what happened between you,

178
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,020
but to me,

179
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,900
you stayed beside him

180
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,350
and got hurt once again.

181
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,020
Your heart was hurt the last time.

182
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,900
Now, you are hospitalized.

183
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,520
Don't you think it's serious?

184
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,540
Look at me now.

185
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,870
Aren't I fine?

186
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,300
I'm alright.

187
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,540
Stop it. I know you well.

188
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,870
You say you're alright.

189
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,830
You put up a tough face.

190
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,900
But that's all on the surface.

191
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,990
The more uncaring you look,

192
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,630
the more you care deep down.

193
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,710
Shen Xingruo,

194
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,350
can you stop acting tough?

195
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,710
I really don't want to see

196
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,990
you get hurt again.

197
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,420
Did I hit my head

198
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,390
or did you?

199
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,780
Why are you saying these to me?

200
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,750
What if I say it's because

201
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,300
I like you?

202
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,260
Ever since "Race Against Time",

203
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,180
I fell in love with you.

204
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
At that time, you were emanating
a chilly aura.

205
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,230
But when you were answering
the questions,

206
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,900
your concentration and seriousness

207
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,230
attracted me deeply.

208
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,830
I marveled at that time.

209
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,830
How could there be such a wise girl?

210
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,230
But not long after,

211
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Lu Xingyan proposed to you on the show.

212
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,230
I thought I had no more chances
in this life.

213
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,230
Such a wonderful girl

214
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,060
appeared in front of me
just like this.

215
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,300
And then what?

216
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,450
(Shen Xingruo WIN)

217
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,230
She immediately became
somebody else's bride.

218
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,140
Then, in Munich,

219
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,180
unexpectedly,

220
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,180
we became roommates.

221
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,660
Did you know

222
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,900
how happy was I back then?

223
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,510
Yu Si?

224
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,830
I didn't expect that
my new roommate would be you.

225
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,350
Yeah.

226
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,750
What a coincidence.

227
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,060
What a coincidence.

228
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,780
I didn't expect that we'd
become classmates here.

229
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,350
Why did you come here to study?

230
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,590
Didn't you get married?

231
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,350
When I knew you and Lu Xingyan

232
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,540
did not get married,

233
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,990
I was actually relieved.

234
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,780
But when I saw you and Lu Xingyan
were still together,

235
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,990
I didn't take that step.

236
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,870
Because I could feel

237
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,940
your happiness back then.

238
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,020
​​I didn't want to ruin your life.

239
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,710
I continue liking you in my heart

240
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,870
while silently blessing you.

241
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,750
I really hope

242
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,140
that you will always be happy.

243
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,470
But Lu Xingyan let me down.

244
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,350
After you broke up,

245
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,300
I saw how Lu Xingyan hurt you.

246
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,710
I saw your sadness and pain.

247
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,990
I was anguished at that time.

248
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,940
I was in pain.

249
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,470
I started to hate him.

250
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,750
I hate him for leaving
such a good girl alone

251
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,900
and not cherishing her properly.

252
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,300
I hate him for hurting you like this,

253
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,870
but I didn't dare.

254
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,180
I didn't dare to take that step,

255
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,420
because I know
he is still in your heart.

256
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,870
I thought I just wanted

257
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,700
to guard you silently.

258
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,700
I would wait for the day

259
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,550
he disappears completely from your heart

260
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,830
before taking that step toward you.

261
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,590
I didn't expect

262
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,940
after everything,

263
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,700
both of you to meet again.

264
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,550
Why are you here?

265
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,140
I'm here to take some more footage.

266
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,980
I'm going to take a call.

267
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,740
Hello, Zhang Xu.

268
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,350
When you were away that day,

269
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,140
I told Lu Xingyan that

270
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,900
I liked you.

271
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,740
So Lu Xingyan was jealous

272
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,870
because he knew you liked me then.

273
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,980
I misunderstood him for so long.

274
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,500
I know that doing so

275
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,270
is very dirty and terrible.

276
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,310
But when you like someone

277
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,660
there's really no way to control

278
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,220
the possessiveness in your heart.

279
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,830
Shen Xingruo,

280
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,940
can you please stop being trapped
with your dad

281
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,310
or Lu Xingyan?

282
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,420
If you want to,

283
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,460
we can leave here anytime. At any time.

284
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,980
I can take you away.

285
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,590
We can go to Munich.

286
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,030
Or Berlin.

287
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,180
Anywhere.

288
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,110
All the conditions I offer you

289
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,630
remain valid.

290
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,740
You can keep making your TV shows

291
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,980
or go back to direct documentaries.

292
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,740
No matter what, I'll be with you.

293
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,110
We just have to reach that place

294
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,830
where we will never have to

295
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,310
worry about those things.

296
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,660
Alright?

297
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,700
You don't have to answer me immediately.

298
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll give you some time

299
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,310
to figure it out.

300
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,350
You know better than anyone

301
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,940
that the two of us

302
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,660
can only be friends.

303
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,270
I know.

304
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,500
But I want to give myself a chance.

305
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,310
A chance to protect you

306
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,870
and to be by your side.

307
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,110
Thank you for your concern,

308
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,460
but I think

309
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,220
I can handle my own matters.

310
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,390
It's true that there were some
minor conflicts between me and him.

311
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,220
But your appearance

312
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,420
calmed me down instantly.

313
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,110
I wasn't thinking about

314
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,420
how to reply to you at all.

315
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,900
Instead, I blamed myself

316
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,030
because I misunderstood Lu Xingyan

317
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,700
for so long.

318
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,390
His existence

319
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,900
is essential to me.

320
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,900
If I, Shen Xingruo,

321
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,830
can only have one person in this life,

322
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,390
he must be

323
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,790
Lu Xingyan.

324
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,980
Bed number five,

325
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,930
you have a meal sent to you by Mr. Lu,
a family member.

326
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
Are you here to send Xingruo a meal?

327
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,390
What a pity. I already gave mine to her.

328
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,550
Lu Xingyan,

329
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,350
Xingruo has agreed to go
to Berlin with me.

330
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,830
Are you afraid?

331
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,180
Impossible.

332
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,740
There's no way she will go with you.

333
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,390
Why are you so sure?

334
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,700
I believe she is the same as me.

335
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,940
In this life, other than each other,

336
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,700
we just can't fall in love with
anyone else.

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Do you know why your show

338
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,740
is so boring?

339
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,220
It's because your relationship
is too stable.

340
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,350
There are no ups and downs or suspense.

341
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,980
Congratulations.

342
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,070
Your love is more solid than gold.

343
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,740
Thank you.

344
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,180
Please come in.

345
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,110
Xingruo.

346
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,630
Why are you two here?

347
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,270
We've come to see you.

348
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,030
How are you?

349
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,980
Are you feeling better?

350
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm fine.

351
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,790
The doctor will observe me
for a few more days.

352
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,630
I think I'll be discharged tomorrow.

353
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,740
That's good.

354
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,790
How are you doing lately?

355
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,830
I'm fine.

356
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,390
You don't have to worry about me.

357
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,590
The moment I heard you were hurt

358
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,590
I was shocked,
so we came here immediately.

359
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,180
Don't worry.

360
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,790
But why did the two of you

361
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,350
bring so much food?

362
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,500
We were entrusted by somebody.

363
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,110
Let me be clear,

364
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,740
I'm not Lu Xingyan's stooge.

365
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,420
I, Chen Zhu, swear to the heavens

366
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,180
that I will stand by my sisters
to the death.

367
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,310
Lu Xingyan said he was wrong.

368
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,350
He said it was all his fault yesterday.

369
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,590
He's afraid that you'll be angry
and won't want to see him.

370
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,070
That's why he asked us

371
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,070
to bring so many things.

372
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,130
He's worried you might be hungry.

373
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,630
How could I be hungry?

374
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,180
Isn't he thoughtful?

375
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,980
Also, he hasn't returned to the hotel
for the past two days

376
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,500
He has been waiting downstairs
every day.

377
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,350
Are you sure you don't want to meet him?

378
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,240
Let me take this.

379
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,790
Hello.

380
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,500
Ms. Xing.

381
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,110
How are you feeling?

382
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,310
When will you be discharged?

383
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,140
Tomorrow.

384
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,350
That's great.

385
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,590
The Love Special of
Evergreen Clinic's Dr. Wang

386
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,590
is finished.

387
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,940
You are just in time for a look.

388
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,140
Sure, no problem.

389
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,740
Do you want to ask Mr. Lu to join us?

390
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,500
I'll send him a message.

391
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,700
Okay.

392
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,390
(Shen Xingruo) (The video of
Dr. Wang's wedding is done.)

393
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,790
(Let's go to the computer room
to watch it together tomorrow.)

394
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,270
(Lu Xingyan)
(Okay.)

395
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,930
(Happiness)

396
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,790
These "Happinesses"

397
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,030
are for those girls.

398
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,900
When they get married,

399
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,790
(Happiness)
they can put them up in the house.

400
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,900
Looks good, doesn't it?

401
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,790
You've been busy all morning.
Let's take a break.

402
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,220
Come, have some water.

403
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,180
Who are you?

404
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,220
Who am I?

405
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,310
Don't you remember?

406
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,590
Think, where have you seen me before?

407
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,030
You are Shenzhi.

408
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,700
Yes.

409
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,550
You wanted a wedding ceremony
to make up for the one we didn't have.

410
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,980
I thought it was meaningless then.

411
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,350
But now,

412
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,630
whenever she can't remember me,

413
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,630
I will let her watch this video.

414
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,420
It's all thanks to you all.

415
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,420
Thank you. Thank you very much.

416
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,070
Thank you.

417
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,940
Shenzhi.

418
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,350
You drink some water too.

419
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,390
Ms. Xing,

420
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,700
are there any problems?

421
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,030
No problems.

422
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,590
I think the edits are pretty good.

423
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,830
How about you, Mr. Lu? Any opinions?

424
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,700
No, I'm good.

425
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,350
If there's no problem

426
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,730
I will get started on
the title sequence.

427
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,740
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

428
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,350
It's pretty good, right?

429
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,350
Let's go out for a walk.

430
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,980
Sure, no problem.

431
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,630
Hello?

432
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,350
Hello, Mr. Lu.

433
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,740
I am Chen Fei.

434
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,940
Xingruo's father is dying soon.

435
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,180
What's wrong?

436
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,220
Chen Fei said that

437
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,420
your father is dying.

438
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,870
Is there no other way?

439
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,500
The patient's various indicators
are not very good.

440
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,030
He hasn't eaten much
in the past two days.

441
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,900
There is no point in continuing
the treatment here.

442
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,550
While the patient is awake now,

443
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,030
shouldn't you take him home?

444
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,110
He probably has two more days.

445
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,110
Alright, I understand.

446
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,110
You are here.

447
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,350
My dad's condition is so terrible.

448
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,740
Why are you only telling me now?

449
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,980
Because he thought that
the farewell party

450
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,350
caused you trouble.

451
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,420
He thinks you probably
don't want to see him.

452
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,180
He saw how sad you were that day.

453
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,900
He regretted what he did

454
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
and felt guilty.

455
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,590
He said he shouldn't have appeared.

456
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,940
He asked me not to disturb you.

457
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,180
But today, in this case,

458
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,700
I really have no choice.

459
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,900
My parents know several cancer experts.

460
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,740
Let me contact them.

461
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,500
No.

462
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,180
In fact, at the beginning
of this year, Shen

463
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,980
was diagnosed with
late-stage lung cancer.

464
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,980
He had his left lung removed
at that time.

465
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,220
Half of his right lung was also cut off.

466
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,180
He has been hospitalized after that.

467
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,630
He had several close calls.

468
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,740
You all heard what the doctor said.

469
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,350
We have used all available treatments.

470
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,350
Even he himself said

471
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,420
he doesn't want to suffer anymore.

472
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,700
Xingruo.

473
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,740
This morning he was calling your name
in a daze.

474
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,110
I don't have your phone number.

475
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,420
That's why I had to call Mr. Lu.

476
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,350
Your dad's clock is ticking.

477
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,110
Don't you want to go in and have a look?

478
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,740
Shen.

479
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,220
Shen.

480
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,740
Xingruo is here to see you.

481
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,220
Don't get excited.

482
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,500
Go get a pillow.

483
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,550
I thought I would

484
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,630
never see my daughter again in my life.

485
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,420
What are you saying?

486
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,270
I am your daughter.

487
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,660
No matter what

488
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,740
blood is thicker than water.

489
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,830
Actually, now that I think about it,

490
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,550
when I was still a kid,

491
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,500
I was pretty happy.

492
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,220
When you were a kid,

493
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,870
you were always pestering me,

494
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,830
running after me,

495
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,070
and even learned painting from me.

496
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,550
I thought my daughter would
become a painter when she grew up.

497
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Actually,

498
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,030
thinking about it now,

499
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,900
as a child,

500
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,500
I didn't like painting itself,

501
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,900
but just recording my life
in that moment.

502
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,590
Later,

503
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,110
I studied how to film documentaries

504
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,590
and realized that

505
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,740
painting was my inspiration.

506
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,980
Dad,

507
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,660
thank you.

508
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,870
If I didn't do those things,

509
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,940
our family could've

510
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,550
stayed happy forever.

511
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:00,030
If we stayed happy forever,

512
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,140
my dad wouldn't be

513
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,740
the great painter Shen Guangyao.

514
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,310
You have grown up.

515
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,940
My daughter has grown up.

516
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,150
You can see it now.

517
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,900
I remember all the words you said

518
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,750
during my farewell ceremony.

519
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,900
Deep in the soul,

520
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,150
we are tightly bound together.

521
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,420
Many things

522
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,830
have already happened.

523
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,020
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

524
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,790
But you coming to see me today

525
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,230
and talking it out,

526
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,790
I am contented.

527
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,580
I hope your life will be

528
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,230
easy

529
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,020
and happy.

530
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,350
Why is there a light?

531
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,150
Light?

532
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,540
It feels so warm.

533
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
Xingruo.

534
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,190
Go and take a look for me.

535
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
It's dazzling.

536
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,270
There is no light.

537
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,190
I'm leaving.

538
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,900
I'm here today

539
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,350
to say goodbye to you on behalf
of your dad.

540
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,190
This is the memorial diamond
made from your father's ashes.

541
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,620
He ordered it when he was still alive.

542
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,150
He said

543
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,710
this is how he will
stay with me forever.

544
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,710
What about my dad's memorial service?

545
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,540
Memorial service?

546
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,790
Are you talking about
the farewell ceremony?

547
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,790
Hasn't it already been done?

548
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,350
At that time,

549
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,750
everyone thought it was
a performance art.

550
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,790
In fact, Shen wanted a reason

551
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,350
to meet his friends one last time.

552
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,420
And to meet you.

553
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,390
Okay, that's enough talking.

554
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,710
From now on,

555
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,190
I want to show him the world.

556
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,940
Goodbye.

557
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,870
I have always thought

558
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,540
of myself as a child.

559
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,270
But now,

560
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,710
my parents are gone.

561
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,790
It's as if in a flash,

562
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,270
I saw the end of life.

563
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,460
The wall that once
separated me from death

564
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,350
has disappeared.

565
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,100
Lu Xingyan,

566
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,710
you are all I have left.

567
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,230
I will always be with you.

568
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,350
Forever.

569
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,540
Does your head still hurt?

570
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,830
It stopped hurting a long time ago.

571
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,620
Why did you think I was discharged
by the doctor?

572
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,460
By the way, I want to tell you something.

573
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,310
That day, Yu Si came to see me.

574
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,980
He said that actually,
he has always liked me.

575
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,230
I know that.

576
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,980
I met him in the parking lot.

577
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,900
What did he tell you?

578
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,790
He said his confession was successful.

579
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,350
No way.

580
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,100
I rejected him outright that day.

581
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,230
Of course, I know.

582
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,270
I'm sorry.

583
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,100
I was wrong.

584
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:36,670
When I didn't know the truth,
I shouldn't have

585
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,710
criticized you like that.

586
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,310
No, it's not your fault.

587
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,580
In fact, in these two days,

588
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,670
I gave it a lot of thought.

589
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,270
I also recalled a lot of things
between us.

590
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,310
I have some new insights now.

591
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,460
What insights?

592
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,830
For example,

593
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,350
I am giving you a cup of milk tea.

594
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,150
In my world,

595
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,540
I may have poured all my care and love

596
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,190
into this cup of milk tea.

597
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,060
But in your eyes,

598
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,100
it might just be a cup of milk tea.

599
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,750
So,

600
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,790
our understanding of the same matter

601
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,150
may differ.

602
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,900
Thinking about it now,

603
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,670
I was really naive.

604
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,870
But now I understand.

605
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,870
The right way to love someone

606
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,900
isn't to be moved by oneself.

607
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,460
It's to be in your partner's shoes

608
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,900
and feel the world from their view.

609
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,350
So,

610
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,620
I set a small goal for myself.

611
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,270
What small goal?

612
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,900
I will constantly adjust my perspective.

613
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,150
Be empathetic.

614
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,270
I will take your angle
more when looking at issues.

615
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:01,940
Moreover,

616
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,390
I will know a little more
about you every day.

617
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,540
Get closer to you every day.

618
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,900
Are you willing to give me this chance?

619
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,100
Yes, I am.

620
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,710
Lu Xingyan,

621
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,100
I seem to

622
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,620
love you more and more.

623
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,390
Thank you for loving me.

624
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,710
Shen Xingruo,

625
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,900
Thank you for accepting my love.

626
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,330
("Go Back Lover" post-episode interview)

627
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,570
What do you think
a good relationship is like?

628
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,010
I think it's like two people
seeing the world side by side.

629
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,930
It's not abandoning the whole world

630
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,170
for one person's sake.

631
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,250
A good love

632
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,290
is not necessarily about
pursuing a specific outcome.

633
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,210
What's more important

634
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,930
is experiencing the sweetness
of the moment.
