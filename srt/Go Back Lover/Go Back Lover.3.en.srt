Please stop by the roadside
at the junction up ahead.

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,380
There's still a bit of distance
from here to the school.

7
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,630
I can drop you off at the gate.

8
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,780
It's fine. It's near anyway.

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,320
I can also familiarize myself
with the route.

10
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,780
Alright then. Wait a second.
I'll stop there.

11
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,780
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

12
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,110
You're welcome. Be careful.

13
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,700
It's okay.

14
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,580
Stay safe.

16

I'll get off here too.

17
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,930
From now on, you can pick me up
here after school.

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,470
Alright. Be careful.

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,500
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,070
See you, Uncle Liu.

21
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,140
Bye-bye.

22
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,430

Stop pretending, Miss Drama Queen.

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,990
Why did you get off early?

25
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,900
Are you trying to avoid being seen
that we come to school together?

26
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,060
You ask even if you
already know the answer.

27
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,070
My mum told me to take care
of you at school.

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,830
Do you think...

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,940
Just take it casually.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,230
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

31
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,220
That's great.

32
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,990

(Lu Xingyan's Personal Profile)

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,140
So, has Lu Xingyan

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,670
agreed to participate in the show?

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,830
He said he's still considering it.

41
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,510
Anyway, I've done all I can.

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,990
I can only leave it to fate now.

43
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,300
Let me ask you,

44
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,060
setting aside your role
as Producer Shen,

45
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,830
if you were just Shen Xingruo,

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,790
would you want him to participate?

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,250
(Lu Xingyan's Personal Profile)

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,390
Honestly, no.

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,460
Because the two of us

50
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,300
have different expectations
for the future.

51
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,270
And, neither of us is willing
to compromise.

52
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,140
So, our current state
of not disturbing each other

53
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,230
is the best.

54
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,300
Exactly.

55
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,140
That's the right way to think about it.

56
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,430
You're such a role model
for modern women.

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,710
Stop teasing me.

58
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,580
Never look back to the old times, okay?

59
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,210

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,270
Alright, I'm going.

61

Go ahead.

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,180
You should sleep soon too.

next to me. I...

85

Why did you drink so much
that you ended up like this?

86
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,060
You really came.

87
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,030
Come, have a seat.

Everyone makes mistakes.

89
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,430
I've been involved in
the social game for so many years.

90
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,470
It's normal to have some small slip-ups.

91
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,230
Weren't you having dinner with Mr. Yang?

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,060
He has already agreed
upon the investment amount.

93
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,670
What makes you drink yourself
into this state?

94
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,110
Yeah, but maintaining relationships
needs constant work,

95
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,860
Right?

96
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,470
Is there something amiss?

97
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,030
That's nothing. Look at me.

98
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,180
Everything is just good.

99
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,910
I'm your business partner,

100
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,230
and also the producer of the show.

101
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,860
If there's a funding issue,

102
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,500
I need to adjust the plan accordingly.

103
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,700
Anyway, it's reasonable

104
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,620
for you to tell me the truth.

105
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,620
During dinner, he suddenly told me

106
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,910
that their company

107
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,230
wants to seize the short video trend.

108
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,380
So, they want to cut
part of our funding.

109
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,790
How much are they cutting?

110
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,060
Six million.

111
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,180
We hired our team
based on the initial budget,

112
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,230
and we've already paid the deposit.

113
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,180
Now, if they reduce our budget,

114
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,590
how can we take back the money

115
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,620
that we've already paid?

116
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,620
Additionally, we're about
to make the second payment.

117
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,300
They are sabotaging us!

118
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,620
I know it clearly.

119
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,990
That's why I went to dinner tonight

120
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,670
with the mindset
that I had to take the risk.

121
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,430
I thought,

122
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,110
if one shot didn't work,
then I had three.

123
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,330
If three shots didn't work,
then I had five.

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,380
If it didn't work still,

125
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,620
then I had myself a bet on it.

126
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,860
I just want to get
that six million back.

127
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,060
Don't worry. I'm sober now.

128
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,590
My stomach just hurts a little now.

129
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm fine. I'll keep drinking
with them tomorrow.

130
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,500
Bro, you have a stomach bleeding.

131
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,860
You'll need a week
of intravenous treatment.

132
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,820
If you insist on drinking tomorrow,
you're taking a risk of your life.

133
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,530
You...

134
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,350
Keep your voice down.

135
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,430
If I can't get that six million back,

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,180
it won't just be me who's finished.

137
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,110
The whole company will be collapsed.

138
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,720
You should listen to me.
You don't have to worry about it.

139
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,790
I've got it under control.

140
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,990
What's wrong?

141
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,550
Or this way,

142
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,500
I have a house in my hometown

143
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,180
that my mom left me.

144
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,030
I can use it as collateral

145
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,620
to cover the second payment.

146
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,670
Shen Xingruo,

147
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,990
are you gone insane?

148
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,820
How can a producer

149
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,230
take the risk for that?

150
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,910
You know, it's too risky to do that.

151
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,940
Don't you know that?

152
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,500
I know the risks.

153
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,620
From the preliminary planning
of this show

154
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,620
to budgeting and selecting the team,
and also the final presentation of it,

155
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,060
I've been involved in every phase.

156
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,430
I love our show.

157
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,030
We've been

158
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,230
putting so much effort into it.

159
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,910
I know it very well.

160
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,260
Our priority now is to figure out

161
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,620
how to cover the second payment
and keep the team steady.

162
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,230
We can find new investors later.

163
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,170
Let me take my house
as the collateral, okay?

164
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,030
No.

165
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,430
You have a wife and kids.

166
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,790
Your risk is greater than mine.

167
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,260
I can assume the money
that I spent on it

168
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,790
as an investment.

169
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,910
Stop it.

170
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,620
Just listen to me.

171
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,830
We should stop arguing about that.

Mr. Zhang.

219
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,430
What makes you here?

220
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,180
I heard from the staff

221
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,180
that Mr. Lu is always working
on the front lines.

222
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,670
I'm fortunate to witness it today.

223
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,730
If you have anything, I don't mind
you go straight to the point.

224
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,790
Hmm...

225
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,980
I do have something I'd like
to discuss with you.

226
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,180
Mr. Zhang.

227
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,980
Thank you.

228
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,720
Regarding the guest's invitation,

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,580
have you made a decision?

230
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,980
I think that your concept
is quite innovative,

231
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,510
but personally...

232
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,430
Mr. Lu, you're really good
at identifying good things.

233
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,870
You can pinpoint
our core competitiveness at a glance.

234
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,100
The competition in the variety
show industry is intense nowadays.

235
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,030
Everyone is trying
to outshine each other.

236
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,550
Our show focuses on

237
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,870
the quality content, and we believe that
as long as we put in our best effort,

238
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,390
we are able to achieve a breakthrough.

239
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,580
To be honest,

240
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,150
Producer Shen and I

241
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,980
are planning to mortgage our houses

242
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,270
to fill the funding gap.

243
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,430
Let's say if we are not confident
for the show,

244
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,430
- how could we possibly...
- Hold on.

245
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,750
You mentioned, Producer Shen
is going to mortgage the house?

246
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,820
It's us.

247
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,030
We decided to mortgage our houses.

248
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,870
This is not important.

249
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,030
We've got everything ready,

250
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,460
all we need is your presence.

251
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,100
Mr. Lu, you must join us as a guest.

252
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,550
It's a win-win for both of us.

253
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,700
I believe

254
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
that you won't be
disappointed in our show.

255
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,550
How much was your initial funding gap?

256
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,100
Six million.

257
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,180
Six million.

258
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,180
Mr. Lu,

259
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,580
why are you asking this?

260
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,510
Of course, I need
to fully understand the project

261
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,670
before making a decision.

262
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,870
Well,

263
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,270
whether I participate or not,

264
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,460
I'll give you a quick answer.

265
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,700
Alright, I'll be waiting
for your good news.

266
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,370
I won't take up any
more of your time today.

267
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,550
Thank you.

268
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,580
My phone is 24-hours available for you.

269
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,490
Goodbye.

270
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,870
Hello.

271
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,460
How much do we have left
for the promotional budget this year?

272
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,910
Traveling through dimensions.

273
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,140
There are still people in the world
where time has stopped.

274
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,870
I disagree.

275
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,700
Of course, I can't agree.

276
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,180
Come on, have some water
and calm down yourself.

277
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,030
Don't try to convince me
with sweet talk.

278
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,460
That's why I feel strange
with your personality today.

279
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,980
Serving me tea,

280
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,550
and offering me ten epic game outfits.

281
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,640
It turns out
that you've been waiting for this.

282
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,180
If you don't like it, you can pay me
back for the game outfits.

283
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,430
Moreover,

284
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,870
weren't you the one

285
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,340
who suggested me go on the
show to promote the resort?

286
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,980
I asked you to go by yourself,

287
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,580
not take the whole company with you.

288
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,940
Apart from that,

289
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,750
we've never invested
in a variety show before.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,750
Aren't you afraid your money
will be wasted?

291
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,670
There's a first time for everything.

292
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,980
Moreover, I've studied their data.

293
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,670
This is a great opportunity.

294
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,750
How pleasant that sounds to be!

295
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,180
I know what you are thinking.

296
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,180
Wise people avoid falling in love,

297
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,870
only fools repeat the mistakes.

298
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,030
Shen Xingruo is your stumbling stone.

299
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,300
Look at this.

300
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,460
This is the contract I asked
Zhai Jiajing to draft.

301
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,340
First, it clearly defines

302
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,910
the promotional model for the resort.

303
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,870
The capital, Kangte has no objections.

304
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,820
Second,

305
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
I've requested they complete

306
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,170
the project's preliminary filming
within three months,

307
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,180
including the launch,

308
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,030
to ensure our promotional effect.

309
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,220
Additionally,

310
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,630
we have priority repayment rights.

311
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,750
I didn't expect you to be so thorough.

312
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,030
I thought you were...

313
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,980
Thought what?

314
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,690
I thought you had fallen
into the love trap again.

315
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,790
As usual, Mr. Lu is so professional.

316
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,550
You have a very thorough consideration.

317
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,300
I have no objections.

318
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,910
I do.

319
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,870
You didn't even ask before doubting me.

320
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,460
I'm very disappointed in you.

321
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,630
Give me back the money
for the game outfits.

322
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,750
Hey bro.

323
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,060
What is mine is yours.

324
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,270
No need to keep things separate.

325
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,220
Come on. Have some water and calm down.

326
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,620
I'll borrow it to you a few days later.

327
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,630
Please have a seat.

328
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,220
Mr. Lu, you called me here urgently.

329
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,700
Have you decided to join our show?

330
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,550
I just wanted to tell you,

331
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,750
regarding the conditions
you mentioned before,

332
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,460
I wasn't very satisfied.

333
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,390
So...

334
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,750
You turned me down in person last time.

335
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,030
And now, you call me here just
to reject me again?

336
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,920
What's wrong with you?

337
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,340
Does it give you satisfaction

338
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,150
to see my defeated expression, Mr. Lu?

339
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,630
Don't be so hasty.

340
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,350
Let me finish.

341
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,540
I can participate in your show,

342
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,430
but on the condition that I want
to invest as a title sponsor.

343
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,940
But it's only limited to six million.

344
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,450
You will need to figure out
the rest of the fund yourselves.

345
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,350
And,

346
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,780
I need the filming
to take place at the resort,

347
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,150
and the show must cooperate
fully with the hotel

348
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,830
to complete the agreed promotional plan.

349
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,150
Did Zhang Xu tell you all of this?

350
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,540
I asked about it myself.

351
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,630
It's because your show is great

352
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,150
that I'm willing to participate.

353
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,980
Of course,

354
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,430
to ensure you follow
through on your promises,

355
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,930
I have the right to understand
the progress of the show.

356
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,310
Mr. Lu,

357
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,390
we invited you to participate
in the show,

358
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,020
not to invest in it.

359
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,540
I understand.

360
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,780
The investment

361
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,150
is purely for business reasons.

362
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,430
Business reasons?

363
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,740
Do you realize how risky it is

364
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
to invest in a show?

365
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,180
Any investment

366
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,260
involves risk.

367
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,390
And, I've done some background research.

368
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,390
Your team has Director Jun,

369
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,180
who directed the hit show
"The Transit Journey"

370
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,540
that was recently launched.

371
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,670
But due to conflicts with the investors,

372
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,980
he was being substituted.

373
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,430
K and Ye Zi have worked
on productions domestically,

374
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,780
so they are experienced.

375
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,940
And, He Ming

376
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,780
is your junior from overseas.

377
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,940
He has won awards with you
for the television show.

378
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,350
As for Zhang Xu,

379
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,070
though he may seem unreliable,

380
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,630
he is good at recognizing talent

381
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,150
and treats his friends with loyalty.

382
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,150
That's why he managed

383
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,260
to unite all of you.

384
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,540
With people like you guys
leading the show

385
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,980
and your control
over the general direction,

386
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,630
I'm confident

387
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,150
in the potential of this investment.

388
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,150
I also understand your concerns.

389
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,180
A lot has happened between us.

390
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,590
You probably don't want things
to get complicated.

391
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,150
So this time,

392
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,180
our relationship is purely
as business partners.

393
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,390
I'm sorry

394
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,460
that I got a bit emotional just now.

395
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,070
Thank you for understanding me.

396
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,980
And also, thanks
for recognizing my team.

397
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Don't be too hasty.

398
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,940
I still have a few
additional conditions.

399
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,780
Go ahead.

400
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,040
I want the right to select
the guests for the show,

401
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,210
mainly to ensure that the direction
of the show's content

402
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,430
is aligned with the
promotional ideas of the resort.

403
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,430
Is that okay?

404
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,180
As long as it doesn't go
against the guests' wishes,

405
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,220
we can fully cooperate on that.

406
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,980
Do you have any other conditions?

407
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,830
No, that's all.

408
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,430
Well, since you don't have any added,

409
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,150
I have a suggestion.

410
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,780
Go ahead.

411
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,980
You only need to invest three million

412
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,780
to become our title sponsor.

413
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,220
The remaining three million

414
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,940
can be a fixed investment

415
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,870
with a ten percent interest rate.

416
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,980
Forget the ten percent.

417
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,130
Otherwise, people will say
I'm taking advantage of you.

418
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,740
How about we stick to the old rules?

419
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,940
Do you remember?

420
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,390
Eight percent.

421
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,020
Got it.

422
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,460
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

423
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,180
I hope you remain

424
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,780
as generous and trustworthy as always.

425
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,150
You've discussed so much with me.

426
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,150
Have you consulted
your partner's opinion?

427
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,630
He has no objections.

428
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,390
Great.

429
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,780
Xingruo.

430
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,830
- Do you still remember me?
- Xing, why is she here?

431
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,030
We need Lawyer Zhai to take
a look at the agreement just now.

432
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,350
Zhai Jiajing, it's been
a long time since I met you.

433
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,740
Yeah, it's been a while.

434
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,110
I remember the last time we met was

435
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,150
at the recording scene
of "Race Against Time".

436
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,780
Who would've thought,
in the blink of an eye,

437
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,830
you've become such a mature producer.

438
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,540
I heard your variety show

439
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,780
is about to start filming soon.

440
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,180
How is it going?
Are you still looking for a guest?

441
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,390
You can consider me.

442
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,460
Sure!

443
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,230
If Lawyer Zhai is willing to show up,
I'd be more than happy to have you.

444
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,700
But, this is

445
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,260
a dating show about exes.

446
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,350
Is your ex willing to come?

447
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,460
I've been so focused
on my career these past years.

448
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,390
Where would I find an ex?

449
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,500
Forget it.

450
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,870
I'd better do my job well.

451
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,940
All the best to you.

452
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,980
I hope we'll have
a successful collaboration.

453
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,540
Don't worry.

454
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,700
I won't disappoint you.

455
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,150
You better do that.

456
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,910
Our lives and property
are in your hands.

457
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,260
Alright, give me two days.

458
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,220
By 9:00 AM the day after tomorrow,

459
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,830
I'll have a revised plan

460
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,700
that everyone will be satisfied with.

461
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,180
Is that okay?

462
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,180
Sure.

463
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,540
That's great.

464
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,390
The appearance of the "Double-Star Team"

465
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,260
will definitely be invincible.

466
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,590
Xing, the investment supervisor
from Kangte Group

467
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,260
should be arriving soon.

468
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,150
Let's go meet him.

469
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,180
Kangte?

470
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,430
What is that?

471
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,150
That's the investor
we signed the bet-on agreement with.

472
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,770
In other words, they are
our first party,

473
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,530
which is also the first party
of your first party.

474
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,540
You could put it that way.

475
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,870
Lawyer Zhai.

476
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,870
When you were at the
headquarters in Germany,

477
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,830
did you meet this supervisor?

478
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,840
- No, I didn't.
- I have a PPT here.

479
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,480
Let me show you.

480
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,390
You didn't meet him either?

481
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,980
No, it's my first time too.

482
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,940
That sounds mysterious.

483
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,180
Are you sure you sent
the right location?

484
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,070
Why isn't he here yet?

485
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,070
I confirmed by message just now.

486
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,220
He should be here any minute.

487
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,780
Let's wait a bit longer.

488
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,740
Xingruo!

489
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,180
Xingruo.

490
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Why are you here?

491
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,260
I'm waiting for someone with Mr. Lu.

492
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,310
The person Mr. Lu is waiting for is me.

493
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,980
You are the one
they have been talking about,

494
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,390
the person from Kangte?

495
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,790
Yes.

496
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,210
When I went to the headquarters
last time, I didn't get to meet you.

497
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,980
I didn't expect

498
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,390
you to be the legendary Evan Yu.

499
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,540
Lawyer Zhai.

500
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,130
If I had known you were this pretty,
we would have met long ago.

501
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,980
It's my pleasure to meet you,
Lawyer Zhai.

502
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,660
According to the
capital increase agreement,

503
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,910
three months before the
bet-on agreement is ended,

504
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,590
the company will assign a supervisor

505
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,700
to inspect the operations of the resort.

506
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,630
We will have the authority
for direct management.

507
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,980
So in the coming months,

508
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,430
don't find me too bothersome.

509
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,740
How could we?

510
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,980
We are old acquaintances after all.

511
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,350
Did you forget?

512
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,020
Back during the filming
of "Race Against Time",

513
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,220
I was defeated by both of you.

514
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,670
Were you sitting in the audience?

515
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,590
On the stage.

516
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,220
I'm sorry.

517
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,110
Back then,

518
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,590
all my attention was on Xingruo.

519
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,390
So... I'm sorry.

520
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,430
Sorry. Sorry.

521
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,150
Mr. Yu.

522
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,830
What a coincidence.

523
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,910
I didn't expect to see you again.

524
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,150
We thought you hadn't arrived yet,

525
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,510
so we've been waiting for you here.

526
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,940
I checked in in advance. And you are...?

527
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,630
You are an eminent man
with a short memory.

528
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,700
I'm Xu Chengzhou.

529
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,940
I was also a part of the finals
of "Race Against Time".

530
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,980
Were you on stage too?

531
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,980
No, I was in the audience.
An enthusiastic viewer.

532
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,740
In the audience?

533
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,630
I'm the financial director
of the resort.

534
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,260
If you have any financial matters,

535
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,220
feel free to contact me.

536
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,870
I look forward to working with you.

537
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,630
This is our director, Mr. Lu Xingyan.

538
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,020
Mr. Lu, finally we meet again.

539
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,590
You left quite an impression
on me last time.

540
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,150
I wonder if you still remember me.

541
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,730
Even if Mr. Yu's appearance

542
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,130
turned into ashes, I can still remember.

543
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,590
Yeah.

544
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,020
Mr. Lu means

545
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,500
he's Mr.Yu's die-hard fan.

546
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,180
Great.

547
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,350
Well then, Xingruo.

548
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,220
I'll discuss it with them for a bit,
and we can have lunch afterwards.

549
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:45,980
How about that?

550
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,420
You should focus on your work first.

551
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,220
That's fine.

552
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,220
I'm here today

553
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,430
just to do an inspection.

554
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,150
But after seeing Mr. Lu,

555
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,780
the inspection is already done.

556
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,180
Mr. Yu, weren't you supposed to check

557
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,030
our development plan
for the fourth quarter?

558
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,670
The materials are ready.

559
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,930
Shall we move to the meeting room?

560
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,830
You have my email, right?

561
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,020
Just send it to me via email.

562
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,930
I'll be staying here
for a few more days,

563
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,260
so I'll notify you
after I've reviewed everything.

564
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,390
Right now, I'm more interested in

565
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,830
catching up with my old friend.

566
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,910
What if we all have lunch together?

567
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,040
Then, we can discuss
about work later in the afternoon.

568
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,980
What do you think?

569
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,180
Alright.

570
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,830
Whatever Xingruo says goes for me.

571
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,310
Exactly.

572
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,390
Our resort has
a great dining environment.

573
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,700
How about we eat there?

574
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,740
And you can inspect the resort too.

575
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,020
Sounds great.

576
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,260
I'll lead the way.

577
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,330
By the way, I forgot to ask earlier,

578
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,460
what were you and Lu Xingyan
talking about with regard to guests?

579
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,600
What does that have to do with him?

580
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,540
Lu Xingyan is my guest.

581
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,230
Shen Xingruo, are you out of your mind?

582
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,630
Have you been so stressed lately
that you lost your mind?

583
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,110
Did you forget how he tormented you

584
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,630
when you broke up?

585
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,980
You watched it here for days,

586
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,870
not eating for several days.

587
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,090
If you keep this up, your body
won't be able to bear it.

588
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm not hungry.

589
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,020
See.

590
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,630
You've got low blood sugar now.

591
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,980
Hurry up. Get dressed.

592
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,230
I bring you out to eat. Let's go.

593
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,630
Leave me alone.

594
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,180
I'm not trying to meddle,

595
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,830
but if you faint here,

596
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,700
the school is going to blame me, right?

597
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,460
Stop talking and get up.
Put on your shoes.

598
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,830
I've always been curious.

599
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,460
You two were together for so long.

600
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,260
What do you feel like after breaking up?

601
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,910
It's like

602
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,180
someone took a knife

603
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,540
and slowly cut away

604
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,430
part of you,

605
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,980
bit by bit.

606
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,220
If it hurts you so much,

607
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,670
why don't you go find him?

608
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,350
What's the point of finding him?

609
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,940
So we could

610
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,940
torture each other again?

611
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,940
Yes, you're right.

612
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,780
Isn't there a saying,

613
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,910
"a short pain is better
than a long one"?

614
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,500
Since you have

615
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,180
already made up your mind

616
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,180
to make the cut,

617
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,260
why not look at it differently?

618
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,830
Take that cut

619
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,220
as experience and a lesson,

620
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,630
turning it into strength

621
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,430
and remind yourself

622
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,830
never to go back.

623
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,780
Have some.

624
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,220
That's enough. Stop eating.

625
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,430
Do you even remember

626
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,700
what you said before?

627
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,740
Now you look for him yourself.

628
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,070
Are you blurred?

629
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,150
Keep your mouth shut.

630
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Why should I shut up?

631
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,070
I tell you,

632
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,700
you can choose anyone as a guest,

633
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
just not him.

634
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,430
Yu Si,

635
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,870
can you stop meddling in my matter?

636
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,030
Mr. Yu, regarding the matter
of me being a guest,

637
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,780
do you have any objections?

638
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,150
I do.

639
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,020
And, it is a strong objection.

640
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,350
What would everyone like to order?

641
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,150
I'll have a hand-punch lemon tea.

642
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,460
This is truly Mr. Lu's restaurant.

643
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,830
It matches your style exactly.

644
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,260
You used to hit people.

645
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,540
Now you punch the lemons.

646
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,540
Mr.Yu, you've misunderstood.

647
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,460
Mr. Lu isn't that kind of person.

648
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,310
It wasn't me misunderstanding him,
it was him misunderstanding me.

649
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,980
Back then, he thought I had
something going on with Xingruo,

650
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,110
and he beat me up.

651
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,910
This incident

652
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,670
even made it to the Munich police.

653
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,540
Do you remember?

654
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,150
I do.

655
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,390
I already apologized to Mr. Yu back then.

656
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,030
I didn't expect Mr. Yu
to hold a grudge this long.

657
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,740
I'm not that petty.

658
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,430
I wouldn't take the power of Kangte

659
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,390
to target you.

660
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,830
Of course not.

661
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,700
Mr. Yu is a true professional.

662
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,310
Although I haven't worked
with you for long,

663
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,910
I can feel that.

664
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,980
Thank you.

665
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,260
After all, Mr. Yu's authority
is limited.

666
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,350
You don't have the authority
to make the decision.

667
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,630
As only a senior accountant
at Kangte Group,

668
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,910
it would be hard

669
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,870
to target us as well, wouldn't it?

670
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,310
Let's order.

671
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:27,910
Xingruo.

672
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,740
Is this fried rice okay for you?

673
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,500
You can order your own food.

674
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
I'm cutting carbs lately.

675
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,500
Cutting carbs?

676
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,670
That's right. Carbs contain sugar.

677
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Some things

678
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,780
may seem sweet,

679
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,220
but in reality, they are just burdens.

680
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,220
Not worth it.

681
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,260
Then how about this?

682
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,150
Let me order you a "Never Look Back".

683
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,700
A fish, rich in protein
and good for health.

684
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,740
Fish head is great.

685
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,310
Waiter, we would like
to have a fish head.

686
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,230
Got it.

687
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,150
One fish head.

688
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,740
Okay.

689
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,460
And, add on a fried...

690
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,590
Scum.

691
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,030
Mr. Yu, is your Chinese not that good?

692
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,020
There's no such dish on the menu.

693
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,070
Oh?

694
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,180
Sorry.

695
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,780
When I was ordering just now,
I made eye contact with you.

696
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,780
When I see your face,

697
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,830
the word "scum"

698
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,910
just flashes through my mind.

699
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,700
My bad.

700
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,940
What do you mean by that?

701
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,740
Do you see that?

702
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,540
He was just pretending
to be emotionally stable.

703
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,020
You can see his true colors now.

704
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,910
Let's go with a set meal instead.

705
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,430
It's too laborious
to order dish by dish, right?

706
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,220
Up to you guys then.

707
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,590
All these signature dishes.

708
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,180
Bring all of the signature dishes.

709
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,230
Okay.

710
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,980
Go ahead and prepare it.

711
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,500
Alright.

712
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,830
Since Xingruo doesn't want
to talk about the past,

713
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,630
let's talk about something else.

714
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,500
How is the show's progress?

715
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,630
I introduced your proposal

716
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,260
to a few local friends,

717
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,530
and they're very interested in it
and would like to invest it.

718
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,410
Shall I arrange a time
to discuss it with them?

719
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,270
It's not necessary.

720
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,830
I've already found
an investor for the show.

721
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,060
Who is it? Which company?

722
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm the new investor.

723
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,660
Now I understand
why you are making him a guest.

724
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,390
You are being threatened
by his investment.

725
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,100
Back then, when he proposed to you,

726
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,350
he forced you

727
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,870
to accept it using the show.

728
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,500
After all these years,

729
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,870
he is still using the same tactic.

730
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,410
Mr. Lu, can't you come up
with something new?

731
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,100
Xingruo, if you are being forced,

732
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,660
just blink to me.

733
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,540
I approached Mr. Lu first
to propose the collaboration.

734
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,350
He didn't force me.

735
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,100
You told me before
that you were short on funds,

736
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,120
that you are amidst the hardship.

737
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,870
I called you so many times,

738
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,460
but you wouldn't accept my investment.

739
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,980
You said

740
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,100
something about principles,

741
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,710
not wanting to get money
from friends and family.

742
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,830
But in the end,

743
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,660
you went to him.

744
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,540
The resort and the show
are highly integrated.

745
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,420
It's a win-win situation for both of us.

746
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,310
Integrated?

747
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,130
Have you forgotten what
it was like being tied up with Mr. Lu?

748
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,270
And, Mr. Lu's resort itself

749
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,500
is on edge now.

750
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,950
Does he even have money
to invest in a variety show?

751
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,270
It's precisely because we are on edge,

752
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,830
that we need to make a comeback.

753
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,350
I have great confidence
in Ms. Shen's show.

754
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,130
Ms. Yu's capabilities
is undeniably outstanding.

755
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,660
We will make a big impact
for the next quarter.

756
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,910
I hope Mr. Yu and Kangte Group
will rest assured.

757
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,980
Xingruo,

758
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,870
as your old friend and as an investor,

759
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,100
I'd like to remind you

760
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,660
that things will turn terrible

761
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,230
if you simply try anything in a crisis.

762
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,060
I know the condition
of Mr. Lu's company.

763
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,910
His ideals are high,
but the execution is tough.

764
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,710
You've put a lot of
effort and energy into your show.

765
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,190
I think you should look for

766
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,100
a more stable source of funding.

767
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,230
Mr. Lu, anything to help you with?

768
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
I leave for the restroom.

769
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,730
I need to go to the restroom too.

770
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,130
(Go Back Lover, Interview Session)

771
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,490
What does the 'old rule'
between you and Lu Xingyan

772
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,490
refer to?

773
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,730
(What is the 'old rule'
between you two?)

774
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,660
(Year 2014, 17 years old, second year of high school)
The reverse of the Three Perpendicular Theorem

775
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,020
(Year 2014, 17 years old, second year of high school)
basically means that

776
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,190
if it's perpendicular to the diagonal,
it's perpendicular to the projection.

777
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,540
Got it?

778
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,500
Got it.

779
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,540
That's the end of today's lesson.

780
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,490
Keep reviewing it later.

781
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,560
That's great. Finally, it's over.

782
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,460
It's time to do the worksheet.

783
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,710
Here, do this worksheet.

784
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,230
You don't need to take it so seriously.

785
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,980
My mum asked you to tutor me,

786
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,410
you can just take it casually, okay?

787
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,940
Let's not make things hard
for both of us, okay?

788
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,750
Sure.

789
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,500
Wait a second.

790
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,980
Why are you so easygoing today?

791
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,100
Do you need a favor from me?

792
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,790
I'm out of money on my meal card.

793
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,500
Can you lend me some?

794
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,390
What happened to you?

795
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,660
Do you even have to borrow money to eat?

796
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,140
Are you a real Cinderella?

797
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,940
I didn't say I wouldn't lend it.

798
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,140
But in return,

799
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,100
I get to ask you a question.

800
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,060
Go ahead.

801
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,100
Why don't your parents take care of you?

802
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,190
My mom passed away.

803
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,750
What about your dad?

804
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,030
He doesn't take care of you either.

805
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,750
I don't want to spend
single penny of his.

806
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,270
Why?

807
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,140
Are you lending me or not?

808
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,470
Sure.

809
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,330
How much do you want?

810
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,190
1,500.

811
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,020
I'll pay you back with interest.

812
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,660
Pay with interest? How many percent?

813
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,430
Eight percent.

814
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:18,980
Deal.

815
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,710
I transferred it.

816
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,830
When I get my scholarship,

817
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,940
I'll pay you back.

818
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,030
Just give me five more
tutoring sessions next month,

819
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,600
and we'll call it even
for the money as tutoring fees.

820
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,130
It's troublesome to transfer it
back and forth.

821
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,190
You're barely surviving one session.

822
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,530
Why do you want five more sessions?

823
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,710
Can't I pursue self-improvement?

824
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,710
You just focus on teaching me well.

825
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,490
(What is the 'old rule' between you two?)
So are you using this amount of money

826
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,090
to try to start over with Shen Xingruo?

827
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,250
I never try to use money
to manipulate people.

828
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,210
As an investor and her old friend,

829
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,090
I'm helping her out

830
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,890
where I can.

831
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,730
But, if this money

832
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,650
creates extra interactions between us,

833
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,210
that's beyond my control.
