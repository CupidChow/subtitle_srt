=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,250
(June 19, 2018,
the day of filming "Race Against Time")

4
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,430
So, that means

5
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,300
I passed it.

6
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,430
I can go to the Munich Film Academy.

7
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,739
Yeah.

8
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,910
Out of the 12 people
in our course who applied,

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,370
you were the only one
who got accepted.

10
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,110
(Admission Letter)
Xingruo, congratulations!

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,110
I'll help you prepare the
necessary materials for the school

12
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,350
these next few days.

13
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,020
You can start getting ready

14
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,860
for your visa.

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,660
Alright.

16
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,190
I understand.

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,580
You don't seem too happy about it.

18
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,990
You'll be away for two years.

19
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,840
Are you worried
your boyfriend won't agree?

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,140
Yes, I'm a bit concerned about that.

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,710
Find a good time

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,020
to talk to him about it.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,350
It's such a great opportunity.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,470
Your boyfriend must be
very happy for you.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,780
The school has a
student practice week every year.

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,630
They'll invite many famous directors

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,470
for giving lectures.

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,630
The outstanding performers

29
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,070
might even have the chance
to collaborate on a film.

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,220
I believe in your potential.

31
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,630
As long as you put in effort,

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,630
you'll obtain fruitful outcomes.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,830
Alright, thank you, teacher.

34
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,910
I will do my best.

35
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,630
You're filming the final episode

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,270
of 'Race Against Time'
this afternoon, right?

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,950
Yes, I'm heading there soon.

38
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,510
Once you get
to the filming scene,

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,580
a teacher from the school
will contact you.

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,830
Relax.

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,990
You'll be okay.

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,950
I'll give it my all.

43
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,230
Thank you, teacher.

44
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,670
Alright, goodbye!

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,550
Goodbye, teacher.

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,210
(Admission Letter)

47
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,130
(Lu Xingyan)
(The car for the champion is ready.)

48
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,860
(Please proceed to the entrance.)

49
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,020
What's up? Are you in a bad mood?

50
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,430
Is that because you haven't thought
of what to say in your champion speech?

51
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,950
Do you need me to help you draft it out?

52
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,140
You know my greatest strength is
my communication skills.

53
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,180
What is it called?

54
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,710
Great leadership style.

55
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,740
Stop talking nonsense.

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,430
I'm not even sure I'll win.

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,110
Impossible!

58
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,740
With me as your solid backup,

59
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,740
you must be the champion.

60
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,710
Don't worry!

61
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,390
Today will be the most
unforgettable day of your life.

62
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,620
Come on, let's go.

63
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,970
=Episode 24=

64
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,530
(Thank you, Time,
for bringing you back into my life.)

65
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:32,010
(Year 2024)

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,110
Here you go.

67
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,700
You haven't eaten much.

68
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,820
Why are you feeling so nauseous?

69
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,550
I don't know.

70
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,260
It must've been the wrong restaurant
you picked for lunch.

71
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,790
That can't be it.

72
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,550
Isn't that your
favourite barbecue buffet?

73
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,820
Don't you remember the time

74
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,030
you devoured over ten plates
of beef all by yourself?

75
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,960
You even scared the owner!

76
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,350
You swore

77
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,550
no one would know about that

78
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,060
except the two of us.

79
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,180
Sorry, we've made so many oaths

80
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,180
that I can't keep track anymore.
I promise this won't happen again.

81
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,910
My dear, I accepted your proposal.

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,060
Am I dizzy from throwing up,
or are you out of your mind?

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,030
When did I propose to you?

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,060
There are flowers, balloons, and
'Will you marry me?' written all over here.

85
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,230
If it's not a proposal, what is it?

86
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,060
I didn't prepare this.

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,150
If it wasn't you, then who?

88
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,910
Maybe it's something Xingruo left

89
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,150
while working here earlier.

90
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,150
No way.

91
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
Xingruo proposing?

92
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,350
Even you yourself don't believe that.

93
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,500
Then, who's that?

94
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,430
Proposing?

95
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,230
Lu Xingyan?

96
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,260
This guy never learns from mistakes!

97
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,500
They just get along well for a few days,
and he's already planning a proposal.

98
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,470
Is he a marriage maniac?

99
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,940
I bet

100
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,620
he's going to propose
during the final episode of the show.

101
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,820
What should we do?

102
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,720
Here's the plan.

103
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,180
You go talk to Lu Xingyan,

104
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,670
and I'll tell Xingruo,

105
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,720
so she's mentally prepared.

106
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,620
This is a bad idea.

107
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,150
Isn't that going to ruin the surprise?

108
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,700
No, I'm saving their relationship!

109
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,260
Okay?

110
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,990
You know how Xingruo is.

111
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,620
She hates this kind of stuff.

112
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,300
Do you wish to see them

113
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,990
break up on the final episode?

114
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,350
No, I don't.

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,300
That's why.

116
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,940
I'll hold onto the evidence for now.

117
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,430
Let's take action now.

118
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,530
Xingruo.

119
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,380
Why are you here?

120
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,470
Are you going out?

121
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,300
I have a dinner date
with Lu Xingyan tonight.

122
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,110
What's up?

123
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,910
Come over here.

124
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,430
Sit down.

125
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,060
I have something very important

126
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,700
to inform you.

127
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,500
What's the urgency?

128
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:37,790
Let me ask you,

129
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,180
how's everything going
with you and Lu Xingyan lately?

130
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,910
We're doing fine.

131
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,790
Work is going well,

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,150
and our relationship is good too.

133
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,260
All in all, everything is fine.

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,230
Oh no.

135
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,230
Oh no.

136
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,790
That's exactly what Lu Xingyan
must be thinking too,

137
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,180
so he's ready to take the next step.

138
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,820
Next step?

139
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,350
Don't be scared when I tell you this,

140
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,380
but Lu Xingyan is going
to propose to you again.

141
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,380
No, I don't.

142
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,700
That's not such a things.

143
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,180
Why don't you admit it?

144
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,790
You even hide this from me.

145
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,500
I've seen the design plan.

146
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,740
What design plan?

147
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,590
Chen Zhu took it with her.

148
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,230
How could you be so careless

149
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,230
leaving the design in the living room?

150
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,940
I swear,

151
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,820
the design plan you mentioned is not mine.

152
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,690
You know

153
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,740
how hard I've worked
to get to this point.

154
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,430
How can I propose to
Shen Xingruo again at this point?

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,740
I'm not that dumb enough.

156
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,300
That doesn't sound very nice.

157
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,060
But, I get what you mean.

158
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,460
So, whose design plan is that?

159
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,300
Not mine, not yours.

160
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,100
Could it be He Siyue's?

161
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Could be.

162
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,150
Ever since he confessed to Shi Qin,

163
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,530
things have been going
smoothly for them.

164
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,400
But, the progress is just too fast,

165
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,580
that he already planned to tie the knot?

166
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,300
Well, let me be honest to you,

167
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,100
this design is mine.

168
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,750
Can't you recognize my handwriting?

169
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,340
Look closely.

170
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,100
It's been so long
since we handwritten something.

171
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,460
It's normal for me to not recognize it.

172
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,220
Why did you draw this?

173
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,510
I want to propose to Lu Xingyan.

174
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,150
Is this so gross?

175
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,510
Hey. Hold on.

176
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,820
Let me get you some water.

177
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,060
Drink some water.

178
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,940
No, no.

179
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,100
Don't get me wrong!

180
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,700
It's not that I think your
proposal idea is gross.

181
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,430
It's just that I have

182
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,550
an upset stomach after lunch.

183
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,910
You've been feeling off lately.

184
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,180
Maybe you should go to
the hospital for a check-up.

185
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,820
I'll go with you.

186
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,510
No need. It's probably
just a stomach issue.

187
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,750
Let me ask you,

188
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,550
weren't you the one
who was most against marriage before?

189
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,300
How come you've
suddenly changed your mind?

190
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,700
Well,

191
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,300
I wouldn't say it was sudden.

192
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,390
Actually,

193
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,980
I've been

194
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,150
secretly thinking about it
for a long time.

195
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,980
You know,

196
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,870
I used to be pretty afraid of marriage.

197
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,060
Partly because of my family,

198
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,340
and partly

199
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,100
because I wasn't sure

200
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,180
how much I truly loved Lu Xingyan.

201
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,550
I didn't know how long

202
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,460
our love could last.

203
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,630
But, you two have been
together for so long.

204
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,060
Are you still unsure about that?

205
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,180
Maybe

206
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,630
that's exactly

207
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,430
why we both

208
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,030
keep having conflicts.

209
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,220
But when came to the time
he got into a car accident,

210
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,870
I went to the hospital to stay with him.

211
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,510
I sat right beside him,

212
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,580
watching him lie there,

213
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,390
and in that moment,

214
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,300
I felt like my world was falling apart.

215
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,300
It was as if the most
important pillar in my life

216
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,460
was about to disappear.

217
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,630
I was terrified.

218
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,870
At that moment,

219
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,550
I thought to myself,

220
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,750
if only I were the one lying there
instead of him.

221
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,270
If only I could endure all the pain

222
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,100
instead of him.

223
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,910
During those two days in the hospital,

224
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,940
as I watched him,

225
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,820
all the sweet memories of us together

226
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,300
kept flashing through my mind,

227
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,940
one after another.

228
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,870
And,

229
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,910
I felt such deep regret all of a sudden.

230
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,270
It was then

231
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,510
that I realized
I didn't know myself at all.

232
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,550
I...

233
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,390
I really love Lu Xingyan.

234
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,150
I love him to my core.

235
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,100
So after that accident,

236
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,300
I became deeply grateful to the God

237
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,150
for giving me another chance

238
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,940
to have Lu Xingyan back in my life.

239
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,750
This time,

240
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,100
I don't want
to miss out on him anymore.

241
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,790
Lu Xingyan is such a fool,

242
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,100
that has already taken
99 steps toward me

243
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,180
for the sake of our love.

244
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,390
So, for this final step,

245
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,220
I'm going to take it myself.

246
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,430
What's wrong with you?

247
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,060
Why are you crying?

248
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,550
No, it's nothing.

249
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,340
Lately, I've just been

250
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,750
a little emotionally unstable.

251
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,460
But, I'm just so happy
for the two of you.

252
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,870
Alright.

253
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,790
But, Zhu,

254
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,460
I'm planning

255
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,910
to give him a surprise

256
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,980
during the final episode,

257
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,510
so you have to keep this a secret

258
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,510
and don't tell him.

259
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,060
Xingruo,

260
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,870
regarding this matter,

261
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,150
he probably already knows.

262
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,550
But even if we both know,
we have to pretend we don't, right?

263
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,910
Otherwise,

264
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,630
it'll ruin He Siyue's plan.

265
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,300
You're right.

266
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,820
So, what can I do now?

267
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,180
Shen Xingruo probably
already misunderstood me.

268
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,220
Just pretend you don't know
will be fine then.

269
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,630
Are you silly?

270
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,100
Chen Zhu has already gone
to talk to Shen Xingruo.

271
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,060
She definitely knows it by now,

272
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,790
and if I keep pretending,

273
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,390
it'll seem like I'm doing it.

274
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,510
What can we do then?

275
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,390
At dinner tonight,

276
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,940
I'll explain everything to her.

277
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
You two are creating drama for me.

278
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,510
True gold stands the test of fire.

279
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,180
Both of you will
definitely work things out.

280
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,870
Hang in there!

281
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,630
You've been acting weird today.

282
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,700
No, not at all.

283
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,910
I just heard

284
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,870
Chen Zhu went to meet you.

285
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,820
What did you two talk about?

286
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,180
Excuse me, have you both
decided what to order?

287
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,060
I'm hungry. Let's order first.

288
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,460
Sure, what would you like to have?

289
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,390
Do you have any recommendations?

290
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,820
We have a special dish
called Hundred Years of Harmony.

291
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,370
Hundred...

292
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,030
Hundred Years of Harmony?

293
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,180
What happens?

294
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,390
I just think that
the name of the dish

295
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,820
is weird.

296
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,430
It feels like
pushing people to get married.

297
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,460
I think that's a bad idea.

298
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,980
I just want us to

299
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,910
stay where we are.
Stay where we are, right?

300
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,150
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,130
I think my boyfriend's just
a little dizzy from hunger.

302
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,700
We'll have an egg sandwich,

303
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,870
a cheese pizza,

304
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,790
and the Hundred Years of Harmony
you mentioned.

305
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,440
These three dishes.

306
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,060
Alright, please wait a moment.

307
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,300
What were you trying to say just now?

308
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,300
I was thinking...

309
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,700
Hey, this song sounds familiar.

310
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,550
Isn't this the wedding march?

311
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,580
Wait a minute.

312
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,870
Please stop it.

313
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,430
Xingruo, don't get mad.

314
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,790
This has nothing to do with me at all.

315
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,500
We have nothing to do
with each other, right?

316
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,820
Nobody said I'm doing this for you, sir.

317
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,580
Please let me go.

318
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,300
He's heading to the other table.

319
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Why are you so nervous? Sit down.

320
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,670
I just worry that you'll misunderstand.

321
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,830
Do you know how long

322
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,930
I've been waiting for this moment?

323
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,910
Will you marry me?

324
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,180
I will.

325
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,500
They are proposing. How sweet they are!

326
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,310
What do you think?

327
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,740
I think...

328
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,150
- I think...
- Congratulations.

329
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,700
Every stage in life

330
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,110
has its own unique happiness.

331
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,310
I think

332
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,670
that marriage isn't all that good.

333
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,310
Sorry, what did you say?

334
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,390
I said marriage isn't that good.

335
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,310
Sorry.

336
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,390
What my boyfriend meant to say is

337
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,180
he can't think of anything

338
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,830
better than marriage.

339
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,460
So, congratulations to you both.

340
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,130
Wishing you everlasting happiness,
and a harmonious reunion.

341
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,310
A harmonious reunion.

342
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,980
Thank you.

343
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,910
What's wrong with you?

344
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,980
Congratulations on your wedding!

345
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,700
Who is it?

346
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:22,780
It's me,

347
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,740
Lu Xingyan.

348
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,390
I'm coming.

349
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,800
Hi.

350
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,240
Hi.

351
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm here to confess.

352
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,350
I know I acted weird tonight,

353
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,910
but that's because before dinner,
Xu Chengzhou found me,

354
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,540
and said that he found

355
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,350
a proposal venue design with Chen Zhu,

356
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,830
I know I have a history,

357
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,310
but this time, it wasn't me.

358
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,540
I know it wasn't you.

359
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,590
How do you know?

360
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,430
Because when it comes to this,

361
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,870
you've tried repeatedly,

362
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,180
and I've rejected you repeatedly.

363
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,460
I think by now you've become
an expert for that.

364
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,830
Yes, that's true.

365
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,350
That's why I'm here to say

366
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,430
I won't make the same mistake again.

367
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,110
Everything I said before,

368
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,350
and all the consensus we reached,

369
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,390
I remember them all.

370
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,670
Where our relationships go from here

371
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,700
is completely up to you.

372
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,460
So,

373
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,700
I want to give this to you.

374
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,910
This?

375
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,590
Don't open it.

376
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,870
I'm afraid it'll make things awkward.

377
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,430
It is my 'crime tool'.

378
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,450
I'm handing it over to you now,

379
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,460
hoping it'll put you at ease.

380
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,740
I'll head back now.

381
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,310
You rest early.

382
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,410
Alright.

383
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,310
What a great news! You're pregnant!

384
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,980
Honey, you're amazing!

385
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,150
I'm going to be a dad soon.

386
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,310
What's wrong?

387
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,740
This is supposed to be good news,

388
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,940
why aren't you happy at all?

389
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,740
I just feel...

390
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,150
How did I end up pregnant?

391
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,150
If we calculate the time,

392
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,500
it must have been that night...

393
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,980
That's not what I mean.

394
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,980
I...

395
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,630
I just wasn't ready for a pregnancy.

396
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,700
I don't even know how to be a good mom.

397
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,630
Don't worry. I'll be with you always.

398
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,390
What's the point of you accompanying me?

399
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,980
If I'm pregnant,

400
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,110
I'll become fat,

401
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,780
and won't be able
to wear all my pretty dresses anymore.

402
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,110
Pregnancy also

403
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,390
messes with the hormones.

404
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,150
What if my skin gets bad?

405
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,830
They say childbirth is very painful.

406
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,980
What if I can't handle it?

407
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,700
And, we didn't even plan
for this pregnancy properly.

408
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,110
What if the baby isn't healthy?

409
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,630
We can deal with all of that.

410
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,910
We'll schedule

411
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,980
a full medical checkup for you.

412
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,110
The baby will definitely be healthy.

413
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,940
Even if the baby is healthy,

414
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,940
will I be a good mom?

415
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,830
You absolutely will.

416
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,870
Really?

417
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,780
But I have no idea

418
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,220
how to raise a child.

419
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,220
I'm such a short-tempered person.

420
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,940
What if the child ends up hating me?

421
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,590
What if they don't listen to me?

422
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,540
What if one day we both
struggle with our jobs,

423
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,980
and can't provide a good life,

424
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,390
letting the child
doesn't have what others have,

425
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,310
what should we do?

426
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,540
You don't need to put so much...

427
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,310
I can't help it, but getting anxious

428
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,740
while thinking about all these things.

429
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,020
What am I supposed to do?

430
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,390
I think you...

431
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,740
I think I need to take some time
to think this over.

432
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,740
Zhu, you're pregnant.

433
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,220
Please don't get too upset.

434
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,740
It'll be fine.

435
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,260
Let's just wait for Lu Xingyan
and the other to get here.

436
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,220
So, we can ask them.

437
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,020
Don't be mad.

438
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,500
What happens?

439
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,390
Xu Chengzhou has gone missing.

440
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,180
He's been gone since noon,

441
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,130
and the production team has tried
calling him, but he's not picking up.

442
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,780
Have you guys seen him today?

443
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,590
No, I haven't.

444
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,910
Me neither.

445
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,740
How could he just disappear like that?

446
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,350
It's probably because of me.

447
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,830
Ever since I got pregnant,

448
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,260
my emotions have been unstable.

449
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,460
I said some things this morning

450
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,630
that put a lot of pressure on him.

451
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,260
Think carefully,

452
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,390
where do you think
Xu Chengzhou might have gone?

453
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,180
He usually only has three occasions,

454
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,870
Chen Zhu, Sun Inn, and playing games.

455
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,180
So, where could he be?

456
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,430
I guess he must have gotten scared

457
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,870
and is hiding somewhere for now.

458
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,670
He's like a child sometimes.

459
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,020
I think what I said really
scared him this time,

460
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,540
so he probably feels like

461
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,740
this is all a mistake.

462
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,070
You shouldn't be too upset.

463
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,590
Let's split up and look for him.

464
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,700
We might find him soon.

465
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,110
Even if we find him, what then?

466
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,180
He's already given his answer

467
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,220
through his actions.

468
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,740
So, what are you planning to do now?

469
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,070
Xingruo,

470
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,310
I want to film tomorrow's episode alone,

471
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,940
at the hospital.

472
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,350
Wait, what do you mean?

473
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,940
I think it's better to make
a decision sooner rather than later.

474
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,070
Let's just give our relationship

475
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,740
a conclusion.

476
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,110
Are you sure?

477
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,940
Maybe think about it some more?

478
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,830
Xingruo, don't persuade me anymore.

479
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,350
I've already made up my mind.

480
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,120
Please contact the
production team for me.

481

they haven't talked
to each other at all.

511
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,310
Should we give them some kind of hint?

512
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,670
It's the final episode.

513
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,220

is basically set.

00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,670
Let's just show
their natural state will do.

515
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,480
Alright.

516
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,830

The sun is too bright.
I can't open my eyes.

520
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,390
Let me come closer to you. Like this.

521
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,980
I feel better now.

522
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,230
It's fine. I'll just move
a little closer to you.

523
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:25,910
How sweet they are!

524
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,180
For the final mission,

525
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,540
why did you choose to cook together?

526
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,350
I told him before

527
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,830
that I wanted him to try my cooking,

528
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,430
but we never had the chance.

529
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,590
Today, we finally had time,

530
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,870
so I'm keeping my promise.

531
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,870
Besides, I have to say,

532
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
He Siyue is quite talented at cooking.

533
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,600
Really?

534
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,780
Let me cook for you in the future.

535
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,940
Sure, you can give it a try.

536
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,150
Cooking is solved.

537
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,110
But, who will handle buying groceries?

538
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,940
We've always felt that

539
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,220
bargaining, picking ingredients,

540
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,940
and dealing with shopkeepers

541
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,500
make us very nervous.

542
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,940
So, as for today's dishes,

543
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,350
we ordered it online.

544
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,070
In the first episode,
you two didn't talk much.

545
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,310
And, now in the final episode,
you're still not talking much.

546
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,670
Why is that?

547
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,740
In the first episode,
it was because we were nervous,

548
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,540
and we didn't know what to say.

549
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,220
But, now it's different.

550
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,980
Now, it's because
we know each other so well

551
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,260
that we don't need
to force conversation.

552
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,630
Exactly.

553
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,700
I read a book before,

554
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,910
and it mentioned that

555
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,310
when you truly like someone,

556
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,430
she becomes essential in your life.

557
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,590
And, you'll love

558
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,430
having them by your side all the time.

559
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,910
Alright, here's a last question for you.

560
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,070
Will you two continue
your relationship journey?

561
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:04,940
Of course.

562
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,310
Of course.

563
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,220
Even though

564
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,110
I'm not a romance novelist,

565
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,310
I...

566
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,500
I've already imagined

567
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,150
the story of our future life
together in my mind.

568
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,670
Why are you back?

569
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,020
What kind of question is that?

570
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,870
Isn't today the filming
for the final episode?

571
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,130
If I didn't come back, where would I go?

572
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,980
Where did you go yesterday?

573
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,230
Everyone was looking for you,
but couldn't find you.

574
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,590
Chen Zhu is pregnant.

575
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,310
She's feeling scared,

576
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,590
worried that she won't
be able to handle it.

577
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,260
So, I signed up for
a "dad-to-be" training class.

578
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,560
Yesterday was the first session.

579
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,460
Bro,

580
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,630
why didn't you answer your phone
if you were in class?

581
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,780
The first lesson

582
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,180
was about understanding and empathizing

583
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,150
with the pain of childbirth.

584
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,870
At that time, I was...

585
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,670
This pain simulation device is
on a scale from one to ten,

586
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,110
with level ten being equivalent
to the pain of childbirth.

587
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,500
I'll let you experience it
level by level.

588
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,870
Miss, I'm strong.

589
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,350
Can I go straight to level ten?

590
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,770
Sure.

591
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,700
Then, I passed out from the pain.

592
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,590
When I woke up,
my phone was running out of battery.

593
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,700
At least you could've told Chen Zhu.

594
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,500
I was trying to prepare
a surprise for her.

595
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,600
Anyway, let's stop it here.
I'm heading there now.

596
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,910
They're not here for now.

597
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,940
The team moved to a
different location for filming.

598
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,780
Where did they go?

599
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,780
The maternity hospital.

600
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,970
Does she go
for a prenatal checkup on her own?

601
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
I don't know about this.

602
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,780
All I know is everyone thinks

603
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,600
you went missing because
you didn't want to take responsibility.

604
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,940
So, Chen Zhu is in a very upset mood.

605
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,910
We're all worried she
might do something reckless.

606
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,490
What?

607
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,170
(Star City People's Hospital,
Outpatient)

608
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,300
Excuse me, nurse.

609
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,540
(Obstetrics and Gynecology)
Where is the ultrasound department located?

610
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,430
Just walk straight ahead to the end.

611
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,590
What makes you show up?

612
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,130
Alright, thank you.

613
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,150
Am I already too late?

614
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,070
Yes, you're late.

615
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
It's all over.

616
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,460
I thought you didn't want to be a dad.

617
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,780
I never didn't want to be a dad.

618
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,740
I signed up for
a 'dad-to-be' training camp,

619
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,150
trying to prepare a surprise for you.

620
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,730
I didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

621
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,310
That's fine.

622
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,070
I often

623
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,220
mess things up too.

624
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,700
Do you think

625
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,870
we aren't cut out to be good parents?

626
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,740
We can be.

627
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,740
There are no perfect parents
in the world.

628
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,110
Every thing will be fruitful
after we figure out it step by step.

629
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,390
And, you're so cheerful
and kind-hearted.

630
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,540
That's why everyone likes you

631
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,220
and wants to be around you.

632
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm sure our future child

633
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,220
will feel the same way.

634
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,310
I know I'm not doing well enough now,

635
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,940
but I can try harder to be better.

636
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,530
Although I don't have a plan
for the future yet,

637
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,500
I'll start working
towards it step by step,

638
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,910
and make sure you
and our child lives the best life.

639
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,430
But, now it's too late to say anything.

640
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,030
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

641
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,940
No, it's not too late.

642
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,910
What's wrong?

643
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,670
Why are you crying?

644
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,210
I'll stop crying now.

645
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,700
Since we'll have more in the future.

646
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,460
In the future?

647
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,260
You should figure out this one first

648
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,350
before thinking about the next.

649
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,780
Wait, you're confusing me.

650
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,390
You're not...

651
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,370
(Outpatient Abortion Room)

652
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,830
No way!

653
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,110
I'm here for a prenatal checkup.

654
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,740
Do you think I'm that irresponsible?

655
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,830
Of course not.

656
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,910
Thank goodness!

657
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,310
You scared me.

658
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,260
I thought you were gone, buddy.

659
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,350
It shows we're meant to be.

660
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,310
I swear, I will never leave you.

661
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,540
A lifetime is long,

662
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,500
let's get along well.

663
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,740
Get up now.

664
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,220
Don't act so crazy.
There are so many people around.

665
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,260
But, you like me when I'm crazy,
don't you?

666
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,670
In a lifetime,

667
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,430
having someone
to be crazy with isn't easy.

668
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,150
I hope the baby in your belly

669
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,220
will be a little wild too.

670
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,010
So, we can all be crazy
together as a family.

671
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,460
He's coming.

672
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,780
Isn't this the place
where He Siyue wanted to propose?

673
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,150
Of course not.

674
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,910
The main character today is you.

675
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,500
Me?

676
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,630
No way, don't scare me.

677
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,110
Xingruo will be mad at me.

678
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,070
Xingruo has been waiting for you
there for a long time.

679
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,410
Look.

680
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,790
Are you surprised?

681
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,940
I...

682
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,020
I'm surprised.

683
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,830
I'm surprised.

684
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,940
I used to be the one
preparing surprises,

685
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,270
so...

686
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,790
I'm stunned and

687
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,620
speechless now.

688
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,430
That's okay.

689
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,020
This time,

690
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,060
I'll be the one to speak.

691
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,390
In the past,

692
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,020
I always told myself,

693
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,140
once I make a decision,

694
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,430
I shouldn't regret it.

695
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,630
I shouldn't look back at it.

696
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,390
So,

697
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,100
in the five years
after I turned down your proposal,

698
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,060
whenever I missed you,

699
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,750
I would tell myself,

700
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,580
there are no two people in this world

701
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,060
who will love each other for a lifetime.

702
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,060
Like my parents,

703
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,100
like many people I've encountered.

704
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,350
I've witnessed their passionate love,

705
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,460
and I've also seen them
part in mutual resentment.

706
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,460
All affection

707
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,790
can't withstand
the wear and tear of time.

708
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,020
So I thought I was the same.

709
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,540
But, after meeting you again,

710
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,350
you warmed me, embraced me.

711
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,790
You hold my hand.

712
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,500
Your love showed me

713
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,310
that I

714
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,790
could be the exception.

715
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,460
Thank you for loving me continuously,

716
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,140
giving me the courage to admit

717
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,580
that in those five years we are apart,

718
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,060
I regretted it every single day.

719
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm sorry

720
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,580
I made you wait for me
for five whole years.

721
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,190
That duration was way too long.

722
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,100
So long that now,

723
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,710
I can't bear to make you
wait one more minute.

724
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,020
This ring

725
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,790
is the one you gave me

726
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,830
when you proposed to me back then.

727
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,140
It accompanied us along the way.

728
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,310
So for this proposal today,

729
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,460
I want it to witness
this moment with me.

730
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,620
That night, when you came to find me

731
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,350
and return this to me,

732
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,830
I believed

733
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,660
that all of this

734
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,270
was destined.

735
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,190
As for your ring,

736
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,100
I had it specially made.

737
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,060
The two rings can be a perfect pair.

738
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,910
I hope

739
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,270
they can witness

740
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,310
our long-lasting love.

741
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,310
So,

742
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,390

Our show

807
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,980
officially finishes filming today.

808
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,980
Everyone has worked hard
during this time.

809
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,540
Why are you sighing?

810
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,470
What's wrong?

811
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,790
The last episode

812
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,190
was too emotional.

813
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,940
It made me forget to mention
the commercial plug for my resort.

814
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,540
Don't worry about that.

815
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,020
I'll talk to the scenarist,

816
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,540
and we'll get you
a special intro recorded

817
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,100
to promote the resort properly.

818
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:03,930
Really?

819
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,530
Of course.

820
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,430
That's great.

821
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,410
I told you that
this six million was well spent.

822
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,060
You two have finally settled everything.

823
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,390
So, He Siyue,

824
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,190
when are you planning
to hold a wedding with Qin?

825
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,460
We've already decided

826
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,390
not to have a ceremony.

827
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,660
Why not?

828
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,140
Because holding a ceremony

829
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,060
means we have to meet a lot of

830
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,310
guests and relatives.

831
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,270
And, we have to pretend
to be so close to them.

832
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,430
Just thinking about that
makes me anxious.

833
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,060
So, we both agreed

834
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,910
to skip it.

835
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,190
Regarding the ceremony,

836
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,500
I had one before, and honestly,
it wasn't that meaningful.

837
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,230
Now, I just feel that

838
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,830
being happy with the one you love
is the most important thing, right?

839
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,540
As for me,

840
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,140
I still want to have a wedding.

841
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,910
Because having a wedding

842
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,790
has been Lu Xingyan's dream
since he was little.

843
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,660
I want to fulfill that dream for him.

844
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,350
Honestly,

845
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,430
I didn't care that much
about having a wedding.

846
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,270
You can't do that.

847
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,870
Your wedding

848
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,750
is a massive business opportunity.

849
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,230
There's already
so much buzz online about it.

850
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,580
I was planning

851
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,870
to announce your marriage

852
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,060
as soon as the last episode airs.

853
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,130
So, we can have fans buy tickets
to watch the wedding.

854
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,500
Let's talk about this later.

855
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,350
We've finally finished the show.

856
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,540
We need some time to rest,

857
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,100
And,

858
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,790
we're all entering a new stage in life.

859
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:27,870
I think

860
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,310
we need a more special way

861
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,750
to celebrate it.

862
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,660
For instance?

863
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,100
Your idea is brilliant.

864
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,230
The scenery here is so beautiful.

865
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,130
You're right.

866
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,910
After being in the city for so long,

867
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,790
it feels nice

868
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,230
to take a trip once in a while.

869
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,230
But, this isn't just a short trip.

870
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,790
We're going to take a full tour
around the northwest loop.

871
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,350
Sunsets, deserts, the Gobi desert.

872
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,850
Just thinking about it
feels so romantic.

873
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,270
But, how did you come up with this idea?

874
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,910
I know you don't like boring ceremonies,

875
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,430
or dealing with tedious guests,

876
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,350
and you don't like being put on stage

877
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,580
like an actress,

878
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,410
giving them some so-called
surprise or emotional moment.

879
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,830
So, I thought,

880
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,190
just driving with you,

881
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,940
going somewhere
that's just the two of us,

882
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,140
that's enough.

883
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,010
Thank you for being
so considerate of me.

884
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,540
This is just the beginning.

885
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,620
I'm going to be considerate
of you for a lifetime.

886
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,790
Could you two stop being so lovey-dovey?

887
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,230
Let's pack up and head to the next stop.

888
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,510
Alright.

00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,350

is pretty great.

899
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,580
So I asked He Ming
to create a proposal for me.

900
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,500
The theme is escaping
the noise of the city,

901
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,020
and finding new meaning in life

902
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,540

903
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,190
