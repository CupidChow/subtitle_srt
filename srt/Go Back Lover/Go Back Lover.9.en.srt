(The 50th Anniversary
of Mingli High School)

5
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,190
Who?

6
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,670
Who threw that?

7
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,110
How can you be so rude?

8
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,060
Stop there!

9
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,790
Lu Xingyan, don't hit him!

10
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,750
Stop it! Stop hitting him!

11
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,020
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

12
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,270
Calm down.

13
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,010
Stop it!

(2024)

16
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,860
You're done with the meeting?

17
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,140
What are you doing here?

18
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,830
Want a drink?

19
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,140
Okay.

20
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,030
Thank you.

21
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,220
Go ahead.

22
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,060
You didn't come to see me this late

23
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,140
just to have a drink, did you?

24
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,710
If there's anything else
you want to say,

25
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,200
just say it.

26
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,770
I'd like

27
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,390
to talk to you about Yu Si.

28
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,900
I know what you're trying to say.

29
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,550
He's a harsh talker,

30
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,920
that's what he is.

31
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,860
I can't do anything about it.

32
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,180
It doesn't really matter what he says.

33
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,430
I know he doesn't like me,

34
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,790
and I don't expect him

35
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,990
to be nice to me.

36
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,620
And that's not what

37
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm trying to say.

38
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
What are you trying to say, then?

39
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,020
You remember

40
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,150
we're partners, right?

41
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,030
Yes, I do.

42
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,470
When you asked me
to join the show earlier,

43
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,820
you said you valued the buzz
of Double-Star Team.

44
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,500
I also want to take this opportunity
to promote my inn.

45
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
This is the basis of our cooperation.

46
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,030
Since we want to take the benefits
from the buzz,

47
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,500
we need to behave ourselves.

48
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,500
I just don't think

49
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,990
it's a good idea for you
to meet him in private.

50
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,300
Yu Si and I

51
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,350
are just friends.

52
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,700
I know. I believe you.

53
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,940
Anyway, I don't know
if the audience will believe it.

54
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,700
If you see each other all the time,

55
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,940
and people see you,
and you're photographed,

56
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,790
How are we going to explain it

57
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,550
when the show is broadcast?

58
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,590
We're just having
a normal social interaction,

59
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,670
we don't have any intimate behaviour.

60
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,380
Even if we were photographed,

61
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,700
I don't think it would matter.

62
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,260
That's just what you think.

63
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,060
You don't know what he thinks.

64
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,260
I think

65
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,110
he's approaching you
with an ulterior motive.

66
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,300
I've known Yu Si for years.

67
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,300
We've never even

68
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,590
had an idea like this for each other.

69
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,820
Lu Xingyan, the point is not

70
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,380
whether I want to see Yu Si or not,

71
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,230
it's that I want you to know

72
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,550
that no matter what kind of relationship

73
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,700
we have,

74
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,470
I've never been a possession of yours.

75
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,590
Please don't think
about controlling my life.

76
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,990
If he's spoken out of turn to you today,

77
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,350
I'm here to apologize on his behalf.

78
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,150
You apologize for him?

79
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,990
Fine, I understand now.

80
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,350
I'm glad to hear the answer from you.

81
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,630
Get some rest.

82
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,950

88
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,790
(based on how the guests performed
in the previous round.)

89
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,150
(What exactly are their dates about?)

90
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,550
(Let's check it out.)

91
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,510
(Please limit yourself)

92
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,070
(to no more than ten sentences in total)

93
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,550
(on this date.)

94
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,180
(You decide what you want
to do on your date.)

95
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,190
No.

96
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,990
Why do you control how much I talk?

97
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,820
Are you guys picking on me?

98
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,300
You don't want me
to promote Sun Inn, do you?

99
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,470
If you guys keep this up,
I'll go to Producer Shen.

100
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,820
Why do they control how much you talk?

101
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,940
Reflect on yourself.

102
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,260
Because you're too noisy.

103
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,990
Mr. K, what do you demand of me?

104
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,030
The same demand for both of you.

105
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,670
Same?

106
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,380
I can't talk
for more than ten sentences, too?

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,860
Why?

108
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,260
Aren't you making this rule

109
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,590
against me?

110
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,860
If you keep this up, I'll go to Xingruo.

111
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,700
Because you're too noisy.

112
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,500
Why don't you reflect on yourself?

113
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,670
You're implicating me.

114
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,260
What do I have to reflect on?

115
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,550
(Please increase
the number of sentences)

116
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,030
(you speak on this date)

117
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,940
(to a total of no less than 100.)

118
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,670
(You decide what you want
to do on your date.)

119
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,150
So are we going to say

120
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,620
a hundred sentences on this date?

121
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,940
I think we can do it.

122
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,430
I'll try my best.

123
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,870
By the way,
will those sentences we just said

124
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,670
count?

125
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,220
(Make a dinner together
in the main villa)

126
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,870
(and open up)

127
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,180
(about the one thing)

128
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,750
(you can't stand about each other.)

129
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,220
Didn't we do

130
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,750
a barbecue together last time?

131
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,510
Why are we cooking together this time?

132
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,060
Last time the director saw the material

133
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,630
and thought you two were very sweet.

134
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,430
Nowadays, the audience loves
to watch these things,

135
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,460
so it's good
to have more materials like that.

136
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,940
Are we going to the suburbs this time?

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,830
No.

138
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,430
The setting is in the main villa.

139
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,270
Ms. Xing instructed us

140
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,700
to decorate the area
around the island properly.

141
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,630
We're just trying
to make the best use of it.

142
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,550
Ore the money will be wasted.

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,700
Do you two have a problem with that?

144
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,390
I don't have a problem.

145
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,430
Just see if Mr. Lu has a problem.

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,340
After all, Mr. Lu's demands

147
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,790
are always so many.

148
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,030
I don't have a problem, too.

149
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,780
Anyway,

150
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,750
sometimes, it's useless to make demands.

151
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,750
The other party isn't going
to cooperate anyway.

152
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,030
Well,

153
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,870
are you guys okay with it or not?

154
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,510
Proceed as planned.

155
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,770
(Gracie China)

156
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,150
Sorry, I'm late.

157
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,150
Let's start now.

158
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,790
Let's start.

159
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,820
Why are you looking at me like that?

160
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,870
What's wrong?

161
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,940
You're upset again?

162
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,940
You left the house at nine this morning

163
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,300
and arrived later than me.

164
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,630
What have you been up to?

165
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,180
What, it's already started?

166
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,110
We weren't informed of this.

167
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,480
Let's start again.

168
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,390
One more time, okay?

169
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,020
What are you laughing at?

170
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,300
Is it funny?

171
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,030
I dare you to laugh again.

172
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,060
What's wrong? Are you upset again?

173
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,750
I didn't mean to laugh.

174
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,580
It's for the show, isn't it?

175
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,340
How can I do it if you're gone?

176
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,750
Say something.

177
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,430
Well, now he's used up
his ten-sentence quota, too.

178
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,140
You tricked me?

179
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,220
Sorry, guys.

180
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,820
You two are going to be taped up
for the rest of the show.

181
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,820
No, Mr. K.

182
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,150
It's no fun.

183
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,580
And audience certainly
doesn't like pantomimes.

184
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,670
Yes, I...

185
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,390
I haven't mentioned a word
about Sun Inn.

186
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,580
I... I'll play by the rules.

187
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,390
Give me another chance.

188
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,850
Let's start over.

189
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,670
Okay, let's do it again.

190
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,060
Last chance.

191
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,150
Sun Inn provides you

192
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,510
with the most considerate services.

193
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,390
The person you just met with

194
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,910
was a woman, right?

195
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,980
How did you know?

196
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,390
Who is she?

197
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,700
I promised her I wouldn't tell you.

198
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,580
Promise?

199
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,180
You two even made a promise?

200
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,220
Shameless.

201
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,220
No. Does ha-ha count?

202
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,700
Does my off-camera question count, too?

203
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,300
Say, do you see each other often?

204
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,870
She only shows up
when I'm having trouble

205
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,940
in a relationship, in a crisis.

206
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,820
Is she pretty?

207
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,550
Very pretty.

208
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,510
How dare you call her pretty?

209
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,510
You'd think she was very pretty, too.

210
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,820
Chen Zhu.

211
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,910
This is a judo hall, not a pet shop.

212
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,390
How dare you call me a dog?

213
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,750
You're dead, Xu Chengzhou!

214
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,510
One last word from each of you.

215
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,910
Xu Chengzhou,

216
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,300
who the hell is that woman?

217
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,870
I really can't tell you.

218
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,390
You... Don't cry.

219
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,550
All right, I'll tell you.

220
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,630
That's your mom.

221
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,980
She asked me out
because she was concerned

222
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,750
about our relationship

223
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,820
and didn't want me to tell you because
she didn't want you to feel pressured.

224
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,980
They're quite sweet when they're quiet.

225
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,910
If only the world

226
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,340
were always this quiet.

227
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,060
Wifey.

228
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,460
We're divorced.

229
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,550
Ex-wife.

230
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,060
Xu Chengzhou,

231
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,670
do you have a death wish?

232
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,230
Come here!

233
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,030
How could I have a death wish?

234
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,220
You told me to say it and you...

235
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,910
Come back here!

236
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,150
No. I'll get beaten up.

237
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,460
Do you think I need
to put the tape back on?

238
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,750
Forget it. I think
it's just for decoration.

239
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,270
That's true.

240
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,910
No one in the world
can stop them from fighting.

241
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,980
Let's edit it in post-production.

242
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,030
(Topics to talk about during dating)
Weather and seasonal changes.

243
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,790
Did you write in your memo the other day

244
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,450
(Are the topics in the memo prepared?)
about topics you prepared in advance?

245
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,410
Yes.

246
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,170
Because we're both

247
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,650
quiet people,

248
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,330
we don't know what to say
when we're together.

249
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,210
And on that day, we were tasked

250
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,370
with saying a hundred sentences
to each other.

251
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,810
It was too much for both of us.

252
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,010
I just hoped

253
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,210
that we could start a smooth dialogue

254
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,490
with the topics I had written down.

255
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
Weather and seasonal changes.

256
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,990
Mr. He, I'll put the mike on for you.

257
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,660
Thank you.

258
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,540
Shi Qin.

259
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,460
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,580
Something's come up at the publisher.
I'm a bit delayed.

261
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,820
You must have waited long.

262
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,910
No, I just got here.

263
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,239
Sit down.

264
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,870
Let's start now.

265
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,870
It's a pretty

266
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,980
- good day.
- Foggy day.

267
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,750
I... I saw the weather forecast saying

268
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,710
it's good.

269
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,150
Is... Is that so?

270
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,380
Actually,

271
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,470
there's a film festival in Xingcheng

272
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,580
that's quite a buzz lately.

273
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,220
Roman Holiday has been re-released.

274
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,580
I wonder if you've watched it.

275
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,780
I've heard people say that,

276
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,540
but I haven't had a chance
to watch it yet.

277
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,830
All right.

278
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,740
Actually,

279
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,070
there's something I want
to ask you today.

280
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,540
Okay.

281
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,070
Go ahead.

282
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,430
Here's the thing. I have a friend

283
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,980
who recently had a lawsuit

284
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,020
about intellectual property rights.

285
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,460
He knows you're a lawyer,

286
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
so he asked me

287
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,500
to get your advice.

288
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,870
No problem.

289
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,460
Here, have a look.

290
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,260
Let me read it.

291
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,570
Did you really want to consult her?

292
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,010
No.

293
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,810
My friend has enlisted

294
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,130
a team of solicitors
specializing in this.

295
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,890
I think

296
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,770
everyone has their own comfort zone.

297
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,410
It's hard to break the ice

298
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,890
by putting me and Shi Qin together

299
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,890
who don't like to communicate

300
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,570
So I wanted to relax Shi Qin

301
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,330
in this way.

302
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,730
(Civil appeal)

303
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,110
I just read it through.

304
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,980
First of all,

305
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,870
he registered his account

306
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,020
without permission,

307
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,910
which is definitely
a copyright infringement.

308
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Did he talk to your friend in advance?

309
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,110
No.

310
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,110
In that case,

311
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,590
I think your friend

312
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,980
can increase the amount
of compensation he's claiming.

313
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,260
And look at this.

314
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,460
It is to demand
that the defendant immediately stop

315
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,780
using the smurf account
for live streaming.

316
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,220
I think your friend

317
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,110
can implement this as soon as possible.

318
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,670
Okay.

319
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,940
Because it's

320
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,150
your legal right

321
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,940
and he opened the smurf account

322
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,910
himself.

323
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,870
It's a definite

324
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,910
- This one?
- violation.

325
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,310
- Yes, correct.
- This one?

326
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,150
Yes, this it is.

327
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,390
And the following one, too.

328
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,220
The amount of compensation

329
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,630
is the point I just mentioned.

330
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,630
Thank you so much

331
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,870
for your professional advice today.

332
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,940
I'd like to thank you, too.

333
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,540
If it wasn't for you,

334
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,150
I don't know how we'd get this done.

335
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,110
All right, cut.

336
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,310
That's it for today's filming.

337
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,220
Let me take your mike off.

338
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,660
Okay.

339
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,230
I'll take the mike off.

340
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,870
Here.

341
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,540
Okay.

342
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm going to go back
and sort out some material.

343
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,590
I'll see you later.

344
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,940
- All right. Thanks for you hard work.
- All right.

345
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,350
Thank you.

346
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,980
- Bye.
- Bye.

347
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

348
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,239
Let's go.

349
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,110
Well, I'll get going now.

350
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,430
Do you think Roman Holiday is good?

351
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,940
Actually, I haven't watched it either.

352
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,430
I wanted to buy a ticket
for the film festival a while ago.

353
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,870
Too many people were fighting
for tickets, so I didn't get one.

354
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,350
Here's the thing.

355
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,980
I sent a message to my friend

356
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,310
when we were on a date.

357
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,940
He knew

358
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,780
someone who worked at the festival,

359
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,700
so I asked him for two tickets.

360
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,310
If you want,

361
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,110
we can watch it together

362
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:05,540
as a celebration
of a mission well accomplished today.

363
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,430
Okay.

364
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,540
This is the first stop
on her cordial visit

365
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,390
to European capitals.

366
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
She gets a royal welcome
from the British.

367
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,630
The crowd cheers the young member

368
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,700
of one of Europe's
oldest ruling families.

369
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,070
After three days of activities
and a visit to Buckingham Palace,

370
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,870
Princess Anne flies to Amsterdam

371
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,500
to inaugurate the opening
of the International Aid Building

372
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,110
and the launching
of an ocean liner

373
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,070
Then, she went to Paris
to attend a number of official events

374
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,980
to strengthen trade partnerships

375
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,740
between her home country
and the countries of Western Europe.

I'll work with you later.

390
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Jun, how's it?

391
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,390
It's done.

392
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,460
Go and do your work over there.

393
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,670
I have something to say to Mr. Lu.

394
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,390
Okay.

395
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,740
I hope we can

396
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,020
work well together when we cook later.

397
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,590
Are you here to make up with me?

398
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,780
Of course not.

399
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,020
What are you trying to say?

400
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,540
I'd like to say

401
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,110
I hope we don't bring
our personal emotions

402
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,260
to work.

403
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,830
Producer Shen, you're being paranoid.

404
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,870
As an investor in the show,

405
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,830
I definitely want the outcome
to be good.

406
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,180
I won't ruin the filming.

407
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
All right, that's good.

408
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,870
Xing, we're ready.

409
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,630
Let's start now.

410
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,670
Okay. Let's start.

411
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,150
Let's go. Get in position.

412
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,940
Can you pass me that ginger?

413
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,540
Of course.

414
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,590
What about the washed one?

415
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,020
No problem.

416
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,180
That's pretty clean.

417
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,780
Thank you for your hard work.

418
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,390
You're welcome.
It's what I'm supposed to do.

419
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,780
What's going on with these two today?

420
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,780
They're acting like robots.

421
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,350
I have no idea.

422
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,910
Maybe they're having a little crisis
in their relationship.

423
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,500
What to do?

424
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,690
(Be natural.)

425
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,220
The choreographer's cue
is for us to speak naturally.

426
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,540
Can you speak normally?

427
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,070
Don't sound too formal.

428
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,830
I'm not speaking normally?

429
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,110
Do you speak naturally?

430
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,540
Besides,

431
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,350
that's just the way I am.

432
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,390
I want to make my own decisions
about my life.

433
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,780
What? Didn't you teach me that?

434
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,980
You're right, Mr. Lu.

435
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,110
You can do whatever you want.

436
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,460
Who are we

437
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,830
to meddle in other people's lives?

438
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,220
Let's just have fun.

439
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,110
Am I right?

440
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,020
Yes, of course.

441
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,110
I think this kind of peace and quiet

442
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,870
really suits us.

443
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,430
Yes, it does.

444
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,180
Can I start cooking fish, please?

445
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,390
Go ahead.

446
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,220
Can you get me the rice vinegar?

447
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,350
Won't the pan catch fire

448
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,740
if it's this hot?

449
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,780
It won't.

450
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,940
That's what my helper did.

451
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,980
- Are you all right?

457
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,020
This subconscious concern for each other

458
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,110
is what's really sweet.

459
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,180
"Are you all right?"

460
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,020
They're not three years old.

461
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,540
That's exaggerated.

462
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,780
That was a mistake.

463
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,430
You should have taken my advice.

464
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,310
Maybe we

465
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,390
just can't convince each other.

466
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,020
Yes.

467
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,460
We probably

468
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,740
don't really get along that well.

469
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,220
Producer Shen, try it.

470
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,110
Okay.

471
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,700
Mr. Lu, have some, too.

472
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,910
Why are these two
acting like robots again?

473
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,670
Let's get to the main mission.

474
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,630
Two planning directors on set,

475
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,670
seize the moment and cue them.

476
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,870
Let me write it.

477
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,730
(Open up and talk
about each other's shortcomings)

478
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,430
Shortcomings?

479
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,590
I don't think there's anything wrong

480
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,740
with Producer Shen.

481
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,740
She's perfect inside and out.

482
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,020
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

483
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,700
I think you are, too.

484
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,430
You're a perfect person

485
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,350
and you're very understanding.

486
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,260
What to do? I can't
answer that question.

487
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,570
(You must say it)

488
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,540
If I must say it,

489
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,180
let me think about it.

490
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,430
In fact, Mr. Lu always
has a small problem

491
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,460
that is

492
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,070
a bit arrogant,

493
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,220
especially like to let others

494
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,980
live according to his ideas.

495
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,430
Start the second camera.

496
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
If I must say,

497
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
I've got one here too.

498
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,870
Producer Shen is good at everything,

499
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,070
but she needs to improve her judgment
in making friends.

500
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,700
If you can stay away
from some bad friends,

501
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,590
I think your life will be better.

502
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,430
The friend you're talking about

503
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,830
isn't here today.

504
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,910
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to talk about him

505
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,180
behind his back.

506
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,070
Is it not a good idea?

507
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,780
I don't think so.

508
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,590
That's what the audience wants to see.

509
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,070
Director Jun, what do you think?

510
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,350
I think it's good.

511
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,940
There's a good feeling
between the two of them.

512
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,310
It's like a young married couple arguing

513
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,740
and accusing each other.

514
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,890
(Elaborate it, ask more about it)

515
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,940
They want to know who this friend is.

516
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,500
Producer Shen,

517
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,460
can you not avoid the question?

518
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,670
I don't understand

519
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,700
why you always see him
as a thorn in your side.

520
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,700
Because he's the reason we broke up.

521
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,940
We would still have broken up
without him.

522
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,180
I thought you knew why.

523
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,020
I don't know.

524
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,630
Well, since we are talking about it,

525
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,500
why don't you tell me

526
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,780
the real reason why we broke up?

527
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,110
(June 2018)
Let's give them a big hand again.

528
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,740
This season of Race Against Time

529
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,500
is all but over here.

530
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,430
Thank you for your participation.
Thank you.

531
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,120
What's wrong?

532
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,150
There were too many people watching us.

533
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,740
I couldn't turn you down.

534
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,870
You should've told me in advance

535
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,910
about the proposal.

536
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,500
A proposal

537
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,780
should be a surprise.

538
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,150
It was quite a surprise,

539
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,540
but you're stressing me out.

540
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,310
I think we're a couple

541
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,460
and we love each other.

542
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,780
It's a normal thing to do.

543
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,260
Lu Xingyan,

544
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,700
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

545
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,940
Do you know why

546
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,630
I went to your house in high school?

547
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,780
It was because of your family.

548
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,110
Yes.

549
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,070
The relationship between my parents

550
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,590
is actually worse than you think.

551
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,780
I've watched them torture each other

552
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,870
since I was a kid.

553
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,870
My memories of my family

554
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,980
are painful.

555
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,830
So when you proposed to me,

556
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,070
I wasn't happy at all,

557
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,630
I was scared.

558
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,460
Lu Xingyan,

559
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,430
the two of us are really different.

560
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,070
I don't have

561
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,460
the slightest desire to be married.

562
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,390
What do you mean by saying that?

563
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,070
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,980
I know it's hard for you
to accept what I'm telling you

565
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,150
out of the blue,

566
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,430
but it's really what I'm thinking.

567
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,540
I'm going to Germany.

568
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,150
I got an offer from Munich Film Academy.

569
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,830
You're going to Germany?

570
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,239
Yes.

571
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,310
When did you apply for it?

572
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,790
How come I didn't know about it?

573
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,020
My teacher recommended me,

574
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,500
and I didn't care because I didn't think

575
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,270
I had a chance.

576
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,460
But this morning,

577
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,190
I got my acceptance letter.

578
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,870
This is really important to me.

579
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,710
Can we take this time

580
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,750
to consider our future?

581
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,620

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,230

(September 2018, Upon graduation
from the fourth year of college)

599
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,020
Long time no see.

600
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,980
Long time no see.

601
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,020
I heard from my mom

602
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,230
that you've booked a flight to Germany.

603
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,910
The reporting time has been set.

604
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,790
I came back today

605
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,190
to pack my things.

606
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,310
I've been thinking a lot about it.

607
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,620
I did

608
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,910
have a bad attitude last time.

609
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,190
I apologize.

610
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:05,870
I'm sorry.

611
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,140
Don't say that.

612
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,430
It's not entirely your fault.

613
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,980
But... But I've figured it out.

614
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,870
It's not like in the olden days.

615
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,140
Transportation is pretty advanced.

616
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,750
After you go to Germany,

617
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,500
I can visit you anytime.

618
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,870
It's not that difficult.

619
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,580
Well, Lu Xingyan,

620
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,580
Have you thought

621
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,310
about what we're going to do

622
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,060
in the future?

623
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,500
No matter what the future holds,

624
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,910
as long as we're still together.

625
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,830
Give me a hug.

626
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,460
(October 2018)
Across 8,217 kilometers,

627
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,430
it's the first time
we're meeting in Germany.

628
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,430
Stop reading.
You've been reading all night.

629
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,390
Why are you staring at me?

630
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,190
Isn't it hard for you

631
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,980
to travel so far away
for the first time?

632
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,350
No.

633
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,940
It'll be worth it

634
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,830
just to see you.

635
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,060
Didn't you say

636
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,230
you had an internship at the resort?

637
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,580
Doesn't traveling here

638
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,060
take you away from your work?

639
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,580
No.

640
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,350
They don't need me now anyway.

641
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,100
Besides,

642
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,940
your time studying abroad
will be over soon.

643
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,020
As long as you're back in the country,

644
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,540
I won't have to travel like this.

645
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,210
(December 2018)

646
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,020
Are you satisfied with the venue
you checked out last time?

647
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
Our reservation

648
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,620
has to be made a year in advance.

649
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,790
So if you don't have any problems,

650
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,980
you'd better decide earlier.

651
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,660
The best wedding venues.

652
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,020
You're still studying?

653
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,500
Dry your hair. Don't catch a cold.

654
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,810
Quick.

655
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,270
(May 2019)
Did you see the property at Xinghe Bay

656
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:36,940
I sent you?

657
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,870
I haven't opened it yet.

658
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,750
Why did you send me the information
of a property all of a sudden?

659
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,620
My parents gave me money
out of the blue.

660
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,830
I'm sure I'll spend this money quickly

661
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,980
if it's left with me.

662
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,390
I might as well buy a house

663
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,980
and consider it savings.

664
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,660
Take a look when you're free.

665
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,310
When you come back,

666
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,870
we can discuss

667
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,190
the style of decoration and so on.

668
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,140
Have you arranged a time to come back?

669
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,230
Hey, is the connection bad?

670
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,390
No.

671
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,140
I don't think I'm going
to make it back anytime soon.

672
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,140
Why?

673
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,540
My teacher has found me

674
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,580
a very good director.

675
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,350
That director won a lot of awards

676
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,980
and asked me
to be his executive producer.

677
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,830
If I can perform well this time,

678
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,870
I can work with him for a long time.

679
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,940
That would be closer
to my dream, wouldn't it?

680
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,350
What do you think?

681
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:30,830
Yes.

682
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,500
How long do you have to work with him?

683
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,310
The duration is uncertain.

684
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,390
We'll have to see
how the filming progresses.

685
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,910
Then you should work first.

686
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,830
Work is more important.

687
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,540
Was there someone back there?

688
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,750
That's my new roommate, Yu Si.

689
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,580
He was also there during the recording
of Race Against Time.

690
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,390
Do you remember him?

691
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,020
I kind of remember.

692
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,140
Anyway, why would your school

693
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,100
give you a male roommate?

694
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,190
We have random allocation here.

695
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,540
Well, I'm going to look at the files.

696
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,750
I still have homework to do.

697
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,510
Okay.

698
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,460
Bye.

699
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,710
Shen Xingruo can't go back,

700
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,910
(July 2019)
but I can come.

701
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm downstairs in her dormitory now.

702
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,100
This is the tenth time we've
been reunited in a foreign country.

703
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,660
Let me see what she's doing now.

704
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,500
Lu Xingyan.

705
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,980
Lu Xingyan, what are you doing?

706
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,500
Are you crazy?

707
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,190
What are you doing?

708
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,940
What are you doing?

709
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,460
Stop it.

710
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:15,620
What's wrong with you?

711
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,750
Shen Xingruo!

712
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,310
Stop it.

713
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,060
What's wrong with you?

714
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,060
Shen Xingruo!

715
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,060
What are you doing?

716
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,190
Stop it! Stop it!

717
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,790
Go away!

718
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,790
Lu Xingyan is my boyfriend.

719
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,230
He didn't break into our apartment,

720
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,790
and he didn't mean to attack Mr. Yu Si.

721
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,060
It's all a misunderstanding.

722
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,980
Please believe me.

723
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,190
I can understand your feelings.

724
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,580
Please be patient.

725
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,940
We'll let you know

726
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,270
when we have the results.

727
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,190
That's it.

728
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,570
(POLICE)

729
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,190
Xingruo.

730
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,660
Lu Xingyan,

731
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,140
do you know you really scared me?

732
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,540
I thought you were going
to be deported by immigration.

733
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,660
I'm fine.

734
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,870
Don't worry.

735
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,350
What's wrong?

736
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,350
I was wrong. I apologize.

737
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,980
I'll go apologize to Yu Si.

738
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,230
I'll also pay for his medical bills.

739
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,660
I'll never do it again, okay?

740
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,910
Last night was a misunderstanding.

741
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,710
I thought

742
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,270
that was you he was holding
on the balcony.

743
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,140
We've been together for so long.

744
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,940
Is that

745
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,020
what I am to you?

746
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,430
No, I shouldn't have doubted you.

747
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,940
But you're really far away from me.

748
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,940
We're still just boyfriend
and girlfriend

749
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,870
so I'm feeling a little

750
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:01,620
insecure.

751
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,060
But these are only temporary.

752
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,230
I'm sure all this will be resolved

753
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,310
when you come back to the country.

754
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,710
But there are still many problems
that cannot be solved.

755
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,910
I accidentally saw your phone
the other day.

756
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,980
You're planning our wedding.

757
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,980
You've bought a house for us
and you want to renovate it.

758
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,060
Lu Xingyan,

759
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,750
I know what it all means.

760
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,660
Am I wrong for doing all this?

761
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,940
You're right,

762
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,830
but I thought we had an understanding.

763
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,430
I don't want to get married.

764
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,100
Not at that time doesn't mean you
don't want to get married in the future.

765
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,660
I'm just preparing.

766
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
It doesn't mean we have
to get married right now.

767
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,710
I know

768
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,910
your family has done you a lot of harm,

769
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,460
but I'm willing to be there for you.

770
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,190
I'm willing to be with you

771
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,500
as the wounds heal.

772
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,620
I'm sure one day

773
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,430
you'll change your mind.

774
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,580
And please believe me

775
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,980
that I'll make you happy.

776
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,710
One day?

777
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,270
Lu Xingyan, why can't you
understand what I say?

778
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,830
Happiness and marriage can't be equated

779
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,310
in my world.

780
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,140
I don't want to get married.

781
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,980
This thing is never going to change.

782
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,350
Shen Xingruo,

783
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:15,460
it's been six years.

784
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,239
Six years.

785
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,430
I just want an outcome.

786
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,540
Am I wrong?

787
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,660
You aren't.

788
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,750
You're right all along,

789
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,230
but I can't give you that outcome.

790
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,230
If our relationship

791
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,500
is all about giving in to each other

792
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,830
and compromising ourselves,

793
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,060
I don't think we need

794
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,020
to go on.

795
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,230
I'm so sorry.

796
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,350
I had an emergency last night.

797
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,430
I'll be right there.

798
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,020
I'm sorry. I can explain.

799
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,230
What's wrong?

800
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,620
I'm tired.

801
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,270
We're done here.

802
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,660
Okay.

803
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,830
I'm tired, too.

804
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:01,750
Let's go home.

805
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:09,750
I say

806
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,100
we're

807
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,350
done here.

808
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,060
Lu Xingyan,

809
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,540
please don't ever come to me again.

810
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,230
Xingruo.

811
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:31,510
Let go.
