(The time spent waiting,
I kept practicing not to forget you.)

54
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,370
(Year 2024)

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,710
Is this feasible?

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,580
Huang Bing's wife

57
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,270
brings freshly prepared Chinese medicine

58
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,390
to the hospital every noon.

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,550
This is exactly the time
she leaves the house.

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,990
If my guess is right,

61
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,060
we should be able

62
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,300
to find some clues from it.

63
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,300
But,

64
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,110
is rummaging through someone's trash

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,790
even legal?

66
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Once they discarded the trash

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,580
in a public garbage disposal area

68
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,900
or handed it over to sanitation workers,

69
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,020
they've already forfeited

70
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,580
the ownership of the trash,

71
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,150
and the discarded trash

72
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,700
will become owner-less property.

73
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,300
So, technically,

74
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,740
after they discard the trash,

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,910
the behavior of rummaging
through the trash

76
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,150
will not necessarily
constitute an infringement.

77
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,910
She's coming.

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
Let's go quickly.

79
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,380
She threw it in this garbage bin.

80
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,590
Which one?

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,940
It should be this one.

82
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,060
He Siyue.

83
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,060
It's this one.

84
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,150
We found it!

85
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,060
I... Oh yeah!

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,700
I know an expert in this field.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,860
You can hand
this medicinal residue to me,

88
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,940
and I'll let him analyze

89
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,030
the ingredients inside this.

90
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,350
That would be great.

91
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,620
Thank you for your help.

92
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,380
It's nothing.

93
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,820
Let me do it.

94
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,670
Actually,

95
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,180
if it's convenient for you,

96
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,060
you can share the information we found

97
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,740
with Lu Xingyan.

98
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,670
Why don't you reach out
to Shen Xingruo directly?

99
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,350
Are you two upset over this?

100
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,380
No.

101
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,180
Xingruo is incredibly generous.

102
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,940
She's never pressured me

103
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,550
because of this.

104
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,500
And,

105
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,790
we wouldn't argue

106
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,670
over something like this.

107
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,550
It's just...

108
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,990
I still feel guilty.

109
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,060
Xingruo has been putting

110
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,700
so much effort into this show,

111
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,300
and we all have witnessed it.

112
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,990
Even though I'm just doing my job,

113
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,300
it's still affecting the show.

114
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,260
So, I...

115
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
So, you're investigating the truth

116
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,060
to make it up to Shen Xingruo?

117
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,300
Yes, but that's not the only reason.

118
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,620
As lawyers,

119
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,060
we're responsible for ensuring that
the evidence we present to the court,

120
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,060
the opposing party,

121
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,910
and any other related parties

122
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,300
is accurate, truthful, and complete.

123
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,150
So,

124
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm just obeying my professional ethics.

125
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,150
Alright, I got it.

126
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,470
I'll update Lu Xingyan

127
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,910
on our investigation.

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,130
(Evergreen Clinic)

129
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,150
Thank you for both of you yesterday.

130
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,350
If it weren't for your help,

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,990
my wife would have had another episode.

132
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,590
It's nothing.

133
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,550
We are just lending a hand.

134
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,030
You don't have to be too polite to us.

135
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,150
Doctor Wang,

136
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,260
before we leave,
there's something I'd like to ask you.

137
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,740
It's about Huang Bing, isn't it?

138
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,350
Yes.

139
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,690
I'm the producer of the show
that Huang Bing is involved in.

140
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,910
Everyone has put in so much effort

141
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,180
into this show.

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,670
We've all seen Huang Bing's dedication,

143
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,380
and he deserves compensation.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,820
But, I don't want things

145
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,300
to remain unclear this way.

146
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,180
I just want you to tell me the truth.

147
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,300
Well.

148
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,300
Hold on.

149
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,700
There's nothing to hide from this.

150
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,300
Huang Bing came back
last Lunar New Year already sick.

151
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,300
At first, it was just a cold and fever,

152
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,180
and he didn't care much about it.

153
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,300
But, when the fever wouldn't go away,

154
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,390
that's when we discovered
he had myocarditis.

155
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,940
These are the medicines

156
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,230
I've been prescribing him
since last year.

157
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,550
Thank you so much for this.

158
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,510
No need to thank me.

159
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,430
Actually, his wife

160
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,390
once called me,

161
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,610
saying that the production team
was bullying Huang Bing

162
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,870
and refusing to compensate him.

163
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,550
But, I think

164
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,060
you're not that kind of person.

165
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,180
That's why I'm
giving you the prescription.

166
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,610
Will Huang Bing's brother
cause trouble to you?

167
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,820
Don't worry about it. He is...

168
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,270
I'll just tell him you both
slipped away in midnight.

169
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,100
He won't do anything to me.

170
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,460
That's great.

171
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,060
Well, off you go.

172
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,750
Alright.

173
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,300
You can often come visit
Changqing Village when you have time.

174
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,550
Don't worry.

175
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,150
We'll definitely come back to see you.

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,160
Alright. Let me send you off.

177
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,910
We must come.

178
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,839
Let's go.

179
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,700
Thank you again, Doctor Wang.

180
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,510
It's nothing.

181
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,060
Let's go.

182
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,060
Okay.

183
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,390
Everything is sorted out.

184
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,980
Why do you sigh?

185
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,100
I just feel it's unfair to them.

186
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,940
Why does fate have
to be so cruel to them?

187
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,910
Even though they missed out
on many years,

188
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,580
and the journey has been rough,

189
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,100
at least they ended up together.

190
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,270
Why do I feel like
you've been looking at me all day?

191
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,390
I was just thinking,

192
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,980
if someday

193
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,870
I get Alzheimer's,

194
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,510
what do you think I'd remember?

195
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,390
If it were me,

196
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,230
even if I forgot everything,
I'm sure I'll still remember you.

197
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,060
But if it were you,

198
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,000
I bet you'd still remember your slogan.

199
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,510
What is that?

200
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,910
"I don't want to get married."

201
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,550
If only we could

202
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,790
give them a wedding,
it'll be nice.

203
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,060
I understand how you feel.

204
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,700
But, if we threw them a wedding,

205
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,630
she'd probably forget the next day

206
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,510
and demand another one.

207
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,060
Am I right?

208
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,940
Don't you think

209
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,550
Doctor Wang is a very kind person?

210
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,820
He's quite interesting.

211
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,180
But I do feel sorry for Aunt.

212
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,510
Qin.

213
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,060
I heard you went to Changqing Village.

214
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,060
Did you find any clues?

215
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,970
We found the doctor
who prescribed medicine to Huang Bing.

216
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,700
He has indeed had
myocarditis for a while.

217
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,130
We brought back his medical records.

218
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,340
I know you're investigating this too.

219
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,870
But you don't have to tell us

220
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,100
your investigation results.

221
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,220
That way,

222
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,380
you won't have to
compromise your professional ethics.

223
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,060
Afterwards,

224
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,390
I'll contact Lawyer Zhai
to arrange a meeting with you.

225
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,510
But, Qin, to be honest,

226
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,060
I don't want to make
a big deal out of this.

227
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,340
If possible,

228
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,270
I'd prefer a private settlement.

229
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,580
I agree.

230
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,430
But, I still need
to communicate with them first.

231
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,300
I'm worried that
if you approach them directly,

232
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,870
they might be a bit resistant.

233
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,340
After all, I'm their lawyer,

234
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,100
so they'll at least listen to me a bit.

235
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,980
Thank you.

236
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,580
Here you go.

237
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,060
Still have to drink?

238
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,870
Drink it.

239
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,150
Lawyer Shi, what brings you here?

240
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,390
You don't need to hide it anymore.

241
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,870
We already know

242
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,550
the contents of the thermos

243
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,750
are medicine for treating
Huang Bing's myocarditis.

244
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,670
Who's there?

245
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,300
Ms. Shen.

246
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,100
Mr. Zhang.

247
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,670
Why are you...

248
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,940
Please come in.

249
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,510
Mr. Zhang, take a seat.

250
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,790
Alright, I'll sit here.

251
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,300
Alright.

252
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,180
Have some fruit.

253
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,100
Thank you.

254
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,790
I'll go pour some water for you.

255
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,100
Daddy is good.

256
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,580
You keep an eye on your little brother.

257
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,790
Don't run around.

258
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,980
Ms. Shen. Mr. Zhang.

259
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,460
Please have some water.

260
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,700
Thank you.

261
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,700
You too, please have a seat.

262
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,580
I'll sit.

263
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,790
We're here today

264
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,150
to discuss your situation.

265
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,670
Your myocarditis

266
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,180
has no direct connection

267
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,820
to your work with the production team.

268
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,220
Also, the compensation
you're asking for, 120,000 yuan,

269
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,100
is unreasonable.

270
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,870
I'm here

271
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,940
to clarify things

272
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,270
and to hear your thoughts.

273
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,060
Bosses, regarding the compensation,

274
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,060
I know we're asking for a lot.

275
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,870
We can negotiate things.

276
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,460
Please don't sue us.

277
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,750
How did

278
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,300
your myocarditis happen?

279
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,820
I...

280
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,390
Well, Ms. Shen,

281
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,460
at the beginning of the year,

282
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,340
I felt some discomfort in my heart.

283
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,100
So, I went to the clinic in the village.

284
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,610
The doctor there told me
to get checked at a bigger hospital.

285
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,180
After the checkup,

286
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,750
I was diagnosed with myocarditis.

287
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,870
The doctor told me to rest,

288
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,910
but I didn't dare.

289
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,060
I have a family

290
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,790
depending on me.

291
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,060
So, when the production team
contacted me,

292
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,750
I didn't dare to mention my illness.

293
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,390
I thought it'd be fine.

294
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,790
Ms. Shen, I'm sorry

295
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,910
to cause you trouble.

296
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,870
We understand your situation.

297
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,060
But, after you were hospitalized,

298
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,340
the agreed compensation conditions

299
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,340
suddenly changed overnight.

300
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,940
What happened?

301
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,940
Did someone

302
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,070
say something to you?

303
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,220
Huang, for your current condition,

304
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,020
I think you'll need
at least a year of rest.

305
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,740
Have you discussed
the compensation amount with them?

306
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,830
Not yet.

307
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,460
How much do you think is reasonable?

308
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,630
Well,

309
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,220
as a crew in the production team,

310
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,740
it's not appropriate for me
to comment on this.

311
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,150
But, since you took
good care of me very much

312
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,070
throughout the show,

313
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,630
as a sister,

314
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,020
I'll give you a suggestion personally.

315
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,830
If you need to rest for some time,

316
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,910
then the compensation should match that.

317
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,350
One month, 10,000 yuan.

318
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,220
Then, that's 120,000 yuan for a year.

319
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,180
Really?

320
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,350
This is how it is.

321
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,020
The production team

322
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,070
has a contingency fund.

323
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,700
Simply put, if this money

324
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,740
doesn't go to you,

325
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,830
it'll be spent elsewhere too, right?

326
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Additionally, the production team

327
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,830
definitely doesn't want
things to blow up.

328
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,630
They'll probably want
to settle this privately.

329
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,730
What if they
don't agree on the compensation?

330
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,780
If they don't agree,

331
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,910
you can go to her.

332
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,500
(Shi Qin, Practicing Lawyer)

333
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,460
Shi Qin?

334
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,940
A lawyer?

335
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,210
Does that mean we're going on a lawsuit?

336
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,460
The crying child gets the milk.

337
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,350
Just to scare them.

338
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,870
So they'll agree with it.

339
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,150
We were wrong about this.

340
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,540
It was our greed that led to this.

341
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,830
But, please consider Huang Bing's

342
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,310
hard works and contributions.

343
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,220
Please be lenient to us,

344
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,830
and don't send Huang Bing to jail.

345
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,020
Our whole family depends on him.

346
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,150
Mrs. Huang, you've misunderstood us.

347
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,740
We didn't come here today

348
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,070
to assign blame.

349
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,220
We just want to understand
what really happened.

350
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,020
We've worked together
for some time, right?

351
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,070
You've been diligent and hard-working.

352
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,870
Now that you're unwell,
and it's hard to get a job.

353
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,430
So, we've discussed it.

354
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,220
Ms. Shen

355
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,460
is willing to offer some compensation

356
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,740
within our means.

357
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,630
We'll settle it
based on your quarterly wages,

358
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,260
a total of 30,000 yuan. Is that okay?

359
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,910
But, Ms. Shen...

360
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,670
This money...

361
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,430
I shouldn't take it.

362
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,430
Listen to me.

363
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,670
You fell ill while working with us.

364
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,310
If you have difficulties

365
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,220
and we don't lend a hand to you,

366
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,150
who will want to work
with us in the future?

367
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,070
Moreover, you've also helped

368
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,530
coordinate a lot of the crew members.

369
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,740
So, we'd like you to assist us

370
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,630
in settling them.

371
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,220
What's important now

372
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,110
is finishing the show.

373
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,430
That way,

374
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,740
everyone's efforts won't go to waste,

375
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,630
am I right?

376
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,780
But...

377
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,940
Don't overthink it.

378
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,670
Take care of your health.

379
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,980
Eat, drink, and relax. Isn't that nice?

380
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,500
Thank you so much.

381
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,020
Mrs. Huang,

382
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,830
our company currently has
a cleaning position available.

383
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,110
You'll have a stable income.

384
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,390
But, it might not be
as much as Huang earns.

385
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,980
The working hours aren't long,

386
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,460
so you'll have time
to take care of the family.

387
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,220
You can consider
whether to help me with this.

388
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,430
Sure, I will.

389
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,220
When can I start working?

390
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,180
It depends on you.
You can start anytime.

391
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,730
- Thank you, Ms. Shen.
- No need, please sit down.

392
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,110
We've already taken up
a lot of your time.

393
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,070
We get to go now.

394
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,700
That's right.

395
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,590
Stay a bit longer, Ms. Shen.

396
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,980
Miao Miao and her brother are adorable.

397
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,110
Bring them over to play there.

398
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,700
Alright.

399
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,430
We're leaving now.

400
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,530
Sorry for disturbing you.

401
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,740
Alright.

402
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,710
Take care of yourself.

403
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,190
- Okay.
- Don't overthink.

404
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,830
Let me walk you out.

405
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,740
Thanks, Ms. Shen.

406
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,450
(Office, Zhang Xu)

407
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,020
Mr. Zhang, you wanted to see me?

408
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,980
I'm the one who called you here.

409
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,390
What's going on?

410
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,910
Starting tomorrow,
you don't need to come to work.

411
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,780
You've been fired.

412
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,780
What makes you qualified to fire me?

413
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,030
You obstructed the filming process
of the production team,

414
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,350
and persuaded Huang Bing
to extort the team.

415
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,350
Are these reasons enough?

416
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,630
Do you have any proof?

417
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,630
You said it yourself,

418
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,070
Huang Bing was extorting.

419
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,180
How can you believe his words?

420
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,180
Although you came here as a fan,

421
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,150
you've been diligent in your work

422
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,670
and have contributed to the show.

423
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,740
So, I think

424
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,350
you're passionate about your job.

425
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,350
You're a thoughtful scenarist.

426
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,180
I also know that
whether or not you get fired

427
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,700
won't affect your life.

428
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,110
And I don't believe

429
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,430
that the extortion ideas
you told Huang Bing

430
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,070
came from someone as young as you.

431
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,830
I just don't want to see you
being used as a pawn.

432
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,020
Shen Xingruo,

433
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,870
do you think

434
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,180
you're the smartest person in the world?

435
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,830
I can't stand

436
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,630
your smug attitude.

437
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,940
I was the one who came up
with all the ideas.

438
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,830
I encouraged Huang Bing

439
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,080
to ask for more money from you.

440
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,740
I told him

441
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,460
you'd go to Changqing Village
to investigate.

442
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,150
How was it? Did I guess it right?

443
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,540
With that attitude,

444
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,530
there's no point in us talking anymore.

445
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,830
Don't forget.

446
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,830
My dad is the investor.

447
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,830
If you dare to fire me,

448
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,940
I'll let him withdraw his investment.

449
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,110
If you lack the money,

450
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,540
the production team

451
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,110
will be all ruined, right?

452
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,630
The contract your father's company

453
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,390
signed with the production team

454
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,740
is legally effective.

455
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,490
Withdrawing the investment without
reason would breach the agreement.

456
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,590
Whether to fire me or not,

457
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,460
you'll have to ask
if Uncle Zhang agrees or not.

458
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,260
Firing you is my decision.

459
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,780
Uncle Zhang,

460
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,700
I'll tell my dad when I get home later.

461
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,460
Your dad has already agreed
to this decision.

462
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,310
Your dad doesn't want
his money wasted either.

463
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,700
So, you should go home

464
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,600
and think about
how to explain it to him.

465
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,540
(Star Media Studio)
The production team is ready to resume.

466
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,350
But before returning to the main set,

467
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,630
I want to film
a special episode about love.

468
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,830
(Photo of Wang Shenzhi and Li Yuzhi)

469
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,310
What is love?

470
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,310
We tried

471
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,220
to find an answer
from the ordinary elderly couple.

472
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,740
The elderly couple
living in Changqing Village

473
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,430
were each other's first love
during their youth,

474
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,630
but due to a series
of misunderstandings,

475
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,710
(Young Li Yuzhi)
they were separated for half a lifetime.

476
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,180
(Young Wang Shenzhi)
The man remained unmarried his whole life,

477
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,460
(Bravery for Love, Igniting the Heart)
waiting for her.

478
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Later, when she lost her husband,

479
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,260
and developed Alzheimer's disease,

480
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,020
with no one to take care of her,

481
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,670
he chose to return to her side.

482
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,310
(Li Yuzhi)

483
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,150
Now, she

484
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,590
remembers nothing.

485
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,220
But, she only remembers her first love

486
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,020
and the wedding
that was never completed.

487
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,780
So,

488
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,540
I want to help them have
the wedding they missed out on,

489
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,980
to make up for the regret
from her youth.

490
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,260
I also want the audience to experience

491
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,310
this beautiful and sincere love.

492
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,220
Won't people online say
we're just putting on a show?

493
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,390
Because even if you hold the wedding,
she won't know

494
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,260
as she has Alzheimer's disease.

495
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,980
I've thought about this.

496
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,630
I plan to film the wedding

497
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,740
and edit it into a video

498
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,980
to give to her,

499
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,730
so she can watch it
and keep it as a memory.

500
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,180
Why not film the editing process too,

501
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,030
and include it as part
of the special episode?

502
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,940
I think that's great.

503
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,460
Does anyone else have any suggestions?

504
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,940
Nothing?

505
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,980
Alright, let's dismiss.

506
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,260
Xingruo,

507
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,310
I feel like your heart

508
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,540
has softened a bit lately.

509
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,150
What am I like in your eyes?

510
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,350
Soft-hearted but sharp-tongued?

511
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,020
Nope.

512
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,910
Sharp-tongued and sharp-hearted.

513
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,780
Have you and Lu Xingyan

514
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,350
made some progress lately?

515
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,020
This drink is good. What is it?

516
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,500
Am I right? It's sour yet sweet,
made with raspberry jam.

517
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,560
This is really good.

518
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,330
Are you done with your work?

519
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,590
How is the progress
with your previous client?

520
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,540
Any new developments

521
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,150
on the collaboration projects?

522
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,260
Hold on.

523
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,020
Haven't we not finished shooting
the current variety show yet?

524
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,460
How is there already a new client?

525
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,020
Xingruo, aren't you
pushing yourself too hard?

526
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,540
That's not her case.

527
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,260
Xingruo would gladly
work overtime recently.

528
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,260
What does that mean?

529
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,910
How can someone work overtime willingly?

530
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,220
Stop guessing.

531
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,500
Let me reveal the truth to you.

532
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,780
Lu Xingyan and her,

533
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,020
the two of them...

534
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,630
Are you and Lu Xingyan back together?

535
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,940
We're together,

536
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,030
but we haven't confirmed
a romantic relationship yet.

537
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,220
So, does that mean...

538
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,390
I'd like to interview you.

539
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,180
Do you have any plans

540
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,590
to take things further?

541
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,870
For the past few days,

542
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,310
I've been reflecting

543
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,910
upon our relationship.

544
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,070
I used to think

545
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,460
that being immersed in love
would make me lose myself.

546
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,940
But recently,

547
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,870
after I went to Changqing Village,

548
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,780
and I saw

549
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,980
the love between
Doctor Wang and his wife.

550
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,740
I suddenly realized

551
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,910
that maybe it's not
as scary as I thought.

552
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,390
So,

553
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,020
no matter how far things go
between Lu Xingyan and me,

554
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,020
I'm happy

555
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,980
we're moving forward
and not standing still.

556
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,430
Stop it here.

557
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,910
There's something
I need to discuss with both of you.

558
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,110
The production team

559
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,870
is planning to hold a wedding

560
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,110
for Doctor Wang and his wife.

561
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,430
We want the male guests

562
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,500
to be groomsmen,

563
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,350
and the female guests to be bridesmaids.

564
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,110
So, both of you,

565
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,390
get ready for it.

566
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,870
Okay.

567
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,590
No problem.

568
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,590
Check out what your boyfriend sent you.

569
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,260
Faster.

570
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,020
Your boyfriend just texted you.

571
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,180
Everyone, come here!

572
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,870
It's over here!

573
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,430
Let's go.

574
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,410
Be careful, don't run.

575
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,870
Go in.

576
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,010
You're here too.

577
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,310
You should stand further.

578
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,130
Otherwise, Yuzhi will
mistake you for me again,

579
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,310
I won't go easy on you.

580
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,980
Alright, I'll stand further back.

581
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,740
Don't worry, Doctor Wang.

582
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,630
You're looking so handsome today,
more handsome than anyone else here.

583
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,830
There's no way she'll mistake you.

584
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,460
Mrs. Wang is here.

585
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,930
The bride is here! The bride is here!

586
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,520
How wonderful this is!

587
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,040
Here she comes.

588
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,180
What a joyful moment!

589
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,460
Mrs. Wang.

590
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,020
Doctor Wang is waiting for you up ahead.

591
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,260
Go ahead.

592
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,390
Yuzhi, come here.

593
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,070
You look beautiful today.

594
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,940
You look quite handsome too.

595
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,740
This is for you.

596
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,630
Yuzhi.

597
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,780
Who are you?

598
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm...

599
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,350
Yuzhi.

600
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,630
Who are you people?

601
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,120
I'm not getting married.

602
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,700
Yuzhi.

603
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,530
I'm not getting married.

604
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,540
I'm waiting for Shenzhi to come back.

605
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,260
Yuzhi.

606
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,700
I'm waiting for Shenzhi to come back.

607
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,670
I'm not getting married.

608
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,780
Yuzhi.

609
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,180
- Shenzhi will marry me.
- Calm down.

610
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,930
She just needs a moment.

611
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,780
Don't worry.

612
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,910
Doctor Wang is there.

613
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,150
We shouldn't disturb them.

614
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,800
They have their
own way of settling that.

615
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,390
Shenzhi.

616
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,630
You...

617
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,350
Yuzhi.

618
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,070
What happened to your face?

619
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,390
Who scratched you?

620
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,430
It's nothing.

621
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,020
Today is

622
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,350
our big day.

623
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,700
Today is our wedding day?

624
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,390
Yes.

625
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,940
Shenzhi, do I...

626
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,830
Do I look good?

627
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,070
Of course, you are. You look beautiful.

628
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,150
I'm getting married?

629
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,220
Yes.

630
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,590
You're marrying me?

631
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,670
Yes.

632
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,700
Yuzhi,

633
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,500
the first time I saw you,

634
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,780
your hair was so long.

635
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,020
Back then, I thought,

636
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,110
if I could marry

637
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,910
a girl like you,

638
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,350
I'd smile in my sleep.

639
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,220
I also wondered,

640
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,260
could a good girl like you

641
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,460
even admire a silly guy like me?

642
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,350
Yuzhi,

643
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,500
for the first half of our lives,

644
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,310
I've made you wait too long.

645
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,870
So, starting from today,

646
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,590
I'm going to stay by your side,

647
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,630
taking care of you and being with you.

648
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,220
Yuzhi,

649
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,980
will you marry me?

650
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,980
Yes, I will.

651
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,670
Great.

652
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,310
Here.

653
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,350
Beautiful.

654
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,070
Shenzhi.

655
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,380
Great!

656
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,190
Great!

657
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,520
Great!

658
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,020
Be gentle.

659
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,500
If not, you'll wipe away my eyelashes.

660
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,060
Don't move.

661
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,870
Seems like this wedding
didn't move Lawyer Zhai.

662
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,660
Mr. Yu was touched?

663
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,190
Yes, it's touching.

664
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,980
But, when I think

665
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,030
about the results of the challengers
will be coming out in a few days,

666
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,660
and that I won't be able
to see Lawyer Zhai anymore,

667
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,390
I feel a little down.

668
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:37,910
Yes?

669
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,980
Does Mr. Yu intend to leave the show?

670
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,500
You sound so confident that you'll stay.

671
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,190
I was hoping

672
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,940
we'd both stay on the show.

673
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,870
Xingruo,

674
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,060
what's the next agenda for the show?

675
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,830
No more plans for today.

676
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,830
The next filming is next weekend.

677
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,460
Everyone has been working hard,

678
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,710
so go home and rest well.

679
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,390
By the way, there's a Dock Hotel nearby,

680
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,160
with rooms remodeled from fishing boats.

681
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,660
Lu Xingyan, do you want to check it out?

682
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,230
Director Xu has already invited me,

683
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,310
of course I will go.

684
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,060
- I...
- I knew your answer already. You're going.

685
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,270
Mr. Yu,

686
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,310
there's a Dock Hotel nearby. Do you...

687
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,830
Do you want to go with us?

688
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,350
No, I'm not going.

689
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,140
Seeing your boss, Mr. Lu, annoys me.

690
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,390
How bored.

691
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,430
Lawyer Zhai,

692
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
will you stay?

693
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,830
I still have work at the law firm,
so I can't join.

694
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,620
I've just finished dealing
with Huang Bing's case,

695
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,020
and I have to submit a report tomorrow.

696
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,270
So, I'm heading back later.

697
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,540
I...

698
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,100
I have an event tomorrow.

699
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,230
So, you guys enjoy yourselves.

700
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,710
I'll leave later as well.

701
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,750
No one's going?

702
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,390
Just the four of us, then.

703
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,060
Let's go.

704
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,410
(Laochuanmeishuguan Homestay)

705
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,060
No wonder this place is so popular.

706
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,750
Alright.

707
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,910
Let's enjoy.

708
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,410
- We're leaving.
- Just one room key.

709
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,270
Enjoy yourselves.

710
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,750
Are we sharing a room?

711
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,830
Can we make it so public now?

712
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,230
They already knew it.

713
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,500
Are you unhappy about that?

714
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
I can't believe it.

715
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,310
So, are we now

716
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,500
officially boyfriend and girlfriend?

717
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,830
In a trial phase.

718
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,580
I got it.

719
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,940
Boyfriend in training.

720
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,310
Which room?

721
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,790
That way.

722
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,430
I'm exhausted.

723
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,580
Finally, I can sleep.

724
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,460
My wifey.

725
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,140
My adorable and beautiful wifey,

726
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,910
in these past few days,

727
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,870
I've reflected upon
my past inappropriate behaviors,

728
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,980
and would like to offer my apology.

729
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,870
From Doctor Wang's love story,

730
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,430
I've learned the crucial point,

731
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,310
which is sacrifice. I love you.

732
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,390
So, from now on,

733
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,580
I'm willing to sacrifice
my games for you.

734
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,770
(Uninstall?
Confirm)

735
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,660
When you made a fuss over me,

736
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,460
it's because you want me to stop gaming.

737
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,830
It's my fault for not understanding you,

738
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,270
and did not spend time accompanying you.

739
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,350
So, from today on.

740
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,620
I'm turning over a new leaf,

741
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,910
and committed to being a better person.

742
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,140
From now on,

743
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,660
you are the center of my world.

744
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,750
I will always obey the rule

745
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,450
that "Wife is the best,
wife is always right."

746
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,430
Have you finished your words?

747
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,580
I'm really touched

748
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,540
that you feel this way.

749
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,620
Let's sleep now.

750
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,190
My wifey.

751
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,460
Regarding tomorrow's plan,

752
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,030
I'd like to plan the itinerary with you.

753
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,140
Starting now,

754
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,540
your personal tour guide, Zhou,

755
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,270
will offer you full-service support.

756
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,430
It's too late now. Let's plan tomorrow.

757
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,830
Sleep tight, goodnight, love you.

758
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,430
No, we have to decide
on the route tonight,

759
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,890
or it'll be too late in the morning.

760
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,540
I'm fine with whatever you choose.

761
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,870
I know

762
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,980
that when you say
you're fine with anything,

763
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,830
you want me to guess
what you're thinking.

764
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,310
Wifey, give me a chance
to understand you.

765
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,500
Tell me

766
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,230
what your thoughts are.

767
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,980
I just want to sleep right now.

768
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,100
Sightseeing or food?

769
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,430
Sleeping.

770
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,430
There are two sightseeing routes,
east and west.

771
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,580
Let me know where you want to go.

772
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,980
And, for lunch,

773
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,500
do you prefer rice noodles
or vermicelli?

774
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,270
Dry or in soup?

775
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,310
East route for sightseeing.
Dry noodles for lunch.

776
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,460
No hiking. No going to any place
where the sun is too strong.

777
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,540
Any other questions?

778
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,020
Wifey.

779
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,870
You predicted all my questions!

780
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,790
Congratulations

781
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,310
on answering all my questions
ahead of me asking.

782
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,230
Let's sleep.

783
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,350
What's up?

784
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,870
Are you craving for a late-night snack?

785
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,790
What are you doing?

786
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,870
I'm a boyfriend in training now.

787
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,500
Don't you think

788
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,500
it's time you made some changes too?

789
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,580
What kind of changes?

790
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,620
I think calling me "Lu Xingyan"

791
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,620
is too strange and formal.

792
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,750
Then, what should I call you?

793
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,390
Call me "brother".

794
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,830
I can't say that.

795
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,580
I'm older than you.

796
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,500
Why can't you call me that?

797
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,750
Piggy.

798
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,750
Call me "brother".

799
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,060
Xingyan.

800
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,460
I'll just call you Xingyan from now on.

801
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,500
Call me "brother".

802
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,540
If you

803
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,830
don't even like that,

804
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,980
then I'll just call you...

805
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,350
Mr. Lu.

806
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,100
Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu.

807
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,940
Fine.

808
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,830
Call me "Xingyan".

809
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,140
I read the summary report
of Huang Bing's case.

810
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,010
It's well written.

811
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,910
I didn't do much for that.

812
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,620
Plus, I didn't settle the case.

813
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,060
True.

814
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,930
This was your first case
since becoming a full-time lawyer,

815
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,750
and it ended up
with a private settlement.

816
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,710
So, neither the firm nor you,

817
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,020
made any profit from it.

818
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,390
In terms of efficiency,

819
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,710
you worked for nothing.

820
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,430
But an excellent lawyer's job

821
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,620
isn't just about winning cases in court.

822
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,310
It's about helping clients avoid going
to court in the first place.

823
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,350
Before protecting a client's interest,

824
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,790
we should first uphold
the fairness of the law.

825
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
For your first case,

826
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,430
you didn't rush for accomplishment.

827
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,430
Instead, you carefully
searched for clues

828
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,460
and uncovered hidden information.

829
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,460
That's what I appreciate most.

830
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,310
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

831
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,500
Keep it up.

832
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,500
You've been in a good condition lately.

833
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,620
You even look prettier.

834
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,230
Did you get some cosmetic work done?

835
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,500
No, no.

836
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,350
Are you using some new makeup products?

837
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,060
Nope,

838
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,430
you've also become
more cheerful and smiley.

839
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,350
Could it be that
you're in a relationship?

840
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,580
What are you doing after work?

841
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,060
I want to eat hotpot.

842
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,750
Qin,

843
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,790
you're looking elegant today.

844
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,350
Thank you.

845
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,870
(Shi Qin)
(Are you free tonight?)

846
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,830
(He Siyue)
(I'm busy tonight.)

847
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,690
(How late will you be busy?)

848
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,570
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

849
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,650
In the final selection
for the guest challenger,

850
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,810
why did you make this decision?

851
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,130
Regarding Shi Qin's choice,

852
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,610
do you have anything to say?

853
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:43,850
(Do you have anything to say
about Shi Qin's choice?)

854
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,850
Move the screen a bit.

855
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,170
Otherwise, the audience might
think the screen is frozen.

856
