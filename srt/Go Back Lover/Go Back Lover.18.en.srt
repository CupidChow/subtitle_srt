=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,330
(October 2015.
First Semester of Sophomore Year)

4
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,180
Is this mine?

5
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,430
Yes, I saw it when I went to the post office
to collect my package.

6
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,390
I brought it back for you.

7
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,820
Okay, thank you.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,260
I'm going out to eat.
Do you want to join me?

9
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,430
No, you go first.

10
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,070
Okay.

11
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,850
(Sender: Shen Guangyao
Receiver: Shen Xingruo)

12
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,090
(Double Happiness)

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,130
(Double Happiness)

14
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,980
(Xingruo.)

15
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,030
(Long time no see.)

16
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,980
(Madam Fang and I have decided)

17
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,860
(to get married on November 6th.)

18
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,910
(We hope you'll give us your blessing.)

19
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,300
(You'll always be my dearest daughter.)

20
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,190
Have you eaten?

21
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,700
No, I'm not hungry yet.

22
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,450
What about you?

23
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,540
I'm walking back now.

24
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,140
Today's class was really difficult.

25
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,670
I wish you were by my side.

26
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,020
This way,
I don't have to pay attention.

27
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,230
You'll give me extra lessons
anyway, right?

28
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,010
Is that thing on your desk
a wedding invitation?

29
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,260
Someone wants me
to attend their wedding,

30
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,510
but I don't want to go.

31
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,670
Why?

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,910
No reason. I just don't want to go.

33
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,700
You can go and have a look.

34
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,470
Gain some experience.

35
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,910
This way, it'll be much easier

36
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,470
when we get married.

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,050
What's the matter?

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,910
Nothing, I'm just
a little tired from class.

39
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,790
I'll call you back later.

40
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,510
Okay.

41
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,930
=Episode 18=
(I've always been waiting for you here.)

42
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,810
(Year 2024)

43
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,910
What's this?

44
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,110
I saw you didn't eat anything,

45
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,020
so I ordered wonton skin and filling

46
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,460
to make you some wontons.

47
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,430
I'm not hungry.

48
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,340
Do you know

49
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,070
that the stomach
is not only a digestive organ,

50
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,190
but also an emotional organ?

51
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,550
When you take good care of it,

52
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,390
your mood will also improve.

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,950
I'll go cook for you first.

54
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,660
You can eat it anytime you want.

55
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,260
Rest first.

56
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,760
I'll let you know when it's done.

57
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,750
Go.

58
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,450
(Xingruo, long time no see!)

59
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,250
(I've seen your music variety show.)

60
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,650
(I'm proud of you.)

61
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,650
(Xingruo, I feel happy
that I have a brilliant daughter.)

62
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,390
(Don't exhaust yourself.)

63
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,090
(I'll always have your back.)

64
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,010
(I recently attended
an art exhibition in Germany)

65
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,710
(and saw a wonderful artwork.)

66
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,810
(It reminded me
of how I taught you to draw an apple.)

67
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,290
(Xingruo, I'll always support you.)

68
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,590
(I'm waiting for the day when
we'll be together again.)

69
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,490

Try it.

108
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,020
It's a little hot.

109
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,900
Let me guess.
This was you when you were little.

110
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,830
Did someone give this to you?

111
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,990
My dad

112
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,870
secretly stuffed it into my luggage

113
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,540
when I moved to your house.

114
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,710
Your dad drew you so beautifully.

115
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,780
He must love you very much.

116
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,470
But what's this?

117
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,850
(Dear Xingruo,
you'll always be my dear daughter.)

118
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,750
(Dear Xingruo,)

119
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,230
(you'll always be my dear daughter.)

120
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,940
Who are you?

121
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,300
Lu Xingyan.

122
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,420
So you wanted
to burn this painting that day.

123
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,540
After all these years,

124
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,110
this is the first time I hear you
talk about your dad.

125
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,420
My relationship with my dad

126
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,300
is quite complicated.

127
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,140
That's why

128
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,780
I never want to mention him.

129
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,470
It's because whenever I think of him,

130
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,230
it makes me miserable.

131
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,940
So what happened back then?

132
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,060
Can you tell me about it?

133
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,590
When I was little,

134
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,630
my family was happy.

135
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,510
My dad

136
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,470
is a famous artist,

137
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,590
so we're quite well-off.

138
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,420
My mom

139
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,940
is a famous pianist.

140
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,540
But she never played the piano again

141
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,060
after getting married.

142
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,780
I'm done.

143
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,510
Here, let me see.

144
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,940
Am I not very good at drawing?

145
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,990
Of course not.

146
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,350
You did such a great job
that you surprised me.

147
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,110
I don't believe you.

148
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,330
If you don't believe me,
show it to your mom.

149
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,300
Look.

150
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,750
Baby, don't come over.
My hands are dirty.

151
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,830
You don't need to do the chores.

152
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,870
We can just hire cleaners.

153
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,780
Cleaners won't clean
as seriously as yourself.

154
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,390
I clean the house thoroughly

155
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,020
so that you feel comfortable.

156
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,230
Go play with your dad. Hurry.

157
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,230
Ignore your mom.

158
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,510
She doesn't know anything.

159
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,710
Let me explain.

160
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,780
Sit.

161
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,420
What you drew

162
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,940
is called Cubism.

163
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,300
This is a painting by Picasso.

164
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,020
Don't you think your drawings
are exactly the same?

165
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,990
You're amazing.

166
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,230
(I thought)

167
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,230
(our family
could live happily like this forever.)

168
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,780
(But I didn't expect)

169
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,750
(that there were cracks)

170
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,660
(in my parents' relationship)

171
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,710
(that I couldn't see.)

172
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,940
Shen Guangyao.

173
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,230
How could you say that to me?

174
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,230
I quit my job

175
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,020
and became what I am today.

176
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,660
I did everything
for you and this family.

177
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,110
I never deny

178
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,020
what you have done for this family.

179
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,390
But how come

180
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,230
you keep finding fault with me?

181
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,510
Either this is wrong or that is wrong!

182
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,540
Where's the person who used to sit

183
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,420
at the piano?

184
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,750
How did you become
someone who only cares

185
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,420
about the daily necessities of life?

186
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,470
What do you want?

187
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,900
Daily necessities of life?

188
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
Are you telling me
about daily necessities of life?

189
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,750
Okay, let me ask you.

190
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,140
Someone has to buy the food in this house.

191
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,230
Someone has to cook the daily meals.

192
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,710
You know Xingruo only likes to eat

193
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,020
the food I cook.

194
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,750
Aren't I

195
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,830
the only one

196
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,350
who's taking care of this family?

197
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,060
Enough!

198
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,180
Guangyao.

199
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,510
Stop living in your own world.

200
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,750
We need to take care of the family

201
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,780
together.

202
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,470
Can you understand me?

203
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,660
Dad and Mom.

204
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,540
What's going on with you two?

205
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,660
Nothing. Do your homework.

206
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,710
- I'm talking to your mom.
- Nothing.

207
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,020
Nothing, Xingruo.

208
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,350
Nothing.

209
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,060
Nothing, baby. Nothing.

210
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,020
Here, do your homework first.

211
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,780
You must be hungry.

212
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
I'll make you

213
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,110
your favorite hot pot later, okay?

214
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,230
Here, go upstairs.

215
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,660
I'll call you when I'm done.

216
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,230
After my mom died,

217
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,660
I felt like the sky was falling.

218
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,350
I'm sorry for your loss.

219
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,110
My condolences.

220
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,590
(But to my dad,)

221
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,180
(it was a relief.)

222
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,710
(What I couldn't accept the most)

223
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,900
(was that my dad)

224
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,870
(got together with my head teacher,)

225
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,990
(Ms. Fang.)

226
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,460
(You know what happened later.)

227
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,460
(I went to Mingli.)

228
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,790
(Then I went to university.)

229
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,630
(My dad
tried to contact me a few times,)

230
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,870
(but I never met him.)

231
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,350
(I never reply)

232
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,940
(to the text messages
he sent me either.)

233
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,180
Hello, welcome.

234
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,740
Why are you here?

235
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,870
I have an art exhibition here.

236
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,270
So I stopped by to see you.

237
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,270
Let me buy you coffee.

238
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,310
Why didn't you use
the money I gave you?

239
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,390
I think I'm doing pretty good.

240
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,740
I make my own living.

241
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,740
Didn't I say

242
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,180
I don't need you?

243
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,830
Why don't you understand it yet?

244
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,630
The fact that you are my daughter

245
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,140
can never be changed.

246
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,630
Many years have passed.

247
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,980
Shouldn't I move on?

248
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,270
Shouldn't I have my own life?

249
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,660
I beg you. Don't hate me.

250
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,350
You haven't changed

251
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,070
in all these years.

252
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,390
You're lenient with yourself
and strict with others.

253
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,070
You have the right to choose your life.

254
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,030
I have the right

255
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,870
to choose my life too.

256
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,550
I hope you don't exist in my life.

257
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,590
Please don't bother me anymore.

258
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,660
Do you get what I mean?

259
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,790
If I knew

260
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,790
that was the last time
I would see him,

261
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,070
I wouldn't have been so harsh.

262
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,110
I think my dad probably hates me.

263
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,180
Why do you say so?

264
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,350
If he didn't hate me,

265
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,790
why didn't he tell me

266
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,180
he was sick?

267
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,740
Why didn't he let me see him one last time?

268
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,630
No matter

269
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,350
what the relationship between us
was like,

270
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,270
I felt guilty

271
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,790
for not saying goodbye to him properly.

272
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,590
It's my regret.

273
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,900
Mr. Shen

274
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,420
might not be a good husband

275
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,550
or a good father,

276
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,460
but I think

277
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,700
you don't have to hate him that much.

278
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,940
After all, as an adult,

279
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,790
he does have the right
to choose his own life.

280
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,550
I think

281
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,460
it's time to let go of your hatred.

282
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,220
Whether I let it go

283
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,660
or hate him

284
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,900
doesn't matter anymore.

285
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,110
I don't have a chance anymore.

286
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,350
You actually have one more chance.

287
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,660
Want to hear it?

288
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,140
We went over the procedures
for the farewell ceremony today.

289
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,140
Before your dad died,
he specifically asked

290
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,980
that you

291
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,590
be the speaker at his farewell ceremony.

292
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,790
Don't you have a lot of things
you want to say to him?

293
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,180
This is a good opportunity

294
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,900
to tell him.

295
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,270
I'm sure

296
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,070
he can hear it from up there.

297
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,500
Will you do it?

298
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,350
Hello, this is Mr. Shen's portfolio.

299
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,590
Hello, Mr. Shen's portfolio.

300
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,220
Have a look.

301
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,270
Hello, Mr. Shen's portfolio.

302
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:30,830
Have a look.

303
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,870
Mr. Shen's portfolio.

304
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:37,950
Okay.

305
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,630
Why are you standing there?
Continue distributing.

306
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,110
Who's that woman?

307
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,270
How come I haven't seen this relative
in Xingruo's family before?

308
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
She's Mr. Shen's girlfriend.

309
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,630
She looks about our age.

310
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,460
Are you sure?

311
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,630
I'm sure.

312
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,270
We checked out the venue
with them yesterday.

313
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,310
Well... Mr. Shen is quite capable.

314
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,550
No wonder Xingruo
doesn't get along with him.

315
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,070
Look, there are so many cameras
at the funeral.

316
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,110
Gosh. You don't say.

317
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,700
She brought her own cameras,
saying she was going to film everything

318
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,550
and rewatch it at home.

319
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,350
Isn't that...

320
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,630
Rewatch it?

321
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,550
Who is it for?

322
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,980
Who would rewatch funerals?

323
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
It's kind of scary.

324
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,550
I wouldn't do this if I wasn't paid.

325
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,790
It's a pity for Guangyao.

326
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,980
I thought he was working on something
these past two years.

327
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,830
I didn't expect news like this.

328
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,500
Yeah.

329
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,870
Where have you been?
Why are you so late?

330
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,110
There's something

331
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,900
I think I should talk to you about.

332
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,110
What is it?

333
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,310
Hello.

334
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,870
Are you Mr. Shen Guangyao's daughter?

335
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,460
Yes.

336
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,310
The second part of the farewell ceremony

337
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,350
is the speech.

338
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,700
Get prepared for it.

339
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,630
Thank you.

340
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,110
Are you ready for your speech?

341
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,110
I'm ready.

342
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,110
After you talked to me that night,

343
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,500
I thought a lot about it.

344
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,420
I

345
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,070
finally have the courage to say it now.

346
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,900
I'm tired

347
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,870
harboring all this resentment

348
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,740
for so many years.

349
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,110
It's time to let it all go.

350
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,980
Lu Xingyan.

351
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,830
Thank you for giving me the courage

352
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,460
to say all these.

353
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,690
Speaking of which,

354
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,700
what did you want to tell me just now?

355
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,310
I wanted to say

356
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,740
if...

357
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,700
If your dad were still alive,

358
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,310
would you be willing to do this too?

359
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,940
I know you're trying to comfort me

360
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,310
that the dead can't be resurrected.

361
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,870
I think

362
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,140
it's not too late for me to do this now.

363
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,270
Dear guests,

364
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,270
ladies and gentlemen.

365
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,980
It is with deep sorrow
that we gather here

366
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,390
today

367
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,140
to bid farewell
to Mr. Shen Guangyao together.

368
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,900
Mr. Shen Guangyao was born in 1970.

369
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,740
In 1990,

370
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,460
he began studying
at the Art Students League of New York.

371
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,500
He started creating artworks in 1993.

372
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,310
In 1995,

373
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,940
he held
his first art exhibition in New York.

374
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,940
Mr. Shen Guangyao

375
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,870
was deeply influenced

376
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,370
by Jackson Pollock's action painting

377
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,030
and incorporated
his artistic characteristics

378
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,310
into his own creations.

379
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,350
His works use bold colors

380
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,790
and are good at describing
the emotions of a certain moment.

381
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,180
They have distinct
abstract expressionist characteristics.

382
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,030
Next,we'll move on
to his family members' speeches.

383
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,140
Let's welcome
Mr. Shen Guangyao's daughter,

384
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,900
Ms. Shen Xingruo.

385
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
My father

386
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,900
is an outstanding artist.

387
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,740
His artistic achievements
are remarkable.

388
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,420
I believe everyone here knows.

389
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,420
As his daughter,

390
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,980
I want to say a few words

391
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,070
to my father here today.

392
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,700
Actually, before today,

393
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,740
I didn't get along with my father.

394
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,460
We haven't contacted each other

395
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
for many years.

396
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,870
I always thought

397
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,900
that our bond

398
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,140
could be so weak

399
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,460
that it could be ignored.

400
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,630
But the moment I knew he was dead,

401
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,550
I suddenly realized

402
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,420
that the two of us
are tightly bound together

403
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,830
in the depths of our souls.

404
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,940
We have very similar personalities

405
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,790
and ways of doing things.

406
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,110
Whether I'll admit it,

407
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,270
they all left deep marks

408
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,030
on me.

409
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,590
My father once said something to me.

410
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,740
He said

411
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,220
I'm his daughter.

412
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,790
This is a fact
that can never be changed.

413
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,790
I was very repelled
by this sentence at that time.

414
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,980
It's only now

415
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,630
that I understand
the meaning of this statement.

416
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,220
I thank my father

417
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,070
for giving me life.

418
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,900
All the right and wrong

419
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,830
have vanished.

420
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,140
I hope

421
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,180
he can find eternal peace here.

422
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,630
Good!

423
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,940
What's going on?

424
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,980
Shen Guangyao?

425
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,350
Xingruo, well said!

426
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,740
Isn't he dead?

427
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,730
- Who's this old man?
- What's going on?

428
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,110
What's going on?

429
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,420
I don't know.

430
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,940
My daughter.

431
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,140
Mr. Shen?

432
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,590
Isn't he...

433
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,740
What's going on?

434
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,590
Shut up.

435
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,500
You're all here.

436
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,980
I was able

437
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,220
to meet so many old friends in one day.

438
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,870
I didn't hold this ceremony in vain.

439
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,700
I always wondered

440
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,740
what are people's comments about me

441
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,420
if I left this world one day,

442
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,660
so I held this farewell ceremony

443
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,180
to hear what everyone have to say.

444
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,310
I was supposed
to make a grand entrance

445
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,590
at the end of this farewell ceremony.

446
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,030
But I was particularly moved

447
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,590
by what my daughter said just now.

448
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,460
So I couldn't control myself

449
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,660
and showed up earlier.

450
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,830
I'm thankful for my daughter.

451
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,030
She

452
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,870
gave today's farewell ceremony

453
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,420
a new meaning.

454
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,460
I'm also very happy

455
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,460
that she can let go
of her previous resentment

456
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,940
and give me a brief new life

457
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,980
in the last stage of my life.

458
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,630
Xingruo.

459
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,660
Thank you.

460
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,070
I would also like to thank

461
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,220
the owner of this resort,

462
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,140
who is also my daughter's boyfriend,

463
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,030
Lu Xingyan.

464
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,310
He helped me

465
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,220
with the whole ceremony.

466
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,110
Most importantly, I want to thank him

467
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,900
for creating such a rare opportunity

468
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,350
for me and my daughter

469
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,140
and gave me no regrets

470
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,830
in the last stage of my life.

471
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,550
- Good!
- Good!

472
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,420
Amazing. How amazing.

473
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,940
Xingruo, let me explain.

474
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,900
You already knew, didn't you?

475
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,870
I wanted to tell you this just now,

476
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,870
but I didn't have time.

477
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,900
Is something wrong with you?

478
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,830
Don't follow me.

479
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,030
Xingruo!

480
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,390
Xingruo!

481
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,630
Xingruo.

482
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,740
Don't you have something to tell me?

483
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,270
I already said

484
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,830
what I wanted to say on stage!

485
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,590
I know

486
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,310
I'm wrong for lying to you,

487
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,500
but

488
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,460
I've been thinking about you
all these years.

489
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,070
This is the only way
for me to get close to you.

490
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,740
You're really eloquent.

491
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,110
A leopard never changes its spots.

492
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,270
You made

493
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,940
habitual lying so high-sounding.

494
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,500
Ms. Fang?

495
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,220
What are you doing here?

496
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,220
We're husband and wife after all.

497
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,070
You're dead.

498
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,110
I should come over
to pay my respects, right?

499
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,460
I've told you clearly

500
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,550
that I don't love you anymore.

501
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,660
It's over between us.

502
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,590
Why do you keep pestering me?

503
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,460
You were sick for years.

504
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,500
I did so many things for you.

505
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,630
I even lost my job.

506
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,550
When I took care of you,

507
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,830
why didn't you say
you don't love me anymore?

508
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,980
Now great.

509
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,560
You said you're going abroad
for medical treatment,

510
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,870
but you found someone new
in half a year.

511
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,630
Is your love that cheap?

512
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,870
I'm your wife.

513
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,310
Can you take some responsibility?

514
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,310
We're in public.

515
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,270
Can you shut up?

516
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,350
Why should I shut up?

517
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,940
Which part of what I said isn't true?

518
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,740
Is this your new lover?

519
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,740
I would like to see

520
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,310
your rapid yet sincere love today.

521
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,140
Shut up!

522
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,270
You're a young lady.

523
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,500
You can do anything you want,

524
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,590
yet you did such a nasty thing.

525
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,180
Don't listen to her.

526
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,310
Who are you calling nasty?

527
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,630
What are you talking about?

528
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,110
You two have broken up.

529
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,460
Guangyao and I are true love.

530
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,390
What's wrong with that?

531
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,110
When Shen Guangyao was dating,

532
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,460
you weren't born yet.

533
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,900
How much true love did he give you?

534
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,180
Two minutes or three minutes?

535
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,700
Shut up!

536
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,660
Aren't you just after money?

537
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,940
I'll kill you!

538
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,500
Chen Fei!

539
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Madams, calm down!

540
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Who are you calling Madam?

541
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,140
Miss, calm down.

542
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
- Enough.
- Calm down.

543
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,420
- Stop fighting. Don't use violence.
- Who are you calling Madam?

544
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,550
Miss.

545
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,400
- Calm down.
- Let go!

546
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,700
- Enough.
- Miss, calm down.

547
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,940
Madam, Miss.

548
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,130
(Outpatient Clinic,
Xingcheng People's Hospital)

549
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,030
You're awake.

550
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,980
How do you feel? Are you okay?

551
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,980
Drink some water.

552
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,110
How did I get here?

553
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,150
This afternoon,

554
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,020
Chen Fei accidentally hit you.

555
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,500
But don't worry.

556
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,390
The doctor said you're fine.

557
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,520
You just need to stay in the hospital
for three days.

558
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
I'm sorry.

559
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,620
It's all my fault today.

560
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,580
I really shouldn't have hidden
your dad's stuff from you.

561
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,190
When did you

562
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,100
find out that my dad's alive?

563
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,390
This morning.

564
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,350
I was checking out the setup

565
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,900
and I ran into him.

566
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,940
He said he wanted to see for himself
the ceremony's setup.

567
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,020
I was also shocked.

568
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,830
Mr. Shen, I really can't help you.

569
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,790
I can't lie to her.

570
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,230
I know what you're worried about.

571
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,670
I beg you.

572
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,620
My health

573
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,190
is getting worse day by day.

574
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,310
I don't know how many more times
I can meet Xingruo.

575
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,230
If I had any other ideas,

576
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,420
I wouldn't come to you today.

577
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,620
I only have one daughter.

578
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,790
I need this chance.

579
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,150
So you knew everything

580
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,350
and teamed up with him to deceive me.

581
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,830
When you saw me
saying those words of gratitude on stage,

582
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,310
did you feel a sense of accomplishment,

583
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,020
Lu Xingyan?

584
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,270
No, of course not.

585
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,540
You told me so much last night.

586
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,830
I thought you
wanted to make up with him,

587
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,710
so I thought it's a good opportunity.

588
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,670
Why do you think
I want to make up with him?

589
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,460
Why do you think
this is a good opportunity?

590
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,670
Why did you make decisions for me?

591
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,270
Sorry.

592
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,060
Calm down.

593
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,390
I was presumptuous.

594
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,870
But I think

595
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,670
as adults,

596
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,980
when love vanishes

597
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,940
and when two people

598
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,350
can't get along anymore,

599
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,580
separating

600
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,420
isn't a bad decision.

601
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,230
If you bind two people

602
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,390
who don't love each other,

603
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,750
it's a form of torture for them.

604
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,390
Just because your dad
stopped loving your mom,

605
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,100
don't hate him because you think

606
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
he's a bad person.

607
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,620
It's torture for you too.

608
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,710
I don't want it to trap you.

609
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,150
Lu Xingyan.

610
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,230
If you don't want me to hate him,

611
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,580
over his dead body.

612
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,460
Why?

613
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,750
Why are you so stubborn?

614
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,310
Because my mom didn't die of sickness.

615
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,150
She was killed.

616
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,670
She was killed my dad.

617
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,390
Are you satisfied with this answer?

618
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,540
Shen Guangyao

619
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,940
is a murderer.

620
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,930
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

621
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,690
Why did you leave Shen Xingruo's mom?

622
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:42,490
(Why did you leave Shen Xingruo's mom?)
