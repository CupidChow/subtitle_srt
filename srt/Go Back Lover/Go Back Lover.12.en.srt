(Lu Xingyan)
(Where are you?)

(Shen Xingruo)
(I'm lying down in my bedroom.)

6
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,730
(What's the matter?)

7
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,239
(Lu Xingyan)
(Nothing.)

8
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,740
(I have a surprise for you.)

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,580
♪For you to say yes♪

11
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,830
♪For the next time♪

12
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,780
This girl is so aggressive.

13
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,780
Yes.

14
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,830
No man should be able
to stand this kind of aggression.

15
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,500
Other guys would be envious.

16
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,860
Lu Xingyan from Chinese Language
and Literature, Class 3,

17
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,830
I like you!

18
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,860
Will you be my boyfriend?

19
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,430
(Lu Xingyan)
(Your surprise has arrived downstairs.)

20
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,710
(Come down and collect it.)

21
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,540
Lu Xingyan,

22
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,300
I really like you!

23
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,830
Come down and meet me!

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,670
What is this?

25
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,510
I was thinking of coming
to visit someone's school,

26
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,710
but then I realised

27
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,140
I didn't have to.

28
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,110
You're enjoying yourself
pretty well at school.

29
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,180
No.

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,950
I know nothing about it.

31
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,230
This really has nothing
to do with me.

32
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,180
Look where I am now.

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,020
What are you doing at my school?

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,950
To surprise you, of course.

35
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,580
I didn't expect us
to be so in tune with each other.

36
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,670
You can still laugh out loud now?

37
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,020
Why can't I?

38
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,390
Shen Xingruo,

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,340
you're jealous.

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,230
I'm not jealous because of you.

41
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,060
Don't talk nonsense.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,230
It's no use denying it.

43
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,270
You're jealous.

44
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,740
I notice

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,180
you're kind of cute
when you're jealous.

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,170
=Episode 12=

47
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,690

I just want to be with you.)

(Year 2024, Meeting Room)

49
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,990
He Ming,

50
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,990
are you sure you don't want
to come over and take a look?

51
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,180
You're a scenarist.

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,580
Wait a minute.

53
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,580
This CCTV of the walkway

54
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,620
seems to have captured
one of the guest rooms.

55
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,020
I don't think this room
was occupied last night.

56
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,270
What guest room?

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,130
It's a bad choice of setting.

58
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,710
We're deeply bonded.

59
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,230
The most important place
in the hotel is not even chosen.

60
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:10,990
What's going on?

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,180
Wait,

62
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,180
Mr. Lu.

63
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,950
What exactly is this most special place

64
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,390
you're talking about?

65
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,590
That place

66
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,740
is harder to describe.

67
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,430
We'll have to take a look over there.

68
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,180
It's better to do it now.

69
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,260
We'll get on this right away.

70
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,910
Sure, no problem.

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,700
He Ming, put off looking at the materials
for a while.

72
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,590
Let's go with Mr. Lu now. Okay?

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,830
- Let's go.
- Come on.

74
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,260
Xingruo,

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,600
aren't you coming with us?

76
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,860
Shall I go?

77
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,300
- Of course.
- You can't go.

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,430
As the producer of the show,

79
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,770
you've made a mistake in something
as important as setting selection.

80
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,550
I order you

81
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,790
to reflect on yourself

82
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,180
in this room.

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,350
I've sent them away.

84
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,930
How's it?

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,120
Have you found the footage?

86
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,820
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,820
This should be it.

88
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,150
Look.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,620
You're so aggressive.

90
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,350
Shut up.

91
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,380
Okay.

92
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,090
(Delete)

93
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,820
Right, where did you send them?

94
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,430
I feel sorry for them today,

95
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,380
so I decided to make it up to them.

96
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,430
Make it up to them?

97
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,110
Mr. Zhang,

98
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,300
why is Mr. Lu so strange?

99
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,230
I thought we wanted
to check out the setting.

100
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,860
Why did he send us here?

101
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,700
Mr. Lu said
this is the most important place.

102
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,260
Is their massage technique

103
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,110
the core secret of their hotel?

104
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,060
Forget it, let's feel it first,

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,300
and try to figure out
Mr. Lu's intention.

106
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,860
Thank you.

107
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,350
All right.

108
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,860
The immediate concern has been resolved.

109
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,990
So

110
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
shall we

111
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,700
think about us?

112
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,820
Do we

113
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,860
have a problem?

114
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Last night, we kind of cleared the air.

115
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,590
So our relationship...

116
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,820
I think

117
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,150
the two of us should reconsider

118
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,790
what we did yesterday.

119
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,639
Look.

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,430
We're both under a lot of pressure
at work,

121
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,100
so there's bound to be times when
our rationality goes out the window.

122
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,060
Last night, we were kind of

123
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,500
on an impulse.

124
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,110
What do you think, Mr. Lu?

125
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,110
What's that look on your face?

126
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,790
Last night, when you kissed me,
you were so impatient.

127
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,620
Now that you've deleted the footage
and the evidence is gone,

128
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,470
you've turned your back on me.

129
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,260
Shen Xingruo,

130
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,910
you can't be a bad girl.

131
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,380
So now,

132
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,110
shall we

133
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,060
redefine our relationship?

134
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,630
Am I your boyfriend now?

135
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,630
I'll think about it

136
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,870
when I get back.

137
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,730
When I've thought it over,

138
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,790
I'll tell you.

139
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
I'll wait for your reply.

140
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,430
Okay.

141
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,980
(Go Back Lover)

142
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,560
(The challenger's second date)

143
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,580
(Second Challenge Mission)
(is officially coming up.)

144
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,180
(Xingruo, Chen Zhu, Shi Qin, Jiajing)
(Based on the last voting result,)

145
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,820
(Xingyan, Chengzhou, Siyue, Yu Shi)
(the two who voted for each other)

146
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,980
(Zhai Jiajing, Lu Xingyan)
(will become each other's date.)

147
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,510
(Chen Zhu & Yu Si)
(Yu Si and Chen Zhu were put together.)

148
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,040
(Lu Xingyan & Zhai Jiajing)
(Zhai Jiajing and Lu Xingyan)

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,980
(Shen Xingruo, Xu Chengzhou)
(were put together.)

150
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,470
(Not getting chosen)
(Shen Xingruo and Xu Chengzhou)

151
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,700
(didn't get chosen.)

152
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,390
(They have the right to choose
whether or not to join them on a date.)

153
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,060
(This time,)

154
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,390
(what kind of chemistry)

155
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,460
(will there be between the guests?)

156
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,060
You scared me.

157
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,220
What are you nervous about?

158
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,930
What did you do last night?

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,839
I...

160
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,340
I went to the tea garden to hoe.

161
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Hoeing all night?

162
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,630
Pretty much.

163
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,790
I understand you're upset

164
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,700
about Shen Xingruo.

165
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,030
Women

166
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,100
are the most unfathomable creatures
in the world.

167
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,550
Are you worried about Chen Zhu dating

168
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,460
Yu Si?

169
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,090
That's what I'm here
to talk to you about.

170
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,820
After yesterday,

171
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,460
the more I thought about it,
the more I felt something was wrong.

172
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,790
I don't think they've had much contact.

173
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,510
Why is Chen Zhu suddenly so interested

174
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,670
in Yu Si?

175
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,030
Yu Si has a lot of tricks up his sleeve.

176
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,910
He's always on the prowl.

177
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,150
One minute he's a friend,

178
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,910
the next minute he's a roommate.

179
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,790
The other minute...

180
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,180
Enough. Say no more.

181
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,730
The more you talk,
the more scared I get.

182
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,630
Do you think they'll take advantage
of this opportunity

183
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,980
for chemistry?

184
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,390
I shouldn't be on their date, should I?

185
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,460
No, don't go.

186
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,550
Why?

187
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,930
He's got so many tricks up his sleeve.

188
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,060
If he sets you up,

189
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,150
you'll have no choice
but to live with it.

190
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,200
More talk, more mistakes.

191
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,460
Just don't go.

192
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,700
That way,

193
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,180
it won't seem like you two
have too many differences.

194
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,980
You've got a point there.

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,150
You're beating around the bush
to say I'm not good enough?

196
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,460
I didn't mean that.

197
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,060
I advise you

198
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,270
to look on the bright side of things.

199
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,550
You've been with Chen Zhu
for so many years.

200
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,980
It's obvious to everyone

201
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,580
how she is to you, isn't it?

202
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,790
That's true.

203
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,010
I've been with Chen Zhu
for so many years

204
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,430
and it's obvious to everyone

205
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,100
that she's chasing after me.

206
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,790
Therefore,

207
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,820
although Yu Si is really annoying,

208
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,130
I don't think there's anything going
on between them.

209
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,870
How could it be?

210
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,940
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

211
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,980
Why wouldn't I go?

212
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,980
Well,

213
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,180
aren't you afraid
that Xu Chengzhou will be upset?

214
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,550
You're a producer, aren't you?

215
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,510
Isn't this what you show crews

216
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,010
are most looking forward to happening?

217
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,180
Moreover,

218
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,390
pressure is the key to motivation.

219
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,940
After the last round of voting,

220
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,390
Xu Chengzhou really thinks he's

221
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,460
the most popular person in the universe.

222
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm taking this opportunity
to give him a reminder

223
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,580
so that he doesn't
have unrealistic fantasies

224
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,750
that I can't live without him.

225
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,270
You didn't come back last night.

226
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,460
I actually went

227
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,460
to discuss some work last night.

228
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,430
What kind of work has to be discussed
in the middle of the night?

229
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,060
An investor I've worked with before

230
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,820
approached me last night

231
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,550
and said he wanted to talk to me

232
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,100
about working on the next project.

233
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,220
What are you going to do?

234
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,790
I... The investor and I

235
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,180
hadn't been working

236
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,700
so well together before

237
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,430
so we had a brief chat

238
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,510
yesterday.

239
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,790
I haven't decided
if we're going to continue

240
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,030
to work together.

241
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
I'd advise you

242
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,790
to secure cooperation
before it's too late.

243
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,820
Or it's easy
for someone else to steal it.

244
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,980
You know Zhai Jiajing

245
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,390
is dating Lu Xingyan today, right?

246
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,390
What do these two things relate
to each other?

247
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,870
It doesn't relate.

248
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,430
Which of these two looks better?

249
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,930
This one.

250
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,980
Okay, I'll pick this one.

251
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,150
Do you doubt my aesthetics, Chen Zhu?

252
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,550
No.

253
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,390
I'm going out with Yu Si

254
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,910
just to piss off Xu Cheng Zhou.

255
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,670
I won't really hook up with him.

256
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,120
So why should I dress so nicely?

257
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,239
He Ming,

258
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
it's late now.

259
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
Isn't Xingruo coming?

260
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,150
Xingruo didn't get chosen

261
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,180
for this round of date.

262
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,300
Guests who are not chosen
are given the option to choose

263
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,130
whether or not they want
to go on a trio date.

264
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,270
Xingruo rejected.

265
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,100
So it's just

266
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,020
the two of them today.

267
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,030
The two of them

268
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,180
chatting here?

269
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,580
How boring would that be?

270
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,790
It's only interesting
if Xingruo is here.

271
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,180
But didn't we say that in the meeting?

272
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,790
We have to respect the guests' wishes.

273
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,870
The guests' wishes?

274
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,940
The guests' wishes

275
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,790
are not as important as the audience's.

276
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,180
How could she

277
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,670
not show up?

278
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,820
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

279
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,870
I have an idea for you.

280
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,839
Yes.

281
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,580
I know what you mean.

282
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,940
But our variety show is mainly

283
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,390
an objective record.

284
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,340
That's what idol dramas do

285
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,980
when you're trying to make a scene.

286
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,580
Actually, Jiao made this suggestion

287
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,030
for the sake of the show.

288
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,430
A lot of audiences
don't have the patience these days.

289
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,870
If you don't give them something
to be excited about,

290
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,060
the show won't succeed.

291
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,230
If it doesn't do well,
can it be profitable?

292
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,510
If it's not profitable,
how can we start the next show?

293
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,710
No.

294
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,580
Listen to me.

295
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,230
Xingruo,

296
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,910
are you afraid to go?

297
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,510
Are you avoiding Lu Xingyan?

298
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,550
Why should I avoid him?

299
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,150
I think you two are very, very strange.

300
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,890
Suddenly, you're exercising together.

301
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,750
Suddenly, you want to check out
the materials. Suddenly...

302
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,460
Will you stop speculating?

303
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,460
All right.

304
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,910
As your business partner,
I'm begging you, Producer Shen,

305
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,060
just join them.

306
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,100
Just go and guide the guests live

307
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,790
and create a chemistry
between the guests

308
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,980
to attract the audience.

309
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,870
Okay?

310
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,150
Our task today

311
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,580
is to draw a portrait

312
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,700
of the person you've drawn,

313
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,460
and draw a picture
of what he looks like in your mind.

314
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,790
Three of you, let's start
by drawing the envelopes.

315
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,630
(Lu Xingyan)
I got Lu Xingyan.

316
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,270
I got Lawyer Zhai.

317
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,010
(Zhai Jiajing)

318
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,430
(Shen Xingruo)
I got Shen Xingruo.

319
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,700
All right, let's start now.

320
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,130
Why do you keep looking at me?

321
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,630
How do you know I'm looking at you
if you don't look at me?

322
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,180
I'm going to draw you.
Of course I'm going to look at you.

323
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,180
Why are you two still always fighting

324
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,590
when you see each other
like in high school?

325
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,310
In fact, when I was in school,

326
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,830
I thought you two were a perfect match.

327
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,780
One is passionate

328
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,020
and the other is cold.

329
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,180
Your personalities
really complement each other.

330
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,780
That's why I thought it was a shame
when I found out

331
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,540
that you two had broken up.

332
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,980
Why don't you guys develop
your relationship again?

333
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,590
Yes.

334
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,940
Lawyer Zhai has a point.

335
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,540
Why do you think
we can't develop our relationship again?

336
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,830
I don't think the two of us

337
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,430
complement each other's personalities,

338
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,180
we're just not right for each other.

339
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,970
(Go on. Why are you
not right for each other?)

340
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,150
Maybe it's just
that we all have different expectations

341
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,180
of relationships.

342
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,220
What is your ideal relationship

343
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
like?

344
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,670
I want a relationship

345
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,940
that's relaxed and comfortable.

346
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,870
Nowadays, everyone is
under a lot of pressure at work.

347
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,150
When we're busy,

348
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,310
we do our own thing
and don't bother each other.

349
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,830
When we're off,

350
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,110
we can do things we both like.

351
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,220
This is the kind
of relationship I want.

352
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,830
I like the kind of
relationship that's stable.

353
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,630
It's important to me

354
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,800
how far two people have come.

355
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
I'm the kind of person

356
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,390
who likes to express
my love all the time.

357
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,230
If I can get a response
from the other person,

358
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,670
I think that's a very wonderful thing.

359
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,500
Unfortunately,

360
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,020
some people just don't like
that kind of love.

361
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,540
Xingruo, what do you think?

362
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,350
I think

363
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,460
you two are quite compatible.

364
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,220
Why don't you two try it out?

365
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,110
I'm curious, too.

366
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,110
We've known each other for years.

367
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,700
Why isn't there any chemistry?

368
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,700
Xingruo, how's it?

369
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,540
Am I good at creating puzzles
for the show?

370
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,500
I think it's the right idea

371
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,700
to have you on the show.

372
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,500
All right, I'm done.

373
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,670
Xingruo has always been

374
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,910
a very impressive person in my mind.

375
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,390
It's like there's a special kind
of magical power in her

376
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,870
that makes people
like her unconsciously.

377
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,910
So does Mr. Lu,

378
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,670
and so does Yu Si.

379
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,180
So I really think she's impressive.

380
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,230
Thank you.

381
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,430
I think you're really good at drawing.

382
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,940
This is my drawing.

383
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,030
Lawyer Zhai.

384
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,390
Which one is me?

385
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,460
This one.

386
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
This is my drawing
of you in a court case.

387
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,220
But

388
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,070
the proportions are all wrong.

389
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,310
The proportions are wrong?

390
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,310
It's very vivid.

391
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,500
Look.

392
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,540
Aren't the proportions wrong here?

393
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,600
Producer Shen, what do you think?

394
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,940
I think Lawyer Zhai is right.

395
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,670
You do have a problem

396
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,180
with the proportions of the characters.

397
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,630
Let her teach you how to do it,

398
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,910
and fix your drawing.

399
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,670
Actually, I was just babbling.

400
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,690
Let's see what you've got, Xingruo.

401
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,150
This is the Lu Xingyan I drew.

402
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,260
I got lost during the recording

403
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,180
of a show,

404
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,700
and he came to my rescue.

405
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,350
You're so good at drawing.

406
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,700
You must teach me sometime.

407
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,310
I'll sign up with Lu Xingyan.

408
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,590
How's it?

409
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,910
Do you want to join us
in our tuition class?

410
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,130
That depends on whether
Producer Shen is willing to teach me.

411
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,780
I'm very busy at work.

412
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,430
I don't think I'll have time.

413
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,220
You should learn from Lawyer Zhai.

414
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,630
You two have been in contact a lot,

415
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,980
so you'll learn faster.

416
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,940
Am I right?

417
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,830
I didn't expect you to come.

418
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,150
Zhang Xu asked me to come.

419
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,239
I see.

420
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,540
I thought

421
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,180
you had thought about our relationship.

422
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,940
After that day,

423
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,700
I've been thinking about it a lot.

424
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,070
Are you free tonight?

425
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,430
Let's have a chat.

426
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,220
I'm free, of course.

427
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,540
Ms. Xing, it's time for your shot.

428
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,900
Coming.

429
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
Well,

430
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,150
see you tonight.

431
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,940
See me tonight?

432
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,550
Hello.

433
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,460
Hi, this is for you.

434
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,460
Thank you. It's so beautiful.

435
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,530
Why didn't you say thank you
every time I gave you roses?

436
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,910
How did you know

437
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,980
I like champagne roses?

438
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,220
I went through your social media posts
before we went out.

439
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,940
I think you like this one.

440
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,670
If only Xu Chengzhou

441
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,460
was half as sweet as you.

442
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,980
He knows I like champagne roses,

443
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,180
but he always gives me
ordinary yellow roses.

444
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,940
Aren't all roses the same?

445
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,390
What's the difference?

446
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,910
Besides, if you like champagne roses,
just say so.

447
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,500
Look, I wrote
that I love champagne roses

448
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,630
in my social media posts.

449
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,670
Maybe he just doesn't care

450
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,780
what I wrote.

451
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,590
(Chen Zhu: I like champagne roses.)

452
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,700
(I like champagne roses.)
Let's go in first.

453
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,700
It's a nice place.

454
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,180
You guys are really good
at choosing these.

455
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,530
Let me take some pictures first.

456
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,070
What's wrong?

457
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,130
Give me your phone
and I'll take a picture of you.

458
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,260
It's very nice here.

459
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,940
Well, I'll come closer.

460
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,630
Don't move.

461
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,990
All right.

462
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,030
Have a look.

463
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,150
Let me see.

464
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,500
Should it be retouched?

465
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,590
In all the years I've been
taking pictures of Chen Zhu,

466
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,230
I've never taken one
that she was happy with.

467
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,670
Let's see how she'll scold you.

468
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,940
This is good.

469
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,910
The background is...

470
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,180
It's all right. It can be retouched.

471
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,700
Is that so?

472
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,430
- Is the lighting okay?
- This one's good, too.

473
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,980
No, Mr. Yu,
you're a good photographer.

474
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,910
You're something.

475
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,420
Mostly... Mostly because you're pretty.

476
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:12,940
What's going on?

477
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,220
How good of pictures can he take?

478
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,910
Let me tell you.

479
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,020
Whenever Xu Chengzhou
takes pictures of me,

480
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,940
he just closes his eyes

481
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,870
and presses the button,

482
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,530
he doesn't care
if the pictures are good or not.

483
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,540
Sometimes,

484
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,830
I really don't want
to get angry with him.

485
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,940
But who wouldn't be angry

486
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,220
with that kind of attitude?

487
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,220
I think I know what you mean.

488
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,310
You're feeling underappreciated.

489
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,070
Yes.

490
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,350
Fine, let's not talk about him.

491
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,700
Let's do some pottery first.

492
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,310
Fine, do pottery.

493
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,220
If you dirty Chen Zhu's clothes,

494
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,230
I'll see how she'll scold you
and how it will end.

495
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,030
Let's go.

496
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,110
Actually, it's fine
if you don't do it.

497
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,590
What's wrong?

498
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,460
You are dressed so nicely today.

499
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,350
If you do pottery,

500
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,220
your clothes will get dirty.

501
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,940
And I know my photography skills

502
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,780
aren't up to snuff.

503
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,830
Why don't you sit here and take a break
and retouch the pictures?

504
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,910
But won't you be bored

505
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,070
if I just retouch the pictures there?

506
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,870
No.

507
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,220
I couldn't be happier

508
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,670
to be around a beautiful woman.

509
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,430
Take a break.

510
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,150
Is Yu Si a fortune teller?

511
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,220
How can he get past all the traps
so easily?

512
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,230
What's wrong with you?

513
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,910
Nothing.

514
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,630
I was just thinking

515
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,980
if only Xu Chengzhou could be as gentle
and considerate as you.

516
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,670
We've been together all these years

517
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,070
and we've always fought.

518
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,540
He's really like an immature little boy.

519
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,630
Isn't that what you like

520
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,870
about him?

521
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,630
Yes.

522
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,740
I used to,

523
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,830
but

524
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,830
I can't tell now.

525
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,910
Maybe I want different things

526
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,590
at different ages.

527
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,870
Before, I really liked his

528
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,220
spunky, cheerful

529
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,740
reckless and goofy personality.

530
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,350
But now, we've all grown up.

531
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,150
Sometimes,

532
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,110
I really wish he could be gentler,

533
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,980
more considerate

534
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,350
or more understanding.

535
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,700
But he never seems

536
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,630
to want to change.

537
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,430
What are you going to do?

538
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,310
I don't know.

539
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,740
In fact, after the divorce ceremony,

540
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,910
I've been wondering

541
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,910
if we're really not right
for each other.

542
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,020
Maybe a separation would be

543
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,540
a better outcome for both of us.

544
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,740
Wait.

545
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,390
Sorry about today.

546
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,220
It was supposed to be a good date,

547
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,120
but you've been listening
to me complain.

548
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,460
It's all right.

549
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,180
Anyway,

550
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,220
I have a little bit of an opinion

551
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,910
about what you told me today.

552
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,110
Can I tell you about it?

553
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,940
Actually, I think deep down

554
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,630
you still like Xu Chengzhou.

555
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,500
The reason you complain
so much about him

556
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,350
is because you expect
just as much from him.

557
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,670
You want to be with him for a long time,

558
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,260
that's why you expect
so much from him, isn't it?

559
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,980
In fact, we often

560
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,500
save our harshest side

561
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,980
for those closest to us.

562
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,780
But that's not a very good choice.

563
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,310
If you still like him

564
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,220
and want him to change,

565
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,830
I suggest you find a chance

566
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,430
to tell him what's in your mind
in person

567
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,780
so that your relationship can last.

568
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,370
(Guest, Xu Chengzhou)

569
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,940
You're supposed to knock
before entering someone's room.

570
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,150
You don't seem to want to see me.

571
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,150
No.

572
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,980
I thought you'd be tired
from your afternoon date

573
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,590
with Yu Si,

574
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,030
and I didn't think you'd come to see me.

575
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,390
I want to talk to you.

576
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,070
Go ahead.

577
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,910
The show's been on for a while.

578
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,430
I think we should reconsider

579
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,980
the relationship between the two of us.

580
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,220
Over the years,

581
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,830
we've all grown up.

582
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,220
I think it's time
to change the way we get along.

583
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,670
You want to break up with me?

584
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,540
Why would you suddenly think of that?

585
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,870
I went to your date
with Yu Si this afternoon.

586
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,180
I heard everything you two said.

587
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,110
You're right.

588
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,150
We've all grown up

589
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,220
and many things have changed.

590
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,780
I've felt the same way

591
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,740
since our divorce.

592
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,940
Then?

593
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,590
Not only are you tired, I'm tired.

594
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
I've had enough

595
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,150
of your princess tantrums,

596
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,980
I've had enough
of apologizing over and over again,

597
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,980
I've had enough of trying to
figure out what you're really thinking.

598
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,590
I had tried to understand you

599
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,740
in all the years we've been together,

600
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,590
but all I get in return
is a beating or a scolding.

601
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,910
I really don't know what to do.

602
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,070
You were so right this afternoon.

603
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,830
People may never change.

604
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,210
I'm just a straightforward guy.

605
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,460
I'll never be

606
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,870
as sweet and considerate as Yu Si.

607
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,870
That's the size of my head.

608
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,310
I can't think of anything else.

609
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,870
You won't be happy

610
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,350
with anything I do anyway.

611
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,930
The cooling-off period for our divorce
is coming to an end anyway.

612
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,530
The divorce appointment at the Civil
Affairs Bureau is in the next few days.

613
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,830
Take the time

614
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,830
to get the divorce certificate.

615
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,180
Are you sure?

616
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,310
Isn't that why you came to see me?

617
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,790
Yes.

618
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,870
That's what this is about.

619
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,500
I got it.

620
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,590
I won't bother you.

621
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,510
Xingruo.

622
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,260
Zhu.

623
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,940
So

624
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,590
this time, you two are really...

625
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,390
It's really over this time.

626
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,030
Zhu,

627
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,180
don't get too upset.

628
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,630
You guys even went through
a divorce ceremony before

629
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,360
and you're still not
completely separated.

630
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,740
Yes.

631
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
To find out

632
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,180
what's in Xu Chengzhou's mind

633
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,590
through this show.

634
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,630
I didn't expect it to work so well.

635
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,430
I really didn't expect him

636
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,630
to have the guts to say those things

637
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,670
to my face.

638
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,310
Don't think like that.

639
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,870
It's not a bad thing

640
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,430
to be able to express

641
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,020
such thoughts sometimes.

642
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,430
Of course it's good.

643
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,830
From now on,

644
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,230
he won't have to put up
with my bad temper,

645
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,270
and I won't have
to wait for him to grow up.

646
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,790
We had better break up.

647
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,100
We won't have to torture
each other anymore.

648
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,750
So,

649
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,100
look, I'm totally fine.

650
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,060
I'm clear-headed.

651
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,390
All right.

652
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,910
Don't worry about me.

653
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,750
Enjoy your drinks. I'm going to help.

654
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,910
Xingruo,

655
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,310
do you think she meant what she said?

656
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,460
I hope she did.

657
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,430
(Li Xingyan: Sun Hotel)

658
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,340
(I'll wait for you here.)

659
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,620
I've got something to do.

660
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,940
I have to go now.

661
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,390
It's late

662
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,460
and you still have to work?

663
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,660
The investor from before

664
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,060
wants to have a meeting with me tonight.

665
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,100
Xingruo,

666
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,910
you work so late every day.

667
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,870
Aren't you tired?

668
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,910
You must take care of yourself.

669
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,310
Don't worry.

670
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,500
I'm fine.

671
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,310
I'll get going now.

672
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,580
Take care of Chen Zhu. Bye.

673
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,660
Bye.

674
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,910
How did you decorate the room like that?

675
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,310
It's still a bit rushed.

676
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,830
Didn't you tell me

677
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,270
we'd...

678
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,660
We'd

679
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,830
have a chat.

680
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,580
When I say a chat,

681
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,310
I mean a serious chat.

682
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,500
A chat, yes.

683
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,930
We're going to have a chat.

684
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,230
I thought...

685
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,460
I thought you were going to tell me

686
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,790
that you had figured out
what our relationship was.

687
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,830
We were both

688
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,790
very compatible before last night.

689
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,270
But you know

690
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,620
I can't give you

691
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,660
what you want.

692
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,830
So

693
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,750
staying where we are

694
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,910
is what's best for us.

695
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,310
Lu Xingyan,

696
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,460
will you stay where you are with me?

697
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,140
I do.

I don't think any of those things
are as important as you.

701

As long as you're happy,

734
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,810
Then why did you advise Chen Zhu

735
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,450
to go for Xu Chengzhou?

736
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,890
There are a lot of girls in this world

737
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,610
who deserve to be liked,

738
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,850
but I can't have them all.

739
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,490
And she's obviously

740
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,150
in the throes
of a relationship right now.

741
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,650
I never take advantage
of people at this time.

742
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,970
Do you like Lu Xingyan?

743
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,090
(Do you like Lu Xingyan?)

744
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,110
Mr Lu and I have been
working together for years,

745
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,250
I'm really interested in him.

746
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,250
But unfortunately,

747
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,810
he's not my final destination.

748
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,200
