=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,490
(Summer Break of Freshman Year,
July 2014)

4
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,470
What are you doing?

5
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,830
It's finally summer break.

6
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,660
I can hold my girlfriend to sleep now.

7
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,110
Listen,

8
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,500
you better restrain yourself.

9
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,190
Aunt Pei asked me

10
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:30,990
if you're in a relationship today.

11
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,830
She asked you that?

12
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,740
Why is she asking this suddenly?

13
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,190
How would I know?

14
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,780
I think we need to find a time

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,910
to clarify to her.

16
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,070
It's not that I don't want to tell her,

17
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,470
the thing is, if we do that,

18
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,830
she won't stop nagging.

19
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,500
Come to me when you think this through.

20
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,020
Get out, now.

21
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,070
I won't go.

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,830
Get out.

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,470
Ruo, can you take a look at this?

24
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,830
Is she not in here?

25
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,270
I'll come back later.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,580
Are you happy now?

27
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,580
She knows everything now.

28
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,300
Get out.

29
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,390
Stop pushing me.

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,900
Fine, I'll go.

31
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,020
I'm going to explain to her.

32
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,550
Ouch.

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,580
Do you know pain?

34
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,230
This is not a dream.

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,670
What were you doing in her room?

36
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,510
Behaving like a hooligan?

37
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,270
What hooligan?

38
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,039
We

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,430
are in a relationship.

40
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,020
A relationship?

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,530
You

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,900
and Ruo?

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,180
Yes.

44
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,230
When did it happen?

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,270
We've been together for a while.

46
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,670
We wanted to tell you, but...

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,550
Well done.

48
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,300
This is the best thing you've done

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,180
since your birth.

50
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,140
Come on, tell me everything.

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,510
When did it start?

52
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,950
How did you two get together?

53
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,510
What stage are you in now?

54
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,710
Tell me now.

55
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:34,770
=Episode 17=
(Love is like an uncontrollable sneeze.)

56
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,450
(Year 2024)

57
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,530
(Shi Qin)

58
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,390
You're back.

59
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,390
I didn't reply to your message
fast enough today,

60
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,340
are you upset?

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,710
It's fine.

62
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,550
Stop eating instant noodles.

63
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,620
I haven't eaten either.

64
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,670
I'll make noodles so we can share,

65
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,460
just like last time.

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,430
No, thanks.

67
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,710
Shi Qin?

68
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,060
Shi Qin?

69
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,990
You mean you sent He Siyue
a text on WeChat

70
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,590
and you noticed he read it
without sending a reply

71
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,030
across the road

72
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,230
and the reason is
that he is with Zhai Jiajing?

73
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
He Siyue, what a scumbag.

74
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,110
I'll question him now.

75
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,300
- What is going on?
- Don't be impulsive.

76
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,380
Don't be impulsive.

77
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,550
How can I not?

78
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,940
Listen to Qin.

79
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,550
How can he do this?

80
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,940
He has demonstrated his love to her
like crazy on the show,

81
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,740
yet he is dating Zhai Jiajing
in secret behind the scenes?

82
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,940
What a two-faced scumbag!

83
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,670
I have to seek justice for you today.

84
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,820
Come back, you!

85
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,860
Wait a second.

86
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,060
Calm down.

87
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,430
We are both Qin's best friends.

88
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,350
If we just rush out and question him

89
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,820
but it turns out to be
a misunderstanding,

90
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,670
it will make things difficult for Qin
for both sides.

91
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,150
Besides, they finally got together
after so many hardships,

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,300
if we make a fuss,

93
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,620
how are they going
to meet each other again in the future?

94
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,940
What should we do?

95
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,820
We can't just let him off the hook.

96
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,180
We won't question him,

97
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,740
but

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,300
we can get Xu Chengzhou
and Lu Xingyan do it.

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,030
We get them to meet He Siyue

100
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,500
to have a chat,

101
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,380
they can probe him

102
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,150
to find out what's going on
with him and Zhai Jiajing.

103
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,230
I second this.

104
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,820
Yue, having a jog?

105
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,910
Why are you up so early?

106
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,380
My eyes hurt from playing games all day.

107
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,300
I wanted to take a breath of fresh air.

108
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,820
And elevate our friendship.

109
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,030
The three of us?
Elevating our friendship?

110
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,470
We realise we don't know you
well enough,

111
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,150
we neglected our duty as friends.

112
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,990
What specifically do you mean?

113
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,110
For example, what did you do last night?

114
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,260
Who were you with?

115
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,860
Why are you asking this?

116
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,620
Answer the questions first.

117
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,790
Sorry,

118
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,110
I don't want to lie,

119
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,990
I really can't answer.

120
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,860
If there's nothing else,

121
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,300
I should go.

122
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,180
Wait.

123
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,060
We have known each other
for so many years.

124
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,820
Is there something
you are hiding from us?

125
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,579
Exactly.

126
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,470
What did you do last night?

127
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,150
Were you with Zhai Jiajing?

128
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,700
How do you know
that I was with her yesterday?

129
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,620
Don't reflect the question.

130
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,230
Be honest, what did you do last night?

131
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,030
Sorry,

132
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,380
I can't say.

133
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,370
I really can't.

134
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,700
Why not?

135
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,430
He doesn't need to answer,

136
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,860
I'll do it for him.

137
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,990
He Siyue is a complete scumbag.

138
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,500
He was acting mysterious

139
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
and hesitant.

140
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,060
He must have some ulterior secret

141
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,060
with Zhai Jiajing.

142
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,550
Do you think

143
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,230
there could be some unspeakable reason
behind this?

144
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,740
Unspeakable reason?

145
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,030
Qin,

146
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,180
are you listening to yourself?

147
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,940
Give me an example
of an unspeakable reason now.

148
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,620
I want to know. Come on.

149
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,860
Qin,

150
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,820
can you stop lying to yourself?

151
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,470
I made this gin and tonic just for you.

152
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,500
It appears colourless,

153
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,940
but it actually has
very high alcohol content,

154
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,910
it makes you tipsy easily.

155
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,110
I gave it a nice name,

156
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,590
"Tears of A Scumbag".

157
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,500
It's for you.

158
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,180
"Tears of A Scumbag"?

159
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,030
Why are you introducing drinks?

160
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,380
This drink

161
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,790
resembles He Siyue.

162
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,500
Simple and harmless in appearance,

163
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,990
but actually very profound.

164
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,350
Finish it.

165
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,430
Time to wake up.

166
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,430
What does this mean?

167
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,470
It's an illustration that profound men

168
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,790
are not suitable for you at all.

169
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,500
Have some water.

170
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,550
He's actually really good to me.

171
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,670
Besides, I can really sense

172
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,940
his concern for my well-being.

173
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,220
It's just that I can't understand

174
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,510
that his concern for me

175
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,940
stems from the show's requirement

176
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,580
or am I taking his chivalry

177
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,460
as fondness by mistake.

178
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,220
Although he never expresses

179
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,180
his feelings,

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,820
I can see it in his eyes.

181
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,580
I do think

182
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,270
He Siyue likes Qin quite a lot.

183
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,130
Otherwise,

184
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,750
why would he be so nice to her
on the program?

185
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,060
Shen Xingruo, how can you say that?

186
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,220
You are totally speaking for him.

187
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,630
No, I just think there's something off
about this.

188
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,100
If He Siyue really likes Zhai Jiajing,

189
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,030
why didn't he

190
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,790
join the program with our Qin
instead of her

191
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,820
from the start?

192
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,300
That is the trick of a scumbag, friends.

193
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,580
When they get something,
they crave something else.

194
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,870
They are unfaithful.

195
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,870
But when I actually think about it,

196
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,980
I still think

197
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,030
He Siyue and Zhai Jiajing

198
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,030
shouldn't have much
interaction in private.

199
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,510
Since he's not answering anything,

200
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,910
let's ask Zhai Jiajing.

201
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,630
No matter what,

202
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,790
we need to figure this out.

203
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,430
We can't let Qin

204
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,030
endure the pain of
a vague and unclear love.

205
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,230
Alright.

206
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,550
You two, don't worry too much about me.

207
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,580
After all, this is my personal matter.

208
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,790
I can still handle it properly.

209
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,340
Take your time with it.

210
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,980
I'll make you another one.

211
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,100
You're making more?

212
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,910
Sorry.

213
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,060
I got a call from a trainee

214
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,870
about a case

215
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,460
when I got out

216
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,460
so I took some time.

217
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,440
It's fine.

218
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,060
Have a seat.

219
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,270
You have no idea

220
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,820
how troublesome are
these trainee lawyers.

221
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,150
They just can't understand things
no matter how many times I tell them.

222
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,510
Have you gotten
your practising license?

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,870
I just did.

224
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,270
Wait until you have trainees,

225
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,870
you will understand.

226
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,340
You looked me up at such a late hour,

227
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,430
did something happen?

228
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,750
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

229
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,550
(Go Back Lover)
(The ultimate choice of the challengers)

230
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,460
(Challenge Mission)
(is starting soon.)

231
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,150
(Dear guests, please take your seats.)

232
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,820
(This round will feature
a guest mutual voting session.)

233
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,030
(Challenger, Guest)
(Challengers are allowed to pick)

234
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,180
(any guest of the opposite gender)

235
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,870
(and guests can make a pick)

236
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,580
(between existing guests
and challengers.)

237
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
(If the guest and the challenger)

238
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,340
(select each other,)

239
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,340
(it will be deemed that the challenge
is successful.)

240
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,430
Let's welcome our two challengers

241
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,060
and our three pairs of guests

242
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,300
to the moment of the final choice.

243
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,610
Firstly,

244
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,460
the two challengers

245
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,630
can make their choice.

246
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,100
Mr. Yu Si,

247
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,670
have you made your choice?

248
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,150
Yes.

249
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,820
I can announce it now, right?

250
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,430
You may start now.

251
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,460
Ms. Shi Qin,

252
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,670
if I were to compare you to a flower,

253
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,430
I think it would be
a lily of the valley.

254
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,150
Quiet, gentle,

255
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,510
pure, and, flawless.

256
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
When I am by your side,

257
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,340
I can feel absolute peace.

258
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,580
No one else can give me this feeling.

259
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,940
Therefore, you have to be confident
in yourself.

260
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,750
However, sorry,

261
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,820
you are not my choice.

262
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,790
Ms. Chen Zhu,

263
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,940
you are passionate and beautiful

264
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,820
just like champagne roses
that you love.

265
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,390
Your emotions infect those around you,

266
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:13,910
including me.

267
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
When I'm with you,

268
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,630
indeed, I laugh out loud

269
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,910
involuntarily.

270
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,300
Indeed,

271
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,430
I can't control

272
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,670
my true inner emotions.

273
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,700
You are a girl who is very worthy
of being liked

274
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,630
but don't worry,

275
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,340
I won't choose you either.

276
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,630
Nervous?

277
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,300
If you have something to say,
say it quickly.

278
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,300
When I'm with you,

279
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,300
all I do is deprecate you.

280
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,980
To praise you

281
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,750
in front of so many people
all of a sudden,

282
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,870
I do feel a little...

283
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,940
Shen Xingruo,
you have always been like a rose,

284
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,940
you grow wild, and bloom free.

285
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,670
In my mind,

286
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,870
you are the girl with the most vitality.

287
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
But I won't choose you either.

288
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,100
I thank the production team
of Go Back Lover

289
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,550
for giving me the opportunity

290
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,150
to date the three female guests.

291
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,820
I cherish this unforgettable time
very much,

292
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,460
but I know it well

293
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,580
that there is no longer

294
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,270
any space that I can enter

295
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,700
in your hearts now.

296
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,220
As a human being,

297
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
I should know my position.

298
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,460
Therefore, I choose

299
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,300
to quit.

300
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,180
Are you not worried

301
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,030
that there might be female guests
who will choose you later?

302
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,700
From what I know about them,

303
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,940
that will certainly not happen.

304
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,460
However,

305
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,270
if Lawyer Zhai wants to choose me,

306
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,340
as I said before,

307
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,060
you can contact me
for a date in private.

308
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,550
We have plenty of time.

309
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,580
Alright.

310
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,870
Since Mr. Yu Si has chosen
to withdraw himself,

311
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,980
that undoubtedly benefits

312
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,300
the other male guests among us.

313
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,630
What will be the decision of

314
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,340
our next female challenger?

315
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,030
The next choice is left to Zhai Jiajing.

316
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,550
I'm afraid

317
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,790
I am not as upright as Mr. Yu.

318
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,700
I think as long as there is
a glimmer of hope,

319
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,790
I should try my best for myself.

320
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,220
Therefore, my choice is

321
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,220
He Siyue.

322
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,220
Sure enough, they are colluding
behind the scenes.

323
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,430
What?

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,550
Feeling guilty?

325
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,030
It'd be great if
you chose Zhai Jiajing earlier.

326
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,340
Let our Qin off, alright?

327
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,300
What do you mean by that?

328
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,910
Stop pretending.

329
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,700
Forget it.

330
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,980
Let's just finish recording the program.

331
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,030
He and Shi's team has just started
to improve recently,

332
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,550
yet she challenged them.

333
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,580
He Siyue probably
wouldn't choose her, right?

334
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,550
Everyone, please be quiet.

335
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,820
The first guest chosen by the challenger

336
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,180
in this round has been selected,

337
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,060
which is He Siyue.

338
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,430
There was one night

339
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,300
when I noticed He Siyue and you together

340
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,820
across the road.

341
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,670
May I ask

342
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,150
what did you do together?

343
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,750
We didn't do much, actually.

344
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,270
We just had a meal, talked,

345
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,390
and took a walk.

346
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
These are the activities we do
when we meet every week.

347
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,750
You meet each other every week?

348
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,310
It started from high school,
it has been 10 years.

349
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,310
I'm a little embarrassed to say that

350
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,870
but indeed,

351
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,940
we kept a fixed frequency
of meeting each other.

352
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,350
So,

353
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,700
you have been keeping contact
with each other

354
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,110
since high school?

355
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,700
He has always been by my side

356
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,670
all these years.

357
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,830
He Siyue,

358
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,180
please make your final choice.

359
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,870
Sorry,

360
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,590
I think there is no need to choose.

361
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,150
I quit.

362
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,540
Shi Qin, are you sure you want to quit?

363
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:58,980
Yes.

364
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,020
Let me remind you,

365
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,540
if you choose to opt-out now,

366
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,780
according to program rules,

367
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,110
Zhai Jiajing will replace your position

368
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,700
and form a new couple with He Siyue.

369
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,460
I know.

370
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,780
I've already thought it through.

371
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,070
I quit.

372
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,670
Shi Qin!

373
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,980
Shi Qin!

374
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,110
Shi Qin!

375
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,830
Shi Qin, listen to me.

376
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,260
Shi Qin.

377
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,780
I hope you'll give it
another serious thought.

378
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,339
Can you?

379
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,020
I have thought it through clearly.

380
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,220
There is no need for me
to participate in this program anymore.

381
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,780
Did I do something to make you unhappy?

382
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,730
No.

383
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,630
It's all my fault.

384
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,390
I don't think I'm suitable

385
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,740
to participate in the program
with you anymore.

386
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,020
If you have any issues,

387
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,940
you can tell me.

388
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,590
We can solve it together.

389
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,260
Regardless,

390
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,460
I don't wish you to leave like this.

391
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,220
We took part in this show

392
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,700
to help each other.

393
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,460
Now that Zhai Jiajing
can do it with you,

394
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,740
the show can still go on.

395
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,110
It's not about the program.

396
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,940
I think we both get along

397
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,670
pretty well all this while.

398
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,740
Besides, our interactions

399
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,390
made me realise

400
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,630
we have many things in common.

401
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,180
Shi Qin,

402
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,940
I hope we can record
the program together after this.

403
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,150
He Siyue,

404
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,830
I know you chose me

405
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,460
because you're worried about hurting me.

406
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,780
I appreciate it very much.

407
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,310
Indeed,

408
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,350
your care and help for me

409
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,180
all these while

410
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,350
have stirred up emotions in my heart,

411
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,180
but don't worry.

412
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,390
I will never be

413
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,870
the stumbling block between
you and Zhai Jiajing.

414
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,910
Besides, I know

415
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,260
that she is the better choice for you.

416
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,670
Shi Qin, it's really not like
what you think.

417
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,390
There's nothing between the two of us.

418
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,150
You have been meeting each other
every week for the past 10 years.

419
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,780
Is that nothing to you?

420
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,260
You must be curious
how I found out about this, right?

421
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,470
What's happening?

422
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,070
I already asked Zhai Jiajing.

423
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:55,870
Stop.

424
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,540
She told me

425
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,260
that you have been in contact
for the past 10 years.

426
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,740
He Siyue,

427
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,910
I really can't understand

428
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,020
why did you choose me

429
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,110
to join the program instead of her

430
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,540
when the two of you are so close.

431
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,740
That's because...

432
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,700
If my issue caused you
a misunderstanding...

433
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,590
I can provide an explanation.

434
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,740
No need.

435
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,600
Shi Qin!

436
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,740
- Chen Zhu!
- He Siyue, you scumbag!

437
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,830
What is the meaning of this?

438
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,870
- Stop explaining. Go.
- Don't touch me!

439
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,910
- Get off me!
- Go.

440
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,220
I will do justice today.

441
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,780
- I'll beat you to death, scumbag!
- Go.

442
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,350
Let me go!

443
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,260
Zhai Jiajing, you should go.

444
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,020
Don't touch me!

445
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Let me go!

446
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,630
Don't touch me!

447
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,110
He Siyue, come back here!

448
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,310
The shoot today ends here.

449
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,910
Let's have a meeting in the editing room
in 30 minutes.

450
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,260
Keep your phones.

451
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,980
What is the meaning of this?

452
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,430
Don't touch me!

453
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,220
Get off me!

454
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,540
He Siyue, I'm not done with you!

455
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,590
Everyone here, please listen to me.

456
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,590
Please delete

457
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,700
all images and videos taken

458
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,150
with unofficial cameras

459
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,500
at the recording site today

460
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,110
and prohibit any leakage.

461
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,430
Everyone heard that, right?

462
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,460
Delete everything.

463
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,590
Yes.

464
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,220
Do we need to edit the live content
we recorded today

465
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,700
into the final version later?

466
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,030
Yes,

467
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,830
this is a reality show

468
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,350
so we need to record
the truest side of our emotions.

469
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,430
The promotion of the program

470
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,500
has not started yet,

471
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm just worried that someone
will make a big fuss out of this.

472
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,310
Why did you ask to meet here?

473
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,700
I just want to know
what you're thinking.

474
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,460
Nothing.

475
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,830
I just did

476
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,630
something that I've been
wanting to do for a long time.

477
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,870
Why do you bring up the fact
that we keep seeing each other

478
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,910
to Shi Qin?

479
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,350
No, you got it wrong.

480
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,630
I didn't bring it up to her,

481
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,940
she was the one who asked me about it.

482
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,700
She coincidentally saw us
on the evening of the day

483
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,780
when we were passing by her law firm

484
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,700
after we returned from Changqing Village,

485
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,940
so she came to ask me
what was going on.

486
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,110
I was just accompanying you to therapy.

487
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,020
I've kept this secret for you,

488
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,940
yet you're using it to hurt Shi Qin

489
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,630
so she misunderstands

490
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,590
and leaves the program?

491
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,870
What were you thinking?

492
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,980
What do you want me to say, then?

493
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,150
Do you want me to tell her the secret?

494
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,210
Siyue,

495
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,740
you well know

496
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,110
that I don't want anyone
to find out about the secret.

497
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,260
You are my closest friend.

498
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,460
I don't know why

499
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,940
Shi Qin would react so much.

500
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,180
Fine.

501
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,430
It was clearly scheduled
for the morning that day,

502
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,590
when I just returned
from Changqing Village,

503
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,700
why was it delayed to the evening?

504
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,700
That was a coincidence.

505
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,830
I don't know why the psychiatrist

506
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,980
suddenly changed the appointment
to the evening.

507
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,740
I don't know

508
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,180
how Shi Qin noticed us by chance either.

509
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,670
We have known each other
for so many years,

510
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,500
don't you believe me?

511
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,980
There are so many guests

512
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,180
in the program,

513
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,500
why must you choose me?

514
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,350
I come to this show

515
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,110
because of you,

516
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,740
He Siyue.

517
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,630
Do you still remember

518
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,540
that you saved me

519
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,180
on a beach similar to this one

520
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,940
10 years ago?

521
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,590
Mom,

522
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,220
you are back.

523
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,310
Here, have some water.

524
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,020
Well,

525
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,500
it's almost time,
I'm going to class first.

526
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,430
Stop there,

527
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,590
I have something to tell you.

528
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,740
What is it?

529
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,740
What do you think?

530
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,830
Think carefully,

531
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,670
what have you done wrong?

532
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,070
About the art performance report,

533
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,870
it wasn't entirely my fault.

534
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,870
The teacher insisted on
letting Shen Xingruo participate.

535
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,460
I tried my best.

536
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,630
I have been practising piano
the whole time

537
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,110
before you came back.

538
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,110
What else?

539
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,110
I didn't do well in this exam.

540
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,350
I didn't know Shen Xingruo

541
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,500
is so good in her studies.

542
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,260
Why is Shen Xingruo

543
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,630
better than you in everything?

544
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,590
Why did I give birth to waste like you?

545
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,500
Look at your report,

546
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,020
you used to be in second place,

547
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,460
you are now in third place.

548
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,540
Zhai Jiajing, you are
running out of time.

549
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,980
The college entrance examination
is just one year away.

550
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,830
If you don't work hard

551
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,150
and strengthen your foundation now,

552
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,110
during the mock exams,

553
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,390
those smarter than you

554
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,630
will surpass you completely.

555
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,150
You stupid pig,

556
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,350
think about what you should do!

557
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,780
Sorry, Mom.

558
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,940
Sorry, I will definitely try my best.

559
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,260
Is saying sorry going to help?

560
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,630
Let me ask you,

561
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,460
why didn't your father

562
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,590
want us two back then?

563
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,110
Answer it!

564
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,110
It's because I am a girl,

565
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,070
he wanted a son.

566
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,870
I almost lost my life

567
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,980
when I gave birth to you.

568
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,180
It's because of you

569
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,390
that I have no chance to have a son.

570
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,980
That is why your father abandoned me!

571
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,110
Everyone says you bring bad luck,

572
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,940
nobody likes you at all.

573
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,350
It was me,

574
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,070
it was me who raised you up
with my own hands.

575
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,910
It has been so many years,

576
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,670
I played the role of a father
and a mother at the same time,

577
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,150
do you think it was easy for me?

578
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,020
I know.

579
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,870
I know it is difficult for you, Mom.

580
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,260
I work extremely long hours
and maintained a frugal lifestyle

581
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,590
to buy you a piano

582
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,430
and enrol you on tuition classes.

583
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,740
What am I after?

584
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,020
What is it that I want?

585
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,670
You want me to study well

586
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,830
and to have a good future

587
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,180
so we can uplift each other.

588
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,260
Did you do it?

589
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,310
What is your repayment?

590
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,350
Sorry, Mom.

591
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,390
I will try harder. I'm sorry.

592
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,590
You say that every time.

593
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,070
If I knew you'd be like this,

594
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,940
I shouldn't have given birth
to you in the first place.

595
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,020
What brings you,
this karmic retribution,

596
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,460
to my side?

597
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,560
Mom,

598
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,020
sorry.

599
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,460
If I had a choice,

600
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,430
I wouldn't want to come
to this world either.

601
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,150
What did you say?

602
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,460
You have never praised me once

603
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,670
since my childhood.

604
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,500
When I was little, I thought

605
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,630
it must be because I wasn't good enough

606
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,910
and as long as I worked harder

607
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,260
and became more excellent,

608
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,110
you would definitely like me

609
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,630
and praise me.

610
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,390
Have you forgotten what you understood

611
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,590
when you were a kid, then?

612
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,670
That's because I now know

613
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,540
that regardless of how well I do,
it's no use.

614
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,260
Zhai Jiajing, listen.

615
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,430
As long as you stay in this house,

616
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,940
no matter what I do to you,

617
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,430
you have to bear with it.

618
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,670
I'm done!

619
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,670
I finally understand.

620
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,220
Both you and your father
can never be tamed like wolves.

621
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,150
Get out! Leave!

622
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,870
Go as far away as you can!

623
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,940
This house doesn't need you!

624
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,590
Go!

625
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,310
As far away as you can!

626
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,390
Zhai Jiajing!

627
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,940
Zhai Jiajing!

628
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,180
Let go!

629
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,700
Let me go!

630
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,780
He Siyue, let me go!

631
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,350
- Have you gone mad?
- Let go!

632
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,220
Zhai Jiajing, calm down!

633
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,940
Calm down.

634
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,110
Don't die today.

635
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,350
If you really want to die,

636
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,830
do it on another day.

637
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,940
Just see this as lending the day to me,

638
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,590
can you?

639
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,870
I heard everything about the fight

640
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,460
between you and your mother today.

641
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,590
How ridiculous.

642
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,540
Before this,

643
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,020
I wanted to surpass you,
even in my dreams.

644
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,460
It turns out,

645
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,870
you are now in second place

646
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,830
and I am third.

647
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,150
You even saw me like this.

648
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,310
Don't think this way.

649
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,220
School results don't mean anything.

650
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,830
It is everything to me.

651
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,540
I pretend to be cheerful

652
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,630
at school every day

653
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,870
as if I don't care
about my results at all,

654
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,590
as if I'm a little princess
spoilt by my parents.

655
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,350
I am not happy.

656
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,590
I am so tired.

657
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,870
He Siyue,

658
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,150
the real me

659
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,670
is even more pathetic than
what you're looking at now.

660
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,590
Don't worry,

661
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,910
I will help you keep this secret.

662
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,350
Really?

663
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,020
Zhai Jiajing,

664
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,740
I won't tell anyone about this.

665
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,390
I will also keep this a secret.

666
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,750
Trust me.

667
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,330
(Freshman Year, Year 2015)

668
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,910
Sorry

669
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,140
for being late.

670
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,620
It's fine, I was just reading.

671
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,020
Didn't you sleep well?

672
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,430
Why do you look so haggard?

673
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,350
I had difficulty falling asleep

674
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,310
recently.

675
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,500
I keep having dreams,

676
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,230
I dreamed about many things
from the past,

677
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,710
I dreamed

678
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,270
about my mother.

679
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,750
Zhai Jiajing,

680
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,460
I think

681
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,100
you should let the past go by.

682
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,870
You should stop thinking about it.

683
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,580
What do you want to drink?

684
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,140
What's happened to your wrist?

685
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,750
Did someone bully you?

686
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,660
Zhai Jiajing?

687
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,460
What happened? Tell me.

688
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,620
I...

689
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,270
I did it to myself.

690
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,980
I don't know what is wrong with me.

691
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,190
I just feel so suffocated inside.

692
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,190
It feels like this is the only thing
I can do

693
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,940
to make myself feel better.

694
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,870
I hope you

695
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,710
don't mind me saying this,

696
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,620
I really think

697
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,500
you should consult a psychiatrist.

698
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,140
You can't keep being like this.

699
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,980
I think I should, too,

700
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,910
but I'm scared.

701
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,500
I can't bring myself to go to a doctor.

702
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,190
Can you go with me?

703
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,580
Can you do that?

704
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,430
Please?

705
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,190
Fine, I'll go with you.

706
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,790
All these years,

707
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,790
you have always been by my side.

708
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,660
When I was about to crumble,

709
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,190
it was you who stayed with me
all the time.

710
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,980
You've given me support
and encouragement.

711
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,230
It's because of you that I have
the courage to live on.

712
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,940
If you were not with me...

713
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,350
The relationship between

714
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,940
the two of us

715
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,870
is not something
that others can understand.

716
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,460
Stop deceiving yourself.

717
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,460
You have feelings for me.

718
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,940
Zhai Jiajing,

719
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,060
I'm sorry.

720
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,310
I have no feelings for you.

721
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,500
Besides, I already have someone I like.

722
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,020
I can't accept you.

723
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,980
Qin, are you alright?

724
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,310
Wherever you are,

725
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,790
please text me back now.

726
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,980
I'm worried about you.

727
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,390
(Shi Qin)
(Don't worry.)

728
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,230
(I'm fine.)

729
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
(I just want to be alone.)

730
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,510
Hello.

731
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,540
What's up with you?

732
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,870
You didn't even notice when I arrived.

733
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,790
Nothing,

734
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:06,870
I was just waiting for you.

735
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,460
Are you done with work?

736
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,270
I wanted to invite Qin
to dinner tonight,

737
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,830
but she said she wanted to be alone,

738
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,620
so I came over.

739
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
Why aren't you eating?

740
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,270
I felt something was off
as soon as I came in.

741
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,020
What is wrong with you today?

742
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,230
Eat up.

743
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,460
I won't eat if you don't tell me.

744
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,620
Xu Chengzhou told me something today.

745
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,350
The resort has received a new event.

746
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,140
An event? Isn't that good news?

747
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,270
This event

748
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,940
is a funeral.

749
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,500
Whose funeral is it?

750
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,620
It's your father's funeral.

751
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,830
My father...

752
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:28,870
He...

753
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,230
When did it happen?

754
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,580
Uncle had cancer.

755
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,460
He likely passed away
due to complications

756
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,540
while receiving treatment abroad.

757
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,140
This is everything I know

758
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,870
so far.

759
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,239
He...

760
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,790
When will he return here?

761
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,460
Returning the body here
would be very complicated,

762
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,140
so his family

763
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,980
agreed to have him cremated there.

764
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,020
She will return here with his ashes,

765
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,390
the funeral ceremony will be held
at the resort.

766
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,100
I don't know how to comfort you,

767
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,100
but I want to tell you

768
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,910
that no matter what happens,

769
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,270
I will always be with you.

770
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,190
I'm a little exhausted,

771
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,620
I should go home.

772
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,310
Sure, I'll send you back.

773
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:17,850
(Go Back Lover)
(Interview Time)

774
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,930
Why are you quitting the show?

775
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,250
It's actually good to quit.

776
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,330
Participating in this program

777
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,930
has been a fantasy

778
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,290
to me from the start.

779
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,210
It's time to wake up.

780
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,130
It's good

781
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,250
that I at least got an answer

782
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,850
and I can give up

783
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,690
on some of my unnecessary thoughts.

784
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,250
He and Zhai Jiajing

785
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,810
make a good couple.

786
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,050
They have always been

787
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,450
the right person for each other.

788
00:43:58,290 --> 00:43:59,170
They have my blessing.

789
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,010
(What do you think about Shi Qin?)
I don't know how to provide her

790
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,810
a better explanation about this matter.

791
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,930
If we had to do it all over again,

792
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,530
I will definitely still choose her

793
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,930
to participate in the show together.

794
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,770
I will also definitely choose her

795
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,250
to be my interested guest.

796
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:13,730
It's just that...

797
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,610
It's just that I really don't want her

798
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,930
to quit the program like this.

799
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,360
