(2018)

4
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,670
(22 years old, Senior Year)
Congratulations to Yunjiang University.

5
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,260
(Shen Xingruo won)
Congratulations to Shen Xingruo

6
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,780
on winning
the Prestigious Universities Tour Finals

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,470
of "Seize Every Second Year 2018"
on Xingcheng Satellite TV.

8
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,230
Congratulations!
Let's give her a big hand.

9
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,530
Please come forward to the middle
of the stage. Congratulations.

10
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,870
Shen Xingruo.

11
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,110
The day we turned 18

12
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,700
was our first day together.

13
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,620
I owed you five yuan.

14
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,110
With inflation and interest,

15
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,780
I now owe you nine yuan altogether.

16
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,340
Shen Xingruo,

17
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,950
will you go to the Civil Affairs Bureau
and use this nine yuan with me?

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,950
Say yes!

19
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,710
- Say yes!
- Say yes!

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,470
(In fairy tales,)

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,470
(princesses will definitely agree
to marry their princes)

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,550
(and live happily ever after.)

23
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,340
(But in reality,)

24
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,750
(a proposal may not be
the beginning of happiness,)

25
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,710
(but rather the end of a relationship.)

26
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,750
Xing, our competitor is going

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,220
to look for fresh souls at the opening
ceremony of Tsinghua University.

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,920
Why are you coming
to the airport instead?

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,130
Where do you think we should go?

30
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,930
At least a CBD.
[*Central business district]

31
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,430
That's where all business elites gather.

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,830
Areas like the CBD

33
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,310
create an elite vibe

34
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,750
where people go to great lengths

35
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,780
to make themselves look like they're
from the upper class so as to fit in.

36
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,150
I'd say that the quality
of the people there is quite mixed.

37
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,820
We're highly likely to find potential guests
with a fine appearance and no substance.

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,620
Is the airport a guaranteed choice?

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,070
I bought two experience tickets
at the departure lounge.

40
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,310
People here are

41
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,620
our real targets.

42
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,430
In that case, I'm a bit...

43
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,620
Xing, don't walk so fast. Wait for me.

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,870
For you,

45
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,470
I'm willing to repeat the mistake.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,710
Yes.

47
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,430
That's the slogan of Go Back Lover,

48
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,230
our new dating show focusing on people
from outside the show industry.

49
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,940
Hello, I'm Shen Xingruo, the producer.

50
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,940
So, what do you expect from me?

51
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,710
Well,

52
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,700
we're short of a single male guest
with a favorable background,

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,620
so we'd like to ask

54
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,550
if you're interested

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,590
in joining our program.

56
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,070
Who are you?

57
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm He Ming, the screenwriter.
Nice to meet you.

58
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,830
This is quite a new way I've ever seen
to recruit guests.

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,380
I got it.

60
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,870
Sorry, but I'm not interested.
I don't have money either.

61
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,230
You should look for someone else.

62
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,430
Mister, you got us wrong.

63
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,430
We're not scammers.
We're from a proper production team.

64
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,060
Please excuse me.

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:16,940
I... I predicted that.

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,990
Is this a rocky start, Xing?

67
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,380
The tickets are wasted.

68
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,860
Don't be discouraged.

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,190
The genuine articles are waiting for us
in the departure lounge.

70
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,270
Xing,

71
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,190
look over there. There!

72
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,610
(Xingcheng International Airport Lounge)

73
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,070
What's it?

74
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,300
I swear, this is definitely the best
I've seen today.

75
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,470
No, the best male potential guest

76
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,860
in the past six months.

77
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,270
Those long legs.

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,660
What if he's compared

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,590
to the male guest
Love Diary poached from us?

80
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,390
He's way better for sure.

81
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,830
Great. I'm going to get him.

82
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,060
Let's go.

83
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,370
(Boarding Gate)

84
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,530
(Departure Lounge)

85
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,210
This way, please.

86
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,470
Okay. Let's split up.

87
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,980
You go to the back and see if there are
any potential female guests.

88
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,830
I'll approach him.

89
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,950
Roger, Xing.

90
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,830
Good luck.

91
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,270
What a coincidence.

92
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,470
I read about this magazine before.

93
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,390
The theme is about

94
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,590
the deep analysis of the top 50 global
breakthrough technologies,

95
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,390
right?

96
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,510
Since we're so fated,

97
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,510
would you mind telling me

98
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,190
if you're still single?

99
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,340

It's been a long while.

110
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,300
Right.

111
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,900
It's been a long while.

112
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,540
Why are you here?

113
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,340
I...

114
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,830
I'm here to see someone off.

115
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,270
Even came to the departure lounge?

116
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
I used to come here

117
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,510
when I saw you off.

118
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,470
(About the program)

119
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,950
Is this your new documentary?

120
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,270
Go Back Lover.

121
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,630
The title sounds quite romantic.

122
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:24,950
This is great!

123
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,660
Finally, we have a full cast
of male guests.

124
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,270
Male guests?

125
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,100
What's that?

126
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,140
Well, here's the thing.

127
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,670
We're preparing a dating show

128
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,740
for ex-partners.

129
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,500
We think you're a perfect fit

130
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
for our program.

131
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,830
We'd like to invite you
to be our male guest.

132
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,100
Please have a look at this.

133
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,430
Xing, didn't you tell him about it?

134
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,430
I see.

135
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,100
(Go Back Lover)

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,980
Didn't you study documentaries?

137
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,950
When did you switch to reality shows?

138
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,430
Lu Xingyan,

139
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,740
you're as bad an actor as you were.

140
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,830
Have you already heard from them

141
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,860
that I came back to China
to do reality shows?

142
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,100
Shen Xingruo,

143
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,670
what makes you think

144
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,910
I'd want to know anything about you?

145
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,340
So you know each other.

146
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
You should've told me.

147
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,980
Mister, is it possible for you
to bring your ex-partner

148
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,430
to participate in our program?

149
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,590
It seems

150
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,140
she wouldn't agree.

151
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:37,940
She...

152
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,380
Both of you...

153
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,860
I see.

154
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,070
Hello, Zhu.

155
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,100
Hello, Xingruo.

156
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,860
The ride I sent to you
got a flat on the way.

157
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,020
Can you come here by yourself?

158
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,130
I'll head over
right after my business is done.

159
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,500
We'll wait for you.

160
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,590
You're my bridesmaid. Don't be late.

161
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,500
No worries.

162
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,620
See you later. Bye-bye.

163
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,210
There's somewhere I need to be.
I got to go.

164
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,710
Are you attending the ceremony
of Chen Zhu and Xu Chengzhou?

165
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm the best man.

166
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,220
Need a ride?

167
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,890
No need.

168
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,500
I see.

169
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,450
(We're trying to arrange a ride for you.
You're number 272 in line.)

170
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,340
Wait.

171
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,500
Give me a ride.

172
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,620
It's more convenient

173
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,790
if we go together.

174
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,260
Hurry up.

175
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,860
Xing,

176
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,380
what about me?

177
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,220
Stay here and try looking around.

178
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
If you spot any suitable guest,
remember to ask for their contact.

179
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,470
I'm leaving.

180
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,550
I'm of marriageable age today.

181
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,070
Shen Xingruo,

182
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,530
will you go to the Civil Affairs Bureau

183
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,790
to use this nine yuan with me?

184
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,140
Seriously?

185
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,020
The ceremony is starting any minute.

186
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,140
Why are you still watching
that video from ages ago?

187
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,860
I just want to recall some old memories.

188
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,980
After all,

189
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,310
people from different worlds

190
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,470
can't end up together.

191
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,220
True enough.

192
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,220
Finally, I can say goodbye
to this trashy relationship today.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm over the moon.

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,620
Xu Chengzhou,
we were together for years.

195
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,950
You're that trash.

196
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,470
Excuse me. Have you checked

197
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,260
the video for later?

198
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,200
It's on the desktop.

199
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,140
All right.

200
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,860
I'm trash?

201
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,470
I said our relationship is trashy,

202
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,590
not that I'm trash.

203
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,310
You said it.

204
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,670
Trash with a trashy relationship.

205
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,340
A perfect match.

206
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,340
Trash with a trashy relationship?

207
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,310
The relationship is trashy.

208
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,120
Did I say I'm trash?

209
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,230
If I'm trash, what about you?

210
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,340
You're the wife of a trash.

211
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,980
What does that make you?

212
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,910
Do you think
you're any better than trash?

213
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm telling you, from today on, we...

214
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,730
(Incoming call from Zhai Jiajing)

215
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,510
Yes?

216
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,470
Have you arrived yet?

217
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,190
Not yet. I'm stuck in traffic.

218
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,710
My flight is about to take off.

219
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,990
Snap a picture of the contract
and send it to me when you have time.

220
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,950
I left the document

221
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,740
in your office last night.

222
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,430
All right. I'll send it once I get back.

223
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,790
No rush.

224
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,620
Get your best man duty done first.

225
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,380
I'll hang up. Bye-bye.

226
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,910
What a busy working day.

227
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,710
Today's traffic is particularly heavy.

228
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,140
Since everyone's held up
in traffic right now,

229
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,030
let's take this opportunity to talk
about a topic many are interested in.

230
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,340
If your ex-partner moves on to someone
faster than you do,

231
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,650
will you give them your blessing?

232
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,260
I prefer quiet.

233
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,710
How much longer?

234
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,260
The line is long.

235
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,590
The ceremony starts at 11:11 AM.

236
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,070
Can we make it in time?

237
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,520
Let's take a shortcut from here.

238
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,310
Didn't you check before turning here?

239
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,860
Producer Shen,

240
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,590
I'm not your staff.

241
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,380
And stop blaming me now.

242
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,710
Just pull over here.

243
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,500
Why?

244
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,340
Only this junction has heavy traffic.

245
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,220
Park your car here.

246
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,220
We'll walk over
to the next intersection to grab a cab.

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,530
That way, we can make it on time.

248
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:27,980
Do it.

249
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,740
You can't walk in heels.

250
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,490
Do you need these?

251
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,790
Your girlfriend's sneakers?

252
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,620
Ms. Shen, you seem
particularly interested

253
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,100
in my private life.

254
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,020
Not at all.

255
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,790
I just don't like using
someone else's things.

256
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,450
(Diverging paths leads to happiness)

257
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,050
(Scan the code
to get your red packet back)

258
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,220
Will they really show up?

259
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,860
It's about the auspicious hour.

260
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,790
Xingruo just texted me.

261
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,740
They'll be here in ten minutes.

262
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,140
We can start first.

263
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,910
They'll make it for the last session.

264
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,100
All right, then.

265
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,450
(Diverging paths leads to happiness)

266
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,950
Distinguished guests,

267
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,740
the ceremony will now begin.

268
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,310
On the summer night of 2015,

269
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,340
Mr. Xu and Ms. Chen started

270
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,330
their first relationship in life,
which lasted seven years.

271
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,430
On the first snow of 2023,

272
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,740
they were married

273
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,790
and became Mrs. Chen and Mr. Xu.

274
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,310
Throughout their journey to this day,

275
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,830
they've cried and laughed

276
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,830
but never regretted it.

277
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,620
In the coming 11:11 AM,

278
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,190
a time for singles,

279
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,980
let's raise our hands

280
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,740
and applaud thunderously

281
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,190
to begin the divorce ceremony!

282
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,740
On behalf of all relatives and friends,

283
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,630
I'll ask the question
that everyone is most curious about.

284
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,870
May I know

285
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,390
why you are holding this ceremony

286
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,780
since you've already divorced?

287
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,190
From 2023 until today,

288
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,430
I, Chen Zhu,

289
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,430
have been working on everything alone
for 111 days,

290
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,500
from the set decoration
to the wedding ceremony,

291
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,390
the hotel room bookings,
and guest lists.

292
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,060
Forty-five days before the wedding,

293
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,950
I started losing weight,
building muscle, and getting a Thermage,

294
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,300
I've done it

295
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,710
all for this moment.

296
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,820
I don't need a wedding,

297
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,950
but I must have the spotlight on me.

298
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,950
Well said!

299
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,930
- Ms. Chen, that was a fabulous speech.
- Well put!

300
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,060
What a fighting talk!

301
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,780
Mr. Xu, is there anything
you want to say?

302
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,870
Just one point.

303
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,630
Most of what she did

304
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,710
was paid by me.

305
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,430
When you throw a pebble into water,
at least there's some ripple, right?

306
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,810
That's why I'm standing here today.

307
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,980
What's wrong with me
spending your money?

308
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,220
Did I not put in any effort?

309
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,870
For whom did you put the effort into?

310
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,740
Not for yourself?

311
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,190
Am I marrying myself?

312
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,470
Did you contribute a single thing

313
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,500
to this wedding?

314
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,820
You just stood by

315
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,110
and did nothing.

316
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,630
Do you want to stop me
from doing something for our wedding?

317
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,980
Please calm down.

318
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,580
Please.

319
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,020
Don't be mad.

320
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,710
Here's the thing.

321
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,740
It seems both of you have a lot to say,

322
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,060
so let's move on to the first session:

323
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,350
the blaming session.

324
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,500
Air your grievances.

325
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,500
It'll begin in 60 seconds.

326
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,060
Ready, start.

327
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,870
I've always believed

328
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,630
that the end of a marriage
or a relationship

329
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,710
doesn't happen in a single moment,

330
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,190
It's the accumulation of moments.

331
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,980
Mr. Xu Chengzhou and I
were together for years,

332
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,870
but in all that time,

333
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,350
he never understood what I truly wanted.

334
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,540
When I was sick,
he told me to drink warm water.

335
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,390
When I was down,
he told me to stop overthinking.

336
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,390
When we finally had some time together,

337
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,390
and I wanted to have a talk,

338
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,710
he said he was tired and needed sleep.

339
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,910
Dear relatives and friends,

340
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,470
I'm just wondering

341
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,630
that if a man

342
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,300
can't even give me
the most fundamental emotional support,

343
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,580
what do I need him for?

344
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,930
It's not that I don't care about you,

345
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,220
but there should be a limit.

346
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,740
You wanted me to video call you
eight times a day,

347
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,190
even when I went to the bathroom.

348
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,540
Also, I'm not a doctor.

349
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,190
Instead of seeking comfort from me,

350
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,740
you would've recovered faster
if you'd taken some medicine.

351
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,950
Everyone has blue days.

352
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,710
I understand that.

353
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,260
But it just can't continue
the entire day.

354
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,910
When I asked why you were upset,

355
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,910
you wanted me to guess.

356
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,630
I'm not a fortune teller.

357
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,950
How could I possibly know?

358
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,110
We've been together for years.

359
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,670
I'm an open book to you.

360
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,260
I really don't understand
why we still need a long conversation.

361
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,710
Where's the ceremony?

362
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,670
You need a map

363
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,920
after years since you last came?

364
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,110
This is your resort house.

365
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,390
How would I remember the way?

366
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,910
This way.

367
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,020
Do you need help?

368
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,630
No need.

369
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,930
(Sun Hotel Panoramic Guide Map)

370
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,910
Gentlemen,

371
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,370
am I wrong to criticize her?

372
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,430
- No at all.
- No at all.

373
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,500
You made a good point.

374
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,900
Calm down, both of you.

375
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,870
Well, I can feel the tension
between you,

376
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,110
but we're short on time.

377
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,110
Moving on to the second session:

378
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,980
the vows.

379
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,350
Ms. Chen,

380
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,710
after the divorce,

381
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,870
whether Mr. Xu becomes rich overnight

382
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,870
or passes away

383
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,430
or gets a second or third marriage,

384
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,670
do you wish to...

385
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,980
I do.

386
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,390
That's fast.

387
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,110
Well, it's Mr. Xu's turn.

388
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,980
After the divorce,

389
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,820
whether she has a second or third child,

390
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,190
do you wish to...

391
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,390
I do.

392
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,980
Well...

393
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,350
I have no objections to the divorce,
but this vow seems off.

394
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,580
Why does he get
a second or third marriage,

395
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,190
but I get a second or third child?

396
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,060
We should also get a
second or third marriage!

397
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,150
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

398
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,400
- Right!
- Right!

399
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,470
Come on. This is just a formality.

400
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,820
Do you have to be so demanding?

401
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,780
Please calm down.

402
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,740
Okay. Up next, let's invite
the best man and bridesmaid

403
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,780
to remove the rings.

404
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,150
It's Shen Xingruo and Lu Xingyan.

405
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,870
Right. I remember them.

406
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Lu Xingyan proposed to Shen Xingruo

407
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,950
during a program back then.

408
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
I heard they broke up.

409
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,220
But why are they here together now?

410
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,150
Isn't it awkward?

411
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,630
Tell me about it. It's weird.

412
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,300
Ring.

413
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,820
The ceremony is complete.

414
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,580
Very well.

415
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,820
The two of them

416
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,350
have shown us

417
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,140
the differences between men and women
in today's society,

418
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,390
and also,

419
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,870
they've pushed a beautiful marriage

420
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,540
to the verge of the abyss.

421
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,950
Next, let's have the crew

422
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,190
play the blessing messages

423
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,670
from the best man and bridesmaid.

424
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,710
Please look at the screen.

425
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,870
Shen Xingruo, will you go
to the Civil Affairs Bureau

426
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,220
to use this nine yuan with me?

427
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,580
Why is this video playing?

428
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,710
What's going on?

429
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,220
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

430
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,470
Will you marry me?

431
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,470
I'm afraid not.

432
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,990
Why not?

433
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,440
That's awkward.

434
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,430
Since 2015, the Civil Affairs Bureau has stopped
charging document fees.

435
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,390
We can save that nine yuan

436
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,020
and use it to take a cab.

437
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,190
That's enough for the starting fare
from here to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

We're sorry, Mr. Lu.

459

It's a mistake.

460
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,260
We apologize.

461
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,110
Never mind.

462
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,430
Let's continue. Go on.

463
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,430
Dear relatives and friends,

464
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,150
we're moving on

465
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,260
to the last session.

466
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,600
- Remember the last team-building event?
- Relatives and families from both sides,

467
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,630
- The factory was shut. The owner ran away.
- to have a proper, fair,

468
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,390
and legal reason...

469
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,950
These pillows are their final payment.

470
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,670
Thank you

471
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,180
for the divorce present.

472
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,190
- The best man
- I'll deduct it from your salary.

473
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,500
provided us with many pillows

474
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,630
for a pillow fight.

475
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
A pillow fight?

476
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,300
What's going on?

477
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,110
Don't worry.

478
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,250
Just vent out whatever anger
you've been holding in.

479
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,100
Watch me.

480
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,630
Let me show you how I beat him up.

481
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,540
Xu Chengzhou,

482
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm going to beat you up!

483
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,220
Why? Want to join?

484
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,430
It's a good time to celebrate
their separation and a new chapter in life.

485
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,780
Go ahead if you want to play.

486
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,450
What I owed you,

487
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,910
I've already paid off.

488
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,470
I didn't know

489
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,150
we were still in sync after years.

490
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,260
No wonder everyone's curious

491
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,150
about why we broke up.

492
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,260
Come on.

493
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,190
So

494
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,870
the reason for our breakup,

495
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,350
I suppose you know it, right?

496
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,060
I've already forgotten

497
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,230
insignificant people and matters.

498
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,060
That's great.

499
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,950
Let bygone be bygone.

500
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,190
Sure. Just let it go.

501
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,500
I wish Ms. Shen

502
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,230
success in casting new guests
for your show.

503
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,710
I wish Mr. Lu

504
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,300
finds a lot of customers.

505
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,260
May your show
receive a great public reception.

506
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,060
May you

507
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
make a great fortune.

508
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,350
- I wish you
- I wish you

509
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
- a better future.
- a better future.

510
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,450
(Go Back Lover)
(Interview Time)

511
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,580
Done.

512
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,950
First post-interview of Go Back Lover.

513
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,420
Have you tried

514
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,780
to get your ex-partner back
after the breakup?

515
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,570
(Have you tried to get
your ex-partner back?)

516
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,490
After we broke up,

517
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,530
we said a lot of harsh words
to each other.

518
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,810
I realized

519
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,530
I had gone overboard,

520
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,850
so I wanted to talk to him.

521
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,650
Later,

522
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,090
I called him twice,

523
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,570
but...

524
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,970
He didn't pick up?

525
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,890
We haven't talked to each other

526
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,850
since then.

527
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,450
I believe

528
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,010
I had broken Lu Xingyan's heart.

529
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,370
Of course,

530
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,730
she ended the relationship.

531
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,930
I tried to call her many times,

532
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,250
but she blocked me outright.

533
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,090
Since then,

534
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,290
she hasn't contacted me at all.

535
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,810
I think

536
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,090
she didn't want anything

537
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,450
to do with me anymore.

538
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,330
You were at the airport that day.

539
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,090
Was it a coincidence?

540
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,770
(Your ticket from Xingcheng Airport
to Munich, Germany, T1 has been issued.)

541
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,530
(Xingcheng to Munich)

542
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,230
I'm He Ming, the screenwriter.
Nice to meet you.

543
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,500
This is quite a new way

544
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,870
I've ever seen

545
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,190
to recruit male guests.

546
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,820
I got it.

547
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,870
Sorry, but I'm not interested.
I don't have money either.

548
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,320
You should find someone else.

549
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,430
It's not that, mister.

550
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,110
You got us wrong.

551
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,580
We're not scammers.

552
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,820
- We're from a proper production team.
- Please excuse me.

553
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,350
I...

554
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,850
(Your ticket from Xingcheng Airport
to Munich, Germany, T1 has been issued.)

555
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,150
Attention, passengers
He Ming and Shen Qingruo,

556
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,870
traveling on flight CN1698

557
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,220
- to Munich, Germany,
- I predicted this, Xing.

558
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,100
- your flight
- Is this

559
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,230
- is about to take off.
- a rocky start?

560
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,940
- Please proceed to Gate 21 for boarding.
- The tickets are wasted.

561
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,910
Don't be discouraged.

562
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,430
The genuine articles are waiting for us
in the departure lounge.

563
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:03,570
(Have you tried to get
your ex-partner back?)

564
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,230
Why did you receive the notification
about Shen Xingruo's flight information?

565
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,530
We registered the ticket booking apps

566
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,250
with my phone number back then.

567
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,090
That's why I receive notifications

568
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,010
when she books a flight ticket.

569
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,890
Did you go there

570
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,810
because you were afraid
Shen Xingruo would leave

571
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,650
and never come back?

572
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:24,770
No.

573
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,170
The reason being?

574
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,410
I was impulsive.

575
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,170
I was out of my mind.

576
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,120
