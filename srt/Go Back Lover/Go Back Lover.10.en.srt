00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,030
You don't have to feel sorry for anyone.

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,670
We all participated willingly.
Am I right?

187
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,980
And, before we decided to participate,

188
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,180
we've already prepared ourselves
to be scrutinized.

189
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,940
So, we are okay with that.

190
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,100
Let me ask you,

191
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,150
what are you
and Lu Xingyan going to do?

192
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,940
If he has already decided,

193
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,820
then I'll respect his choice.

194
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,670
If we're not from the same world,

195
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,020
we shouldn't be filming
this show together.

196
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,550
That's why we brought you here.

197
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,270
If he quits the show,

198
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,830
how am I supposed to answer the client?

199
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,300
What's wrong? Can't I call you?

200
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,060
Dad, I tell you,

201
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,790
I don't know the reason,

202
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,020
but I'm just very happy today.

203
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,430
Ms. Zhu, please help us out.

204
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,430
The audience is hoping
for a reunion of the "Double-Star".

205
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,870
It's not that I don't want to help,

206
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,390
but there's nothing I can do.

207
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,670
Lu Xingyan used to listen
to everything Xingruo said,

208
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,550
but now even she couldn't handle him.

209
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,390
Who else could?

210
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,750
I might have thought of someone.

211
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,680
- Ms. Pei.
- Ms. Pei.

212
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,340
Aunt Pei.

213
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,790
We've already prepared the tea for you.

214
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,339
You...

215
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,530
Where's Lu Xingyan?

216
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,560
Mr. Lu went out this morning
to meet with a client.

217
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,130
Mr. Lu has been extremely busy lately.

218
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,270
He is worn out recently.

219
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,980
I know where he is now. Don't follow me.

220
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,550
Xing,

221
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,030
I can't help you more.

222
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:01,410
(Xu Chengzhou)

223
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,180
Wake up!

224
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,980
Madam Pei.

225
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,230
What are you doing here so early?

226
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,180
So early?

227
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,730
It hurts!

228
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,030
Do you even know what time it is?

229
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,100
It's 11 o'clock.

230
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,750
You little kid is still sleeping here!

231
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,670
What do you want?

232
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,270
What do I want?

233
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,030
Xingruo is such a good girl,

234
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,300
and you're not cherishing her.

235
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,390
You upset her,

236
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,500
don't go film the show,
and now you're going on strike.

237
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,430
You think you're so capable now, huh?

238
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,270
You wouldn't understand
what's going on between us.

239
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,070
I'm just giving her a bit
of space for a few days.

240
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,270
Oh, giving her space for a few days?

241
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,590
Come on, tell me,
what is it that I don't understand?

242
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,340
You think that all those years

243
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,060
when you two were

244
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,180
secretly dating under my nose,

245
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,080
I didn't know about it?

246
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,670
I pretend not knowing
because I liked Xingruo.

247
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,100
Seeing her kept you in line
made me happy.

248
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,940
I know more about you two
than anyone else.

249
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,510
You little kid, don't be foolish.

250
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,550
Put on your clothes
and go apologize to her!

251
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,530
Where are your clothes?

252
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,980
I'm not going.

253
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,920
I didn't do anything wrong,
why do I need to apologize?

254
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,060
How did I end up

255
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,180
with such a petty son?

256
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,940
In a relationship,

257
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,100
things aren't always so clear-cut.

258
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,550
Sometimes, you just need
to take a step back,

259
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,550
then take another step back,

260
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,980
and another step back,

261
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,460
compromising to her.

262
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,430
That's the way to get along.

263
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,430
Otherwise, do you think I would've got
together with your dad?

264
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,220
You don't even know
what happened between us.

265
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,100
Yet, you're telling me
to take my steps back, again and again.

266
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,630
Come on, my son.

267
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,910
Listen to me.

268
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,580
Think about it this way,

269
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,270
Xingruo worked so hard

270
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,270
to get this project going, right?

271
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,390
If you keep causing trouble

272
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,060
and mess it up for her,

273
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,980
won't you feel so guilty?

274
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,780
Mom.

275
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,520
Don't try to convince me.

276
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Xingruo already said

277
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,180
that we're not from the same world.

278
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,030
What's the point of you
trying to convince me?

279
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,910
Useless man.

280
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,730
You're like a cocoon,
just stay inside and never come out.

281
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,030
Draw the curtains for me, thanks.

282
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,630
How dare you!

283
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,590
Let me do my part
for the critical moment.

284
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,980
Ruo,

285
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,590
there's nothing.

286
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,070
I just missed you.

287
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,780
Will I affect your work progress

288
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,070
for calling you out suddenly?

289
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,070
No, it won't.

290
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,390
That's good.

291
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,220
I really missed you.

292
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,130
It's been days
since you last contacted me.

293
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,720
I've been working overtime recently.

294
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,350
Hello, sorry to interrupt.

295
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,520
What would you like to drink?

296
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,220
Two Americanos, thank you.

297
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,350
Hold on.

298
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,630
Two Irish coffees, please. Thanks.

299
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,910
Alright, just a moment.

300
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,910
Let's try something new today.

301
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,150
Sure.

302
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,460
Last time, a friend of mine

303
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,540
treated me to this coffee,

304
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,020
and I didn't expect it to taste so good.

305
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,780
So today, I brought you
here to taste it.

306
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,910
Look.

307
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,260
The coffee is calm and composed.

308
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,390
The whiskey is hot and intense.

309
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,220
It reminds me of
a certain couple I know.

310
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,910
Aunt Pei, Lu Xingyan and I...

311
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,500
I understand.

312
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,910
You don't have to say anything.

313
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,870
The little kid is messing up again.

314
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,220
He's always carefree without love,

315
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,670
but neurotic when he's in love.

316
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,080
Thank you.

317
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,980
Enjoy.

318
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,940
I know my son well.

319
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,310
Normally,

320
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,910
he's all goofy.

321
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,220
But, when it comes to relationships,

322
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,940
he's as intense as whiskey.

323
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,220
For you, I've watched you grow up.

324
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,670
You're more like coffee,

325
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,910
much calmer and more composed than him.

326
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,590
Coffee and whiskey

327
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,430
may seem

328
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,350
like incompatible,

329
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,670
but when handled it the right way,

330
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,460
the two of them

331
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,980
can create something unique,

332
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,780
just like

333
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,430
this Irish coffee in front of you,

334
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,780
am I right?

335
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,239
Ruo,

336
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,980
do you really not want

337
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,430
to give yourselves another chance?

338
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,210
This is for you.

339
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,980
What is this?

340
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,110
This is something he treasures the most.

341
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,740
He keeps it locked in his drawer,

342
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,310
and I only just managed to get it out.

343
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,040
If I even touched it back then,
he would have thrown a fit.

344
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,980
I don't even need to open it

345
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,600
to know it's full of things

346
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,070
related to you inside.

347
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,630
You two have a relationship
that's lasted over ten years.

348
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,020
That's not easy to come by.

349
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm sure you'll find a way
to figure out

350
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,610
how to be with each other
in a better way.

351
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,050
♪Each day will come and go♪

352
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,930
♪About their story, I never know♪

353
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,330
♪I heard that the world is a void♪

354
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,530
♪But I choose to love♪

355
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,770
♪It's like just me and you♪

356
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,940
So, the fundamental way to
establish connections with a man

357
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,180
is to ask him for help.

358
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,740
You can find an appropriate time

359
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,430
to ask him to do something for you.

360
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,180
But, won't that make him dislike me?

361
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,260
No.

362
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,310
That captures his interest

363
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,740
and more likely to fall for you.

364
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,910
Xingruo!

365
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,800
How did things go with Aunt Pei?

366
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,030
How did you know
I went out with Aunt Pei?

367
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,460
What is this?
Did Aunt Pei give it to you?

368
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,120
But, I haven't opened it yet.

369
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,940
Come in.

370
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,130
Let's open it together.

371
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,110
Faster open it.

372
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,830
Alright, I'll open it.

373
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,510
See.

374
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,540
Oh my goodness.
Lu Xingyan is so meticulous.

375
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,330
He even saved the plane tickets
from when you two were dating.

376
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,590
These are

377
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,700
all from our time together.

378
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,590

379
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,460

381
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,110
Shen Xingruo,

382
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,180
weren't you with us

383
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,910
on your 18th birthday?

384
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,110
After hanging out with you guys,

385
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,180
we didn't go home.

386
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,630
You two went straight to a hotel?

387
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,430
That...

388
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,460
No, it's not like that.

389
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,540
That was just way too advanced.

390
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,150
It's not like what you're thinking.

391
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,700
Where are Chen Zhu and Xu Chengzhou?

392
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,220
I sent them into a car.

393
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,350
Are you okay?

394
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,980
Wow, you're not drunk yet.

395
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,130
Were you pretending?

396
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,460
Yes. Otherwise, how could
I get rid of them

397
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
and be alone with you?

398
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,770
I have a birthday present for you.

399
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,780
What is it?

400
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,430
It's our first day of 18.

401
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,870
I want to take you on
a tour of the adult world.

402

What condition?

405
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,010
You have to be my girlfriend.

406
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,600
Otherwise, my future girlfriend
would be jealous.

After we broke up,

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,830
in those five years,

516

in the past five years,

you haven't been able to forget him.

520
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,350
So, you constantly remind yourself

521
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,060
keep comparing
your current life to the past.

522
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,230

530
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,580
The relationship is hard to break.

531
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,020
But, I feel like,

532
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,620
besides the romantic relationship,

533
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,270
we can handle all other aspects well.

534
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,190
I think you should talk to him,

535
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,460
and make everything clear.

536
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,430
Otherwise, leaving the show
on hold like this

537
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,430
is not a solution either.

want to talk to me?

546
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,460

00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
he remains in your life.

551
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,870
Qin is right.

552
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,460
Lu Xingyan.

553
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,270
Lu Xingyan.

554
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,060
I want to talk to you.

555
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,750
Are you still angry?

556
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,270
I'm angry too,

557
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,710
but I want to see you.

558
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,430
It's about work again, right?

559
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,500
Don't worry,

560
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,060
I'll go back after a few days of rest.

561
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,310
Lu Xingyan,

562
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,230
it seems like the only reason
we meet nowadays

563
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,830
is for work.

564
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,390
But, is work really all that's left

565
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,020
between us?

566
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,870
Let's stop sulking

567
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,100
and have a proper talk.

568
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,710
I admit

569
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,030
it was wrong of me to throw a fit
during the show,

570
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,940
but I just

571
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,580
couldn't control myself.

572
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,190
When it comes to anything
related to you,

573
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,580
I lose control easily.

574
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,390

The fish smells good.

639
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,930
- Mr. Lu made both the shrimp and fish.
- I never know you're good at this.

640
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,350
What a hidden talent!

641
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,980
How is it?

642
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,460
Let's dig in. I'm starving.

643
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,970
Can we start eating now, Mr. Lu?

644
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,060
- Can we?
- Can we eat now?

645
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,910
Go ahead.

646
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,810
Shouldn't we have a bit
of ceremony before eating?

647
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,980
Let's make a toast.

648
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,540
Cheers!

649
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,980

- Cheers!

650
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,390
Thank you everyone.

651
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,460
Yu Si is the supervisor
from Kangte Group,

652
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,310
and also Shen Xingruo's

653
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,270
classmate during her overseas studies.

654
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,790
They also participated

655
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,430
in a show called "Race Against Time".

656
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,940
Many fans shipped for them as a couple,

657
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,350
calling their team
"Rainbow Encounter CP".

658
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,310
What's more,

659
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,140
it seems that Yu Si

660
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,580
is pursuing Xingruo now.

661
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:19,910
Really?

662
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,100
Director, I have a suggestion.

663
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,239
Go ahead.

664
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:33,710
I think

665
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,460
we can bring in challengers

666
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,460
for the upcoming episodes.

667
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,580
After these few episodes,
it's inevitable that the guests

668
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,270
have become dull.

669
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,540
At this moment,

670
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,660
instead of the production team
deliberately arranging something,

671
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,460
it is better to integrate
something new among them

672
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,100
to activate their initiative

673
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,310
and stir things up naturally.

674
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,270
As you can see,

675
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,710
Yu Si and Xingruo's

676
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,310
unexpected outing

677
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,100
has already created some tension

678
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,270
between Mr. Lu and Xingruo.

679
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,390
Between childhood friend
and new contender,

680
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:11,870
who will she choose?

681
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,870
Isn't this the kind of drama
the audience loves to watch?

682
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,620
But, there's one issue.

683
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,100
Do you think

684
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,390
this might upset Xingruo?

685
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,980
It shouldn't.

686
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,580
At the start of filming,

687
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:29,980
didn't Producer Shen say

688
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,230
she wouldn't interfere with

689
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,020
the show's content or planning?

690
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,550
Alright.

691
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,460
Director, if you think

692
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,500
the idea of inviting challenger works,

693
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,540
then Yu Si is a perfect fit
as the male challenger.

694
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,020
I'll work on
getting a female challenger.

695
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,830
This way, in addition
to the "Old Friends Reunion" theme,

696
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,430
we'll have another storyline

697
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,620
to promote now.

698
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,270
That sounds good.

699
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,660
Alright, let's go with that.

700
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,730
Okay.

701
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,100
Rainbow Encounter CP.

702
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,880
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

703
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,650
(Why do you come to the filming scene today?)
Aunt, why do you

704
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,190
come the filming scene suddenly today?

705
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,250
I came partly to settle things

706
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,490
between the two of them,

707
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,330
and partly to offer you guys
some material for the show.

708
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,690
What did you bring with you today?

709
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,090
I brought the baby cot
they used as babies.

710
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,650
Ruo was very naughty
when she was young.

711
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,650
She always pushed
Lu Xingyan to the side.

712
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,810
Once, she even pushed him to the ground.

713
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,050
And look at these.

714
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,170
Very cute, right?

715
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,890
I bought these for them,

716
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,810
a couple set.

717
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,370
Let me show you some photos.

718
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,730
Look at these photos.

719
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,650
And, these two sweaters.

720
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,250
They wore them when they were young.

721
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,650
I knitted them myself.

722
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,250
Back then, when I was young,

723
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,050
I had good skills at this,

724
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,250
though I can't do this now.

725
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,010
I never thought this baby cot

726
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,650
is still usable until today.

727
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,010
I was thinking,

728
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,570
I'll leave it for their future children.

729
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,890
They were so close when they were young.

730
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,970
Why did they separate when they grew up?

731
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,650
When Ruo was about two years old,

732
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,170
her family moved to Huize,

733
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,690
and we didn't meet each other for years.

00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,170
But, fate is

735
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,770
