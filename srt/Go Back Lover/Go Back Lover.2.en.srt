(Spring 2013, 16 years old, Winter
Break of Second Year of High School)

4
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,150
(The door has been opened.)

5
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,620
It's fine if she didn't pick me up,

6
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,950
now she doesn't even leave a light on.

7
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,030
I'm really her own child.

8
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,900
Who are you?

9
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,750
Lu Xingyan?

10
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,230
I'm asking who you are.

11
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,190
No smoking in my room.

12
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,390
To hold a lighter means to smoke?

13
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,690
I can still use it to light incense
on your grave.

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,070
Hi, Aunt Pei.

15
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,700
Madam Pei, it hurts.

16
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,190
Let go of me.

17
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,540
Lu Xingyan, what's wrong with you?

18
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,140
You came to a girl's room at night

19
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
and made a lot of noise.

20
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,350
If I'm not mistaken,
this is my room, right?

21
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,860
Not from tonight.

22
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,410
I've only been away for a few days

23
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,470
and she's got this room?

24
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,300
Shut up and obey.

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,360
You've got thick skin.
You can sleep anywhere.

26
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,470
Ruo.

27
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,260
Aunt Pei.

28
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
You're still up?

29
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,980
Did this brat wake you up?

30
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,510
No, I'm just a little bit thirsty.

31
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,230
What's with the cough?

32
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,820
Get a glass of water now.
Make sure it's warm.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,020
What's wrong? You've got a cold?

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
The wind must have blown you cold

35
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,390
when he broke in.

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,390
You can't just get sick
right after you get here.

37
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,420
It breaks my heart.

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,390
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,700
Let me get you a blanket.

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,470
Okay.

41
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,790
Come on, you're taking too long
to pour a glass of water.

42
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,950
Coming.

43
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,980
You're a good actress.

44
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,670
Thank you.

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,580
What are you muttering about?

46
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,470
Who's she?

47
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,390
Don't you have to introduce her to me?

48
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,350
Come on.

49
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,580
Let me introduce him to you.

50
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,580
This is my no-good son,

51
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,390
Lu Xingyan.

52
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,790
He's got a temper
and he's not a smart talker.

53
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,300
If he ever bullies you,

54
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,670
let me know right away

55
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,790
and I'll deal with him.

56
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,390
Listen carefully,

57
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,350
This is your Uncle Shen's daughter.

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,980
I've told you many times

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,070
that you were born on the same day,
in the same year, in the same month.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,630
One was born in the early hours
of the morning,

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,010
the other in the middle of the night.

62
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,490
The stars could be seen at that time.

63
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,990
That's why your names

64
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,870
have the word "Xing" in them.
[*Xing means the star.]

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,340
Right, I've got some pictures here.

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,220
You're wearing the same

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,660
open-crotch pants as Ruo

68
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,390
in your one-year-old pictures.

69
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,430
Look at this.

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,340
Madam Pei, it's late now.

71
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,690
We have to report for school tomorrow.

72
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
You know that?

73
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,950
Ruo Ruo will be transferred

74
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,340
to Mingli from this term,

75
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,850
and will live in our house from now on.

76
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,390
Take good care of her at school.

77
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,190
Do you hear me?

78
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,900
The college entrance exam
is a year and a half away.

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,950
What's she doing here so early?

80
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,870
Shut up, why do you have so much to say?

81
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,780
Ruo,

82
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,460
this brat's grades

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,550
are a mess.

84
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,630
Help me to supervise him
and help him to improve his grades.

85
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,700
All right, it's late. Get some rest.

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,870
Okay. Good night, Aunt Pei.

87
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,580
Good night.

88
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,140
Let's go. Close the door.

89
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,460
Come on.

Double-Star Team.

97
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,140

Yes, when they're on that variety show,

98

(will invite Double-Star CP as guests)
the guy proposed to the girl.

99

Yes.

What are you all doing here

107
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,340
instead of working?

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,700
Xing,

109
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,390
you've been single all these years

110
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,870
without a man around.

111
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,540
I thought you had sworn
to stop being in love.

112
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,070
I didn't expect

113
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,900
you to have half a foot in marriage.

114
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,630
Xing,

115
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,990
I finished reading through

116
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,260
all the posts
about Double-Star CP yesterday.

117
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,430
My keen eyes

118
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,070
and years of experience
in recognizing couples tell me

119
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,460
that you still love each other.

120
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,550
It's not love
you should be discovering now.

121
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,120
It's the guests.

122
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,730
Have you tried to reach out
to the guests you were able to reach?

123
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,780
Get back to work!

124
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,110
Xingruo,

125
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,510
come here.

126
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,340
Today, you just have to do one thing,

127
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,900
convince a guest to join our show.

128
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,510
He's right here in the meeting room.

129
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,750
Talk to him.

130
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,140
If possible, make sure

131
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,700
you get the contract signed today.

132
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,220
Okay?

133
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,990
A guest?

134
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,340
Where did you find this guest?

135
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,070
Well, I have to read his profile first.

136
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,140
You don't need to read his profile.

137
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,110
You know him very well.

138
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,510
You'll know when you meet him.

139
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,120
Okay.

140
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,070
She... She forgot her stuff.

141
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,460
Xingruo.

142
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,510
Wait, you...

143
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,950
Xingruo, wait a minute.

144
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,630
Come on in.

145
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,190
Come on, sit down.

146
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,820
What are you doing?

147
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,950
I don't agree to be
on the show with him.

148
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,510
Xingruo,

149
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,550
it's not a matter
of whether you agree or not.

150
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,780
If I were a friend or a boss,

151
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,950
I wouldn't want to push you.

152
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,580
The point is that Mr. Yang
sent me a voice message.

153
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,460
Zhang, you're amazing.

154
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,950
I asked Shen to find an influencer,

155
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,630
but she turned herself into one.

156
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,220
My daughters and her classmates

157
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,870
used to like Double-Star Team.

158
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,940
They're all excited this morning.

159
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,990
We need both of them

160
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,510
on this show.

161
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,180
Did you hear that?

162
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,020
The investor has given his order.

163
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,350
It's impossible.

164
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,180
There's one more.

165
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,260
No matter what,

166
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,540
I want these two.

167
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,710
Xingruo, just try it.

168
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,940
To save money,

169
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,360
we even laid off our cleaning staff.

170
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,470
Besides, I've been defending the pay

171
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,990
of those employees.

172
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,420
If we don't pass this hurdle,

173
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,470
there's really no tomorrow
for our company.

174
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,940
I'm the producer of the show.

175
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,830
There's no precedent on the market
for a producer

176
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,230
to take part in a romance variety show.

177
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,260
It's inappropriate.

178
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,990
And even if I agree,

179
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,660
Lu Xingyan next door won't agree.

180
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,830
He's fine.

181
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,940
He's very cooperative.

182
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,260
As soon as he heard about the show,

183
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,230
he came into the office early
in the morning to talk to me.

184
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,420
Now all we need is for you to say yes.

185
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,540
Impossible.

186
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,470
I'll take this.

187
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,260
Hello.

188
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,390
I told you

189
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,590
to give me two more days
on the second installment.

190
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,590
I've been busy with meetings

191
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,780
with investors lately.

192
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,590
Do you know what the point is?

193
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,780
The point is
that the finance executive is on leave.

194
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,230
As soon as she gets to work,
I'll settle it for you, okay?

195
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,060
I've heard

196
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,230
that you're dying to be on our show.

197
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,350
I've just gone out to make a preparation

198
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,710
to give you the best briefing.

199
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,540
Didn't you ask me to come?

200
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,180
As the producer and director

201
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,660
of this show,

202
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,940
I'd really like you

203
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,780
to come and join us.

204
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,060
Come on, let me brief you.

205
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,350
Our show

206
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,350
is called Go Back Lover
and it's a romance variety show.

207
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,750
Unlike other variety shows
on the market today,

208
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,870
we focus on two keywords,

209
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,020
ex and first love,

210
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,230
to make people feel nostalgic
about their youth

211
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,420
and thus trigger empathy.

212
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,350
So you're making this show

213
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,830
to reminisce about your exes?

214
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,390
Actually, you can't say that.

215
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,230
Reminiscing about exes

216
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,540
is just a gimmick.

217
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,120
The most important thing about a product

218
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,910
like reminiscence reality shows
is the positioning.

219
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,230
There is no such show
on the market now,

220
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,110
so we are differentiating
ourselves fundamentally

221
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,660
so as to win at the starting line.

222
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,230
I don't want to hear about the show.

223
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,510
Since you want me
to be a guest on the show,

224
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,510
I'd like to ask you

225
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,060
what I can expect

226
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,540
from this partnership.

227
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,710
If you can join us on the show,

228
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,110
we can bring you some promotional help

229
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,990
for your resort.

230
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,060
Our company has its own publicity team.

231
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,020
I agree with what you said
about differentiation.

232
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,260
May I ask

233
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,510
what's the difference
between your publicity

234
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,300
and ours?

235
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,710
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

236
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,470
As you were not

237
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,390
in our consideration before,

238
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,660
we have not

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,750
discussed this issue in detail.

240
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,140
If you are willing to take part
in our variety show,

241
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,260
we can arrange
for the filming of the show

242
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,660
to take place in your resort.

243
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,510
Variety shows take a long time to shoot

244
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,830
and require a lot of scenes.

245
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,300
We can show your resort's
special features and style

246
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,510
thoroughly in the show.

247
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,390
Besides, variety shows
have a very wide audience.

248
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,590
I'm sure the broadcast

249
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,180
will bring a lot of guests

250
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,630
to your resort.

251
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,350
You're a very professional producer.

252
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,750
For the sake of the show,

253
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,500
you's gone so far as to invite your ex
to join the romance variety show

254
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,470
and display your past relationship
to the nation's 1.4 billion audience.

255
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,020
You're so career-minded.

256
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,990
Falling in love and breaking up

257
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,420
is something
that every adult goes through.

258
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,350
As long as you get over it,

259
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,900
there's nothing to be afraid of.

260
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,020
So you've gotten over it,

261
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,590
right?

262
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,830
Of course.

263
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,390
I'm inviting you
to be a guest on the show

264
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,230
as an organizer.

265
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,420
If you're interested...

266
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
I'm not interested.

267
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,630
I'm here today to tell you

268
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,530
that everything about this show
should never be mentioned to me again.

269
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,870
I'm not going to take part in it.

270
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,230
I've got some work to do.
I have to go now.

271
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,230
Mr. Lu.

272
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,590
Lawyer Zhai?

273
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,230
You're back so soon.

274
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,990
Yeah, it's to save money
on accommodation.

275
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,660
And I flew economy class.

276
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,990
As soon as I landed,
I was called back for a meeting.

277
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,350
I've been going around the clock
for 36 hours.

278
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,710
It must be hard on you.

279
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,470
How about this?

280
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,230
When you're rich,

281
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,260
you can hire me to be your full-time lawyer
at your resort

282
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,510
so I don't have to be exploited
by a law firm.

283
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,230
No problem.

284
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,830
Will you arrange business class for me?

285
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,140
Of course.

286
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,630
What?

287
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,590
One of your eyelashes fell out.

288
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,590
You can't just let him go.

289
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,390
If he wasn't interested,

290
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,230
he wouldn't have made
the trip here, would he?

291
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,350
Didn't he say that?

292
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,350
He came here today
to reject me to my face.

293
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,420
That's impossible.

294
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,140
Or didn't you make that clear to him?

295
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,590
How about this? I'll talk to him.

296
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,590
Maybe there's a chance.

297
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,750
I couldn't answer the questions
he asked me.

298
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,710
He asked what good

299
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,020
the show would do for his resort.

300
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,060
I don't know.

301
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,990
If you don't know, find out.

302
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,750
- I...
- Let's split up.

303
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,990
I'll talk to Mr. Yang
about the investment first.

304
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,370
(Incoming Call: Zhai Jiajing)

305
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,630
Hello.

306
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,630
I was careless last night

307
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,260
and I left the file in your office.

308
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,230
Okay, I'll send it back to you.

309
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,540
There's no rush.

310
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,420
Finish your best man duties today.

311
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,140
I'll hang up now. Bye.

312
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,750
What... What's going on?

313
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,780
Isn't he single?

314
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,750
I told you you shouldn't have gone.

315
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,350
I don't know what you're talking about.

316
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,660
Stop it!

317
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,830
Stop it!

318
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,470
We've known each other for years.

319
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,630
I know you very well.

320
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,630
If you're happy, you plant flowers.
If you're not, you do weed.

321
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,630
What happened? Tell me.

322
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,230
What did Shen Xingruo want
to talk to you about?

323
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,020
It's purely work.

324
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,940
Nothing emotional.

325
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,020
Did she really ask you to be a guest?

326
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,750
I went there

327
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,900
to make her give up on it.

328
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,510
Nothing else?

329
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,110
We have nothing more to say.

330
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Qin, you're good cook.

331
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,660
Call Xingruo

332
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,590
and ask where she is.
Why isn't she back yet?

333
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
I just called her. Her line's busy.

334
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,660
She's probably still busy.

335
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,780
She's been really busy lately.

336
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,390
I feel bad for her.

337
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,870
The day I first got here,

338
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,780
she told me she was having nightmares.

339
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,420
I guess she dreamt
about her family again.

340
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,830
What do you think

341
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,780
happened to her family back then?

342
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,900
After all these years,

343
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,300
she still won't tell us.

344
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,780
That's how she is.

345
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,110
Don't you know?

346
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,470
She keeps everything to herself.

347
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,830
She carries all the stress by herself.

348
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,590
I wish we could help her.

349
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,230
- She's back.
- We don't even know

350
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,590
if Lu Xingyan is single,

351
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,260
and you want me to go
to the inn to investigate.

352
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,710
Aren't we wasting our time?

353
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,830
That's why we have to be prepared.

354
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,060
If he's single,

355
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
he's our

356
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,830
most perfect choice for a guest.

357
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,590
You must convince him.

358
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,590
I got it.

359
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,590
I went to the inn this afternoon.

360
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,590
I'll sort out the information

361
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,460
and we'll talk.

362
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,110
Okay, no problem.

363
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,030
I have to go now.

364
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,350
All right, watch out. Watch your hands.

365
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,220
You're awesome, Qin.

366
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,030
You've cooked so much good food today.

367
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,130
What were you busy with today?

368
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,030
Here you go.

369
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,740
Thank you.

370
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,630
I went to Lu Xingyan's inn today.

371
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,070
Zhang Xu wanted
to invite him to join our show.

372
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,660
He came by the office this morning

373
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,070
to talk to us about the promotion
of the resort.

374
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,180
Oh, my God. Isn't that rubbing salt
in your wounds?

375
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,700
What did Lu Xingyan say?

376
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,830
Did he say yes?

377
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,590
He rejected me.

378
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm glad he did.

379
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,630
No.

380
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,700
He's our only choice right now.

381
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,550
Well, you have to look
on the bright side of things.

382
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,900
The fact that he's willing to go
to your office to talk to you

383
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,350
proves that he's still
got ideas about this.

384
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,740
You can just talk to him
about cooperation,

385
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,660
not feelings.

386
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,110
But I think

387
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,070
Lu Xingyan has a girlfriend.

388
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,660
He doesn't fit the criteria of our show.

389
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,180
No way.

390
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,660
Did you hear Xu Chengzhou talk about it?

391
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,030
I think

392
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,460
his relationship
with Zhai Jiajing is not simple.

393
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,870
I saw them this afternoon.

394
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,940
They looked

395
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,110
very intimate.

396
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,790
I remember now.

397
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,660
I think Xu Chengzhou
mentioned it to me once before.

398
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,940
Zhai Jiajing

399
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,700
is the legal advisor of their resort.

400
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,550
Legal...

401
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,350
Lu Xingyan sent her to the airport

402
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,550
to explain the bet.

403
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
I don't think there's anything going on
between them.

404
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,630
No way.

405
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,900
I don't think this is something
I can just guess at.

406
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,180
I'm going to find a way
to get to the bottom of this.

407
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,790
Dig in.

408
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,080
(Aunt Pei)

409
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,940
Answer it.

410
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,270
God has created an opportunity for you

411
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,980
to ask whether Lu Xingyan
has a girlfriend or not.

412
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,790
Xingruo is here.

413
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,700
Xingruo.

414
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,870
Uncle Lu.

415
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,350
Come on in.

416
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,070
Change into slippers.

417
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,110
It's been a long time
since I've seen you.

418
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,310
Long time no see,

419
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,830
You still like fishing so much?

420
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,500
It's my only hobby.

421
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,900
Well, I'm not talking to you today.

422
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,390
My friends are waiting for me.

423
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,790
I'll cook you fish myself

424
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,660
when you come back next time.

425
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,870
I can cook fish very well now.

426
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,980
No problem.

427
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,500
Okay, enjoy. Your Aunt Pei is inside.

428
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,220
Okay, drive safe.

429
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,980
Okay.

430
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,630
Bye.

431
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,310
Aunt Pei.

432
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,940
If I hadn't seen
Chen Zhu's divorce video,

433
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,270
I'd have thought you were still abroad.

434
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,630
You're so ungrateful.

435
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,460
You've been back for two years

436
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,270
and you haven't called me.

437
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,660
If you don't want
to see that brat, that's fine.

438
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,420
Don't you want to see me too?

439
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,980
Aunt Pei,

440
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,870
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,270
If you really want to apologise to me,

442
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,870
then stay with me tonight.

443
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,900
I've been saving that room
of yours for you.

444
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,350
Come on, sit down.

445
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,940
Let me take a good look at you.

446
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,420
Okay? Stay here.

447
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,270
Don't worry.

448
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,870
Just stay here.

449
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,390
Lu Xingyan won't come back.

450
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,460
He moved to the inn a long time ago.

451
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,420
We don't see him at home

452
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,550
until the holidays.

453
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,940
It's been so many years.

454
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,630
I've missed you so much.

455
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,180
I've missed you, too. But I...

456
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,660
I know. You two broke up.

457
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,220
That's between you.

458
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,030
It doesn't affect us.

459
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,750
The three of us are independent
individuals who don't affect each other.

460
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,030
But I...

461
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,180
I know.

462
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,870
It's okay.

463
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,180
Anyway, I'm used to being on my own

464
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,310
for a few years
while you're out of the country.

465
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,420
I don't know if it's menopause lately.

466
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,140
Every day when I look
at this empty room,

467
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,070
I feel depressed

468
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,460
in my heart,

469
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,700
and I can't stop my tears from falling.

470
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,230
I can't help but feel my nose
getting sore just talking about it.

471
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,070
Ruo, don't mind it.

472
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,180
It's menopause.

473
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,610
I'll just get over it.

474
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,870
It's okay. It's all right.

475
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,830
I won't force you.

476
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,550
You don't have to feel bad about it.

477
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,270
Aunt Pei,

478
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,220
actually, I came here today

479
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,270
to keep you company.

480
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,700
You're the sweetest girl
I've ever known.

481
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,660
I've missed you so much.

482
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,140
Come on, let's have some fruits.

483
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Let's go and watch TV.

484
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,830
Let's watch TV.

485
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,220
That variety show I like
is just about to be updated today.

486
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,980
Come on.

487
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,900
Come on, let's have some fruits.

488
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,420
Is that so?

489
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,270
That's the kind of show you do.

490
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,630
So is it on TV soon?

491
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Not yet.

492
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,220
We've been looking for guests lately.

493
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,790
I'm worried about that.

494
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,500
Do you think Lu Xingyan is suitable?

495
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,230
The door has been opened.

496
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,980
He's not a bad choice

497
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,270
for the dating market, right?

498
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,220
Can he be your guest?

499
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,220
Aunt Pei, the requirements for guests

500
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,740
in a romance variety show
are quite high.

501
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,030
Especially being single,

502
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,550
it's our mandatory requirement.

503
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,660
Then he's a perfect candidate.

504
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,220
Since he broke up with you,

505
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,660
he has put all his thoughts
into the resort.

506
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,660
What's that saying?

507
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,940
Right,

508
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,310
he works every day
to numb the pain of his breakup.

509
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,940
Let me put it to you this way.

510
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,970
In the past few years
since you broke up with him,

511
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,940
besides Xu Chengzhou,

512
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,930
he's only been hanging out
with the staff at the resort.

513
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,980
He's always been chaste

514
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,830
and has never been with any other women.

515
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,350
Madam Pei,

516
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,500
if you're drunk, go inside and sleep.

517
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,870
Don't talk nonsense
in front of outsiders.

518
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,180
What brings you home?

519
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,630
You sent me a message
saying something's wrong.

520
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,270
You didn't pick up when I called.

521
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,790
Why do you think I came back?

522
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,140
It's a mistake. I don't know
how to use my new phone,

523
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,110
so I sent the wrong messages.

524
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,460
I see you're doing just fine.

525
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,590
I'm leaving.

526
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,590
Stop there.

527
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,270
I'm drunk.

528
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,790
I just drank too much.

529
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,070
I can't drive.

530
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,420
Lu Xingyan,

531
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,350
take Ruo home for me.

532
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,070
No, I'll just go back myself.

533
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,590
It's late. It's not safe.

534
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,310
She can take a bus.

535
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,940
You won't take her home, huh?

536
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,310
Aunt Pei,

537
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,940
I don't think

538
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,460
he's available to take me home now.

539
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,310
About the show you mentioned,

540
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,790
he doesn't seem
to fit our mandatory requirement.

541
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,180
What... What do you mean by that?

542
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,420
Are you in love?

543
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,070
It can't be.

544
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,630
Aren't you still thinking of Ruo?

545
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,550
I'll take her home.

546
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,180
Producer Shen,

547
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,500
let's go.

548
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,550
We're in the neighborhood.
Just pull over here.

549
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,870
Forget about

550
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,500
what my mom just said.

551
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,990
It's been four years.

552
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,980
That's all in the past.

553
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,740
Don't worry.

554
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,550
I know what to do.

555
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,050
Yu Si

556
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:05,980
Hello.

557
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,310
Xingruo, do you miss me?

558
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,220
What's wrong with you?

559
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,270
Aren't you coming? I'm hanging up.

560
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,740
You and Yu Si

561
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
are still so close.

562
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,030
Yu Si and I

563
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,590
are just friends.

564
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,110
Mr. Lu,

565
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,070
if you have time to care
about other people's love life,

566
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,900
why don't you take care of your own?

567
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,180
I'm not in a relationship,

568
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,520
so I don't need to worry about it.

569
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,830
I'm single now.

570
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,220
If you want to pretend you're single,

571
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,830
you'd better ask

572
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,550
the owner of the sneakers

573
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,180
if she agrees first.

574
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,460
What are you doing?

575
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,700
Wait a minute.

576
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,140
I told you, I'm not wearing these shoes.

577
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,180
Let go of me.

578
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,460
Lu Xingyan.

579
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,930
(2020, Chinese New Year's Eve,
Eight months after the breakup)

580
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,030
Ruo, are you doing all right there?

581
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,500
Do you have enough masks?

582
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,420
Do you have any alcohol in the house?

583
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,870
It's all enough. Look.

584
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,420
And a thermometer.

585
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,310
Mr. Lu, so you still know your way home.

586
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,550
That's rare.

587
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,310
Those are Ruo's shoes.

588
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,180
I just put it away today
when I was cleaning.

589
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,210
I'm trying to figure out
what to do about it.

590
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
I'll throw them away.

591
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,030
They're returned to their owner now.

592
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,270
I thought

593
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
you'd thrown them away.

594
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,550
I should've thrown them away.

595
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,550
I kept them to remind me

596
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,390
of how stupid I was.

597
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,550
You're home. I'm leaving.

598
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,660
Wait.

599
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,420
I still want to talk to you

600
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,030
about having you as a guest
on the show.

601
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,420
I told you

602
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,500
I wanted to film our variety show

603
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,870
at your resort.

604
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,110
I went

605
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,140
to your inn the other day.

606
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,870
I found that it's changed a lot
in the past few years.

607
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,220
The idyllic and relaxing atmosphere

608
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,180
that you've created

609
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,630
is sure to be appealing

610
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,420
to everyone with our publicity.

611
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,550
You have a good eye for things.

612
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,500
I've also made a proposal
that incorporates our show's

613
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,310
promotional points.
Please take a look.

614
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,460
(Go Back Lover)

615
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
(and Sun Inn's Cooperation Proposal)
Nowadays, there are a lot

616
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,900
of promotional cases in the market
that combine variety shows

617
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,550
with hotels, attractions and resorts.

618
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,270
I have attached the successful cases.

619
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,390
Please take a look.

620
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,140
I'd really like to know

621
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,590
why this guest

622
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,790
has to be me.

623
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,900
There's a lot of buzz

624
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,310
on the Internet right now
about Double-Star Team.

625
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,390
We've analyzed the data.

626
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,500
This kind of buzz

627
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,420
is very good for your inn

628
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,310
and for the promotion

629
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,700
of our show.

630
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,660
So I think

631
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,550
this is a win-win for both of us.

632
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,460
That's it?

633
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,420
Do you have any other questions?

634
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,030
All right.

635
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,460
Thank you.

636
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,350
Thank you for being so serious
in preparing for this,

637
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,270
but I'll have to think about it.

638
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,700
No problem.

639
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,390
You can think about it.

640
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,980
I'll send you an email

641
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,420
with the documents.

642
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
I really hope you'll read through

643
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,790
the successful cases in the back.

644
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,180
I will definitely read it.

645
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,980
It's late. Get some rest.

646
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,350
I think Shen Xingruo is right.

647
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,230
Are you sure you don't want
to think about it?

648
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,590
And we...

649
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
So you think

650
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,940
I should go?

651
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,900
How do you feel

652
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,660
when you get along with each other?

653
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,310
Nothing.

654
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,220
Nothing?

655
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,630
Nonsense.

656
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,590
You feel nothing?

657
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,870
Ask the plants in this garden

658
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,900
if they believe you.

659
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,700
Well, ask them

660
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,180
and see if they can talk.

661
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,900
Lu Xingyan,

662
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,940
we've known each other
for so many years.

663
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,030
If you really want
to know the answer,

664
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,830
you can't ignore your inner thoughts.

665
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,660
To be honest,

666
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,110
I'm very happy

667
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,110
that she came to me.

668
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,740
After all these years,

669
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,070
it would be a lie
if I said I never wanted

670
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,660
to start over with her.

671
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,940
But I've noticed
that she doesn't seem to want to.

672
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,220
Yes.

673
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,530
When it comes to relationships,
whoever makes the first move loses.

674
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,660
I don't really care
about winning or losing.

675
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,900
I'm afraid

676
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,750
that if I'm too proactive
and aggressive,

677
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,670
I'll push her away again.

678
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,270
After getting along
with her a few times,

679
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,100
I realised that we're back

680
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,420
to being normal friends again.

681
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,750
That's good, actually.

682
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,150
Good?

683
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,580
Fine.

684
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,220
In the vast wide world, your happiness
is the most important thing.

685
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,900
Do whatever you want.

686
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,870
I wonder what Shen Xingruo would think

687
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,020
if she heard you say that.

688
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,710
Bye.

689
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,460
So does your show

690
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,150
set an end point

691
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,420
for the guests' romantic paths?

692
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,020
We don't demand

693
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,020
the romantic paths of our guests.

694
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,710
We respect the wishes of our guests

695
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,310
if they are not suitable for each other.

696
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,620
We will never force them.

697
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,530
(Behind-the-scenes Interview
of Go Back Lover)

698
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,210
Over the years,

699
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,290
have you tried
to find out how he's doing?

700
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,050
(Have you tried
to find out how he's doing?)

701
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,850
No.

702
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,970
But, you know, we have

703
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,650
a lot of friends in common,

704
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,330
so I know

705
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,210
a little bit about him.

706
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,130
We were high school friends,

707
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,050
so it's not surprising
that I know a little bit about her.

708
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,050
Then why didn't you

709
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,730
reach out to her when you got back?

710
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,050
I could have,

711
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,730
but I didn't have to.

712
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,330
Seeing that she's doing well,

713
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,250
I don't want to bother her.

714
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,770
So you got the call the other day

715
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,090
and came over early in the morning
just to reject her to her face?

716
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,030
Hello.

717
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,060
Hi, are you Mr. Lu Xingyan?

718
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,000
Yes.

719
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,710
Who are you?

720
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,020
I'm Zhang Xu from Star Entertainment

721
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,940
and Shen Xingruo's business partner.

722
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,580
How may I help you?

723
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,710
Here's the thing.

724
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,870
Our company

725
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,830
is doing a romance variety show

726
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,670
called Go Back Lover.

727
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,460
This show

728
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,390
is actually planned by Xingruo

729
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,460
to reminisce
about her first love and ex.

730
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,100
That's you.

731
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,980
So we'd like to invite you

732
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,230
to join us on this show

733
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,540
to be paired with Xingruo.

734
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,710
If you are interested,

735
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,230
can you come to our company
to have a talk with us?

736
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,820
Why would the audience want to see us?

737
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,190
Watching us fight?

738
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,310
Or watching us

739
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,060
look back on our failed relationship?

740
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,190
Mr. Lu, don't rush to answer

741
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,940
I don't know if I'm right.

742
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,230
A lot of people

743
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,230
initially break up on impulse.

744
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,390
But now that it's been so long,

745
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,230
you've calmed down

746
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,420
after a while.

747
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,620
And we're making this show

748
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,150
to see if there's still a possibility

749
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,460
of a fresh start between exes.

750
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,900
Why didn't Shen Xingruo call me?

751
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,230
Girls are so thin-skinned.

752
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,940
After all the years you've been apart,
how could she bring this up to you?

753
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,830
She'd feel embarrassed.

754
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,580
When would be convenient for you?

755
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,940
Let me check my schedule.

756
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,460
I've got a little time now.

757
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,670
Is that so? That's great.

758
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,580
I'll send you the company's address
right away.

759
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,230
Okay.

760
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,500
Xing, I've discussed a few more
publicity plans with them.

761
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,310
Take a look.

762
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,060
Leave it there. I'll read it later.

763
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,500
Who are you going to meet?

764
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,990
Why do you have to be so dressed up?

765
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,670
Shen Xingruo's company

766
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,980
asked me to join a romance variety show.

767
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,030
Shen Xingruo asked you
to join a romance variety show?

768
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,100
Which of these two is better?

769
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,060
Which one?

770
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,350
Neither one is good.

771
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,500
Exes meet and whoever
doesn't get over it loses first.

772
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,720
The more you dress up, the more
you look like you can't get over it.

773
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,580
You forgot how long it took you
to get over it

774
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,030
after Shen Xingruo dumped you, right?

775
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,490
You've only been well for two years.

776
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,330
One phone call
and you're back to your old ways?

777
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,710
And you can't resist flying to her?

778
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,900
Listen, it's not me
who can't resist flying to her.

779
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,420
They asked me to work with them.

780
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,270
Just lie to yourself.

781
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,390
I've got to go buy a suit.

782
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,350
Bye.

783
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,190
He can't wait to be back
to his old ways?

784
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,450
(Meeting Room)

785
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,190
Mr. Lu.

786
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,810
Mr. Lu.

787
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,250
(Have you tried
to find out how she's doing?)

788
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,250
You haven't answered the question.

789
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,250
So you got the call the other day
and came over early in the morning

790
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,890
just to reject her to her face?

791
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,810
Yes. What else would it be?

792
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:47,001
