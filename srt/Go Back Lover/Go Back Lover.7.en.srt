00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,850
(2013)

4
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,780
Madam Pei will not be at home today.

5
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,320
She asked me to bring you out to eat.

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,270
What are we eating?

7
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,860
Do you eat rice noodle rolls?

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,630
No.

9
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,660
What about pizza?

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,470
No.

11
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,920
Let's eat some barbecued meat.

12
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,710
No.

13
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,020
What do you want to eat?

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,430
This is too spicy.

15
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,910
Here. You can have the milk.

16
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,550
Thank you.

17
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,710
This level of spiciness

18
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,860
is just mildly spicy in Huize.

19
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,140
Mildly spicy?

20
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,580
The food that mom usually cooks
is very bland.

21
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,990
Can you get used to it?

22
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,350
Madam Pei is being kind to me.

23
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,710
Besides, I eat anything.

24
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,780
So, did you act
like a good girl in front of her

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,660
to make her happy?

26
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,300
Madam Pei is just being kind.

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,340
And I don't think
it's that difficult to do.

28
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,510
So, did you call me
the queen of actresses

29
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,270
because of this?

30
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,860
You can't blame me.

31
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,300
After all, my first impression
of you is...

32
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,950
What is it?

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,110
Pretentious.

34
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,180
You are so tough at school

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,990
and play with a lighter
single-handedly at my house.

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,390
But in front of my mom,

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,430
you turn into a fragile little girl.

38
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,210
Aren't you the queen of actresses?

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,430
Lu Xingyan.

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,180
Your result is not that good.

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,340
But you are good at imagining things.

42
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,430
Shen Xingruo.

43
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,020
Do you feel uncomfortable
unless you criticize me every day?

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,530
You have so many things
to be criticized for.

45
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,570
(Shen Guangyao)

46
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,050
(Shen Guangyao)

47
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,230
Your phone is ringing.

48
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,390
Why don't you pick up
the call from your dad?

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,450
It's none of your business.

50
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,530
What color do you want to eat,
my darling?

51
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,710
The pink one.

52
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,110
Here you go.

53
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,830
Okay. Thank you.

54
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,900
Here you go.

55
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,860
Thank you, Dad.

56
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,830
This is great. Let's sit down
and enjoy it, okay?

57
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,230
Here. Take it.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,620
Give it a taste.

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,740
Let's smell it first.

60
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,030
I'll get the bill.

61
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,150
Hello.

62
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,790
Can I get one for my sister?

63
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,820
Who's your sister?

64
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,430
The one with the ponytail.

65
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,590
She's my sister.

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,990
My name is Xingyan. Her name is Xingruo.

67
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,260
Well...

68
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,180
If you don't believe me,
you can call her by her name.

69
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,430
See if she'll answer.

70
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,910
Xingruo.

71
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,740
Okay.

72
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,820
Take it.

73
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,620
Thank you.

74
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,060
Take this.

75
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,380
Did you lie for a cotton candy?

76
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,620
I didn't lie.

77
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,430
You live in my house now.

78
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,700
So, we are a family.

79
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,590
And you were born
a few hours later than me.

80
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,860
So, you are my sister.

81
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,030
Any problem with that?

82
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,450
=Episode 7=

83
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,970
(Spiciness is not a flavor,
it's a taste of pain.)

84
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,370
(Fried Potato, 2024)

85
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,670
Lu Xingyan.

86
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,260
What did you say

87
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,740
about just now?

88
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,740
I said, should we

89
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,480
buy another portion
of the fried potatoes?

90
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm still hungry.

91
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,350
You add so much chili powder
to your fried potatoes.

92
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,180
When has your tolerance for spice
improved so much?

93
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,860
I can eat spicy food now.

94
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,670
Boss.

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,030
Give me another portion of potatoes.

96
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,720
Have you placed it?

97
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,300
Be careful.

98
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,480
Okay.

99
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,110
Come.

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,500
Who gave you the permission to start?

101
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Stop right now.

102
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,600
Stop!

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,860
Stop.

104
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,550
Who gave you the permission to start?

105
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,990
Me, Xingruo.

106
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,350
We'll start filming next week, right?

107
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,740
But they haven't set up the equipment
at the main scene yet.

108
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,180
I don't want that to cause a delay.

109
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,030
You were not here.

110
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,780
So, I asked them
to start setting things up.

111
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm the one who asked them to stop.

112
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,110
The house is not protected yet.

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,380
We have to pay them
for every day that they are here.

114
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,820
Is it that important
to protect the house?

115
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,860
Site planning is the job
of the production team.

116
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,260
You are just an intern director.

117
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,570
Why are you butting
into the production team's job

118
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,860
instead of working
on the guests and the script?

119
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,820
I'm just concerned about our project.

120
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,620
After all, my dad is...

121
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,990
I don't care who you are.

122
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,060
Pack your things and leave at once.

123
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,790
I'm just trying to speed things up

124
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,060
to not disappoint our investors.

125
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,380
Mr. Lu.

126
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,260
You are one of the investors too.

127
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,740
What do you think?

128
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,030
The rate of progress of the project

129
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,550
depends fully on Producer Shen.

130
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,790
You acted on your own and
destroyed the main scene.

131
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,100
I hope

132
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,550
that it won't happen again.

133
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,630
The protection materials
that I bought have arrived.

134
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,030
Cover the place up right now.

135
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,820
Let's get to work.

136
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,630
Come on. Let's go.

137
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,630
Let's lay down protective materials.

138
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,340
Hurry up. Give me a hand.

139
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,030
Dad.

140
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,460
I'm so mad right now.

141
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,750
I'm here

142
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,220
at the village of the resort
that's going to be the main scene.

143
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,100
But as a producer, Shen Xingruo

144
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,870
asked the workers to stop working.

145
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,750
Then she told me arrogantly

146
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,870
to know my place.

147
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,300
She humiliated me in front of everyone.

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,750
Why don't you understand?

149
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm not talking about money.

150
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,390
I'm talking about her.

151
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,820
She's different from
how she looks on TV.

152
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,910
Her public persona is fake.

153
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,580
She doesn't deserve Lu Xingyan.

154
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,580
I'm telling you

155
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,150
how she's singling me out.

156
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm not asking about more pocket money.

157
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,180
Fine. Transfer it to my card.

158
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,150
Hello?

159
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,300
Even without you,

160
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,340
I can take her down.

161
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,220
Thank you for laying down
the protective materials with us.

162
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,980
Don't mention it.
We are business partners.

163
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,180
Aren't you afraid
that you'll get into trouble

164
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,430
by offending the daughter of your boss?

165
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,060
Of course I am.

166
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,820
Everyone is afraid of their clients.

167
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,980
But the shooting
hasn't even started yet.

168
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,220
And yet, she had already
tried taking over.

169
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,180
If I didn't stop her today,

170
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,390
who would listen to me

171
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,670
when we start shooting?

172
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,700
So,

173
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,460
you lectured her in front of everyone

174
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,670
to secure your power.

175
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,430
I didn't lecture her.

176
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,150
I was just being reasonable.

177
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,910
I just wanted to let her know

178
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,430
that I can't be bullied.

179
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,580
I remember that when I first

180
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,670
received a production job,

181
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,870
I cherished that opportunity so much.

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,460
So, whenever someone told me something,

183
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,700
I would agree

184
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,180
and say yes.

185
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,750
In the end,
everything went against my plan.

186
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,390
When we finally got
to the shooting part,

187
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,630
no one

188
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,940
listened to me at all.

189
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,870
When the progress got delayed,

190
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,790
I started to get anxious.

191
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,750
I remember that when I woke up
in the morning one day,

192
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,700
I looked in the mirror

193
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,580
and saw a bald spot on my head.

194
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,460
I was shocked.

195
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,870
And I broke down in front of the mirror.

196
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,390
But what was the point of crying?

197
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,180
No one would understand.

198
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,790
They would just think

199
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,800
that you were too weak
to handle the pressure.

200
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,220
Where's that bald spot? I don't see it.

201
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,870
It has been so long.

202
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,820
Of course it's gone now.

203
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,340
Did you find a solution for that?

204
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,030
No.

205
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,980
But I found a way

206
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,980
to set me free.

207
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,630
After that, I realized

208
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,100
that when it comes to work,

209
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,510
you can't apply
the same rules to everything.

210
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,790
Everyone is finding their own way
while moving forward.

211
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,820
Maybe one day,

212
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,820
I'll find the solution.

213
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,630
Maybe

214
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,150
I'll find it when I retire.

215
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,510
You are thinking quite far ahead.

216
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,060
So,

217
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,750
as my client,

218
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,750
I will do my best to figure out

219
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,390
the way to get along with you.

220
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,460
Actually, you don't
have to figure it out.

221
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,150
You just have

222
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,460
to be honest

223
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,430
with me.

224
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,300
I'm not bold enough to be my true self

225
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,940
in front of my client.

226
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,620
You don't have
to think of me as a client.

227
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,750
I hope that you can

228
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,390
say whatever you want to me.

229
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,630
Why are you laughing?

230
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,390
I'm being serious.

231
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,300
Lu Xingyan.

232
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,980
Sometimes, I think

233
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,980
that if we didn't get together

234
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,220
in the first place,

235
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,870
we would

236
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
be best friends now.

237
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,220
Aren't we best friends now?

238
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,940
We are still best friends.

239
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,180
After so many years,

240
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,940
I still feel the most at ease
when I'm with you.

241
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,510
Me too.

242
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,630
So,

243
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,580
being friends

244
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,390
is the best relationship mode for us.

245
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,980
Am I right, Lu Xingyan?

246
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,910
Let's drink.

247
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,980
Shen.

248
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,150
What?

249
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,550
You went to the building material market
with Lu Xingyan by yourself?

250
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,100
Calm down.

251
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,940
It's not a big deal.

252
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,390
Be honest with me.

253
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,150
What did the two of you do?

254
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,060
We didn't do anything.

255
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,610
We went to the building material market.

256
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,940
Then

257
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,910
we had a drink or two.

258
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
You had a drink or two?

259
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,150
The two of you even drank together
by yourselves.

260
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,060
Then? Was that it?

261
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,820
Impossible.

262
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,580
With the light night breeze
and the twinkling stars,

263
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,300
they drank together,
enjoyed the breeze together,

264
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,500
and looked at each other lovingly.

265
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,750
She came back so late.

266
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,510
Shen Xingruo.

267
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,300
What a fool you were.

268
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,030
That's not true.

269
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,700
Nothing happened between us.

270
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:58,980
Really?

271
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,580
Was your heart not affected either?

272
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,700
My heart

273
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,270
was affected.

274
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,020
But I'll forget everything
tomorrow morning.

275
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,550
Does it mean

276
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,340
that you are falling
for Lu Xingyan again?

277
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Well.

278
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,390
It's impossible not to fall for him.

279
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
Just a little bit.

280
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,300
But we have both agreed

281
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,060
that the current situation

282
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,030
between us is the best for us.

283
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,300
We are friends.

284
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,980
And we are business partners.

285
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,750
We get along very well with each other.

286
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,910
If both of us

287
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,100
take a step further,

288
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,700
I'm worried

289
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,300
that the past will repeat itself.

290
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,360
So, we'll just stop here.

291
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,430
But Chen Zhu,

292
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,430
stop nagging.

293
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm exhausted today.

294
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,390
Let me rest.

295
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,940
By the way,

296
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,740
the Follow PD of the variety show

297
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,180
will meet you tomorrow

298
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,180
to take some pre-shooting footage.

299
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,310
If the two of you have nothing to do,

300
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,220
think about

301
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,020
what you want to show them tomorrow.

302
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,870
Are we not allowed to go anywhere

303
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,110
as soon as the shooting starts?

304
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,590
Tomorrow, you'll move into the villa.

305
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,070
You can do whatever you want.

306
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,310
Go to work.

307
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,740
You'll be followed by a Follow PD

308
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,940
to get some footage taken.

309
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,430
Your Saturdays and Sundays
will be set as your dating days.

310
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,930
So, you'll be filmed more
on these two days.

311
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,700
It means that our daily life

312
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,430
will be exposed to the camera.

313
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,590
No.

314
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,910
If they want to start filming,

315
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,540
the scenarist will tell you in advance.

316
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,020
Do I need to prepare
anything in advance?

317
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,780
You don't have to do anything.

318
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,350
Just be your true self and you'll be fine.

319
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,590
I can't do it.

320
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,590
When so many cameras at pointing at me,

321
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,670
I'll get nervous and I'll panic,
Xingruo.

322
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,780
Don't worry.

323
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,070
If it's necessary, the scenarist
will hold up a sign at the back

324
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,980
to tell you what to do next.

325
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,390
Do I have to sleep with make-up on?

326
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,110
This is a variety show,

327
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,460
not a drama.

328
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,150
Besides, you are a goddess.

329
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,460
What are you worried about?

330
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,830
You just have

331
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,630
to be natural

332
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,910
and live your life as it is.

333
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,220
I can't do that.

334
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,110
This show will be aired
for the whole nation to watch.

335
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,670
I need to keep a perfect image

336
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,540
in front of the whole nation.

337
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,020
That's enough, Ms. Zhu.

338
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,500
Let me see.

339
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,700
Can we film it again?

340
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,150
I think you can

341
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,780
move the camera higher

342
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,220
so that my face will look smaller.

343
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,540
Do you think I should change the color

344
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,980
of my lipstick?

345
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,500
Now that I look at it,
I think it's a little bit too wild.

346
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,780
I don't think you've captured

347
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,590
my aura as a career woman.

348
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,070
You look beautiful already.

349
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,700
We are just taking unedited footage now.

350
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,020
We haven't added the filters.

351
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,310
We've filmed you eight times.

352
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,590
When we edit it,

353
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,020
I'm sure we can showcase

354
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,390
your unique charm
as the startup owner of your cafe.

355
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,390
Really?

356
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,150
Yes.

357
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay. I trust you.

358
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,730
You are the professional here.

359
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,070
We are filming here today.

360
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,330
What about Lu Xingyan and the others?

361
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,150
Who's in charge?

362
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,260
He has another team following him.

363
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,260
I don't have to be there.

364
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,020
Is it because you don't have to be there

365
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,350
or because you are scared.

366
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,980
Fine.

367
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,260
Let's remove the soft light.

368
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,630
Let's just use the harsh light.

369
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,500
You can't do that.

370
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,110
Otherwise,

371
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,070
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,910
Our cafe is not for lent.

373
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,180
Ms. Zhu.

374
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,940
Later, we'll give you a front light.

375
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,740
We can capture your great beauty

376
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,540
from all angles.

377
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,830
So,

378
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,870
I'm really thankful to you

379
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,020
for lending us your cafe

380
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,120
as a shooting site for free.

381
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,110
That's right.

382
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,980
We've come so far.

383
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,590
My comrades, my friends,

384
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
my family.

385
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,930
We are going to start shooting tomorrow.

386
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,430
I hope that in the near future,

387
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,780
we can work hard together

388
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,390
to make this a success.

389
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,780
Next, let us welcome Xingruo
to give us a few words.

390
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,150
Actually, when I first

391
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,740
saw our proposal,

392
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,070
my heart was racing.

393
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,910
It was not because
it reminded me of my ex.

394
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,910
But because I was excited.

395
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,910
We found a great entry point

396
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,830
in the current relationship we face now.

397
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,110
I'm the producer of this show.

398
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,730
At the same time, I'm the audience too.

399
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,740
I really look forward to our show.

400
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,020
I believe

401
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,540
that our audience will feel the same.

402
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,700
All of you here are my colleagues.

403
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,350
And you are my family.

404
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,460
We've gone through so much

405
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,260
to be where we are today.

406
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,630
I hope that
when the shooting starts tomorrow,

407
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,430
we can

408
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,150
do our best and give 120%

409
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,780
to complete

410
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,910
this project that we will be proud of.

411
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,940
Good.

412
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,670
Well said, Producer Shen.

413
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,830
But I want

414
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,070
to voice out an issue.

415
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,020
All of you here know

416
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,390
that we don't have

417
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,830
enough manpower right now.

418
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,830
So, all of the scenarists here

419
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,260
will have to follow an extra guest.

420
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,220
Each of you has to follow one couple.

421
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,700
By doing so,
you can get the latest update

422
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,630
on the couple

423
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,940
and report it to the director.

424
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,590
I have no question.

425
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,070
But

426
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,260
should we treat Ms. Xingruo

427
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,260
like other guests?

428
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,260
Because when it comes to our positions,

429
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,070
Ms. Xingruo is our boss.

430
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,700
And we need to report

431
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,910
our work to her.

432
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,020
But if we do that,

433
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,430
we can't ensure

434
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,910
the authenticity of our show.

435
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,220
How about this?

436
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,780
From today onward,

437
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,830
I will not take part

438
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,910
in any of the planning of the show.

439
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,700
I'll just be in charge of
the progress and budget of the show.

440
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
As for the planning and the scenarists,

441
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,390
Director Jun will take over.

442
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,180
During the shooting period,

443
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,910
I won't take part in both

444
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,540
the preliminary shooting
and also the footage editing

445
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,870
at the end of the shooting.

446
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,720
But there's something
I want to stress on.

447
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,830
I don't want

448
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,540
anyone to agitate

449
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,020
the guests

450
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,390
and cause trouble
just for the sake of gimmick.

451
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,070
I agree.

452
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,590
Don't create any trouble on purpose

453
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,350
for contents.

454
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,020
Focus on our theme of youth, nostalgia,

455
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,910
and healing.

456
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,390
You are right.

457
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,220
Before I came here,

458
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,310
my dad already reminded me of that.

459
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,220
This is my first time being a scenarist.

460
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,390
I hope that I can learn from all of you,

461
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,110
especially Ms. Xingruo.

462
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,110
You can team up with Xingruo, then.

463
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,150
Let her guide you.

464
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,070
Sure.

465
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,220
When you go home, tell your dad

466
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,180
that Xingruo and I
worked together on many big projects

467
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,020
before we decided
to open our own company.

468
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,940
So, pairing up with her

469
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,220
will be the best for you.

470
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,540
Are you happy?

471
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,310
Yes.

472
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,870
Are you glad?

473
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,630
Yes.

474
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,040
Are you okay with that?

475
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,870
Sure.

476
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,460
Okay.

477
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,220
It's late now.

478
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,740
Let's go back and rest earlier.

479
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,870
We have a great fight tomorrow.

480
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,460
- All the best.

The Sun Inn

556
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,940
can let you enjoy the beauty
of the city between sunrise and sunset.

557
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,150
That advertising line is too obvious.

558
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,260
I think he's trying to brainwash

559
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,630
the viewers.

560
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,670
Yes.

561
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,740
It's too awkward.

562
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,460
It's not that bad.

563
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,500
Xingruo, Qin!

564
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,970
All of our schoolmates are here.

565
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,170
Here. Let me take a look at you.

566
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,070
You look pretty.

567
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,830
Let me tell you.

568
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,740
Can you keep Xu Chengzhou under control?

569
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,670
I can't take it anymore.

570
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,020
He's so pretentious.

571
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,180
Zhu, you don't have to whisper.

572
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,350
You are wearing a mic.

573
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,670
What you say will be recorded.

574
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,780
I'm saying

575
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,980
that Xu Chengzhou's performance

576
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,590
was too unnatural just now.

577
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,350
You can just cut out his part.

578
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,110
You can't do that.

579
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,390
I was complimenting Sun Inn sincerely.

580
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,310
Besides, you are pretentious too.

581
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,980
Who was facing the camera

582
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,180
at a 45-degree angle
to the right just now?

583
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,350
I was just trying to give
our audience better visual

584
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,740
by showing them the best of me.

585
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,110
And you were wrong.

586
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,690
It was a 45-degree angle to the left.

587
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,980
Let me remind you.

588
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,940
Just now, you bribed me with a bag

589
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,460
to advertise for you.

590
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,110
All of your words have been recorded.

591
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,430
Mr. Lu.

592
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,180
Stop looking.

593
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,310
The cameras are placed
all over the house.

594
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,980
Everything you do here

595
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,220
will be recorded.

596
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,740
I know.

597
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,740
Are there

598
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,500
cameras in the washrooms too?

599
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,670
Don't worry.

600
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,120
There will be no camera
in the washrooms.

601
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,590
We just need to live

602
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,460
our lives as usual here.

603
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,170
You may not be able
to get used to it at first.

604
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
But you will.

605
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,780
Will I look too foolish?

606
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,670
Everyone in the nation can watch this.

607
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,390
What do you mean by looking foolish?

608
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,980
You are foolish.

609
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,830
Don't worry.

610
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,070
We will cut out those inappropriate

611
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,630
lines and clips.

612
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,670
Will this get recorded too?

613
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,540
This line will be cut out too.

614
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,740
I feel better now.

615
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,630
I was exhausted just now.

616
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,670
He Siyue.

617
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,390
What do you think?

618
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,430
Say something.

619
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,880
I think it's nice.

620
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,740
Say more.

621
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,830
What do you think about Sun Inn?

622
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,630
It's nice.

623
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,800
Even the author thinks
that this place is nice.

624
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,780
Thumb's up for Sun Inn.

625
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,780
Put your thumb up.

626
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
He's at it again.

627
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,630
Qin.

628
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,540
What do you think?

629
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,630
I'm really happy to be

630
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,180
in the same show as you.

631
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,730
(Eat Hotpot)

632
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,070
Okay now.

633
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,780
Since all of us are here,

634
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,310
let's have lunch.

635
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,780
We'll eat hotpot today.

636
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:05,780
Hotpot is good.

637
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,150
The hotpot of Sun Inn!

638
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,260
I can't deal with him anymore.

639
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,230
Don't force yourself
if you can't stand the spice.

640
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,020
Thank you.

641
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,730
(Sun Inn)

642
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,670
Siyue.

643
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,940
We've been eating for an hour.

644
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,980
The food is delicious.

645
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,180
Don't you have anything to say?

646
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,980
To spend a day like this is amazing.

647
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,310
Can you be natural?

648
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,390
You are like a robot.

649
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,020
But

650
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,980
you were right.

651
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,670
However, what makes us happy
is not the hotpot

652
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,630
but this ecology that we are in,

653
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,670
surrounded by a
pollution-free agriculture base.

654
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,870
We don't use
any preservatives or pesticides

655
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,390
in Sun Inn's vegetable garden

656
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,980
for your health.

657
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,020
What nonsense are you talking about?

658
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,910
What were you yapping about?

659
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,220
What has it got to do with

660
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,010
what He Siyue said?

661
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,500
I've been to many hotels.

662
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,630
This is the best.

663
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,020
Said something.

664
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,110
This is not just my inn.

665
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,260
My six million is gone.

666
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,630
Xingruo.

667
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,700
He's terrible.

668
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,940
Hurry up and cut him out.

669
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,180
Mr. Xu.

670
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,020
Please advertise in moderation.

671
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,940
Otherwise, it'll affect

672
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,450
the enjoyment and quality of the show.

673
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,460
I'll eat. I won't talk anymore.

674
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,630
There's only one fish ball left.

675
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,220
Why should you eat it?

676
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,110
- What are you doing?
- I want it.

677
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,700
I'm sorry.

678
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,110
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

679
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,870
You've hurt the innocent.

680
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,220
I'm sorry.

681
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,540
Why do I feel like this scene

682
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,590
looks familiar?

683
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,110
I think so too.

684
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,460
After our college entrance exam
back then,

685
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,940
we celebrated their birthday for them.

686
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,220
I think a meatball

687
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,350
fell onto Shen Xingruo's lap.

688
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,390
Hurry up!

689
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,590
Lu Xingyan!

690
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,740
You are about to win!

691
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,910
- Lu Xingyan!
- Hurry up!

692
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,700
Congratulations on winning
this competition.

693
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,980
You lost.

694
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,690
I'm not in a good shape today.

695
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,910
Why are you drinking instead of eating?

696
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,110
We are finally 18.

697
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,220
Of course we have to drink.

698
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,410
What should we do after
the college entrance exam?

699
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,780
Enjoy our lives to the fullest.

700
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,700
Am I right, Xing?

701
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,220

729
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,120
And he went to the washroom to vomit.

730
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,750
It was Xingruo who helped him.

731
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,350
You don't know the full story.

732
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,060
That day was the first time
Lu Xingyan confessed to Xingruo.

733
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,620

734

about that?

Let's eat.

736
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,800
Otherwise, it'll get burnt.

737
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,430
We are running out of vegetables.

738
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,500
Let me wash some for us.

739
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,140
Eat.

740
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,460

Don't push me.

742
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,460
Xing.

743
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,430
Why didn't you tell me about that?

744
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,390
That was in the past.

745
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,940
That was in the past.

746
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,120
But what about your feelings
for each other?

747
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,190
Are they lost too?

748
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,140
You can fool others,
but you can't fool me.

749
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,060
Shen and I are just friends.

750
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,270
Stop worrying about us.

751
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,750
Shen?

752
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,060
Why are you spacing out?

753
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,940
Just now, for one moment,

754
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,710
I had a deja vu.

755
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,190
Lu Xingyan tuned into

756
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,940
the boy he once was
more than 10 years ago.

757
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,910
But when I came to my senses, I realized

758
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,910
that we've known each other

759
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,310
for 11 years.

760
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,980
And we have been apart for five years.

761
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,020
What do you plan to do next?

762
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,830
Are you okay?

763
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,130
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

764
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,890
Have you always liked spicy food?

765
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:29,850
No.

766
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,650
I couldn't handle spicy food
in the past too.

767
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,370
But I've gotten better in recent years.

768
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,050
What changed you?

769
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,250
I have a friend who loves spicy food.

770
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,450
So,

771
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,620
I'm doing my best to build up
my tolerance for spice too.

772
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,870
Xing.

773
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,020
You've been in there for so long.

774
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,070
Why do you eat spicy food every day
if you can't handle it?

775
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,870
Now, you are suffering.

776
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,010
But I can eat spicy food now.

777
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,970
(Have you always liked spicy food?)

778
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,810
I hope

779
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,130
that when we meet one day,

780
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,410
I can eat spicy food with her.

781
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,570
Ever since I find out
that Lu Xingyan can eat spicy food,

782
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,930
there's this

783
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,170
a special feeling in my heart.

784
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:37,561
