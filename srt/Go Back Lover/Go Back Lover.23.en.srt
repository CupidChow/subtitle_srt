=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,690
(Year 2018, Senior Year winter break)

4
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,830
That was great.

5
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,780
When did you get home?

6
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,910
Xingyan.

7
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,140
I just got back.

8
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,020
Changhao.

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,300
What made you

10
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,580
suddenly come

11
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,940
to get piano lessons from Xingruo?

12
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,380
I'm about to take my piano exam.

13
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,190
Aunt Pei said

14
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,580
Xingruo is really good at the piano.

15
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,110
So I came to ask Xingruo

16
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,630
to give me some tips.

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,910
I see.

18
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,990
You practice well, then.

19
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,220
I'll leave you two be.

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,470
Come, let's go over it again.

21
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,140
Start.

22
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,380
Xingruo,

23
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,110
thank you for today.

24
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,270
You're welcome.

25
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,460
If you want to practice some more
before the exam,

26
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,430
look for me again.

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,550
Okay.

28
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,020
Done practicing?

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,830
I got food delivery.

30
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,140
Let's eat together.

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,710
- Okay.
- Thanks, Xingyan.

32
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,550
Let's go.

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,340
Go on.

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,580
How come you seem
especially happy today?

35
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,580
Yeah,

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,300
watching you teach him piano just now

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,390
suddenly made me think of something.

38
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,460
What is it?

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,430
I thought that scene just now

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,790
would be how our future family
would look.

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,990
Xingyan, Xingruo,

42
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,710
come and eat, quick.

43
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,900
Coming.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,890
=Episode 23=
(You defined how happiness looks.)

45
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,090
(Love House)

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,900
Since everyone is here,

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,580
I'll keep it short.

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,580
Just now,

49
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,110
Mr. Zhang and I met with
the media platform's person-in-charge.

50
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,950
He said

51
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,060
that the public opinion this time
had a big effect

52
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,110
on our show.

53
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,620
So the show

54
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,230
will be suspended for rectification.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,550
When it will be resumed
is yet to be determined.

56
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,860
I knew it.

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,060
So do we continue editing?

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,830
What about the parts
that haven't been shot?

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,230
Those pending

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,790
will be put on hold for now.

61
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,860
The reason we gathered everyone today

62
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,340
was to make this announcement.

63
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,550
Rest assured.

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,110
We will recompense you
according to the actual number of days.

65
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,340
I met vlogger

66
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,430
who made the video.

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,430
He was indeed instructed to do so.

68
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,110
And who instructed him?

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,860
That person

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,950
is in our team.

71
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,740
He's handed over all the details.

72
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,350
All the chat logs are in here.

73
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,790
You can take a look.

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,990
Lu Xingyan, what are you doing?

75
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,260
I know.

76
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,470
You've worked with these people
for many years.

77
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,300
You feel bad for publicly
vilifying the culprit.

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,230
So I'll do it for you.

79
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,550
What are you doing?

80
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,620
I don't want to see it.

81
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,500
I believe every one of them.

82
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,060
Because they're members of my team.

83
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,260
We've been through so much.

84
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,550
If someone had betrayed the team,

85
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,550
I'm sure they had their reasons.

86
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,430
Producer Shen.

87
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,820
You need to face the music.

88
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,500
Now is not the time to be sentimental.

89
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,940
I need you to wake up!

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,110
I'm wide awake.

91
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,060
If we read the chat logs,

92
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,700
there is no going back for us.

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,350
Then tell me,

94
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,260
what do we do
about the show getting suspended?

95
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,030
When our hotel agreed to invest in you,

96
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,470
it is clearly stated in the contract.

97
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,910
If the funding cannot be recovered,

98
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,380
we will go after you for compensation.

99
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,470
I will put my family home as collateral.

100
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,990
I will deal with the money.

101
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,110
I will bear the responsibility, okay?

102
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,940
I don't care what you'll do.

103
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,620
I'm going to get my lawyer
to deal with you all.

104
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,820
I wish you good luck.

105
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,620
What's the matter?

106
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,430
You did well.

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,500
Don't worry.

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,700
I will get in touch
with the boss for you.

109
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,500
Come in.

110
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,380
Mr. Lu.

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,700
You asked for me, sir?

112
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,260
You should know

113
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,260
that the platform has suspended
the show for rectification.

114
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,940
We probably won't be getting back
our investment.

115
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,740
Draft up an indemnification agreement

116
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,470
and discuss it with Producer Shen.

117
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,470
Are we really doing that, sir?

118
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,430
Why don't we give Xingruo
a bit more time?

119
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,590
Perhaps things will turn around.

120
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,110
I can wait.

121
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,430
But can Sun Inn wait?

122
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,150
Our bet agreement with Kangte

123
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,380
is expiring very soon.

124
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,860
In the current situation,

125
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,670
do you expect me
to risk the hotel by waiting?

126
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,300
I understand.

127
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,230
I will talk to Xingruo today.

128
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,030
But I hope

129
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,110
you two

130
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,180
won't become awkward
because of this matter.

131
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,670
After all,

132
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,620
it wasn't easy

133
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,300
for you two to get back together.

134
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,030
After so long,

135
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,550
she hasn't changed one bit.

136
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,030
She is always,

137
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,430
always thinking about herself.

138
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,180
Still as obstinate as ever.

139
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,890
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

140
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,110
Inform me once you've talked to her.

141
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,030
Alright.

142
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,940
Don't be too upset.

143
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,260
Have a good rest.

144
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,150
I'm going to go.

145
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,500
Lawyer Zhai.

146
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,860
It's been many years.

147
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,860
Thank you for all you've done.

148
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,150
Why are you being so polite with me?

149
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,550
I'm off.

150
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,060
Xingruo.

151
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,670
I can't bear to walk another step today,

152
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,510
so I troubled you to come here instead.

153
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,340
It's fine.

154
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,430
The compensation for Sun Inn

155
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,060
is part of my job scope.

156
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,820
Anyway, I come to the hotel

157
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,910
a few times a week.

158
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,790
It's almost like my second home.

159
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,910
When I got here, I noticed

160
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,060
that the cameras

161
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,220
have all been removed.

162
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,180
Did you really stop the recording?

163
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,460
I asked them all to go home.

164
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Because...

165
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,220
we have to minimize the loss.

166
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,670
Are you okay?

167
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,870
I've been working so hard

168
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,060
and this is the result I get.

169
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,150
To be honest,

170
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,220
I feel pretty bummed.

171
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,870
Is there anything I can help with?

172
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,150
It's already come to this.

173
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,630
What else can we do?

174
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,150
Just let it be.

175
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,790
But actually,

176
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,180
there are a few things

177
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,700
that I found odd
and couldn't figure out.

178
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,220
Could you analyze it for me?

179
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,750
Tell me.

180
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,870
There's one thing
I can't wrap my head around.

181
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,550
During the shoot,

182
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,300
Huang Bing had sued us

183
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,870
following Yang Tianjiao's instruction.

184
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,870
You know it, right?

185
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,150
I heard about it after.

186
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,940
Although I didn't have much interaction
with Yang Tianjiao,

187
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,150
I have a feeling

188
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,460
she isn't a very meticulous person.

189
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,980
But she clearly stated
the sum of compensation

190
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,510
and even asked Shi Qin
to take me to court.

191
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,910
Now,

192
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,030
how did she think of that?

193
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,510
Listen, Xingruo.

194
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,980
This matter is already
water under the bridge.

195
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,300
You should think about

196
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,790
what you should do right now instead.

197
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,630
You're right.

198
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,580
The incident with Li Qi

199
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,150
is also pretty weird.

200
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,430
I mean,

201
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,300
getting Li Qi to cause a scene

202
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,060
meant getting him to Xingcheng
from the county.

203
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,870
Also, on the day of the live stream,

204
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,580
he had to sneak past security
at the venue

205
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,790
to get to the streaming site.

206
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,460
Plus, he had to have installed

207
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,430
the other cameras
at the site beforehand.

208
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,300
How could he

209
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,030
do all of that by himself?

210
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,940
Hence why I think

211
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,030
that the person who instructed him

212
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,910
must be very familiar

213
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,150
with the show.

214
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,550
Are you implying that...

215
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,430
there's a mole in your team?

216
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,580
Me and them are in the same boat.

217
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,030
Sink or swim, we're in it together.

218
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,550
If the show gets cancelled,

219
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,940
they wouldn't even get

220
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,150
the most basic pay.

221
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,820
I think...

222
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,430
Maybe you should go

223
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,180
and ask Shi Qin.

224
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,550
Did she look for Li Qi again?

225
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,180
I'm guessing

226
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,460
there's a secret mastermind.

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,820
They utterly despise our show,

228
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,630
and so they found someone

229
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,390
on our team

230
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,980
and offered him something better
than the pay.

231
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,580
That's why he was willing
to take the risk

232
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,390
and created this mess for us.

233
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,390
Xingruo, I think you need to let it go.

234
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,220
Your analysis sound

235
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,580
pretty scary to me.

236
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,460
That's not it.

237
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,550
Listen to me.

238
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,180
They had another trick up their sleeve.

239
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,460
The moment we released
the lawyer's letter,

240
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,460
someone posted the video

241
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,150
taken at the alleyway.

242
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,150
Then a vlogger immediately
made an analysis video

243
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,670
and said we were sending
Li Qi death threats.

244
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,060
You tell me.

245
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,220
Could Li Qi

246
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,870
have come up with all that himself?

247
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,670
Here's the thing, Xingruo.

248
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,750
As an attorney,

249
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,270
I have to remind you.

250
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,270
Everything is based on evidence.

251
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,910
I know you're trying
to save the show's reputation.

252
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,390
But making baseless assumptions
won't get you anywhere.

253
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,670
What about

254
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
I help you get in touch
with that vlogger?

255
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,390
Find out exactly what's going on.

256
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,430
We're old friends after all.

257
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,430
I really wish to help you out.

258
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,460
Don't worry.

259
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,180
Lu Xingyan has already
contacted the vlogger.

260
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,940
He even provided us with evidence.

261
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,820
In fact, after that,

262
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,390
I wasn't going to pursue the matter.

263
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,510
But to my surprise,

264
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,300
that person

265
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,030
came looking for me on their own.

266
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,940
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,700
I told the vlogger

268
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,180
to make that video.

269
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,750
He Ming.

270
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,270
Finally, you chose
to come clean with me.

271
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,660
You...

272
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,910
You already knew?

273
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,820
The chat logs in the USB drive.

274
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,910
I've seen it.

275
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,750
He Ming.

276
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,870
I went over every person around me,

277
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,180
but it never crossed my mind

278
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,790
that the culprit would be you.

279
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,870
Do you know what I was thinking

280
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,300
when I read the chat logs yesterday?

281
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,060
That night,

282
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,910
I kept reading the chat logs,

283
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,870
over and over again.

284
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,270
How I wish my eyes were deceiving me.

285
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,300
Or maybe

286
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,870
the culprit had impersonated you
in the chat.

287
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,790
But it was neither.

288
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,220
You didn't expose me
in front of everyone

289
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,750
because you wanted
to give me a way out, right?

290
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,630
That's right.

291
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,180
But I'm not going to make it public.

292
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,460
You and I

293
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,390
have worked together a long time, right?

294
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,430
He Ming.

295
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,270
I know you.

296
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,630
I know about your dreams and ambitions.

297
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,300
I previously spoke to Zhang Xu.

298
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,430
For the next variety show,

299
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,550
we're hoping you'd be the producer.

300
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,490
(Project Planning, Producer: He Ming
Production Company: Star Media Studio)

301
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,510
I get it.

302
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,300
I'm sure you have your own concerns.

303
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,430
I just want you to tell me

304
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,390
who it is

305
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,430
that incited you to do this.

306
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,150
If you tell me the truth,

307
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,220
I'm willing to think

308
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,700
that the incident never happened.

309
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,180
It was Zhai Jiajing.

310
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,340
She approached me in the beginning

311
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,460
and said,

312
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,220
I would always be in your shadow.

313
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,940
That I had no chance
to make a name for myself.

314
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,700
It was all part of her plan.

315
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,700
It was also her

316
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,980
who asked me to get in touch
with the vlogger.

317
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,820
She even promised me.

318
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,260
When everything was done,

319
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,180
she'd introduce other projects to me

320
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,790
and let me be the producer.

321
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,580
I'm glad you decided
to be honest with me.

322
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,940
It means I wasn't wrong about you.

323
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,340
But, He Ming,

324
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,180
right now I need a favor from you.

325
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,910
Make a call to Zhai Jiajing.

326
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,670
What is it?

327
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,630
You got what you wanted.

328
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,180
Mr. Lu and Ms. Xing
had a heated argument just now.

329
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,980
The Double-Star CP has officially split.

330
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,500
Previously, He Ming did come to see me.

331
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,910
He asked me

332
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,590
to help connect him

333
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,870
to an old client of mine.

334
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,630
He wanted to do more
and become a producer.

335
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,700
So out of goodwill, I helped
bridge the connection.

336
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,910
But he used that to slander me.

337
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,630
Xingruo,

338
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,590
you don't believe him, right?

339
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,980
I too, thought it was so odd.

340
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,460
I mean,

341
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,310
you and I

342
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,310
aren't competitors.

343
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,350
Neither do you know Li Qi.

344
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,870
How could you have guessed

345
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,780
when Li Qi was going
to come and cause a scene?

346
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,220
Right.

347
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,460
I never interacted with him at all.

348
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,310
When Li Qi made a scene that day,

349
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,020
he said someone went to his company

350
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,070
and reported him for domestic abuse.

351
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,980
It got him fired.

352
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,670
Could it be

353
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,110
that the one who reported
to his company

354
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,350
was you?

355
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,980
You cut off his lifeline.

356
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,670
He had no other option,

357
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,180
and so he came seeking revenge from us.

358
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,460
You have quite the imagination.

359
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,150
He Siyue and Shi Qin

360
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,180
used the video

361
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,780
and tracked it
to the hotel's IP address.

362
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,830
At last, they found that

363
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,980
on a particular night,

364
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,940
you and Li Qi
had gone to the hotel together.

365
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,910
Zhai Jiajing.

366
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,830
Why did you look for Li Qi?

367
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,150
Could it be

368
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,830
that you're his secret girlfriend?

369
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,220
What did you say?

370
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,070
Just kidding.

371
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,070
I actually know why you went.

372
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,220
Who are you to question
why she came looking for me?

373
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,020
Or is it because
you've thought it through.

374
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,390
You're ready to come back

375
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,940
because you know I'm better.

376
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,780
Li Qi.

377
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,310
I came today

378
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,070
because I wanted to give you
another chance.

379
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,430
You caused such a mess
for the production team.

380
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,070
They will surely come after you.

381
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,220
You better not think you'd be spared.

382
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,260
Once the legal department gets involved,

383
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,460
they will investigate

384
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,220
what exactly

385
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,740
you guys talked about in the video.

386
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,150
What you did is considered defamation.

387
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,540
If the content is serious,

388
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,070
not only do you have to pay
for any monetary loss,

389
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,940
you'd also face

390
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,500
up to three years of imprisonment.

391
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,460
Are you really ready
to bear the responsibility?

392
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,630
That's impossible.

393
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,590
She is a lawyer too.

394
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,010
She told me that
it's nothing to worry about.

395
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,910
Go ahead and continue
believing her, then.

396
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,740
Let's see if she can still protect you

397
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,150
when you're in court.

398
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,940
Wait!

399
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,700
Shen Xingruo.

400
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,220
I'm impressed.

401
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,180
You managed to find out so much

402
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,740
in such a short time.

403
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,870
Pretty good.

404
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,220
So you admit it.

405
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,390
You planned everything.

406
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,460
Yes,

407
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,350
I did.

408
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,310
So what if I admit it?

409
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,390
What can you do about it?

410
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,780
Your show is ruined.

411
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,870
Because of that, Lu Xingyan

412
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,540
has completely turned his back on you.

413
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,110
Shen Xingruo,

414
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,740
you've lost everything.

415
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,070
I've lost everything now.

416
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,070
So, Zhai Jiajing,

417
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,310
will you tell me?

418
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,150
Will you tell me why you did it?

419
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,070
I really want to know why.

420
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,110
You really surprised me.

421
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,670
I never thought

422
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,260
that I'd get to see this one day.

423
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,630
In the past,

424
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,980
you always acted like
you were better than everyone else.

425
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,670
No matter how hard I tried,

426
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,220
you would always beat me
without any effort,

427
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,390
ignored me.

428
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,700
You destroyed the plan
I so carefully put together.

429
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,070
Actually today, I was going

430
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,390
to finish discussing
the compensation first

431
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,630
before telling you the truth.

432
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,070
But now it seems like

433
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,430
telling you sooner

434
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,700
is fine, too.

435
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,940
I came here today

436
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,260
so that I could see your pathetic self.

437
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,310
You said

438
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,870
that I destroyed your plan.

439
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,780
What do you mean?

440
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,150
Do you really not know?

441
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,540
Stop.

442
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,940
Let me borrow your assignment.

443
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,590
No way. Do it yourself.

444
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,180
Don't be such a stingy wart.

445
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,700
It's for your own good.

446
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,570
Let me see the topic.

447
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,460
Have you done the math test paper?

448
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,870
Well,

449
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,910
if you don't know how to do it,

450
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,180
I can explain it to you.

451
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,630
Just copying is no good.

452
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,310
Right.

453
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,910
I won't copy.

454
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,150
I'll just take a look.

455
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,310
Thanks.

456
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,590
Before you came to Mingli,

457
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,540
among so many girls in the class,

458
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,220
Lu Xingyan was closest with me.

459
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,020
But after you came,

460
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,350
everything seemed to have changed.

461
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,390
I don't know why
he always listened to you.

462
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,780
He did whatever you said.

463
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,220
What a rare sight.

464
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,980
Lu Xingyan is studying
on his own accord.

465
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,910
Shen Xingruo set some questions for me.

466
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,350
She's going to check later at night.

467
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,350
What's up?

468
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,830
If there's nothing,
I have to get back to this.

469
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,540
Shen Xingruo.

470
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,110
You always pretended

471
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,150
to be a dignified white peacock.

472
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,460
In fact, you were also seducing him.

473
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,780
But what's the point of you
doing that?

474
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,500
What Lu Xingyan wanted,

475
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,020
you couldn't give him after all.

476
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,760
- Nice!
- That was awesome.

477
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,890
(Shen Xingruo WIN)

478
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,570
(Year 2019, one week after break up)

479
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,570
(Shen Xingruo)

480
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,810
(Shen Xingruo)

481
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,250
(Shen Xingruo)

482
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,050
(Calls, Shen Xingruo)

483
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,780
You're saying

484
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,500
you were the one who deleted
my call logs with Lu Xingyan?

485
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,540
That's right.

486
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,350
You left, didn't you?

487
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,670
Why didn't you stay away?

488
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,070
Why did you come back?

489
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,540
Actually,

490
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,940
when Lu Xingyan was suffering
because of you,

491
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,740
I was really happy at first.

492
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,830
Because he chose the wrong person.

493
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,700
It was his punishment.

494
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,910
But,

495
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,870
I'm a very generous person.

496
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,220
As long as he's willing to come back,

497
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,070
I can forget
about his nasty past with you.

498
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,630
Hence the moment I graduated,

499
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,150
I took the initiative
to be his legal advisor.

500
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,910
I offered him the lowest price

501
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,310
and did the most for him.

502
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,350
Our camaraderie was becoming stronger.

503
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,430
We were becoming closer.

504
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,110
Here's to a happy partnership.

505
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,870
Looking forward to it.

506
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,310
Likewise.

507
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,150
You're one lucky man, Mr. Lu.

508
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,740
To find a capable person
like Lawyer Zhai.

509
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,180
Our hotel has worked
with Lawyer Zhai for many years.

510
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,390
She is very skilled.

511
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,310
I am hoping

512
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,500
that one day, I could get her
to join us full-time

513
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,980
and handle the hotel's legal affairs.

514
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,180
Just when I thought

515
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,830
I was going to be the person
by his side,

516
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,700
Shen Xingruo,

517
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,390
you showed up again.

518
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,390
At the time, I thought,

519
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,980
why won't this person
disappear for good?

520
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,220
Why is it that the guy
whom I can't seem to tame,

521
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,670
become a lapdog the moment
he's next to you?

522
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,020
I think this part is not right.

523
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,430
What do you think, Producer Shen?

524
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,070
I agree with Lawyer Zhai.

525
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,940
The body proportion is a little off.

526
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,430
Listen to her advice

527
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,780
and edit your painting.

528
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,020
Do you feel a sense of accomplishment
keeping him on a leash?

529
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,260
Since young,

530
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,220
I've never had anything.

531
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,350
That's why I always tried the hardest
in everything I did.

532
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,540
But despite doing so much,

533
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,070
still nobody loves me.

534
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,940
Nobody cares about me!

535
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,220
No one pays me any attention!

536
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,500
Why?

537
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,220
Why is only my world like that?

538
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,220
Do I not deserve to have good things?

539
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,980
Is that it?

540
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,020
I put my heart and soul
into planning everything out,

541
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,780
to get closer to Lu Xingyan.

542
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,500
The moment you appeared,

543
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,980
everything fell apart.

544
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,630
So you joined the show

545
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,430
because of Lu Xingyan?

546
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,670
Then why did you break up

547
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,670
He Siyue and Shi Qin's relationship?

548
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,630
Because He Siyue is mine!

549
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,670
Aside from work, no one else

550
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,180
would give me any time of day.

551
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,260
Only He Siyue.

552
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,260
All these years, he stayed by me
and protected me,

553
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,590
took care of me
and listened to what I had to say.

554
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,260
There's no way
he didn't have feelings for me.

555
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,940
But thanks to your show,

556
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,630
Shi Qin got the opportunity
to get close to him.

557
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,220
Now, it's not just you
getting in the way.

558
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,180
Shi Qin too, wants to steal from me!

559
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,830
Who the hell is she?

560
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,220
Why do you people

561
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
keep wanting to snatch
my things away from me?

562
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,220
You people...

563
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,390
all deserve to be punished.

564
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,390
So you mean,

565
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,830
Lu Xingyan's car crash

566
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,590
was never an accident.

567
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,630
It was because he drove He Siyue's car.

568
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,740
Yes.

569
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,070
I gave him a chance.

570
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,260
But he still wanted to leave me.

571
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,020
So I had to punish him.

572
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,220
Zhai Jiajing.

573
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,220
You're really scary, you know?

574
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,630
Aren't you afraid that one day

575
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,020
you'd be exposed?

576
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,980
Afraid?

577
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,390
Afraid of what?

578
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,830
My hands are untainted.

579
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,070
I went to check He Siyue's car.

580
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,070
It was scrapped.

581
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,870
You won't be able to find anything.

582
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,020
Inciting, guiding,

583
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,630
those are not grounds
to constitute criminal action.

584
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,740
Even if we bring this to court,

585
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,540
Li Qi and He Ming's testimonies

586
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,830
can only be considered
as same case accusation.

587
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,830
You won't be able to prove anything.

588
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,670
Shen Xingruo,

589
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,630
no one can say for sure
if I'd be convicted.

590
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,540
But your show is as good as dead.

591
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,980
And because of your rogue actions,

592
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,260
Lu Xingyan has totally given up on you.

593
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,350
He asked me to come today

594
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,830
because he wants to be recompensed
for your garbage of a show.

595
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,980
Well?

596
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,220
How does it feel
to have someone take away

597
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,830
the most important thing to you?

598
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,350
The most important thing to her

599
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,260
is not something anyone can take away.

600
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,740
Why are you here?

601
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,390
If I hadn't come,

602
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,740
I'd never have known
you were this kind of person.

603
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,670
No...

604
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,700
Let me explain.

605
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,830
I did all this

606
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,540
because I like you.

607
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
The stuff you said about high school?

608
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,070
I've forgotten all of it.

609
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,740
At work, we're merely normal colleagues.

610
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,630
I can tell you right now.

611
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,150
In this world,

612
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,740
there's only one person I can love.

613
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,070
And that person
can only be Shen Xingruo.

614
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,980
I did so much for you.

615
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,500
How am I worse than her?

616
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,830
Why couldn't you take notice of me?

617
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,780
Did you do it for me?

618
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,830
Or was it to fulfill
your demented possessiveness?

619
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,740
To satisfy your own selfish interests,

620
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,020
you put the entire
production team's efforts

621
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
and the hotel's investment in danger.

622
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,220
How many people suffered because of you?

623
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,020
He Siyue almost lost his life!

624
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,910
Zhai Jiajing.

625
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,220
Stop making yourself look good.

626
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,220
In your heart,

627
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,630
there's only yourself.

628
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,630
Lu Xingyan.

629
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,020
You've really disappointed me.

630
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,350
I thought you were the clear-headed one.

631
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,540
I thought you'd know
who's right and wrong.

632
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,150
And that you'd know who to choose.

633
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,300
But it doesn't matter now.

634
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,580
Shen Xingruo's show

635
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,060
is completely ruined.

636
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,060
Kangte Capital's bet agreement
is about to expire.

637
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,140
If you two want to die together,

638
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,660
I can offer you my best wishes.

639
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,580
If you hadn't just said those things,

640
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,940
my show would've really been done for.

641
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,020
But,

642
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,540
I'm very thankful

643
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,390
that you clarified things on my behalf.

644
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,350
What do you mean?

645
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,060
In this world,

646
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,270
you're not the only lawyer.

647
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,460
Qin had long guessed your intention

648
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,750
to avoid legal issues.

649
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,710
It's no use even if we have

650
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,140
Li Qi and He Ming's testimonies.

651
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,830
Because their testimonies

652
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,020
can only be regarded as evidence
of the same case.

653
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,660
We need to find more direct proof.

654
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,060
What should we do then?

655
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,580
I have an idea.

656
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,540
Evidence for the same case
couldn't trip you up.

657
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,750
Then we'd get you on video

658
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,230
testifying your crimes.

659
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,500
As it is now,

660
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,830
there should be

661
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,940
enough evidence.

662
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,710
We've called the police.

663
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,270
We'll hand these over to the police.

664
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,830
Anything else you want to say?

665
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,270
So...

666
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,830
the whole time,

667
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,540
you all put on a show to trick me.

668
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,310
If I hadn't made you believe

669
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,660
that you had won,

670
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,460
would you have willingly
told me the truth?

671
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,540
I hope you didn't think

672
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,660
that your plan was foolproof.

673
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,100
Or that you outsmarted everyone else.

674
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,830
Your possessiveness
has driven you crazy.

675
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,020
To get what you desired,

676
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,460
you dreamt up unrealistic illusions.

677
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,020
Zhai Jiajing, it's time to face reality.

678
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,020
The things and people you wanted

679
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,430
never belonged to you.

680
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,830
Shut up!

681
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,020
Get the security!

682
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,910
You really gave me a heart attack.

683
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,140
She had a knife,

684
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,500
but you just rushed forward.

685
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,710
I'd say you shocked me.

686
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,870
Before I knew it,
you had pinned her on the floor.

687
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,100
When did you learn that move?

688
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,310
I had guessed
there would be a confrontation.

689
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,100
So I learned a few tricks from Chen Zhu.

690
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,710
Well?

691
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,020
Was I not super cool?

692
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,540
About as cool as me.

693
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,350
I thought

694
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,790
I could finally get a scene
of the knight saving the beauty.

695
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,750
This time, I managed to save the show

696
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,230
and you.

697
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,500
Doesn't that count as the knight
saving the beauty?

698
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,910
Sure,

699
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,430
it counts.

700
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,940
The second time.

701
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,490
(Go Back Lover)
(Interview Time)

702
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,450
Our show is ending soon.

703
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,250
Any expectations for the final episode?

704
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,690
(What is your expectation
for the last episode?)

705
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,010
I've gained a lot

706
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,290
on this show.

707
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,930
I think I've gotten the happiness

708
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,090
that I wished for.

709
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,010
So,

710
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,250
as long as we can keep it this way,

711
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,450
I am content.

712
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,130
Actually,

713
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:41,890
(What is your expectation
for the last episode?)

714
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,250
I prepared a surprise for Lu Xingyan.

715
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,690
Could you tell us what it is?

716
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,930
It's something

717
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,250
he's been wanting for a long time.

718
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,770
As for what it is exactly,

719
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,690
you'll find out soon enough.

720
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,370
(After investigation, the suspect Li Qi
was accused of intentional injury.)

721
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,170
(After being prosecuted
by the procuratorate,)

722
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,270
(the People's Court sentenced him
to three years in prison.)

723
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,470
(The suspect Zhai Jiajing
was accused of intentional homicide.)

724
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,270
(After being prosecuted
by the procuratorate,)

725
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,270
(the People's Court sentenced her
to five years in prison.)
