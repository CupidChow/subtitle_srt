00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,490
=Go Back Lover=

3
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,330
(2013, Year 2 of High School)

4
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,590
Siyue.

5
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,340
The entrance exam results
are finally out.

6
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,280
(Mingli High School, Year 2 Class 1)
Siyue came first.

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,340
(Entrance Exam Result)
Jing came second.

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,980
Nothing new.

9
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,870
What about Xing?

10
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,050
(Li Xingyan, 357, Shen Xingruo, 356)

11
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,620
Shen Xingruo.

12
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,620
She got 356 marks.

13
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,460
It shouldn't be.

14
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,740
Why is Xingruo's result so bad?

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,500
Even Xing scored
one point higher than her.

16
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,310
Was there something wrong
with the grading?

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,670
It couldn't be possibly wrong
for every subject.

18
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,180
It's said that she was the top student
at Huize High School.

19
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,150
Can you stop talking about it?

20
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,670
Having one bad result
doesn't mean anything.

21
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,490
I don't need you to speak up for her.

22
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,390
Or are you bumpkins
going to stick together?

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,950
Did any of you

24
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,340
achieve any outstanding results?

25
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,030
Are you done?

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,620
Let's go.

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,950
Having one bad result is nothing.

28
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,350
Look at me.

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,350
I always get bad results.

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,100
You sound proud about it.

31
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,260
Quiet down.

32
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,010
Since this is your self-study time,
I want to announce something.

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,300
For the entrance exam this time,

34
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,230
due to some issue

35
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,300
with the pencil,

36
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,010
some answers in Shen Xingruo's papers
can't be read by the machine.

37
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,020
But we have manually

38
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,860
marked the papers.

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,820
Let me announce the new result ranking.

40
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,230
Shen Xingruo scored 133 marks
in the Chinese Language paper,

41
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,020
150 marks in the Mathematics paper,

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,910
148 marks in the Foreign Language paper,

43
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,020
84 marks in the Politics paper,

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,820
90 marks in the History paper,

45
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,350
81 marks in the Geography paper,

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,910
and 255 marks in the Liberal Arts paper.

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,070
She scored a total of 694 marks.

48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,860
She came first in class

49
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,100
and also first

50
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,510
in this grade.

51
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,670
Amazing.

52
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,540
Xingruo is amazing.

53
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,260
This is a great comeback.

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,750
This is just normal

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,510
for Shen Xingruo.

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,510
It's not shocking.

57
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,420
So, keep up the good work.

58
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,580
Another thing,

59
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,230
the seat arrangement
for this semester has been set.

60
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,470
As a class,

61
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,470
we need to help each other.

62
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,510
Those with good grades
should help those with bad grades.

63
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,430
So, you'll be paired up.

64
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,910
Come and take a look.

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,860
I'll give you 10 minutes

66
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,420
to get your seats changed.

67
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,250
(Year 2 Class 1 Seating Chart)

68
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,020
Look carefully.

69
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,050
(Chen Zhu, Xu Chengzhou)

70
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,070
I'll be sitting with Chen Zhu.

71
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,490
(Lu Xingyan, Shen Xingruo)

72
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,340
Xing.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,070
You'll be sitting with Xingruo.

74
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,700
I can do it myself.

75
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,950
Take it as an apology.

76
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,430
I wanted to help you
by giving you that pencil.

77
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,130
I never thought
that it would turn out like this.

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,390
It's okay.

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,260
When they looked down
on you this morning,

80
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,660
you didn't say anything.

81
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,030
Did you already know that there was
an issue with the grading?

82
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,660
I know how well

83
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,750
I did in the exam.

84
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,750
So, you acted as cool as a cucumber

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,950
to surprise everyone.

86
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,110
I just didn't want to waste my time

87
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,190
in that pointless debate.

88
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,070
You are indeed the queen of actresses.

89
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,870
You can act so well.

90
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,900
Suddenly, I realized something.

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,780
If there was an issue
with the pencil I lent you,

92
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,780
does it mean there was
an issue with my papers too?

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,190
So, I didn't have bad grades

94
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,430
because I did poorly in the exam.

95
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,570
Maybe because the machine
couldn't read my papers too.

96
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,700
But I still scored one point
higher than you.

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,990
So, my real result...

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,410
Take a look at my papers for me.

99
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,990
I'm sure I'm a top student in secret.

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,510
Am I right?

101
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,900
Lu Xingyan wrote
the wrong answer to this question.

102
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,020
His marks should be deducted.

103
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,140
You...

104
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,930
It's indeed a wrong answer.

105
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Lu Xingyan,

106
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,140
your result has gotten worse again.

107
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,700
I can't believe you.

108
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:51,650
=Episode 6=
(We are all actors and actresses)

109
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,550
(2024)

110
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,260
So, did you ask me out

111
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,900
to tell me something?

112
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,820
There were too many people that day.

113
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,220
So,

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,750
I was too shy to talk to you alone.

115
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,390
I just think that
the way you faced Li Qi

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,750
was amazing.

117
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,430
I didn't know

118
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,950
that you are such
an outstanding person now.

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,140
I need to thank all of you for that.

120
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,140
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the courage
to take the first step.

121
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,900
Shi Qin.

122
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,190
Actually, I

123
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,900
still have something to tell you.

124
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,510
I think the show, Go Back Lover,

125
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,900
is the perfect show
for Shen Xingruo and Lu Xingyan.

126
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,750
All of us can tell

127
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,580
that they still have feelings
for each other.

128
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,110
I think they can get together again

129
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,190
through this show.

130
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,700
The show will start in a week.

131
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,110
If you participate,

132
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,550
the show can go on as scheduled.

133
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,260
What I mean is,

134
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,510
don't you want to help them?

135
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,340
Qin.

136
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,020
We could've talked at the resort.

137
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,390
Why do we have to come here?

138
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,430
A romantic topic

139
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,550
deserves a romantic setting.

140
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,540
I don't know what you are talking about.

141
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,900
Really?

142
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,750
What did you do after work?

143
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,590
Today, He Siyue suddenly came to me

144
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,300
to ask me for your contact number.

145
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,830
So, did you go out with him?

146
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,260
Why was he looking for you?

147
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,020
He just talked
about participating in the show.

148
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,350
So, he wants to team up with you

149
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,140
and participate in the show
together with you.

150
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,540
I think so.

151
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,470
So, he has taken the initiative.

152
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,590
What did you say?

153
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,390
Did you say yes?

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,940
I haven't made up my mind.

155
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,510
It's okay.

156
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,590
There's no rush.

157
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,140
You can take your time.

158
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,990
Now, tell us

159
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,350
what he told you.

160
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,510
Don't miss anything. Talk slowly.

161
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,230
Actually, I really want to help Xingruo.

162
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,540
But I don't think I can.

163
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,350
Compared to all of you,

164
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm too ordinary.

165
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,510
Besides, even if I participate,

166
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm sure I can't perform well.

167
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,590
Xingruo has really put a lot of effort

168
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,590
into this show.

169
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,260
I don't want to let her down.

170
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,940
Don't think like that, Shi Qin.

171
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,260
You are not ordinary at all.

172
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,420
The way you handled Li Qi this afternoon

173
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,260
was great.

174
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,990
You were courageous, steadfast,

175
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,390
and governed by logic.

176
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,990
I think you should

177
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,540
showcase your strengths bravely.

178
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,990
You can participate in the show.

179
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,420
But the show is a romance variety show.

180
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,180
The two of us...

181
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,140
I can tell the production team

182
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,230
that I'm secretly in love with you.

183
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,600
Do you think that will work?

184
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,300
Besides, all of us know each other well.

185
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,900
It won't be that stressful for us
to spend time with each other.

186
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,470
We can

187
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,990
reminisce our time together

188
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,710
like friends.

189
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,260
Okay.

190
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,350
Oh my goodness.

191
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,300
He Siyue is so forward.

192
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,780
No. He said

193
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,110
that he just wanted to help.

194
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,300
Don't think too much.

195
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,510
We can't be sure about that.

196
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,940
But I think need to grab

197
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,020
this golden opportunity
that drops on your lap.

198
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,540
What you need to do now

199
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,420
is to find chances to create
romance between you.

200
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,940
Make him fall for you.

201
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,540
Stop it.

202
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,940
We need to let Qin decide.

203
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,750
Qin, let me ask you.

204
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,870
If it doesn't end well

205
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,300
between the two of you,

206
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,420
can you accept it?

207
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,300
Don't sound so disheartening.

208
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,750
It's not disheartening.

209
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,940
Xingruo.

210
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,940
I know that you are
doing this for my good.

211
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,300
But after what happened with Li Qi,

212
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,750
I finally understand.

213
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,180
Compromising blindly is pointless.

214
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,110
We need to take the initiative

215
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,990
so that we can be free
from the predicament we are in.

216
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,350
So Xingruo,

217
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,940
I want to participate
in the show with you.

218
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,540
You don't know how much
I want you to join us.

219
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,260
I wonder who was
being so reasonable and mature just now.

220
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,350
You almost fooled me.

221
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,540
I didn't want Qin to do it on a whim.

222
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,350
Anyway, no matter

223
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,510
what decision you make,

224
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,420
I'll do my best to support you.

225
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,470
Come on.

226
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,300
Let's make a toast
for having all the guests together,

227
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,260
for the reunion of the three of us,

228
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,300
and for a better life for Qin.

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,750
Come. Cheers.

230
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,990
Cheers.

231
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,140
This is great. Finally, it's done.

232
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,350
Thank goodness.

233
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,470
Okay.

234
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,110
If there's no other question,

235
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,110
I'll send their personal information
to the costume designers.

236
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,630
It's time for them to style the guests.

237
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,710
Okay. No problem.

238
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,780
Get on with it.

239
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,900
Okay. Leave it to me.

240
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,300
Uncle Zhang.

241
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,110
Jiao.

242
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,510
Here. Let me introduce you
to each other.

243
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,830
She is the daughter
of Mr. Yang from Guangqi Group,

244
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,540
Jiao.

245
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,110
She is studying as a scenarist too.

246
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,940
You are in your second year, right?

247
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,630
Yes.

248
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,830
Take good care of her.

249
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,630
Mr. Yang has informed me

250
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,710
that Jiao is here

251
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,260
to observe our project on behalf of him

252
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,180
to see if this show needs
more investments.

253
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,230
Finally, I've met you.

254
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,390
I feel young again.

255
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,660
What do you mean?

256
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,830
I am a loyal fan

257
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,140
of you and Lu Xingyan.

258
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,110
I've watched the video of the two of you

259
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,020
in the final contest multiple times.

260
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,020
No one else in this world will want

261
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,900
the two of you to be together
more than I do.

262
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,110
You have to reconcile with each other

263
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,420
and get back together again.

264
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,300
I beg you. Please be together again.

265
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,300
Thank you for liking us.

266
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,710
But you are here as an intern.

267
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,630
Not a fan.

268
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,420
I hope

269
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,940
that you won't let it affect your job.

270
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,830
Besides, our variety show won't interfere
with the relationship of the guests.

271
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,710
As for what will happen to us
in the future, we don't know.

272
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,900
Lastly, since you are here.

273
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,590
I hope that you can get familiar
with the job of a scenarist.

274
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,590
Because I'll assign tasks for you later.

275
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,350
A variety show is very fast-paced
and it's not forgiving.

276
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,630
I hope that you can get familiar
with your job as soon as possible.

277
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,540
I still have things to do. I have to go.

278
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:14,260
(Office, Zhang Xu)

279
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,060
Jiao.

280
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,110
Don't mind her.

281
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,350
She's always like that.

282
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,750
Yes.

283
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,940
She's diligent and decisive.

284
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,390
I really love her.

285
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,110
Really?

286
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,140
Watch your steps.

287
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,020
Don't hit anything.

288
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,260
Slow down.

289
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,750
Be careful.

290
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,090
You are here.

291
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,790
Good morning.

292
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,910
You've worked hard.

293
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,210
You are here, Ms. Xing.

294
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,710
Yes.

295
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,300
We are almost done here.

296
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,730
We can start setting things up later.

297
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,300
Before that,

298
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,180
let's protect the scene first.

299
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,540
We don't want to damage Mr. Lu's resort.

300
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,030
Actually, before the materials arrived,
I thought about this issue.

301
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,750
But Yang Tianjiao told us this morning

302
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,180
to get to work as soon as possible.

303
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,220
She said she would be here this noon
to check on the progress.

304
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,110
I felt that it was inappropriate.

305
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,420
So, I asked Mr. Zhang about it.

306
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,710
But Yang Tianjiao said

307
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,390
that stopping would be wasting money.

308
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,870
So...

309
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,750
She's a scenarist.

310
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,230
She has no rights

311
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,190
to decide when we should
start setting up the scene.

312
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,110
She's the daughter of our client.

313
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,940
We can't say no to her.

314
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,230
We don't have enough manpower now.

315
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,230
The Art Department is busy
with decorating the scene.

316
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,490
So, we haven't bought
the protective materials yet.

317
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,710
How about this?

318
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
I'll get it done after I'm done
with the styling

319
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,700
of Chen Zhu and the other guests.

320
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,110
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

321
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,420
Focus on your work here.

322
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,940
I'm free this afternoon.

323
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,900
I'll check it out.

324
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,860
I'll leave this to you, then.

325
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,540
Okay.

326
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,940
Oh my goodness! Finally, I've met you.

327
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,750
What can I help you with?

328
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,350
I am a loyal fan of you and Lu Xingyan.

329
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,180
I've watched the video of the two of you

330
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,300
in the final contest multiple times.

331
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,750
No one else in this world will want

332
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,780
the two of you to be together
more than I do.

333
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,110
You have to reconcile with each other

334
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,510
and get back together again. I beg you.

335
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,230
You have great taste.

336
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,830
Thank you for liking us.

337
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,830
I have many friends
who are your fans too.

338
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,260
Really?

339
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,140
If they knew
that I would come to this show,

340
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,590
they would envy me.

341
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,900
They want me to ask you some questions.

342
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,660
Is that okay?

343
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,140
Sure. Go ahead.

344
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,890
Back then,
during the final contest back then,

345
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,500
you answered

346
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
such a difficult question with ease.

347
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,350
Did you make
some preparations in advance

348
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,550
or was it an impromptu?

349
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,940
It was an impromptu.

350
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,700
You are amazing.

351
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,220
How did you and Shen Xingruo

352
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,310
develop that cooperation

353
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,940
between the two of you in that contest?

354
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,140
How did you know that she knew

355
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,180
you knew the answer to that question?

356
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,270
Could the two of you
read each other's mind

357
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,310
just by looking at each other?

358
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,740
I guess.

359
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,310
You are a match made in heaven.

360
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,350
Another question.

361
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,630
When was the first time

362
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,790
you met?

363
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,180
Who confessed first?

364
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,900
What did you like about her

365
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
and what did she like about you?

366
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,500
Another thing.

367
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,310
When the two of you were together,
what was

368
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,900
the activity
that both of you enjoyed the most?

369
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,590
Wait.

370
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,390
Maybe you can ask
these questions next time.

371
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,310
Did you see Shen Xingruo?

372
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,500
They said that she went
to the construction material market.

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,600
The construction material market?

374
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,740
By herself?

375
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,070
Let me ask you one last question.

376
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,420
As our fan,

377
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,350
don't you want me to go to her now?

378
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,390
You are right.

379
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,590
Go now.

380
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,270
Thank you.

381
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,680
(Lu Xingyan)
(Where are you now?)

382
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,980
I think it's still
a little bit expensive.

383
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,350
Can you give me a better price?

384
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,140
Stop trying to negotiate with me.

385
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,590
I'm selling you
these screwdrivers, saws,

386
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,500
wires and PVC pipes

387
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,350
at the lowest price.

388
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,220
For the screws and the nail guns,

389
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,790
can you give me a lower price for them?

390
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,900
Let's stay 5,000.

391
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,790
What do you think?

392
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,350
How can you negotiate like this?

393
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,830
I need to make money.

394
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,220
This is a wholesale price.

395
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,940
Selling them for 5,700
is already very low.

396
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,790
I really want to buy these from you.

397
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,500
But they are too pricey.

398
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,460
Five thousand.

399
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,900
If you can sell these to me for 5,000,
I'll buy them at once.

400
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,940
I can't give you that price.

401
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,220
Why do you need these for?

402
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,500
Is it for your wedding house?

403
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,980
Yes.

404
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,370
(Shen Xingruo:
I'm at the Building Material City.)

405
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,740
I'm at the premium
building material area now.

406
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,270
Where are you?

407
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,870
Yes. My husband and I are newly married.

408
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,830
So, we are a bit tight on money.

409
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,140
Besides, my husband is very strict.

410
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,740
He said that I couldn't buy anything
over the budget of 5,000.

411
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,310
So, Boss...

412
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,410
Why did you come here yourself?

413
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
Is he your husband?

414
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,940
Yes.

415
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Honey.

416
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,550
The boss said that he could
only sell us for 5,700.

417
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,790
He couldn't sell us for 5,000.

418
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,030
Does it mean

419
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,220
that we can't renovate our new house?

420
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,700
I can only afford 5,000.

421
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,420
If we can't buy anything,

422
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,110
we'll have to leave it empty.

423
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,220
We'll renovate it

424
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,590
when we can afford it.

425
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,630
Okay.

426
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,980
Thank you.

427
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,350
We'll check out other shops.

428
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,740
Wait.

429
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,070
I'll sell them to you for 5,000.

430
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,230
I'll sell them to you at a loss.

431
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,500
I want you

432
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,700
to be able to move in.

433
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,700
Thank you very much.

434
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,550
Can you deliver the materials to us?

435
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,350
Yes.

436
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,030
Just give me your address.

437
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,180
No problem.

438
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,590
I need to write.

439
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,700
Can you give me an invoice?

440
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,140
Why do you need an invoice

441
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,550
for your wedding house?

442
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,140
Yes.

443
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,660
Why?

444
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,180
We are renovating our house.

445
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,350
But we are paying through your company.

446
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,180
Have you forgotten?

447
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,940
No.

448
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,390
Just do as my wife asked.

449
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,590
Okay.

450
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,620
Write down who I should
address the invoice to.

451
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,830
No problem.

452
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,390
Treat your wife better.

453
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,070
Don't be so stingy.

454
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,450
You can't be stingy when it comes
to renovating your new house.

455
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,630
Thank you, Boss.

456
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,700
All the best to your business.

457
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,350
Okay.

458
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,550
Thank you, Boss.

459
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,940
He will treat me well. Don't worry.

460
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,660
Okay. Bye.

461
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,390
Bye.

462
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,420
You are crazy.

463
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,140
I never thought that you would tell lies

464
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,550
just to get a discount.

465
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,740
I can save costs with a small lie.

466
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,070
Doesn't your team

467
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,790
have anyone who's in charge of this?

468
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,740
We do.

469
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,550
But we will start filming soon.

470
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,030
Everyone is very busy.

471
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,350
So, I came here myself.

472
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
I heard from Madam Pei

473
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,980
that you personally chose

474
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,530
all the materials and decorations
for your resort.

475
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,420
So, as the producer of the show,

476
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,550
I'll take good care of it.

477
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,550
Since you are taking this so seriously,

478
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,070
I'll have to give you a hand.

479
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,030
Do you think you can do it?

480
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,180
I'm the one who bought

481
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,730
the plants and fertilizers
for the resort.

482
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,660
So, I have some experience.

483
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,460
Besides, I think

484
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,550
we acted pretty well
as a pair of newlyweds.

485
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,140
What do you think?

486
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,180
Don't be a burden to me.

487
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,220
Who are you looking down on?

488
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,310
We have 20 rolls of bubble wrap,

489
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,740
300 square meters of wall panels,

490
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,590
and those baseboards.

491
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,350
It'll be a total

492
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,140
of 16,300.

493
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,550
A total of 16,300.

494
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,390
We bought so many things at once.

495
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,420
Can you give us a discount?

496
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,980
Okay.

497
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,310
I'll give you a whole number.

498
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,390
What about 16,000?

499
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,180
I think it's reasonable. How about...

500
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,110
I think it's still a little bit pricey.

501
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,630
You bought a 500-square-meter house.

502
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,550
You can afford this.

503
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,940
This is how

504
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,500
we saved up for the new house.

505
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,310
Let me tell you.

506
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,140
You can't skimp on this.

507
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,140
Some things

508
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,500
are expensive for a reason.

509
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,310
For example, this masking paper.

510
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,980
My masking paper is extra thick.

511
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,350
If you buy cheaper masking paper
from other shops,

512
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,660
it'll be worse
if you accidentally scratched

513
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,940
your floorboard, right?

514
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,500
I think she is right.

515
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,900
Although you are right,

516
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,790
I still think it's a little bit pricey.

517
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,310
I know your materials
are of high quality.

518
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,790
That's why I really want
to buy from you.

519
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,870
How about this?

520
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,940
Can you sell these to us

521
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,900
for 15,000?

522
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,350
Then I'll take them.

523
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,790
I can't give you that price.

524
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,590
What I'm offering is the cost price.

525
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,980
Besides, my shop

526
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,310
is not making much profit.

527
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,940
Please be understanding.

528
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,220
I want to be understanding too.

529
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,070
But

530
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,940
she's not being forgiving.

531
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,030
Talk to her.

532
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,940
Honey.

533
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,030
Can you accept this price?

534
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,740
Boss.

535
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,700
As soon as I come in, I can smell

536
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,830
the strong odor
of the protective panels.

537
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,740
How about this?

538
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,110
Give me a discount

539
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,590
so that I can buy some pomelo

540
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,140
to absorb the smell.

541
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,550
Yes.

542
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,390
My wife is right.

543
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,740
Besides, we are getting ready
to have a baby.

544
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,390
We can't accept the smell.

545
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,590
These are made with recycled materials.

546
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,110
If you think the odor
of these boards is bad,

547
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,500
those cheaper ones
will smell even worse.

548
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,390
I can't go lower.

549
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,590
This is the lowest price I can give you.

550
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,350
Fine.

551
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,630
How much is it? 16,000.

552
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,940
Stop. No.

553
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,790
Boss.

554
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,140
It's too expensive for us.

555
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,350
Let's go to another shop.

556
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,350
Sorry about that.

557
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,500
Honey.

558
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,660
It's just a little bit.

559
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,900
We almost have a deal.

560
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,590
And you said
that you wouldn't be a burden.

561
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,110
I really think the price is reasonable.

562
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,460
And the quality of those things

563
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,830
are great.

564
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,940
Aren't you satisfied

565
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,110
with their products too?

566
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,070
I am.

567
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,030
But our budget for this

568
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,110
is 15,000.

569
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,980
If we spend over the budget here,

570
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,520
we will have to cut costs
for other areas.

571
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,140
Tell me.

572
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,070
If the same thing happens
again and again,

573
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,180
it'll create a snowball effect.

574
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,330
Things will get uncontrollable.

575
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,740
Do you understand, you dummy?

576
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,740
I don't know why you are even here.

577
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,180
Yes.

578
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,870
You are right.

579
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,630
You are always right.

580
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,900
What should we do now?

581
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
We have to compare the prices.

582
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,030
What are you doing?

583
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,180
You'll be the brain

584
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,180
and I

585
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,550
will be the brawn.

586
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,420

and durable.

603
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,660
Do you have any colors
that are a little bit warmer?

604
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,630
A little bit warmer.

605
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,550
Let me take a look.

606
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,030
What about this? Do you like this?

607
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,390
I think this will do.

608
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,140
What about the price?

609
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,690
It'll be 360 per square meter.

610
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,030
What do you think?

611
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,830
Let me think.

612
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,660
Honey.

613
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,110
I'm getting hungry
from all the shopping.

614
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,980
Can you give me five yuan

615
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,420
so that I can buy some food?

616
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,590
Sure.

617
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,650
(Wood Veneers, Ecological Boards,
Decorative Panels)

618
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,230
I never thought that the potatoes here
would taste so good.

619
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,220
Honey.

620
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,030
Mr. Lu.

621
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,180
We are done with shopping now.

622
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,030
Stop taking advantage of me.

623
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,550
I just want to say
that these potatoes taste good.

624
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,830
Ms.

625
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,460
Shen.

626
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,310
Besides, you can't be sure
who's taking advantage of who.

627
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,180
You looked quite happy too just now.

628
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,500
I was happy because
I got to save some money.

629
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,420
Not because I called you...

630
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,940
honey.

631
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,420
Do you still remember

632
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,140
you told me last time

633
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,110
that I was different
from what you remembered?

634
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,390
Yes.

635
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,590
You gave me a summary.

636
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,920
You said that your brain
had a second development period.

637
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,630
I think

638
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,460
you are different
from what I remember too.

639
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,030
What was I like

640
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,350
in your memory?

641
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,740
Why do you keep quiet?

642
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,350
Have you forgotten
what I was like in the past?

643
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,550
I tried so hard to recall just now.

644
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,740
But I couldn't.

645
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,920
Maybe because
you weren't that important.

646
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,630
I forgot.

647
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,140
I forgot everything.

648
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,940
Being dumb and having a bad memory.

649
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,310
As expected of you, Lu Xingyan.

650
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
You still haven't changed

651
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,940
after so many years.

652
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,550
When have you come up

653
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,740
with such a false conclusion?

654
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,500
When I was tutoring you back then,

655
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,620
you couldn't remember even after
I taught you the same question 10 times.

656
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,700
In the end, even I couldn't remember.

657
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,650
I couldn't even remember if I had
taught you about something or not.

658
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,410
Although I was scolded
by Ms. Shen every day back then,

659
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,220
it was quite a happy time
when I think about it now.

660
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,030
Actually, it would be nice if I could

661
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,940
turn back time.

662
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,140
At that time, we had no worries in life.

663
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,830
It was the happiest moment

664
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,390
in our lives.

665
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,940
If only we couldn't return to the past.

666
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,460
Shen Xingruo.

667
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,900
Should we...

668
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,940
Lu Xingyan.

669
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,550
What are you trying to say?

670
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,500
Should we...

671
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,850
(Go Back Lover Interview Time)

672
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,090
Among the three pairs,

673
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,730
which one do you think will fail?

674
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,850
(Among the three pairs,
which one do you think will fail?)

675
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,050
Who asked this question?

676
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,970
It's tough.

677
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,970
It's for the show.
We have to make it interesting

678
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,630
by asking the guests
to comment on each other.

679
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,170
Lu Xingyan.

680
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,930
I think Lu Xingyan will fail.

681
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,170
Why?

682
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,210
Because Lu Xingyan
doesn't deserve Shen Xingruo.

683
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,850
He has always forced his mindset

684
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,290
on Xingruo.

685
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,770
He doesn't know what Xingruo wanted.

686
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,490
Back then, after they broke up,

687
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,850
Xingruo called him
to reconcile with him.

688
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,810
But he refused to pick up her call, twice.

689
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,410
I don't think anyone will fail.

690
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,930
But I think I know which one
will be the most successful one.

691
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,490
Are you talking about yourself?

692
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,090
How do you know?

693
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,030
Do you think
that I'll be successful too?
