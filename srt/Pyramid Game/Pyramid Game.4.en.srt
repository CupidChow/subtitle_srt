1
00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:02,240
I'm done for.

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:04,110
Totally done for.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,950
(16-inch MacBook Pro, Lowest Price 4,840 Dollars)

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,950
(Compliant)

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,250
I should've caught on before she did.

6
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,670
You look like someone whose secret plan has just been exposed.

7
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,340
The information got out.

8
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,479
(Sung Soo Ji)

9
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,899
What are you two doing here?

10
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,700
We were waiting for you.

11
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,109
- What? - Ye Won told me.

12
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,079
Ye Won.

13
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,180
Can you do me a favor?

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,349
A favor?

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,980
What is it?

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,150
If Soo Ji makes you uncomfortable in any way,

17
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:23,760
can you let me know?

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,489
I heard you made her uncomfortable.

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,629
Ye Won came to me for advice.

20
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,689
She said you kept interrogating her...

21
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,859
and that Ja Eun was suddenly following her around.

22
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,569
The Ja Eun I know would never do something like that.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
Soo Ji, did you tell her to do it?

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,810
I just wanted to befriend Ye Won.

25
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,439
Ja Eun, you too?

26
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,209
In any case, I get what you're saying. It made her uncomfortable.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
I see.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,879
As if. I know it was all you, Baek Ha Rin.

29
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,219
Soo Ji.

30
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,489
Why don't you sit next to me?

31
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,219
I believe we can be better friends than you and Ja Eun are.

32
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,390
All of a sudden?

33
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,500
No, thank you. I like sitting in the back.

34
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,370
Really? That's too bad.

35
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,550
Now, you're showing your true colors.

36
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,379
This is the real Baek Ha Rin.

37
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,849
You smoke?

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,150
Yes.

39
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,620
There are no cameras here, and we're the only ones here now.

40
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,330
Besides, you don't want to be my friend.

41
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:41,729
How much do you know about Myoung Ja Eun?

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
And Pyo Ji Ae?

43
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,240
Do you think everyone is how you think they are?

44
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,210
What do you mean?

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,180
Oh, is this about how I said I'd hang out with them?

46
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,580
I'm embarrassed about it, so forget it.

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,349
Strictly speaking, I'm in Grade C, so why would I?

48
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,120
You're no fun.

49
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,560
Put out your cigarette first.

50
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,400
I really hate secondhand smoke.

51
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,870
What do I think of the girls?

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,699
You think of them as dumb, naive chess pins...

53
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,729
who blindly follow your plans.

54
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,669
I bet you thought Ye Won would be like that too,

55
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,810
but you were wrong, Soo Ji.

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,810

I will really die!

67
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,209
She doesn't know any of the details yet.

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,449
She knows we approached Ye Won. That's about it.

69
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,850
So, she knows everything!

70
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,220
You acted like you were all fussy and thorough.

71
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,519
You totally let me down, Soo Ji.

72
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,920
Gosh, I don't know.

73
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,259
What are we going to do now?

74
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,329
I really have reached my limit.

75
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,660
You girls will...

76
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,970
They've been playing this game since the first year.

77
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,500
Everyone instinctively knows that they can gain more...

78
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,069
from Ha Rin than from us.

79
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:01,610
Then what are we going to do now?

80
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,439
Are we just going to give up?

81
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,439
We should change our approach.

82
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,439
But how?

83
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,959
- Mr. Im. - Yes.

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,029
I want to have a quick chat with the kids in Class Five.

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,899
Can we book a counseling session?

86
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,199
Why? Did my students cause trouble or something?

87
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,310
No, not at all.

88
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,879
They're teenage girls, you know.

89
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,350
They might have some concerns they can't share with a male teacher.

90
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:46,019
The problem is that they tell me all sorts of things without a filter.

91
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,519
I work very hard to cover for them,

92
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,490
yet they won't even throw a ten-dollar bill my way to thank me.

93
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,420
Sorry?

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,740
Hey, F! Where are you?

You must be under a lot of stress.

101
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,800
By the way, what happened between you and Sung Soo Ji?

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,870
Even from afar, I could tell she was really mean.

103
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,639
Don't tell me the two of you and Myoung Ja Eun are up to something.

104
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,180
It's none of your business.

105
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,879
Also,

106
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,379
don't bad-mouth my friend.

107

00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,620
Have you really joined hands with Soo Ji?

109
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,790
Do you think...

110
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,060
you can trust her?

111
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,310
It's a vitamin supplement.

112
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,209

You're a computer geek yourself. A programmer?

183
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,110
Hey, do you think I'm not on Kim Da Yeon and Seo Do Ah's level?

184
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,440
Darn you little...

185
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,879

186
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,820
Don't you think Hae Jun is right?

187
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:55,889
Be careful from now on, Woo Yi.

188
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,490
It's not nice to see.

189
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,690
What?

190
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,899
We were friends.

191
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,509
You and Cho Yu Rim?

192
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,279
That's right. The 2 of you joined in Year 2.

193
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,250
You were in Grade F as soon as the second year began.

194
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,720
Does that mean Yu Rim betrayed you?

195
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,950
Unbelievable.

196
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,129
Why did Myoung Ja Eun and Cho Yu Rim suddenly join our class?

197
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,440
In any case, it means Baek Ha Rin picked them.

198
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
But why?

199
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,720
Did you and Baek Ha Rin know each other in the past?

200
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,889
Baek Ha Rin picked the members this time.

201
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:03,990
Was there a specific reason she chose you or Yu Rim?

202
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,559
Who are you looking for?

203
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,029
Was it...

204
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,830
me?

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,230
Hey, you're hurting my feelings here.

206
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,899
Are you avoiding me?

207
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,309
Sorry. I'm really sorry, Da Yeon!

208

- Hey! - Stop!

215
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,549

Do you have a fever or something?

219
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,860
What are you saying? You don't know a thing about dating.

220
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,960
No, hear me out.

221
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,429
In the past, it was...

222
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,330
- Hey, wait. - It's all there.

223
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,870
- Hold on. - Send it over.

224
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,970
We need proof.

225
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,669
You and Seol Ha seem very close.

226
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,870

232
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,090
Exactly.

233

Let's go.

234

235
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,809

236
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,779

240
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,100
So? Was Da Yeon's dad upset?

241
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,240
It's not a mere school committee.

242

It provides a connection with Baekyeon Group.

243
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,309
Mr. Kim knows that,

244
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,840
and that's why he's fuming mad about losing his position.

245
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,909
How's school?

246
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,750
Ever since a girl named Sung Soo Ji transferred to our school,

247
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,149
things have changed.

248
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,730
Dr. Yang's daughter is in your class too, right?

249
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,299
Do you know the difference between me and Dr. Yang?

250
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,470
He doesn't have a family business to hand over to his child,

Just because you live in the same castle,

254
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,009
it doesn't mean you're all from noble families.

255
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,779
You must differentiate between the two.

256
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,549

She's acting like she voted for the girls she hangs out with,

264

Why did you do that?

267
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,420
Because you were worried and anxious?

268
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,420
She was probably worried...

269
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,930

Aren't we a little too old for that?

I guess not. We did it last year too.

277

I only have my mom,

278
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,970
and she lives in the countryside, so she can't come.

I think I can help you.

291
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,970

What can you do for us?

296
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,150
We should let the school know.

297

The anti-bullying committee will hold a disciplinary hearing,

298
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,359

362
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,400
"You're in Grade F. You're beneath us."

363
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,569
You said that. Don't you remember?

364
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,900
You're in Grade F. You're beneath us.

365
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,839
Right, you probably thought you could treat us like that back then.

366
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,109
You and everyone else have always treated us like that.

367
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,880
So?

368
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,380
You thought it was still okay to treat us like that?

369
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,920
Had you truly thought of me and Ja Eun as your friends,

370
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,519
you would've apologized first.

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,470
Just leave her be.

372
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,039
(Ra Hae Jun)

373
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,180
What's your deal? Why are you doing this to me?

374
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,579
Do you have proof that I did it?

375
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:30,579
Yes, we have proof.

376
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,450
I bet your friends can recognize...

377
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,289
your handwriting.

378
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,920
(Baek Ha Rin, Kim Da Yeon, Seo Do Ah, Bang Woo Yi, Im Ye Rim)

379
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,289
You used to be in Grade C.

380
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,160
You purposely downgraded yourself...

381
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,730
to befriend the girls you hang out with now.

382
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,559
In your group of friends, you're known to be loyal and caring.

383
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,430
Why? You're okay with being in Grade D,

384
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,470
but you don't want your friends to climb higher?

385
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,170
If you don't want your friends to find out that you betrayed them,

386
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,339
you'll have to cooperate, Hae Jun.

387
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,079
Hey, don't you dare glare at me.

388
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,849
Hey, does she still look like an F to you? Watch what you say.

389
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,650
Ja Eun and I are not beneath you.

390
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,589
We can stomp all over you because we know your weakness.

391
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,430
So I just need to vote for you girls in the next round, right?

392
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,190
We got Ra Hae Jun.

393
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,430
Song Jae Hyung is our next target.

394
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,470
This is such a great picture.

395
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,599
Look at the forearm muscle.

396
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I love this.

397
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,809
Was it fun to ditch us?

398
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,579
- What are you saying? - You crazy girl. Let's go.

399
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,480
- Forget it. - We'll wait for you. Hurry.

400
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,579
- Hey, we're leaving. - Where are you going?

401
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,549
- What's with her? - Must she be so difficult?

402
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,519
What's going on, Eun Jung?

403
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,089
What are they doing here?

404
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,759
Aren't they...

405
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,759
your old friends you used to cause trouble with?

406
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,529
They were just in the area.

407
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,700
As if.

408
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,799
I overheard them hitting on you.

409
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,069
If you start hanging out with them again,

410
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,670
I will really kill you.

411
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,109
I'm not crazy.

412
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,750
What matters to me the most right now is swimming and...

413
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
And me?

414
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,930
You're such a sweet friend, Eun Jung.

415
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,230
Oh, right.

416
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,700
Do you know this person on Instagram?

417
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:35,410
(Im Ye Rim, Mega Hit trainee)

418
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,140
They keep talking as if they know you very well in real life.

419
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,509
Could this be a stalker fan?

420
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,279
Trainees don't have such a thing.

421
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Let's go.

422
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,519
Come on.

423
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,849
- No! - My gosh.

424
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,420
Please stop.

425
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,490
Please stop...

426
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,059
No...

427
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,259
Please don't be like this.

428
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,559
Get lost!

429
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,630
I won't go anywhere.

430
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,900
I can't!

431
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,640
I can't...

432
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,279
What can I do?

433
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,279
My dear daughter, what do you want me to do?

434
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,109
Get out!

435
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,359
Leave me alone.

436
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,670
I don't know about that.

437
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:37,329
Gosh.

438
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,240
Cheer up, Ji Ae.

439
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,410
Everything will be okay soon.

440
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,549
Take your time and be careful.

441
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,089
- Thank you. - Thank you.

442
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,559
- Take care. - Bye.

443
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:05,460
Hey, forget about it.

444
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,099
That guy...

445
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,910
- Are you okay? - Why wouldn't I be?

446
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,480
Oh, Pyo Ji Ae.

447
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:21,880
I'll calm her down.

448
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,049
Everything will go according to plan. Don't worry.

449
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,819
No, I wasn't talking about Ji Ae.

450
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:30,150
It seemed like you were hurt too.

451
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:31,589
Me?

452
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,289
What? Come on.

453
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,329
I was angry for a moment because of Ji Ae's attitude.

454
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:40,930
Then I'm relieved.

455
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,240
Pyo Ji Ae is like an immature, whiny kid,

456
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,799
but she's not a bad girl.

457
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,839
Everyone's situation is what determines their behavior.

458
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,079
She was just a spectator, and so was I.

459
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:55,910
Unlike you.

460
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,549
Anyway, the main part of the game begins now.

461
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:02,720
What should we do about Song Jae Hyung and Cho Yu Rim?

462
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,759
Do you happen to know Cho Yu Rim's weaknesses...

463
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,490
Forget it.

464
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,099
Hey, about your wrist.

465
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,269
Were you really trying...

466
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,970
to kill yourself?

467
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:27,509
I don't know.

468
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,210
Were you trying to help Pyo Ji Ae...

469
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,349
when you were that miserable?

470
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,890
And you conceded so we could get Cho Yu Rim.

471
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,960
Now, I remember.

472
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,099
I was wondering where I'd seen him before.

473
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,220
- Ja Eun, can you hear me? - Yes.

474
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,920
You're recording this, right?

475
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,890
- Yes. - If anything happens,

476
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,190
call the police right away.

477
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,029
Aren't you Cho Woo Ri's brother?

478
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,829
What were you doing here?

479
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:52,299
Soo Ji. Hey, Soo Ji!

480
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,170
Oh, hey. I found it.

481
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,240
I left it in the restroom of the annex building.

482
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,480
Yes. Bye.

483
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,390
Are you a hacker?

484
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,650
I read an article about you. Data Monster.

485
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,759
("Korean Hacker Ranks 3rd in an International Competition")

486
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,890
(A Korean hacker won 3rd place in a cybersecurity competition.)

487
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,130
What are you doing in here?

488
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,390
Are you here to steal something?

489
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,759
Did Cho Woo Ri put you up to this?

490
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,660
The Pyramid Game.

491
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,170
What is this game your class is playing?

492
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,210
Sung Soo Ji!

493
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,250
The part-timer at the convenience store. No.

494
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,150
Let's bring Cho Woo Ri's brother into this.

495
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,259
What?

496
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,660
No.

497
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,529
Getting Ra Hae Jun's vote isn't enough.

498
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:58,660
We don't have any information about Song Jae Hyung and Cho Yu Rim.

499
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,400
We don't have much time until the next game either.

500
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,500
But it's still dangerous.

501
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:03,970
You don't know him that well.

502
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,700
I know enough.

503
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,799
Besides, you're supposed...

504
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,940
to team up with people in similar circumstances.

505
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,210
Not with the literature teacher.

506
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,210
Like you, Pyo Ji Ae, me, and that guy.

507
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:19,950
Do you remember how I said...

508
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,119
I could find out everyone's weakness with Yoon Ye Won's help?

509
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,390
Cho Woo Ri's brother will do that for us, not Yoon Ye Won.

510
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,119
What do you know about her? Tell me everything you know.

511
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:36,900
(Cho Seung Hwa)

512
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,529
It's school violence, isn't it?

513
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,539
The votes and the grades...

514
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:43,539
If you don't get any votes, do you become an outcast?

515
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,539
How's Cho Woo Ri doing these days?

516
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,150
She won't come out of her room. It's been months.

517
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,680
A hikikomori.

518
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,220
Here's what I can tell you.

519
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,490
She was a victim.

520
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,119
You want to know...

521
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,329
what happened to your sister, right?

522
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,299
Don't you want to team up with us?

523
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,880
(Notice of Enlistment, Cho Seung Hwa)

524
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:35,589
(The 15th Pyramid Game, D-10)

525
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,960
(Convenience Store)

526
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,740
Is Song Jae Hyung a pervert?

527
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,380
Is she?

528
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,650
(Song Jae Hyung)

529
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,920
Exactly.

530
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,720
(New post)

531
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:09,930
These are some gorgeous pictures.

532
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,200
Look at his body. Oh, my.

533
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,140
I'll take the club sandwich and the Italian BMT.

534
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,769
All of the vegetables on the wheat bread.

535
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,309
Add the recommended sauce, please.

536
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,319
This is tasty.

537
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,819
- Do you want to exchange them? - Sure.

538
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,259
This is good too.

539
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:44,759
Right. Take a look at this.

540
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,200
What's this?

541
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,200
These were the pictures from Song Jae Hyung's gallery.

542
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,369
She's secretly been taking pictures of girls...

543
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:53,569
with a good figure and a temper.

544
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,039
We can expose her as a pervert if we leak them.

545
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,069
Let's use these pictures.

546
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,480
Eat up. Our lunchtime will be over soon.

547
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,450
Oh, okay.

548
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,820
Let me try to persuade her to vote for us.

549
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,949
Do you think you can do it?

550
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,289
Yes. Let me try.

551
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,260
I can't let you do all the work.

552
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,889
I feel bad.

553
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,030
I didn't find anything weird about Cho Yu Rim.

554
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,230
Yes, there is.

555
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,329
Look at this.

556
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:26,369
This painting looks exactly like the painting...

557
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:27,469
she won a school award with.

558
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:30,769
(Cho Yu Rim)

559
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,619
Gosh, she startled me.

560
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,050
Thank you, Ha Rin.

561
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,050
I got the message yesterday.

562
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,730
Are there any changes with Cho Yu Rim?

563
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,699
(Are there any changes with Cho Yu Rim?)

564
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,679
(Application for Extended Leave of Absence)

565
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,179
I'm seeing some hotties today.

566
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,150
Look at them sweating.

567
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
What are you doing?

568
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:23,190
You're a fan of Seanu and Hyung Won. Right?

569
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,199
Do you want them?

570
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,969
No.

571
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,769
According to experts,

572
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,940
Seanu and Hyung Won both have excellent figures.

573
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,809
Especially...

574
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,880
their biceps are well-developed.

575
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,349
They usually develop muscles by doing anaerobic exercises.

576
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,719
It's called the BCAA.

577
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,519
Leucine, valine, isoleucine...

578
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,500
- You saw that, right? - No.

579
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,070
- You did. - No.

580
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,500
Darn it.

581
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,440
Wouldn't it be better to get their permission...

582
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,210
before you take pictures of them?

583
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,280
I mean, the portrait rights...

584
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,210
Darn it.

585
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,079
Nice.

586
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,050
Don't goof around!

587
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,789
Why do you keep coming here?

588
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,820
If you're here alone, it might be more obvious...

589
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,059
to other people that you're a pervert.

590
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:31,690
Gosh.

591
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,230
What? Why isn't she here today?

592
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,099
It's SC. Super comfortable without her.

593
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,110
Here I go. Let's take some beautiful pictures.

594
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,380
What are you doing?

595
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,150
You just took our pictures, didn't you?

596
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,519
No, I didn't. I was taking selfies.

597
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,500
She'll delete them. I'm sorry.

598
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,440
Well,

599
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,739
she probably took them by accident.

600
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,840
Sorry. I overslept.

601
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,780
You...

602
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,619
Gosh, you.

603
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,090
Just do as I say. Darn it.

604
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,119
Why are you talking back?

605
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,969
You're in Grade F, the lowest grade among us.

606
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,500
Know your place.

607
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,369
You are in Grade F. So act like it.

608
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:53,440
(Class Motto: Everyone's happiness, everyone's class)

609
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,880
Let's do this right, Ji Ae.

610
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,250
I'll be watching you.

611
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,489
(A new message from Convenience Store)

612
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,400
Are you all right,

613
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,099
Ji Ae?

614
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,489
Cho Yu Rim was chosen...

615
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,260
to receive the scholarship from Baekyeon Art yesterday.

616
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,690
I'm sure Baek Ha Rin is behind it.

617
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,599
Ha Rin is?

618
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,429
I wonder how much of our plan Baek Ha Rin has figured out.

619
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,909
- About what I said before... - Yes.

620
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,909
You were right.

621
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:01,610
It was my fault.

622
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:03,909
Then...

623
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,449
we'll have to bring in Seung Yi instead of Cho Yu Rim.

624
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,920
To make an alliance with Grade Ds.

625
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,889
Are you okay with that?

626
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,789
I don't care.

627
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,059
She changed her mind that easily?

628
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,070
She smells like cigarettes.

629
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,670
What?

630
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,510
Nothing. How did it go with Song Jae Hyung?

631
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,679
We've gotten quite close.

632
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,050
Don't tell me you didn't use the photos.

633
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,710
That's the easiest and surest way.

634
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:41,150
I'm not as clever as you.

635
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,320
I want to do it my way first.

636
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,389
Your way?

637
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,440
Grade Ds.

638
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,840
Is this Baek Ha Rin?

639
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,840
- Yes. - She's not what I expected.

640
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,269
She looks like a regular high school girl.

641
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,809
I looked into her.

642
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,809
But there hasn't been a single photo of her in public.

643
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,019
The company might be on it.

644
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,380
I couldn't find any information about her either.

645
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,389
There's only a rumor that the chairwoman...

646
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:50,920
lets her granddaughter get everything she wants.

647
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,489
So whom do you want me to look into this time?

648
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,260
Joo Seung Yi. Her.

649
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,570
(Dad)

650
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,039
Hello.

651
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,039
I won't be able to come home from the base today.

652
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,340
- Did you eat? - I did. And I cleaned up afterward.

653
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,409
I'll lock the door and turn off the stove before going to sleep.

654
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,250
I heard parents would be able to observe your class tomorrow.

655
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,380
Oh, that. You don't have to come. It's not mandatory.

656
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,150
- I see. - Goodnight.

657
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,530
(Sung Soo Ji, Daughter)

658
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,929
I found it. Joo Seung Yi's weakness.

659
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,940
(2 days before the vote)

660
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,579
Seung Yi. Are you up?

661
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:49,750
(Seung Yi. Are you up?)

662
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,219
I'm up. But what's this about?

663
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,989
You don't want your secret to be exposed, do you?

664
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,090
(Parents Class Observation Day)

665
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:09,900
(The 15th Pyramid Game, D-1)

666
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,769
- Hello. - Hello.

667
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,679
Gosh.

668
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,989
We have an announcement.

669
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,690
Parents, you can now go to the waiting room.

670
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,289
You can observe the class starting with the fifth period.

671
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:51,940
I persuaded Jae Hyung.

672
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,739
She wants to talk to you guys in person.

673
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,420
Hi, guys.

674
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,619
So I heard this was your hideout.

675
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,230
Hey, I like it. I can smell youth here.

676
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,599
Can I come up here from time to time?

677
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,269
I didn't know she was the bubbly type.

678
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,329
So it means you'll be working with us, right?

679
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,340
Yes.

680
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:21,840
I like her.

681
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,070
Myoung Ja Eun,

682
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,309
it turned out you were a loser, hiding your true power.

683
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,239
It's not because of the photos?

684
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:28,840
Photos? What photos?

685
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

686
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:37,219
But since we're a team now,

687
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:38,750
can I give you a word of advice?

688
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,489
Don't underestimate them.

689
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,030
Especially Ha Rin.

690
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,659
Cho Yu Rim betrayed you last year, right?

691
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,170
How do you know that?

692
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,269
Do you know why Cho Yu Rim betrayed you?

693
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,070
I know why.

694
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,139
I saw it by chance last year.

695
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,739
How Baek Ha Rin hooked Cho Yu Rim.

696
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,650
Baek Ha Rin knows exactly what to do...

697
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,079
to manipulate the kids.

698
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:06,849
She's the worst of your imagination.

699
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,300
Ra Hae Jun, Song Jae Hyung, Joo Seung Yi, and us three.

700
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,630
We can form an alliance with Grade Ds.

701
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And...

702
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,469
I have an addition to our plan.

703
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:34,840
(Waiting Room for Parents)

704
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:41,619
Of course.

705
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:43,750
- Let's play golf sometimes. - Sure.

706
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,360
I don't remember seeing him last year.

707
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,460
I see.

708
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:52,929
Aren't you Do Ah's mom?

709
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,900
- Hello. - Hello.

710
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,469
- Have you been well? - Have you been well?

711
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:58,329
- I hope you've been well. - I have been.

712
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,269
You're Sung Soo Ji's father, right?

713
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,179
Yes, I am.

714
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,480
If you don't mind me asking...

715
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,820
How much do you know about your daughter's school life?

716
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,269
- Do you like me? - What?

717
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,739
You voted for me.

718
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,599
You keep helping me without making it look obvious.

719
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,380
Hey, you're so hilarious.

720
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:41,710
You're indeed interesting.

721
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,579
Then you just hate her.

722
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,610
Baek Ha Rin.

723
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,849
Remember what you told me?

724
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,150
The reason you're playing this game.

725
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:51,690
You said it was because of your secret.

726
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,960
I solved that puzzle.

727
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:57,690
Baek Ha Rin knows your secret. She has something on you.

728
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,630
To me, it was obvious that had to be it.

729
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,130
It's Sim Eun Jung, isn't it?

730
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,170
So what?

731
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,880
Are you threatening me?

732
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,980
I just told you I knew the same thing Baek Ha Rin knew.

733
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,380
What do you think I'll do now?

734
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,679
You're...

735
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,920
quite like her.

736
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,449
- What do you want? - That was quick.

737
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,989
In the next game,

738
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,519
- could you end up in Grade F? - What?

739
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,860
You're a trainee at a big label and come from a rich family.

740
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,300
You're pretty, and you get good grades. If you end up in Grade F,

741
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,130
will the other kids be able to bully you?

742
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,300
- No. - I want to break down the order.

743
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:42,340
Don't you want to beat Baek Ha Rin at her own game?

744
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,909
I think she's neat, independent, and doing well.

745
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:53,420
You have no idea what's happening at school.

746
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,980
But are you falsely assuming that...

747
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,349
your child must be doing okay?

748
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:02,559
There's school violence in your daughter's class.

749
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,840
Why do you think I'll help you?

750
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,710
Because you were the only one who was against this game.

751
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:19,880
Weren't you?

752
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,110
Here's my plan.

753
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:24,809
Screw...

754
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,719
the Pyramid Game.

755
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,449
(Pyramid Game)
