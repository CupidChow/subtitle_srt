I can't believe it.

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,810
She's so white.

8
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,020
Ha Rin, can I share this on Facebook? It will be private.

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,320
- Sure. - Yes!

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,090

22

Did you not get hurt?

23
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,530
Stop, Da Yeon.

24
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,560

No. I can't show that I know all about it now.

Well,

80
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,819
there seems to be some bullying in my class.

81
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,360
It's my first time being a homeroom teacher...

82
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,389
so I don't know what I should do.

83
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,189
- As the school violence manual... - Oh, dear.

84
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,529
Does that student...

85
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,129
have parents with great power?

86
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Sorry?

87
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,470
Oh, the victim?

88
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,970
- No. Her parents are just... - The victim?

89
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,540
Excuse me.

90
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,439
You've heard of celebrities or sports stars...

91
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,480
that have hit rock bottom for being involved...

92
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,350
in school violence, right?

93
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,379
It made me feel bad.

94
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:00,819
As an educator, if you really look into it,

95
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,649
nine out of ten cases are just pranks.

96
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,889
How is that different from getting in the way...

97
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,720
of the students with a bright future ahead of them?

98
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,459
School violence...

99
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,930
can be something very ambiguous to define.

100
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,199
- What's the point of... - Things can get serious...

101
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,470
if you speak like that in front of the public, Principal Im.

102
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,139
Students who are 17 or 18 can drift away even further...

103
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,709
if you are hasty with them.

104
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,680
You should talk with the victim first.

105
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,779
I tell you, 9 out of 10 cases are just pranks.

106
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,519
I just have to endure through this just a little longer.

107
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,460
Just a little longer.

108
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,559
We have a minute left until class starts. Stop.

109
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960

110

111
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,700
This was just the start.

112
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,919

Get back to your seats.

116
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,960
Going.

117
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,210
There are a few points I have learned.

118
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,519
- Hello. - Hi.

119
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,450
- Hello. - Hello.

120
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,120
It's quite noisy in here.

121
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,629
- Can I start class? - Yes.

122
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,990
Recess goes on for ten minutes.

123
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,759
Avoiding just those ten minutes makes life much easier.

124
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:54,730
It's funny, isn't it?

125
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,399
Recess for 10 minutes and lunchtime for 60 minutes.

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
They strictly use only those times to harass someone.

127
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,970
They do not touch you after school...

128
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,480
and do not leave behind any traces of harassment.

129
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,879
They must get permission from the ones in Grades A or B...

130
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,950
to harass those in Grade F.

131
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,779
There are these blind spots.

132
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,490
It means there are rules in the game,

133
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,690
and everyone abides by them.

134
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,559
Is Baek Ha Rin the one...

135
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,929
to have set these rules too?

136
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,129
It feels like everything is organized for this game.

137
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,370
Even the fact that the classroom is separated in the annex.

138
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,039
If this isn't a coincidence,

139
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,740
this wasn't set up just by Baek Ha Rin, a student.

140
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,750
Nature blows your mind.

141
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,779
Nature blows your mind.

142
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,320
So, "Nature blows your mind."

143
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,960
It's something mesmerizing.

144
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,830
This is how it's used here.

145
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,759
It's a matter of reaction and reflection.

146
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,159
Defining these...

147
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,669
depends on where this order started from.

148
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,440
The cerebrum sends a signal, and the body reacts.

149
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,039
This is a conscious reaction.

150
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,909
Do the teachers really know nothing about this?

151
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,679
It's so obvious.

152
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,450
- CCTV cameras? - Yes.

153
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,950
I'm an ENFP, so I'm always curious about things.

154
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,460
I saw them at the main building.

155
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,889
Why aren't there any in the annex?

156

You have a human CCTV camera in your class. It's Do Ah.

She's so reliable.

160

161

191

They get supported just like that?

192
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,529
What's going on with our class?

193
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,970
In today's society, both the rich and the poor...

194
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,940
carry Chanel bags and drive BMWs.

195
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,039
The class difference nowadays comes from people's manners.

196
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,179
The virtues that you need to inhabit shall be respect,

197
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,320
politeness, honesty, responsibility, and care.

198
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,950
The proof of one's higher class will show when people have small talks.

199
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,450
Or how they treat service workers in restaurants.

200
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,820
Or when they make small purchases using black cards. Or...

201
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,730
Get home early, younger sis.

202
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,700

203

Seung Yi, come with me for my Karrot deal.

205
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,970
I got these stickers.

206
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,669
You should just get new ones.

207
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,610
Fine.

208
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,480
- Yes! You're coming, right? - Okay.

209
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,250
Joo Seung Yi,

210
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,549
can I see you?

211
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,179
These are vitamin supplements. Want some?

212
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,120
No, thanks.

213
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,889
Did you know?

214
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,690
I heard Kim Da Yeon is the youngest daughter of QB Group.

215
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,759
Oh, you didn't know?

216
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,029
There are a lot of special ones in our class.

217
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,570
Can I ask you another question?

218
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,970
I have no one to really talk to in our class.

219
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,299
Of course.

220
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,769
What is it about?

221
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,509
Who do you think made this game?

222
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,840
No.

223
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,080
Why do you think they even make a game like this?

224
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,919
Am I the only one that's curious?

225
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,019
What if...

226
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,690
What if you were the one that came up with this game?

227
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,690
With what reason would you have made this game?

228
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,899
Because it's fun.

229
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,500
Fun?

230
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,970
The eyes that look at you when you're getting harassed.

231
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,710
Haven't you ever wanted to dig them out?

232
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,779
The look in their eyes when they see a Grade F.

233
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,580
I bet they're clueless about it.

234
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,720
I want to dig them out and show their eyes to them.

235
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,549
They won't be able to see without their eyes, will they?

236
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Then they will never know.

237
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,559
I find that so funny and entertaining.

238
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,970
If I really meant that as the maker, that would be horrifying.

239
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,700
Right?

240
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,169
That sounded like a psychopath.

241
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,610
It gave me the chills.

242
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,240
I did some thinking.

243
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,580
Why me?

244
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:51,950
There's Myoung Ja Eun too.

245
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,379
Is the transfer student in Grade F...

246
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,750
to be trampled down on from the start?

247
00:16:58,289 --> 00:16:59,559
I'm not sure.

248
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,159
But Soo Ji,

249
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,529
it's not your fault.

250
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,269
Baek Ha Rin.

251
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,109
She's creepier than I thought.

252
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,480
Will getting involved with her...

253
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,319
be easier than persuading Myoung Ja Eun?

254
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,049
Never.

255
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,390
Hey, what's wrong with you?

256
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,430
How can you just disappear whenever it's recess?

257
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,460
Don't you know we're the ones to suffer because of you?

258
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,130
Because of you and Ja Eun, Seung Yi...

259
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,130
Will you take responsibility if we suffer instead of you?

260
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,369
- Are you insane? - What?

261
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,240
Why would I do that for you?

262
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:53,839
You hate it as much as I do.

263
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,849
But must I wait in line to be harassed...

264
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,410
and beaten up?

265
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,049
Why would I do that just to keep you safe?

266
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,349
You're in Grade F!

267
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,549
You're lower than us.

268
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,619
Get in a higher grade if you have a problem with that.

269
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:04,789
Pyo Ji Ae!

270
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,529
Let's stay low.

271
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,539
A girl like Ko Eun Byeol can feel afraid and move away.

272
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,339
There's no need to care about dregs like her.

273
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,210
I need at least two votes secured by the next vote.

274
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,369
I need more votes.

275
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,509
As of right now, it's best to have Eun Byeol, Ja Eun,

276
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:29,410
and I exchange votes.

277
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,250
That can make us go higher than Ji Ae and Seung Yi in Grade D.

278
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,279
Hey!

279
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,849
Where do you think you're going?

280
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,220
Myoung Ja Eun is the only answer.

281
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,630
I don't know what I've done wrong.

282
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,569
The school is a mess.

283
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,670
I'm not brave enough to tell my dad about it.

284
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,480
Soo Ji.

285
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,049
I'm sorry for telling you to report about it or move schools.

286
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:04,410
I was too careless as it wasn't my own business.

287
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,579
I even asked you to bring down someone else.

288
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,390
I'm so terrible, aren't I?

289
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,589
I just felt so cornered.

290
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:14,759
Hey,

291
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:15,930
please help me out.

292
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,859
Let's just exchange votes between ourselves.

293
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,759
That's okay, right?

294
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,069
Fall for it.

295
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,839
Fall for it, innocent Myoung Ja Eun.

296
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,109
No.

297
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,049
I mean...

298
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
I won't play that game.

299
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,990
What? Why?

300
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,490
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,200
What's with this burn pad?

302
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,859
This was...

303
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,740
a cigarette burn from Baek Ha Rin, wasn't it?

304
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,369
No. It wasn't.

305
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,869
It was her!

306
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,369
Gosh, no wonder you smelled like cigarettes all the time.

307
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,210
I found it really weird.

308
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,250
Your patience must know no end at this point.

309
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,710
I'm asking just in case.

310
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,519
You're not a masochist, are you?

311
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,619
Myoung Ja Eun.

312
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,619
Are you satisfied with how things are? Are you happy?

313
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,559
You're in so much pain that you're doing this to yourself.

314
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,960
You want to get away,

315
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,160
don't you?

316
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,140
I still can't do it.

317
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,980
Well,

318
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,480
why don't you ask Seung Yi and Ji Ae?

319
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,609
If you want, I can ask them to help you.

320
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,980
Ask them to help me?

321
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,319
Who's asking who for help?

322
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,819
Seung Yi and Ji Ae are nice.

323
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,519
They even talked to me first.

324
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,059
Seung Yi also lets me borrow her stuff often.

325
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,529
They don't curse either.

326
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,160
Whenever the kids ask for their help,

327
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,230
they always help them out without getting mad.

328
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,829
So if you ask them nicely...

329
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,900
I see.

330
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,470
They must be very nice.

331
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,609
But do you know the difference?

332
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,440
The difference between being nice and being a pushover.

333
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,180
Shall I show you?

334
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:14,849
What?

335
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,950
Get lost!

336
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,349
It's my vote!

337
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,980
I went through all that because of the two of you.

338
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,190
Even an apology wouldn't be enough and you're being so shameless.

339
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,319
Forget about them, Seung Yi. Don't even bother. Let's go.

340
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,859
Do you think I'm some kind of pushover?

341
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,190
Don't act like you're the same as me while being in Grade F.

342
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,430
You're insane.

343
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,829
- Let's go. - Darn it.

344
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,730
See?

345
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,269
Do you still think they're nice?

346
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,099
Are they nice because they're not the ones to touch you?

347
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,700
They... No.

348
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,869
All of our classmates will want you to stay in Grade F.

349
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,470
As long as possible.

350
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,809
That is how they will survive.

351
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,309
That's what humans do.

352
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,750
That's being wise.

353
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,849
You're not being nice. You're a pushover.

354
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:52,380
Get yourself together, Myoung Ja Eun.

355
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,720
From now on,

356
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,849
you and I just have to think about getting away from Grade F...

357
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,829
What? Did she feel hurt for real?

358
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,359
I'll get going first.

359
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,029
Hey!

360
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,039
The classmates stayed the same...

361
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,180
from Year 1 Class 5.

362
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,650
Only Ja Eun and I were the new ones in class.

363
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,779
Year 1 Class 5?

364
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,690
That was why it was the 13th game.

365
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,019
It must've started around June of last year.

366
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,329
But Soo Ji,

367
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,930
You didn't tell Ja Eun about me, did you?

368
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,529
In the end, it's the same for Eun Byeol.

369
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,329
She acts like she cares for Ja Eun,

370
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,839
but she wants to stick to being a bystander.

371
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,900
I don't have other intentions.

372
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,480
It's just in case she's offended...

373
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,980
What is it?

374
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,579
It's no different for me either.

375
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,279
If I bring Ja Eun up to her and they happen to reconcile,

376
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,079
I could end up being alone.

377
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,619
It is why I'm saying this is what humans are like.

378
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,920
All humans are...

379
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,529
bound to be selfish and self-centered, Ja Eun.

380
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,279
(Dad)

381
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,420
- Salute! - Salute.

382
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,990
Hi.

383
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,349
- Here. - Thanks. I appreciate it.

384
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,690
I'll see you at home.

385
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,119
Oh, right. About your transfer...

386
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,390
Has it been moved up? When will I go?

387
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,589
You don't have to.

388
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,660
- Pardon? - My duty in Seoul got extended.

389
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
You'll be able to graduate from your current school.

390
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,039
You'll become a senior next year. Isn't it great?

391
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,599
Go on.

392
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,940
No, Dad.

393
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,779
This time,

394
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,849
I'm doomed for real.

395
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,509
- Seo Do Ah. - Yes.

396
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,720
Myoung Ja Eun.

397
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,920
Is she absent again today?

398
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,220
Goodness.

399
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,019
All right. Open your textbooks.

400
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,460
The limit of a function...

401
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,930
I made a mistake that day.

402
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,730
You're not being nice. You're a pushover.

403
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,259
Get yourself together, Myoung Ja Eun.

404
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,000
- From now on, you and I just... - I'll get going.

405
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,470
I shouldn't have made it...

406
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,740
- too clear for her. - It goes here.

407
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,339
In this case,

408
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,609
x square minus 3x plus 2 over x minus 1.

409
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,809
How do you solve this?

410
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,579
When x goes here, what is the denominator?

411
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,619
It converges to zero.

412
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,450
What? Do you feel bad for her?

413
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,650
Should we help her a little?

414
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,119
- No. - Then, 0 over 0.

415
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,160
It converges. How do you do it?

416
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:52,359
In this case, let's factorize the upper part first.

417
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,730
Let's do the first one. What then?

418
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,630
Limit x...

419
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,240
Get yourself together, Myoung Ja Eun.

420
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,269
From now on,

421
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,500
you and I just have to think about getting away from Grade F...

422
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,109
I'll get going.

423
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,279
Hey.

424
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,329
Why aren't you coming to school?

425
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,470
You'll come tomorrow, right?

426
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,670
I went overboard that day. I'm sorry.

427
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,170
Did you get close with Soo Ji?

428
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:50,150
So, has school become fun for you? No, right?

429
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,119
Then, I'll be...

430
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,660
so disgusted.

431
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,490
Too bad.

432
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,940
(Myoung Ja Eun)

433
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,299
(I went overboard that day. I'm sorry.)

434
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,809
The school ballet society will give a special performance.

435
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:29,150
(Myoung Ja Eun)

436
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,549
Soo Ji.

437
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,960
All right. Soo Ji, go get it.

438
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:44,829
A shotgun?

439
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,700
My dad's hobby is hunting.

440
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,299
I borrowed it from him in case I'd need to use it on you.

441
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:52,569
Soo Ji.

442
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,700
Did you think you could avoid it?

443
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,039
For how long?

444
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,609
Guess what happens when a hound is...

445
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:01,539
no longer useful for hunting?

446
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,119
It dies.

447
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,549
You can shoot me?

448
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,059
No way.

449
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,490
You can't leave evidence anyway.

450
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,460
Or Ha Rin won't stay still.

451
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,960
Hey, this is so cool! It's darn intimidating.

452
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,130
Don't worry. It won't leave any evidence.

453
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,329
This is a tranquilizer gun.

454
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,099
Go get the stuffed rabbit.

455
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,940
Are you looking for someone?

456
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,710
You don't look well.

457
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,539
Would you like to drink some of this?

458
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,109
Although, it's diet black tea.

459
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,720
Do you know who the mastermind of this game is?

460
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,190
Isn't it obvious?

461
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,460
Were you looking for Ha Rin? And here I thought...

462
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,359
Obvious?

463
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,730
Don't tell me the whole class knows it.

464
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,660
Mom.

465
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,369
They probably do.

466
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,299
Even the fact that she's the chair's daughter.

467
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,940
The chair?

468
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,680
One of the top three companies in Korea,

469
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,809
Baekyeon Group's Chair Choi Yi Hwa of the board...

470
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,980
received a commendation today for her contributions...

471
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,619
to the development of education.

472
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,250
The Baekyeon Group family's...

473
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,730
granddaughter.

474
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:12,740
Let me escort you this way.

475
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,019
The steak is tender and delicious.

476
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:29,529
Mr. Seo, let me ask you something.

477
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,660
How can it be explained medically?

478
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,369
Look. The only daughter of the Baekyeon Group family.

479
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,569
The only child of the Seosin Hospital family.

480
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
And we...

481
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,740
only have daughters.

482
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,710
Can you say this is a coincidence?

483
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,079
All of our families have a superior X chromosome.

484
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,880
Oh, right. Ha Rin, which college are you planning to apply for?

485
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,849
If you don't mind, why don't you work on the portfolio with Do Ah?

486
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,819
I think it'll be a chance to tighten your friendship...

487
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,519
and become closer friends.

488
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,289
We're close friends already.

489
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,529
Do Ah is smart and cute.

490
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:10,869
She's cute?

491
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Thanks.

492
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:17,039
Do you still hang out with that judo girl?

493
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,910
I'm closer with Ha Rin.

494
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,579
Oh, Dad.

495
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,819
Can you provide more scholarships...

496
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,759
to the school swimming society?

497
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,089
There's a girl named Eun Jung in my class.

498
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,789
She's talented but poor.

499
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:39,630
Don't say no.

500
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,559
Please?

501
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:55,809
All right.

502
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,980
Let's do that.

503
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,849
Why don't we have a toast?

504
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,390
Sure.

505
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,599
(Pyramid Game, The 13th Game Result)

506
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:23,839
This is to be disposed.

507
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,609
It's ten minutes past the expiration date,

508
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:27,839
but it won't kill you.

509
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,319
It won't kill me.

510
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,410
(Dropout Application)

511
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,220
(Print)

512
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,429
("It was just for fun." Violence isn't a joke.)

513
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,599
Our game?

514
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,400
The teacher would have no idea.

515
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,969
Or he might try to help us.

516
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,969
He knows unexpectedly well...

517
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,710
about the relationships in the class and personal info about students.

518
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,380
He cares about students like Ja Eun too.

519
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,280
The homeroom teacher.

520
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,519
The homeroom teacher...

521
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,960
How many cases of school violence...

522
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,619
are handled properly when teachers get involved?

523
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,329
Only 1 out of 10.

524
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,460
And the homeroom teacher keeps a distance from his students.

525
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,530
Soo Ji.

526
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,829
Is anything going on?

527
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:00,500
Ja Eun hasn't been coming to school.

528
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:03,469
Do tell me if anything happens in the class.

529
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,940
Personal concerns are okay too.

530
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,210
He's unexpectedly caring.

531
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,550
Whether it works or not, it's worth giving a try.

532
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,550
We need another plan anyway.

533
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,150
Well,

534
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,880
- Mr. Im. - Mr. Im.

535
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,119
The principal wants to see you.

536
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,329
You're on your way to Ja Eun's home?

537
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,630
Yes.

538
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,829
I know she hasn't been coming to school.

539
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,869
You look uncaring, but you're unexpectedly delicate.

540
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,300
Will he be able to call a school violence committee...

541
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:36,940
even when the assailant is...

542
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,840
the chair's daughter?

543
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,610
Soo Ji.

544
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,530
I guarantee you.

545
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,300
The more you keep it up, the worse the situation will get.

546
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,570
On what grounds?

547
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,300
So far, only one person was...

548
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:10,139
against the game.

549
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,110
Today, we'll talk about Baruch Spinoza's...

550
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,510
One of them was against the game?

551
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,579
So what?

552
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,389
All of them gave in to conform with it.

553
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,219
Is this your grounds?

554
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,789
And it means Ha Rin...

555
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,690
made her submit.

556
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,460
A deity...

557
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,760
There's a week left until the next game begins.

558
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,469
Will I be able to escape from being in Grade F?

559
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,599
That they're not the Creator or...

560
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,409
You still have a slight fever.

561
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,539
You can't stay here for two periods in a row.

562
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,579
Return to your classroom for now,

563
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,150
and leave school early if you can't stand it.

564
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,110
To my classroom?

565
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,280
Take your time resting and come out when you're ready.

566
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,639
The more you keep it up,

567
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,940
the worse the situation will get.

568
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,179
- Hello. - Hello.

569
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,280
- Hi. - Hi.

570
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,250
I wonder if kids these days are abnormal or sick.

571
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:31,519
They obviously were fighting, but when I stopped them,

572
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,659
they said they were just playing.

573
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,320
I guess it's a way to have fun these days.

574
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,599
They're totally different from our generation.

575
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,500
They're really rough and violent.

576
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,900
I really don't get it.

577
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,800
Can you call that a joke?

578
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,110
You have big buttocks.

579
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,710
Is that simply having fun?

580
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,980
No.

581
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,250
To be outside, it's really...

582
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,550
Is it P.E. next period?

583
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,489
What's so fun?

584
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,690
Are you sure you're having fun all together?

585
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,389
Mr. Im, leave us alone during break time.

586
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,730
This is how we have fun.

587
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,630
Right, Soo Ji?

588
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,070
Mr. Im.

589
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,300
What is it?

590
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,110
Well, the thing is...

591
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,309
Mr. Im, will you walk me to the infirmary?

592
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,920
I think I have a cold.

593
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,179
I'll go with her.

594
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,380
I'll go with him.

595
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,820
Right. You have a class to take.

596
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,420
I'll take her. Is that okay?

597
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,260
- Sure. - Let's go, Soo Ji.

598
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,050
So you have something to tell me?

599
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,880
Can a school violence committee...

600
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,349
be called...

601
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,059
for Class Five?

602
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,590
I was...

603
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,590
concerned about you already.

604
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,659
What is it?

605
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,260
Are your classmates bullying you?

606
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,840
Yes.

607
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,070
Can you help me?

608
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:34,880
Last year,

609
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,280
there was a student named Woo Ri in the class.

610
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,949
Like you,

611
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,820
she was being bullied.

612
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:45,219
Ja Eun is going through something similar, right?

613
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,159
I think...

614
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,670
I can help you girls.

615
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,670
I'm saved.

616
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,239
I'm saved.

617
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:02,710
Thank you.

618
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,539
Thank you for telling me.

619
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,440
Soo Ji.

620
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,809
What you just said...

621
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,849
Can you look here and say it again?

622
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,360
Are you ready?

623
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,130
Did you see it? What's going on with Soo Ji?

624
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,360
- She's doomed. - What is she going to do?

625
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,900
- To the homeroom teacher. - Assigned?

626
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,170
She probably doesn't know...

627
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,429
- that he's a lunatic. - You bet.

628
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,969
I feel bad for her.

629
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,769
She became his prey too.

630
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,469
She's naive unlike she seems.

631
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,539
As if he has no idea.

632
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,710
Tell me about it. He's just a lucrepath.

633
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,849
He's crazy about money.

634
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:44,679
He's darn crazy.

635
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,980
Darn it.

636
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,780
What if she ends up like Woo Ri?

637
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,590
No way.

638
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:55,420
Don't you have any bruises or scars on your body?

639
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,489
You don't?

640
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,699
You at least need a cigarette burn to make it effective.

641
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,500
I mean,

642
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,530
evidence matters the most for a case like this.

643
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,840
But kids these days are so clever.

644
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,739
They don't leave any trace.

645
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,670
Those little brats.

646
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,940
They've gotten better tricks for nothing.

647
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,449
Gosh.

648
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,860
Darn it.

649
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,460
Right.

650
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,289
A burn scar isn't really needed.

651
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,360
Soo Ji. Only if I have evidence,

652
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,599
I'll tell all their parents.

653
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,570
Then you'll get some compensation too.

654
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,170
Okay? Now look.

655
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,809
Grit your teeth.

656
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,269
Soo Ji!

657
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,409
Soo Ji, are you inside? Soo Ji.

658
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,880
Darn, what is this now?

659
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,750
Soo Ji! Are you in there?

660
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,519
Soo Ji, open up.

661
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,349
Soo Ji!

662
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,230
Darn it.

663
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,369
Hey!

664
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:15,099
Soo Ji, pull yourself together. Let's go.

665
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,480
Soo Ji. Ja Eun.

666
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,050
- Hello. - Hello.

667
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,619
Let's go.

668
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:31,789
- Hello. - Hello.

669
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,989
- Hello. - Hello.

670
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,260
Are you insane?

671
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,199
Don't you know what he's like?

672
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:44,130
Why were you alone with him? You don't know what he'd do to you.

673
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,369
The homeroom teacher... I mean,

674
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,699
that lunatic. What's with him?

675
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,940
I'm sorry.

676
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,840
I should've told you.

677
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,710
I...

678
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,789
Let's start the shoot.

679
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,059
A strip show.

680
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,570
What is this?

681
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:17,869
A strip show?

682
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:19,969
Who is this?

683
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:23,170
It was a penalty.

684
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,039
The homeroom teacher would claim...

685
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,380
Da Yeon bullied you and threatened her parents.

686
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,949
Because it'd get him money.

687
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,219
Then Da Yeon would take revenge on you.

688
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,550
She's the example.

689
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,119
Woo Ri.

690
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,119
Cho Woo Ri.

691
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,760
Did you also agree to the rules when you first...

692
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,230
joined the game?

693
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,429
(Pyramid Game, Rules)

694
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,699
(Leak contents and you'll face the utmost penalty.)

695
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,030
(I agree to follow the game rules, Vote now)

696
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,840
That was why she was penalized?

697
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,900
They're insane.

698
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:58,670
Did Mr. Im harass you too?

699
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,739
Not me.

700
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,340
I don't participate in the game...

701
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,420
Are you okay?

702
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,519
Did you get hit?

703
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,889
Forget it. This is just physiological.

704
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,690
I'm sorry, Soo Ji. It's because of me.

705
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,900
It's my fault.

706
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:25,730
It'll be over soon.

707
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,940
What?

708
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,639
Anyway, how did you know I was there?

709
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,349
(Dropout Application)

710
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,730
(It's the counseling room.)

711
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,530
(Dropout Application, Myoung Ja Eun)

712
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,269
Ha Rin.

713
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:02,300
Tell my homeroom teacher...

714
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:05,070
to shut his mouth as if he's invisible...

715
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:08,110
and just focus on teaching classes.

716
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,650
Do you understand?

717
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,280
Yes.

718
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,190
So, he didn't get fired when he already did it once.

719
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,829
I get that it's a private school, but still...

720
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,329
He must have someone to pull strings,

721
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,199
which is related to Ha Rin.

722
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,230
You should've just kept the phone.

723
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,269
- It's evidence. - What?

724
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:37,639
I didn't get to think that far.

725
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,380
It's a shame,

726
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,480
but I'm grateful.

727
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:44,650
I'm back to my senses, thanks to it.

728
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,380
Oh, were you perhaps close with Eun Byeol?

729
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,949
- No. - Did the two of you...

730
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,559
join Class 5 together at the beginning of Year 2?

731
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,429
It's true, but I...

732
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,800
and Eun Byeol aren't close.

733
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:04,369
What's with that lunatic then?

734
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,280
Ja Eun, I have a favor to ask of you.

735
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,980
Join the game.

736
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,650
I want to escape from being an F with you.

737
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,260
I really mean this one.

738
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,579
I'm sorry, but it will be over soon.

739
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:52,809
Once I drop out of school.

740
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,550
- You'll drop out? - Yes.

741
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,250
Without me,

742
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,050
the situation will change.

743
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,059
This game...

744
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,159
will never be over even if you're gone.

745
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:06,260
Ha Rin isn't the only one maintaining the system.

746
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:07,900
The others are the same.

747
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,030
Becoming a monster is infectious.

748
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,800
You've seen it.

749
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,380
You're insane. Get lost!

750
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,480
Do you think I'm a pushover?

751
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,849
Only if I have evidence... You'll get some compensation too.

752
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:25,880
Somebody...

753
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:28,650
has to put an end to it.

754
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,750
This class must change.

755
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,019
No. Let me rephrase it.

756
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,159
Let's destroy the Pyramid Game.

757
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,030
This is the answer.

758
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:41,929
Right?

759
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:57,679
Hey, you.

760
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,980
You should greet a teacher when you see one.

761
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,550
- Hello. - Good.

762
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,260
But you're not a teacher.

763
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,119
You're a parasite of this class.

764
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,289
This is how you use the word, parasite.

765
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:14,699
What?

766
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,670
You little...

767
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,989
- Hello. - Hello.

768
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,159
- Good morning. - Hello.

769
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,559
We'll begin the morning assembly. Sit down already.

770
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,969
Soo Ji, sit down.

771
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,199
Who's tardy? Ja Eun?

772
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,539
Being absent and tardy... She's out of control.

773
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:00,440
You know, right? Tomorrow is Thursday of the last week.

774
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,250
Make sure you come to school.

775
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,809
Draw a star next to "the blue wind."

776
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,820
What does "blue" indicate? Sight.

777
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,989
"Wind" indicates touch. Then what is it?

778
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,849
It's synesthetic.

779
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,389
That's all for today.

780
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,889
- Thank you. - Thank you.

781
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,639
Ji Ae.

782
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,639
Can't you stop smacking your lips?

783
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,380
What?

784
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,380
Sorry.

785
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,179
(1 hour before the Pyramid Game)

786
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,760
Ja Eun, are you really not coming...

787
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,500
Grade F.

788
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,570
Who will you vote for today?

789
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,840
You have no one else to vote anyway, right?

790
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,039
Then, vote for me.

791
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,940
Let me go to Grade A.

792
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,579
Right. Let us have your votes.

793
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,539
Let's just go.

794
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:52,090
(12:50pm, Thursday, September 28)

795
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:01,599
(12:50pm, Thursday, September 28)

796
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,369
We'll begin HR.

797
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,969
Go to your seats, everyone.

798
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:32,389
- Are you going to join the game? - Yes.

799
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,300
Then, sit down.

800
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:47,409
I thought you were going to ditch me.

801
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,579
I had a lot to think about.

802
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,110
You're right.

803
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:55,920
This game must be destroyed.

804
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,960
Did you get the message? The link to the app.

805
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,039
I'll skip the minor details since you'd know the rules.

806
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,409
Now, begin the voting...

807
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:28,179
for the 14th Pyramid Game.

808
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:39,929
(Download Pyramid Game)

809
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,269
(Downloading the Pyramid Game app)

810
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:44,300
(There is no announcement this week.)

811
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,210
(Pyramid Game)

812
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:51,369
(The 14th Pyramid Game)

813
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:52,369
Listen closely.

814
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:54,579
According to the rules, Grade F means no votes.

815
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,239
If we exchange votes,

816
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,849
you, I, Ji Ae, and Seung Yi will receive a vote each.

817
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,280
All of us will become Grade D.

818
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,349
Of course, we'll be ranked bottom, but we won't be Grade F, at least.

819
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,750
This is the loophole.

820
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,789
That all four of us won't be Grade F.

821
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:10,030
This game isn't perfect.

822
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,960
Let's start from here.

823
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,030
(Myoung Ja Eun)

824
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,829
(Sung Soo Ji)

825
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,809
(Voting complete)

826
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,309
(Calculating voting results)

827
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,110
(Calculating voting results)

828
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,940
(Sung Soo Ji, 5 votes)

829
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,320
Why...

830
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,050
Why am I...

831
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:12,590
(Pyramid Game)
