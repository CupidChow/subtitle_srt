The reason I trembled before Ha Rin.

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,599
I get it now.

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,519
It was fear.

Stop!

13
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,238
- We're here. - Be careful.

14
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,519
I'm so excited!

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurry up.

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,439
Come on. Hurry.

Stand up!

18

Get up right now!

- This is so beautiful. - They are so cute.

You and Ha Rin are going to spend free time together, right?

30
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,599
Can I join you guys?

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,719

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,438
Can you give me a hint?

35
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,080
Can you tell me who has reached out to you?

36
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,800
If this fails, you'll take responsibility. Right?

37
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,560
Are they from our classmates?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,479
How many have reached out so far?

39
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,039
It's a huge progress even if they're just testing the waters.

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,680
The public sentiment is wavering.

42
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,560
By the way, I got a message too.

43
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,478

44
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,639

45

Gosh. Park Ji Young?

46
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,170
Filter out Park Ji Young.

47
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,639
I bet she's spying on us.

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,480
I heard their parents worked at Baekyeon Food.

49
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,120
What happened to the recording file?

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,198
I thought you were going to leak that this weekend.

51
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,079
Right, the recording file. What happened with that?

52
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,438
We can't be ordinary high school girls...

53
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,279
enjoying the sunshine at the beach like this.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm thinking about...

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,170
delaying that.

56
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,759
Let's go.

57
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,480
- What? - What?

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,079
- Can you help me get up? - Okay.

59
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,439
Can you guess how far I'll go?

60
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,560
It was just hair.

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
How does it feel...

62
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,720
to betray your friends?

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,560
Are you disappointed in yourself?

64
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,839
Do you regret it?

65
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,279
"I should have transferred out."

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
It's not too late.

67
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,360
Run.

68
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,959
Why...

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,759
are you taking it this far?

70
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,040
What is it that you truly want?

71
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,519
What do I want?

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,839
A crack.

73
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
A betrayal.

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
Your friendship getting shattered.

75
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,838

00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,199
- Here's the tiramisu. - Thank you.

77
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Here.

79
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,920
- Hello. - Did you arrive safely?

80
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,680
Did you say you were going to Busan?

81
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Yes.

82
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,399
Okay.

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,958
Act appropriately during your three-day trip,

84
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,959
and come back home safely.

85
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,639
- Bye. - Dad.

86
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,959
What is it?

87
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,279
Nothing.

88
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,560
Well done, Im Ye Lim.

89
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,040
Your name was included in the debut group.

90
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Hey.

91
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,519
Can you take a group picture of us?

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Okay.

93
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,720
Girls, she'll take it for us. Let's go.

94
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,239
I'll take it.

95
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,720
In 1, 2, 3.

96
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,879
- Which pose should we do next? - Let's rest our chin on our hands.

97
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,639
- You're smiling, right? - One...

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,638
- What else? - Do you want to make a heart?

99
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,120
Sure.

100
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,639
Hey, what's this message from your coach?

101
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,000
The coach asked me to persuade you.

102
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,759
Did you really say you wouldn't compete in the next match?

103
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,119
Are you losing it? You've really gone mad, haven't you?

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,839
- Don't get worked up, Ye Lim. - You stay out of this.

105
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,680
It's because of me.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,160
Eun Jung is going to assist me that day when I go surfing.

107
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,959
- What? - You see, I can't swim.

108
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,000
Could you give us some privacy?

109
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,519
It's okay.

110
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
She'll make her debut.

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,600
Hey. Don't go.

112
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,519
Sim Eun Jung!

113
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,319
Do you want Eun Jung back?

114
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,519
It depends on you.

115
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,319
Im Ye Lim.

116
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,279
I clearly remember taking these photos secretly.

117
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,120
How come you have access?

118
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,960
I know I was wrong.

119
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
And I won't do it again.

120
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,599
Ma'am, whatever you're selling,

121
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,679
I'm not buying.

122
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,519
I hear your brother will take an interview at a law firm.

123
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,919
The interviewer used to be a legal advisor at Baekyeon Group.

124
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,240
What would happen if the interviewer were to see your photos?

125
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,330
I wonder if the interview result...

126
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,090
would change a lot.

127
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,719
All right. Do the field activity with the groups you divided into.

128
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,090
Then come to the lobby. Okay?

129
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,559
Hey, is that supposed to be fun?

130
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,330
I had some left.

131
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
It was more fun than I expected.

132
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,239
It wasn't that scary.

133
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,798
- It wasn't scary? - No.

134
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,239
Maybe, I should have signed up too.

135
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,960
How am I going to fix my hair, though?

136
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,089
- Who is that? - Isn't that Ha Rin?

137
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,239
- It's Ha Rin. - Is it really Ha Rin?

138
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,959
- She can't swim. - Oh, no.

139
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,679
- What's going to happen? - It's really Ha Rin?

140
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Ha Rin!

141
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Oh, no.

142
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,960
- Are you all right? - Yes.

143
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,960
I missed my footing.

144
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,399
Da Yeon, take off your cardigan.

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,559
Take it off now.

146
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,918
- If you feel... - Gosh.

147
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,159
Take it off already.

148
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,279
- Seriously. - Do you feel any dizziness?

149
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,999
You had hair treatments to get your hair this silky.

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,480
But the chlorinated water might damage your hair.

151
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Aren't you cold?

152
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,039
Baek Ha Rin!

153
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,240
Ha Rin. I heard you fell into the water.

154
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,840
Gosh. Thank you.

155
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,839
I'll take care of them now.

156
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,960
- Thank you. - Sure.

157
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,759
Thank you.

158
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,038
It hasn't been long since the ruckus in our class.

159
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,399
You reckless girls.

160
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,120
Was this really a prank?

161
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Is that true?

162
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,679
Ha Rin, are you okay? Should we go to the hospital?

163
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,119
Hey, all of you...

164
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
Be quiet.

165
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,279
Please be quiet.

166
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Okay.

167
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,120
A trip to the hospital would be too much.

168
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,080
Do you want to change first?

169
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,840
I've never seen Baek Ha Rin...

170
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,320
lose it like this.

171
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,600
Why did you do it?

172
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,080
What were you planning to do after you pushed her into the water?

173
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,519
What?

174
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

175
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I saw you.

176
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,360
Don't act out recklessly...

177
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,120
especially if you can't take responsibility for it.

178
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
What do you mean?

179
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,360
Why are you on my back? I hadn't done anything.

180
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,120
Are you talking about what happened to Ha Rin?

181
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,159
Didn't you hear her? She said she missed her footing.

182
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

183
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,279
It was a mistake. I didn't mean it.

184
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,200
I didn't.

185
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,039
Don't act like a saint.

186
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,519
I saw everything too.

187
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,000
Were you guys any different?

188
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Ha Rin!

189
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,758
How about a drink?

190
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,759
- Sure. - Sure.

191
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,200
I just wanted...

192
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,039
to point out that the game the girls are playing...

193
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,360
seems to be getting out of control these days.

194
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,879
Why don't we use this chance to discuss that?

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,600
It's just a game they're playing. What's the harm in that?

196
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,798
One of the people I play golf with...

197
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,000
overlaps in our social circle. He's a colonel.

198
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
A while ago,

199
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:57,199
he bragged about how...

200
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,639
he had been treated well by the chairwoman of Baekyeon Group.

201
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,719
The parent of a student who transferred to the school...

202
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
works in the same base.

203
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,519
It seems their game must've extended outside the classroom.

204
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,559
Addressing the issue would be nice. Don't you agree?

205
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,639
Everyone, take your suitcase after you check it's yours.

206
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,559
Thank you.

207
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,440
- Get your suitcases, and line up. - Hey.

208
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,159
Watch your head.

209
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,599
If you got your suitcases, go inside now.

210
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,199
- Go in slowly. - Okay.

211
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,439
- Let's go. - Okay.

212
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,519
- Right. - Go inside.

213
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,200
- Go slowly. - Move.

214
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,279
Ha Rin. Only our class gets to stay at this lodging?

215
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,960
Where's our room? Is it the most luxurious room?

216
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,080
If you got your suitcases, go inside slowly.

217
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
- Let's go. - Go in slowly with your suitcases.

218
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,120
This isn't it. Keep coming in.

219
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,039
Keep going in.

220
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,319
Just pick your roommates.

221
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,079
It's a simple task. Why are you taking so long...

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
to pick your roommates?

223
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,639
There are 25 of you, so make 5 groups of 5 for each building.

224
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,240
Before I group you based on the attendance list,

225
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,960
divide into groups. Hurry up.

226
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,559
Hurry up.

227
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,278
Hae Jun. Do you want to join us?

228
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,279
We don't have five people yet.

229
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,399
- Sure. - Come here.

230
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,320
Sung A, right here.

231
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Sure.

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,079
- Sin Ye. - Yes?

233
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,679
- Do you want to join me? - Yes.

234
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,840
Come here, Da Yeon.

235
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,120
Come on, Eun Jung.

236
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,480
Sir, we're done.

237
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Is that so?

238
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,480
You can't be done. Then what about those three?

239
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,119
Come on, seriously.

240
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,799
Other than these two groups, each group will take one more. Okay?

241
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,960
Let's get settled in and have dinner.

242
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,239
It doesn't matter which one we choose.

243
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,200
We'll end up with a dud.

244
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,559
Gosh.

245
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,410
Come here, Ji Ae!

246
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,240
Are you going to be okay?

247
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,410
Run, Cho Yu Rim.

248
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,650
I'm in the same room with Ye Lim. This is awesome.

249
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,319
I brought a lot of mask sheets.

250
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,119
Do you want one later?

251
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,440
Are we close?

252
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,079
Talking about being so brazen.

253
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,889
Your lodging is on the right. Start moving.

254
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,039
Hurry up. Let's go.

255
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,559
Gosh, do you smell that?

256
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,119
It's the smell of betrayal.

257
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,680
I didn't know you were so sarcastic.

258
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,559
- You're not what I pictured. - Right.

259
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,558
And you're the traitor who put Ja Eun in Grade F.

260
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,170
She must have told you everything.

261
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,200
I knew it.

262
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,240
She acted as if she was protecting other girls. It was all an act.

263
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm a victim too.

264
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,839
Did you think I wanted to betray her?

265
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,650
You think you wouldn't do the same if you were in my shoes?

266
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,960
I know I speak the truth when I say everyone is the same.

267
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,119
That goes for Ja Eun too.

268
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
A betrayal.

269
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,838
It was your wish. You can eat whatever you want.

270
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,920
- I told you earlier. - So what are we doing?

271
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,889
We have to write down our wishes.

272
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,920
- What are we doing? - Then we put it in and light it.

273
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,599
- I see. - What will you wish for?

274
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,278
Then I should write down, "Jae Hyung hearts Ja Eun."

275
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,799
Come on, Jae Hyung. Dial it down a notch.

276
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Gosh.

277
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,358
Here's the manual.

278
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,359
(Manual on How to Make Lanterns)

279
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,920
This is so pretty.

280
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,559
Ours is over there.

281
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,720
Where is it?

282
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,890
It's beautiful.

283
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
This is nice.

284
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
How beautiful.

285
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Right.

286
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,720
You're ready, right?

287
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,519
Yes.

288
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,038
She catches on really fast.

289
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,119
I wonder if this will work.

290
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,559
Do as I say when I tell you to.

291
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,959
I'll be in touch again.

292
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
(Baek Ha Rin)

293
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,650
(I'll be in touch again.)

294
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,599
Ha Rin.

295
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,519
Don't you think you're doing too much?

296
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,319
I'll be your maid and assistant.

297
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,599
You should still be the princess of our class.

298
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,920
If those fools see you, they might get the wrong idea.

299
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,119
They might think you're anxious.

300
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,078
It's all my fault.

301
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,559
I've been taking it easy today, haven't I?

302
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,559
You immature fool.

303
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,649
Just let me pamper you like a princess.

304
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,118
Just until I get into Hankuk University...

305
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,960
So you want me to give you the next exam paper?

306
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,559
I would be grateful then.

307
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,519
Just do as I say tomorrow.

308
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Get it done properly this time.

309
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Okay.

310
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,078
I'll do my best.

311
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,400
Should I run it by you later?

312
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,799
Ja Eun.

313
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,480
How can you do it?

314
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,559
Cho Yu Rim.

315
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm certain she thought...

316
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,920
you forgave her based on your action.

317
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,079
I just thought we would have been friends...

318
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,480
without this game.

319
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,880
That just crossed my mind.

320
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,759
I feel the same way with the other girls too.

321
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
How did this happen?

322
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,079
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

323
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,400
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

324
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:11,318
- Happy birthday, dear Soo Ji - Happy birthday, dear Soo Ji

325
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,160
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

326
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,960
Happy birthday, Soo Ji.

327
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,640
- Blow them out. - Blow them out.

328
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
(A surprise birthday party for Soo Ji.)

329
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,119
(I'm also in Busan. I guess we're meant to be.)

330
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,118
(Are you having fun without me?)

331
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,960
(Post)

332
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,680
(It looks like you're having fun.)

333
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Had I recognized the danger signs from you back then,

334
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,400
would you have been friends with those girls?

335
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,879
(Would you have been friends with those girls?)

336
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,759
(Would you have been friends with those girls?)

337
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,799
Would I have been friends with them?

338
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,759
All right.

339
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,720
Let's start the shoot.

340
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,319
A strip show.

341
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,558
- How much longer must we wait? - No.

342
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,598
Clock is ticking.

343
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,639
(Cho Woo Ri)

344
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,200
Darn it. She's taking way too long.

345
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,759
Seriously. You're so mean.

346
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Gosh.

347
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,119
You didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,559
I'll help you come out of your room.

349
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,039
(I'll help you come out of your room.)

350
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,559
(Type a message.)

351
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,880
(Delete)

352
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,798
When your sister was walking home alone late at night,

353
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,160
was the look on her face...

354
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,720
similar to mine?

355
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Yes.

356
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,160
She looked scared to death.

357
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,400
I wanted to thank you for the dodgeball game.

358
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
Did I already tell you?

359
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Do you want it?

360
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,880
I really hate making excuses.

361
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,159
Because I made the app,

362
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,679
I might be branded as one of the bullies.

363
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,119
So I don't think that's fair.

364
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll be honest. I stood by and just watched.

365
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,118
Besides, I wasn't the only one...

Anyway, tell me if there's anything you need from me.

Why?

370
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
When I got hit by the ball,

371
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,039
it hurt like crazy.

372
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,319

00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,480
What should we do?

374
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,200
Should we go to sleep?

Are you possessed by an evil spirit?

381
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,839
Having fried chicken at night is evil.

382
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,119
How about a salad?

383
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,879
- Hey. - Okay.

Ja Eun. Can you go and check?

388
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,159
Gosh. I thought I was going to need a heart defibrillator.

389
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,278
- Hey. - It was crazy.

390
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,920
Who is it?

391
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,799
- Gosh. Seriously. - That was crazy.

Gosh.

393
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,519
- What's that? - What?

394
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,038
- Sweet and spicy fried chicken. - Here.

395
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,079
Gosh.

making you uncomfortable?

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
- No. Why do you ask? - I was just asking.

411
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,480
you were...

412
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,039
really cool.

Cho Woo Ri dropped out of school?

549
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,328
She faced a penalty because she tried...

550
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:10,288
- to expose the game to Mr. Im. - What's the penalty?

551
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,159
- Why did she drop out of school? - From what I heard,

552
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:13,840
it was a strip show.

553
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,289
Aren't you curious about the penalty?

554
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,400
You wench! You should've never transferred to our school!

555
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,959
Hadn't you transferred to our school...

556
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,038
This is all because of you and that loser, Myoung Ja Eun!

557
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,079
Darn you!

558
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,119
Let go!

559
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,639
- Die! - Stop it.

560
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,599
Don't act as if you're a victim.

561
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,639
That's your limit, Ja Eun.

562
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,809
You still feel guilty when you're scared of me.

563
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,960
Do you want your mom to be happy?

564
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,400
Then betray your friends.

565
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,769
People who may face the penalty are Sung Soo Ji,

566
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,440
Myoung Ja Eun, Song Jae Hyung,

567
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,000
and Sim Eun Jung.

568
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,479
This is just my speculation.

569
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,289
For your information, Ha Rin is annoyed by Group Four.

570
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,719
The black vests.

571
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,289
And Pyo Ji Ae?

572
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,679
Pyo Ji Ae.

573
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,329
Do you want to switch rooms with me?

574
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm uncomfortable around Myoung Ja Eun and her friends.

575
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,360
Anyway,

576
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:49,280
if your names are called, come forward.

577
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,158
Do Ah.

578
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:53,519
It seems we need a temporary class meeting.

579
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,239
- What's the agenda? - To pick Grade F right here...

580
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,880
right now.

581
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:01,559
What?

582
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,718
We're supposed to vote for that.

583
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,119
Someone in our class must be in Grade F.

584
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,280
Didn't you guys all sense it?

585
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,760
With someone in Grade F, you'd all be safe.

586
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:23,678
She's so annoying.

587
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,679
- Hey. - Ja Eun.

588
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,199
Are you listening?

589
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,078
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

590
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,519
You're so rude.

591
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,280
Things are unstable right now...

592
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,360
because you don't know when and who would be in Grade F.

593
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,280
That's why we're going to pick one of you to be in Grade F.

594
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,480
That's today's penalty.

595
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:46,960
Raise your hands if you agree.

596
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,280
Of course, they'll raise their hands.

597
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,679
They don't care as long as it's not them.

598
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,800
This is being safe...

599
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,679
versus being bystanders.

600
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,238
You're not going to raise your hand, Sin Ye?

601
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:23,159
What? Okay.

602
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:30,880
I wanted to talk to you.

603
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:49,039
The prisoner's dilemma.

604
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,038
Here's what you're going to do.

605
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:53,920
You will expose each other's mistakes.

606
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,159
Like this.

607
00:45:58,119 --> 00:45:59,839
You crossed the line by saying how you would...

608
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,199
get rid of the game.

609
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,000
The game is over once you run out of paintballs.

610
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,880
Think hard.

611
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,920
If you expose more of your friends' mistakes,

612
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,519
your chance of survival will go up.

613
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,239
Of course. If all of you decide to stay silent,

614
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,400
you will survive together.

615
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,039
But...

616
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:23,119
what's the chance of that happening?

617
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:30,800
Betray your friends.

618
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,360
(Baek Ha Rin: Betray your friends.)

619
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:37,320
(Baek Ha Rin: Betray your friends.)

620
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,559
What do I want?

621
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:47,639
A crack.

622
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,239
A betrayal.

623
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,920
Your friendship getting shattered.

624
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,960
And Ja Eun who will be alone.

625
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,320
What did they do wrong?

626
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,599
What could I say?

627
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:17,599
Mistakes?

628
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,079
What mistakes? Darn it.

629
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,960
I betrayed my friends.

630
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,360
I betrayed my friends.

631
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,679
I betrayed my friends.

632
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,360
I betrayed my friends.

633
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,880
I betrayed my friends.

634
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:44,679
What are you doing?

635
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,400
Are you fighting again?

636
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,559
Actually,

637
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,840
I was blackmailed for the first time in my life...

638
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,639
by Baek Ha Rin.

639
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:57,760
But here's what she's clueless about.

640
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,639
That my brother beat me up, growing up.

641
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,319
He beat me up so badly that...

642
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,920
an eight-year-old had a ruptured vein in her eye.

643
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,879
It was the opposite of the desired effect.

644
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,840
I actually want to see him struggle with his life.

645
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,400
What about you, Ye Lim? Are you going to be okay?

646
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,880
Sim Eun Jung.

647
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,880
She saw how badly I wanted to make a debut.

648
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,360
Yet, she gave up on her dream so easily.

649
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,159
I won't consider her my friend.

650
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,360
Did you hear that, Eun Jung?

651
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:28,199
Have a good life.

652
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,719
I'm sorry. I heard about your dad.

653
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:39,119
- It's my fault. - Ja Eun.

654
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,400
- Get a grip. - Yes.

655
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,960
Let's make one thing clear.

656
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,599
It wasn't your fault.

657
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,439
It's all because of that witch, Baek Ha Rin.

658
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,760
That evil wench.

659
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,079
And you too. You don't have to feel bad either.

660
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,559
You said you just delayed it. No?

661
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,079
You won't delete them?

662
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,960
I came here to delete them...

663
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,440
because I was scared.

664
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:08,639
My fear is one thing.

665
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,079
But this might come in handy later.

666
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:13,639
I'll talk to my friends.

667
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,320
The prisoner's dilemma.

668
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,719
If a prisoner betrays, it could ruin all the others.

669
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,558
But if they work together,

670
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,639
all of them would benefit from this psychological warfare.

671
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,920
Watch us.

672
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,119
(The Pyramid Game)
