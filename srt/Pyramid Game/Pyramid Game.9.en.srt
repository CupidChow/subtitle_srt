00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,040
(Congratulations on your debut, Ye Lim!)

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Im Ye Lim!

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,359
- Ye Lim! - Hey, look at her!

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,599

00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,199
(What are you looking at, Ye Lim? Only look at me. Okay?)

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,039
(Arcade)

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,159
I'll see you at the swimming pool.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
(Im Ye Lim)

9
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,839
- You're so pretty. I'm a fan. - You were amazing.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,559
- I'm a fan. - You were great!

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,599
- Good luck! - You're so pretty!

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,520
- Ye Lim, you're gorgeous! - Good luck!

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,560
Congratulations on your debut.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,079
(Sim Eun Jung: Congratulations on your debut.)

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,840
- What happened to her? - Is this for real?

16
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,799
- Oh, no. - What happened?

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
We'll begin the 16th Pyramid Game.

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,959
But before that...

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
Ha Rin. You said you wanted to address the class.

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,598
I'd like to pick someone...

21
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,120
who will permanently stay in Grade F through today's vote.

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
Permanently...

23
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,039
in Grade F?

24
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,960
Being a permanent F means...

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
she will stay in Grade F until we graduate.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,719
We'll do this until we graduate?

27
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,918
- We had to play this next year too? - I had no idea.

28
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,280
There's one more year left.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,080
Is there anyone who wants to volunteer to be a permanent F?

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,479
Anyone?

31
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,280
Sung Soo Ji.

32
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,080
(Pyramid Game, Download the Pyramid Game app.)

33
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,039

(Episode 9)

36
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,360
Because of you, Ye Lim...

37
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,439
- Ye Lim? - What about Ye Lim?

38
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,560
What happened to Ye Lim?

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,680
I heard the siren earlier. Was the ambulance here for here?

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
Are you satisfied now?

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,039
Because of the game you created,

42
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,838
Cho Woo Ri became a hikikomori.

43
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,399
Myoung Ja Eun slit her wrist.

44
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,680
Sim Eun Jung might not be able to perform as an athlete.

45
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,480
This time, it was Ye Lim.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Everyone.

47
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,120
Is there anyone who doesn't know Baek Ha Rin came up with the game?

48
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,279
Go to your seat, Soo Ji.

49
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,560
Yes. I created the game.

50
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,439
You will have to do as I say from now on.

51
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,519
Let me say this again.

52
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,079
I will now accept volunteers to be permanently in Grade F.

53
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,079
What? Permanently in Grade F?

54
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
No way. Will that naive fool...

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,560
Why do we have to pick someone...

56
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,398
to be permanently in Grade F?

57
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,399
No.

58
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,959
Before that, how can you guarantee she'll permanently stay in Grade F?

59
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,839
What?

60
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,000
This text message.

61
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,199
You failed to punish Kim Da Yeon through the game.

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,519
How can I trust you?

63
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,439
That's all you've got?

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
That one time I failed?

65
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,559
You transferred to our school only a few months ago.

66
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,278
Do you think you know the entire history of our class?

67
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,398
Even if I'm a transfer student,

68
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm free to say that I have no confidence in you.

69
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,680
Even if you created this game,

70
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,360
this is my game too now.

71
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,079
I agree with Baek Ha Rin.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,120
What about you, Park Ji Young?

73
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,239
What do you say?

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,519
Someone in Grade F permanently. Are you in?

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,079
What?

76
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Well,

77
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
sure. Sounds good.

78
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,600
What about you guys?

79
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,959
Yang So Young.

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,399
Do Mi Young.

81
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,920
No.

82
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,040
Don't raise your hand, Ja Eun.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,559
I must stop this.

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,720
Fine. Then let's all decide on this.

85
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,240
Whether or not to pick someone to be in Grade F permanently.

86
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
If the class agrees with you, I'll accept it too.

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
But...

88
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:43,439
you must accept the result...

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,079
because this is everyone's game.

90
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,839
But I plan to get rid of this game.

91
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
What about you guys?

92
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,920
Whom will you vote for the permanent F?

93
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,040
Your friend sitting next to you?

94
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,160
Or the one behind you?

95
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,920
I don't want to do that anymore...

96
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,639
because we're friends.

97
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,639
Surprisingly, it only takes a small stone...

98
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,279
to bring down a well-built tower.

99
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,079
Cho Woo Ri.

100
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Myoung Ja Eun.

101
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,360
Sim Eun Jung.

102
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,399
And Im Ye Lim.

103
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
The next victim...

104
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,680
could be yours.

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,600
Do you still want to play this?

106
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,120
The victim wasn't someone from a lower grade,

107
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,959
but someone from Grade A whom they idolized.

108
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
If the idol of our class, Ye Lim, attempted to kill herself,

109
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,040
this would work.

110
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,319
They will sense that this game will destroy everyone,

111
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,279
not just the one in Grade F in the end.

112
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,198
Only a while ago,

113
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,920
you were a downgraded version of Baek Ha Rin.

114
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,960
So this is the solution you came up with.

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,799
The hybrid version of Sung Soo Ji and Myoung Ja Eun.

116
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,360
Those of you who don't want to participate in this crazy game...

117
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,919
should delete the application and stand up.

118
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,090
If the majority agrees, we will get rid of the game.

119
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,330
If not, we will choose someone to be in Grade F permanently.

120
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,519
What do you think?

121
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,559
You emphasized it yourself all the time.

122
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,879
That Pyramid Game was everyone's game.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,639
Fine. Let's do that.

124
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,679
You're confident that you will get your way...

125
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,960
because of Ja Eun, right?

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
I will...

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,720
go back to Grade F.

128
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,639
Please.

129
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,279
Just this once,

130
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
don't do anything, Ja Eun.

131
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,600
(Pyramid Game, Delete)

132
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,399
I deleted it.

133
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,360
You're not going to make Ja Eun end up in Grade F?

134
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,919
Sung Soo Ji will be in Grade F.

135
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,039
How?

136
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,210
Sung Soo Ji won't betray Ja Eun.

137
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,360
If Ja Eun volunteers to be in Grade F, she'll stop Ja Eun.

138
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,720
I'll make her feel the misery of watching her friend...

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,679
suffering in Grade F again.

140
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,719
Watching Sung Soo Ji suffer...

141
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,519
will make the kindhearted girl, Ja Eun, more miserable.

142
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,960
Did anyone else delete the app?

143
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,960
I need 12 votes, at least.

144
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,000
I need 12 votes to win by majority.

145
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,879
(Pyramid Game was deleted.)

146
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,330
I did.

147
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,519
(Do you want to delete Pyramid Game?)

148
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,879
I deleted it too.

(Haters of Trainee L: Sharing only true stories)

155
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,759
Choi Yu Hyun and Joo Seung Yi.

156
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,639
Right. What fun would it be if there weren't any traitors now?

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
Then at this rate...

159
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,279
What? Hey. You guys.

160
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,919
I just need one more vote.

161
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,480
One more vote.

162
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Please.

163
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,840
Too bad, Ha Rin.

164
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Baek Ha Rin.

165
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
I messed up.

166
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,360
Kim Da Yeon. Your vote doesn't count.

167
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,080
Why are you here, to begin with?

168
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,480
- What? - Yoon Ye Won.

169
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,080
Did Kim Da Yeon have any access for the 16th Pyramid Game?

170
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
No. She was blocked a long time ago.

171
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Did you hear that?

172
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:40,759
You're not in our class anymore.

173
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,039
You have to transfer out because you committed school violence.

174
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Darn it.

175
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,278
Hey, do you think you have that luxury?

176
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,439
Without my vote, you don't have the majority.

177
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,039
Even so, we don't need your vote.

178
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,240
Must I spell it out to you?

179
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,600
You don't deserve to vote. Stay out of this.

180
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,320
You jerk!

181
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,960
What are you doing? Darn it!

182
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,519
Get out of my way!

183
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,240
Darn it. When you were in Grade F,

at our school earlier.

366
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,079
What?

367
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,400
Where have you been?

368
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,920
Ye Lim, as it so happens that I'm in Busan too.

369
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,119
I guess we're meant to be.

370
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,920
Ye Lim. You just turned off the light at your lodging, right?

371
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,160
Sleep tight.

372
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,240
Check your direct message.

373
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,240
I told you not to smile at other girls!

374
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,758
I wonder why you won't check your direct messages.

375
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,959
You're cheating on me, right? You just wait.

376
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,318
I'll be at your school later.

377
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,519
Unfaithful girls need to be scolded.

378
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,799
I'm at your school.

379
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,319
But you're smiling at other girls again.

380
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,920
Unfaithful girls need to be scolded.

381
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
Woo Ri. Be strong one more time.

382
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,758
Look at your three o'clock. I'm watching you.

383
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,799
You dirty tramp.

384
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,160
Remember what you told me then?

385
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,279
(I'll help you come out of your room.)

386
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,160
Im Ye Lim told me.

387
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,920
When you started 11th grade, you were no longer in Grade F.

388
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,240
But you were brave and tried to tell your homeroom teacher about it.

389
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,759
Well done.

390
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,720
She helped me.

391
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,079
- What? - Ye Lim...

392
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,480
helped me too.

393
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,119
Be strong one more time.

394
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,279
Woo Ri.

395
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,359
How's Ye Lim?

396
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,199
She'll get discharged soon.

397
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Really?

398
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,839
That's a relief.

399
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,920
Here.

400
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,759
This is Ye Lim's.

401
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,079
Could you return this to her for me?

402
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,319
She dropped it.

403
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,799
Okay.

404
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,079
Woo Ri.

405
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Yes?

406
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,559
You did well.

407
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,039
Get out.

408
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,359
Get out of my office!

409
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,119
(Do Ah)

410
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,160
It's me.

411
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,039
Kim Da Yeon. Where is this wench?

412
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,799
Find her now.

413
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,559
Bring Kim Da Yeon to me now.

414
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,799
Bring her to me!

415
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,239
There was a live-streaming incident of school violence...

416
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,838
at a girls' high school this afternoon.

417
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,240
This exposure has stirred up the public.

418
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,079
A student in 11th grade at a prestigious high school...

419
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,358
beat up another student during the livestream,

420
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,879
and the video quickly spread online.

421
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,118
There was a YouTube video titled... "High School Students..."

422
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,199
- Sir, allow me to enter. - "Pick Outcasts Through..."

423
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,439
- Salute. - "Popularity Vote."

424
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,999
- The video showed... - Sir.

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
High school students who were exposed to school violence.

426
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,240
A student hit another student multiple times.

427
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,719
She assaulted the victim...

428
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,839
in the face as well as all over the body.

429
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,359
The problematic class in the video was playing...

430
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,959
Sun Hee!

431
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,559
Didn't you say your daughter went to this school in Seoul?

432
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,480
The school Baekyeon Group founded.

433
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,200
This is the school, right?

434
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,319
You can transfer me...

435
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
out of the school, right?

436
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,279
I don't care if it's in the countryside.

437
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,599
Just make sure I can transfer out with a girl named Myoung Ja Eun.

438
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Have you gone mad?

439
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
You still haven't figured out the mess you created?

440
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
You can't get it done?

441
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,480
Is that what you want?

442
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,119
Mother.

443
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Ha Rin.

444
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,640
I made a promise to you. Remember that?

445
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,680
As long as you weren't sloppy,

446
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,160
I would do everything for you.

447
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,240
Will you still say that transferring out is what you want?

448
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,799
Yes.

449
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,679
Your eyes lost their sparkle.

450
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,039
You sloppy fool!

451
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,039
- Why didn't you tell me? - You told me to develop a habit...

452
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,880
of overcoming any problems that might arise on my own.

453
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,279
What?

454
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,799
Okay. Wait. I'm coming back.

455
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,279
Sung Soo Ji.

456
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,078
Do you think that can be your excuse?

457
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,160
I thought you would ignore it even if I were to tell you.

458
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,319
You're not reporting this to the higher-ups!

459
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,799
Watch your mouth.

460
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,440
It wasn't an assault. It was an accident for now.

461
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,400
I'll do it. I'll be investigating this myself.

462
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,680
Calm down, and get back to work.

463
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,880
You looked the other way.

464
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
That was...

465
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,039
Didn't I tell you to wait?

466
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,480
I got it. So wait!

467
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,559
You're home.

468
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Mom.

469
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,640
Wash your hands.

470
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,079
I bought some monkfish from Jagalchi Market and boiled them.

471

Let's eat.

472
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,359
Mom...

473
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,640
I had no idea.

475
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,279
I'm sorry.

476
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm sorry, my daughter.

477
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,239
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,039
I'm sorry.

No.

485
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,639
You should transfer out of there. I'll go to school tomorrow.

486
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,199
I'm fine. I have friends at school.

487

What?

Nothing. I'll be back after school.

533

Let's just end it for both of us. That might be better.

534

Why?

539
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,769
Oh, no.

00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,159

00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
out.

548
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:27,039
I can't disgrace Baekyeon Group...

549
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,559
just to save your daughter.

550
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,400
Are you telling me that you'll pin all the blame on my girl?

551
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,960
Don't worry. My daughter will face the consequences too.

552
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,559
The school had no knowledge of what was happening.

553
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,288
But the school will react fast to solve the problem...

554
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,079
and promise the public that this never happens again.

555
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,359
Ms. Choi.

556
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,119
The most precious thing to me is Baekyeon Group,

557
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,719
not my daughter.

558
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,679
Nor you.

559
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
All right.

560
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:02,809
Those of you whose names are called will move their desks to Class One.

561
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,519
Oh Sung A,

562
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,079
Myoung Ja Eun, Shin Sin Ye, and Im Ye Lim.

563
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:09,809
Next.

564
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,079
Sung Soo Ji,

565
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Jung Yeon Doo,

566
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:16,199
Song Jae Hyung, Ko Eun Byeol,

567
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,159
and Bang Woo Yi. To Class Two.

568
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,559
Only you're in a different class. Will you be okay?

569
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,289
I'll be fine.

570
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,079
But let's have lunch together.

571
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:32,769
Sure.

572
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,518
Did what we saw in the video really happen or not?

573
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,519
So what's the truth?

574
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,959
- Explain that to us. - Tell us the truth.

575
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,000
- What is it? - Answer us.

576
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,400
While the school is trying to understand what happened,

577
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,768
not to have another incident like this,

578
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,599
we are reassigning Class Five's students.

579
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,238
We will do everything possible to lessen the confusion...

580
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,880
of the students and their parents as soon as possible.

581
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,638
Make sure no one gets into the building.

582
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,639
Yes, ma'am.

583
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,329
- Aunt. - Gosh.

584
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,880
Be honest. How much did you stash under the borrow-named account?

585
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,809
Given everything that's happened, just tell me.

586
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:46,289
Okay?

587
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,239
I bet you took a lot of bribes.

588
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,919
That mouth of yours...

589
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,079
- Shut it! - Gosh.

590
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,920
Come on. Gosh.

591
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Hey, Ye Lim.

592
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,480
- Ye Lim. - Hello.

593
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,639
Isn't it too soon to come back to school?

594
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,400
Have you been well?

595
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,639
We're in the same class.

596
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,119
Hello.

597
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,288
The traits of living organisms...

598
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:15,880
are determined by genetic information in the DNA.

599
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:19,238
The specific sequence that stores genetic information...

600
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,920
in DNA is called a gene.

601
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,329
Generally, genes are...

602
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,880
Eat up.

603
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:43,079
I didn't know that the cafeteria could get this loud.

604
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:44,329
Right.

605
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,000
I heard Baek Ha Rin went abroad.

606
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,289
- Abroad? - That never crossed your mind?

607
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,599
This kind of ending is quite common.

608
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,199
So Eun went abroad?

609
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,000
"So Eun?"

610
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,559
I mean, Ha Rin went abroad?

611
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,039
Come to think of it, it's the most realistic ending.

612
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,239
I never imagined that...

613
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,238
they would face a real consequence...

614
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,960
just because I exposed the game to the public.

615
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,559
I wonder what Baek Ha Rin wanted to do in there.

616
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,880
You said you would tell me something once we got rid of the game.

617
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,920
Could you tell me that now?

618
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,039
Okay.

619
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:37,479
Why isn't Ja Eun reading her messages?

620
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,920
We were supposed to go home together.

621
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:41,079
What about Soo Ji? She's in your class.

622
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,480
I have no idea. She left alone.

623
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
Guys.

624
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,119
I got a message. The girls are on their way here now.

625
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,239
Why?

626
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,679
I told you not to be so unfriendly toward them.

627
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,079
I got it.

628
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,960
Seriously? She read it right away.

629
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,960
Gosh.

630
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,880
She's hilarious.

631
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,639
Ye Lim!

632
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,360
You're here.

633
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,959
They said they would be awkward.

634
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,718
They begged us to come with them.

635
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,718
Bo Hyun and Seon Ju helped us toward the end.

636
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:50,719
But Jung Yeon Doo...

637
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,519
My bad. I didn't know you were here too.

638
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,839
You're wearing a face blush, right?

639
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,839
Your cheeks couldn't have gotten red because you're ashamed...

640
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,440
to face them after all, you did come here.

641
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,239
Gosh.

642
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,519
You're really an annoying type.

643
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:05,239
Yeon Doo bought this.

644
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,559
Is your leg okay?

645
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,480
- Yes. - Gosh.

646
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,199
Soo Ji and Ja Eun didn't come here, right?

647
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,839
We can't reach them.

648
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Why not?

649
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,760
What if they're causing more trouble?

650
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
I really hope nothing is going on with them.

(Haneul House)

652
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,159
I'll come with you.

653
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,159
What?

654
00:46:58,039 --> 00:46:59,320
When I was in elementary school,

655
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,239
I did something wrong to Ha Rin.

656
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:05,880
Something horribly wrong.

659
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Welcome.

660
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,000
Do you know where we are?

666

My home.

667
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,639
Yang So Eun who lived here...

668
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,960
was a victim of school violence.

669
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:27,559
That was me.

670
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,960
Yang So Eun.

671
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,800
