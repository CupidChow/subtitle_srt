I knew you would come together.

8
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,560
I was going...

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
to give hope to Ja Eun for a moment...

10
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:51,520
because your betrayal would have made her more miserable.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,118
I shouldn't have let you transfer into our class, to begin with.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
To watch.

16
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,960
So she can watch what happens to me.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,560
What?

18

What did you do?

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,960
Hello. My name is So Eun.

37
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,639
I'm from Korea.

38
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,560

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,000
Nice to meet you.

41
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,840
Well done. Everyone, let's give her a round of applause.

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,120
Don't you sort of hate Yang So Eun?

43
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,479
She thinks she's some princess.

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,919
I don't want to play with her.

45
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,800
Don't say that.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,759
What? Why not?

47
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,360
Because we're friends.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,758
Do you like her?

49
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,960
I can't believe you.

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,240
If you say that, you're making us look bad.

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,680
No. I was just...

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
It's not that.

53
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,439
That's not what I meant.

54

55
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,719
for So Eun.

56
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,478
Was it all a lie that your dad went to the US?

57
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,639
I heard you were an orphan.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,719
You're a total con artist and a liar.

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,199
- What was that? - What a liar.

60
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,878

61

68
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,879

No.

No.

No.

83

I didn't get the feeling that S was a victim.

148
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,449
From her attitude, it seemed like she was bossing them around.

149

According to the reports I've been getting,

188
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,840
S has an unusual circle of friends.

189
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,398
Take a look at her first.

190
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,279
She's the famous trainee from Mega Hit.

191
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,999
(S mentioned Im Ye Lim in the video.)

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,518
(Im Ye Lim and S are close friends?)

193
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,200
Myoung Ja Eun had an awful attitude at school.

194
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,159
She rarely came into class.

195
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,200
She must have fought all the time. She always looked so unkempt.

196
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,120
She got a lot of penalty points too.

197
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,398
She was so awful that...

198
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,799
I had to tell her to do her thing outside school.

199
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,799
I thought she was a school bully.

Is this right?

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,600
Can you understand Baek Ha Rin?

203
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,959
(Study hall)

204
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,639
I'm Assistant Inspector Han Ji Min from the Violent Crime Unit.

205
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,719
I need to talk to one of your students.

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,960
- Is it her? - Oh, my gosh.

207
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,600
We need to take her to the station first.

208
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,919
What did Ha Rin say?

209
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,759
What did she say to you guys?

210
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,639
This is the place...

211
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,559
where Pyramid Game started.

212
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,159
All right. We're going to play a game now.

213
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,399
You'll get a reward if you play well.

214
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,480
But you will be punished if you don't.

215
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,638
If we were to meet them,

216
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,799
which one of these people must we behave the best around?

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,159
Raise your hands if you know the answer.

218
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
Well done.

219
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,439
- Thank you. - Here.

220
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Eat a lot.

221
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,039
So Eun, you barely won any points from the game earlier.

222
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
You won't get a blanket when you go to sleep later.

223
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,159
If you do poorly again,

224
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,879
I'll take off that blouse and give it to another girl.

225
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,039
Okay?

226
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,759
That was...

227
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,080
the reason behind the game.

228
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,759

What on earth is happening?

232
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,879
It's likely that this lighter was used to start the fire.

233
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,440
Have you seen this lighter?

234
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,039
Yes.

235
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,159
Baek Ha Rin had it.

236
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,000
Cho Rong. Don't you think this is too much?

237
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,559
What about it?

238
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,119
Yang So Eun doesn't have parents, anyway.

239
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
So she can't tell anyone.

240
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
Right, Ja Eun?

241
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,799
That's what you told me.

242
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,240
That she was an orphan.

243
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
I mean,

244
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,679
I was just...

245
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
I meant...

246
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,919
What if I have parents?

247
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,039
What?

248
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,879
If I have parents, can I use this too?

249
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,999
- Oh, right. - Yes?

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,558
Chairwoman Byun's son and daughter-in-law...

251
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,320
who are in the US don't have any children.

252
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,519
I think they might choose one of the kids from our orphanage.

253
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,399
That would be amazing.

254
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,440
I wish they take one of the kids and make a hefty donation in return.

255
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,639
That sounds great.

256
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,519
They're coming to the Supporters' Day, right?

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,399
(Supporters' Day with Baekyeon Group at Haneul House)

258
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,559
Who is that girl with the determined gaze?

259
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,279
Her name is Yang So Eun.

260
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,759
She's 9 years old. She's in 2nd grade now.

261
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Mom.

262
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,039
Mom. Can I go with you?

263
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,410
- Kid. - It's Ha Rin.

264
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,519
Kid. If you want something from me,

265
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,039
just ask for money instead.

266
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,359
Ha Rin. You got this wrong again.

267
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,519
How many times have you gotten it wrong already?

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,359
(In him was life, and the life was the light of men.)

270
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,079
It feels like only yesterday that she was a little child.

271
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Bye.

272
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,480
Change that.

273
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,119
Plant a yew or something.

274

It's okay.

278
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,169
If you've done something wrong,

279
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,719
you can still apologize.

280
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,078
I'll do it with you.

281
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,839
Don't worry, my daughter.

282
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,079
Okay.

283
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,680
What?

284
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,759
I'm with my friends.

285

Is it your mom?

287
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,960
Yes. I'll be home soon.

288
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,079
It's so obvious that we're only minors.

289
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,650
I can understand your parents' reaction, though.

290
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,519
I can't believe she was questioned by the police.

291
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,169
That girl indeed has an unusual life.

What about you?

294
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,518
I was told...

295
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,599
to come to the station by the end of this week with my parents.

296
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,440
Baekyeon is trying to blame it on you guys, right?

297
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,409
At this rate,

298
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,200
Soo Ji will end up taking all the fall, right?

299
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Obviously.

300
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,319
What should we do?

301
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,920
We're not going to do anything?

302
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,440
What are you doing? Focus.

00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,640
Why didn't you tell us? It must have been tough on you.

Look. This is the annex building.

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,920
It's a fancy building, isn't it? It looks even better inside.

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,720
You're not okay.

367
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,359
Are you sure you don't want to make a debut?

368
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,720
I won't. I apologized to the agency and the other members.

369
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,160
Besides, I can't make a debut now.

370
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,799
Everything got exposed.

371
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,759
It's all my fault.

372
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,119
(I miss you, my friend.)

373
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,359
- I should directly message her. - Who?

374
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,759
My friend.

375
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,400
(I miss you, my friend.)

376
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,440
What's wrong?

377
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Ye Lim...

378
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,200
Ye Lim...

379
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,960
called me her friend.

380
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,599
If...

381
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,720
I do that, will that...

382
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,720
help...

383
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,640
Ye Lim?

384
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,799
No.

385
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:02,799
It will help you.

386
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,359
I read this from a research paper.

387
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,359
When victims share their experience with other people,

388
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,680
the act of sharing can help liberate them from their traumas.

389
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,599
I...

390
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,559
I'll do it.

391
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,480
You can give it some more thought and then decide.

392
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,200
If I do it,

393
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,680
it's good for me.

394
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,279
It'll be good...

395
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,319
for her too. Right?

396
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,480
Ye Lim...

397
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:35,279
Ye Lim helped me. Only she did.

398
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,359
She helped me.

399
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,680
I'll do it.

400
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,359
Seung Hwa.

401
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,079
Then remember this.

402
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,319
- You did nothing wrong. - I know that.

403
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,519
I ran into Baek Ha Rin that day.

404
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:01,959
What?

405
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,039
At the festival.

406
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,039
Why did you do that to me?

407
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,519
Why did you do that to me?

408
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,039
Why was I in Grade F?

409
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,359
Because...

410
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,200
you accidentally stepped on my foot.

411
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
The reason was...

412
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,240
I accidentally stepped on her foot.

413
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,640
After I told my homeroom teacher,

414
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,279
I faced a penalty.

415
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,480
I was forced to do a strip show.

416
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,039
I was scared that...

417
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,200
they would post that online.

418
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,680
I couldn't even tell my parents.

419
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,720
I don't think she's lying.

420
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,679
Gosh, my heart breaks for her.

421
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,879
Just because this girl stepped on her foot,

422
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,959
she bullied this poor girl? This is crazy.

423
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,078
That witch is a psychopath, right?

424
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,199
A strip show? Did they go all crazy or what?

425
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,518
Didn't she say the only one who helped her was Im Ye Lim?

426
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,759
Woo Ri, hang in there. I'm sorry.

427
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,039
The reason was...

428
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,319
I accidentally stepped on her foot.

429
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:36,319
(Ja Eun)

430
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,000
- Hello. - I remembered it.

431
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,399
(Principal's Office)

432
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,480
I remembered what happened...

433
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,039
at the staircase in the main building last year.

434
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
So Eun.

435
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,758
(1 year ago)

436
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,440
It's you, So Eun. Right?

437
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,920
Do you remember me?

438
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,680
It's me, Ja Eun, from Haneulbyeol Elementary School.

439
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,319
Myoung Ja Eun.

440
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,400
It's been a while.

441
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,920
Have you been well?

442
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,440
What do you think?

443
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,160
You're doing well.

444
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm so relieved.

445
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm really relieved.

446
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Ja Eun.

447
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,519
Let's talk more next time. Sorry.

448
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,519
The staircase in the main building last year.

449
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Last year?

450
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,799
You forgave yourself when I didn't forgive you myself.

451
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,559
I saw the sense of guilt disappearing on your face then.

452
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,599
I wanted to rip your face into pieces.

453
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,559
That's why I put you in Grade F.

454
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,558
I wanted to torture you for the rest of your life...

455
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,359
because of a reason you would never guess.

456
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,599
Why are you looking at me like that?

457
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,319
What? You can understand me now?

458
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,480
You're one crazy girl.

459
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,759
- What? - Did you not hear me?

460
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,400
You're crazy.

461
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,919
Ja Eun.

462
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,680
Is it just me who finds her blaming this on you appalling?

463
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,479
She's justifying her action and blaming you for this.

464
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,599
What she's doing is just disgusting.

465
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,279
Her self-pity is making me want to vomit.

466
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,759
You don't know anything.

467
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,400
Why must I understand you?

468
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,479
Don't act like the victim here.

469
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,919
If she kneeled before you as soon as she saw you,

470
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,200
you wouldn't have made that game?

471
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,838
I get that you're on drugs,

472
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,240
but get your timeline straight.

473
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,559
You were already bullying Cho Woo Ri long before you met Ja Eun.

474
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,758
You crazy witch. Now that you're back against a corner...

475
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,919
after all these crazy stunts you pulled,

476
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,720
you're claiming you were a victim?

477
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,559
Hey.

478
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,839
That's pathetic.

479
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,119
You're a victim of school violence?

480
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,200
So what?

481
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,680
Telling me your sob story about being an orphan and a victim...

482
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,640
won't change the fact that you made Pyramid Game.

483
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,359
Both Yang So Eun and Baek Ha Rin had chances...

484
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,960
to redeem themselves.

485
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
You...

486
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,960
ruined those chances, not her.

487
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,518
You don't deserve to forgive Ja Eun.

488
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,519
Do you know why?

489
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,000
Because...

490
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
you committed school violence.

491
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,440
Live the rest of your life in shame.

492
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,799
At least that's what Ja Eun is already doing.

493
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
So Eun.

494
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,559
But still.

495
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,960
I'm sorry that I didn't ask you to play with me all those years ago.

496
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,240
I'm sorry that I forgot about you that easily.

497
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,519
I mean it.

498
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,519
I'm really sorry.

499
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,359
I don't want to hear it.

500
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,839
Remember what I said?

501
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,759
You must watch what happens to me.

502
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,559
I'll make you remember me...

503
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,880
for a long time.

504
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,160
What? A fire?

505
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,400
Even to the end...

506
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,440
Ja Eun. We must get out of here.

507
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,119
Let's get out of here first.

508
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,559
You too. Shut it, and come out.

509
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
So Eun!

510
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,769
Is anyone in there?

511
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,960
We're the firefighters. Please answer me!

512
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,719
Hey.

513
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:35,079
Oh, these?

514
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,879
Our actual exam paper...

515
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,559
and the exam file from Mr. Im's desktop.

516
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,289
Only Question 17 was different.

517
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,519
Question 17?

518
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,840
Question 17 was added at the last minute, right?

519
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,159
Hierarchies exist everywhere.

520
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,119
That school is a smaller version of society.

521
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,808
We fall into a certain class in society...

522
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:05,239
Even if it corners Grade F enough that they want to die?

523
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,239
Would you still say that?

524
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:09,809
To someone, that life could be hell.

525
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,840
I think I found it.

526
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,289
What are you doing?

527
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,360
Sung Soo Ji.

528
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Yes.

529
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,000
I read the interview your subordinate gave...

530
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,159
to the reporter.

531
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,119
I'm sorry.

532
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,079
I misunderstood you.

533
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
Soo Ji.

534
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,400
I decided to go to your school to observe you in class...

535
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,439
because I thought...

536
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,360
you never needed anything from me since you were a kid.

537
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,400
You were always independent.

538
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,719
You were a reliable daughter.

539
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,289
But before you became an adult and led your independent life,

540
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,599
I wanted...

541
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,719
to check at least once...

542
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:30,880
if you were doing well at your new school...

543
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,400
and getting along with your friends. That's what I wanted to see.

544
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,920
I've been acting appropriately.

545
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,239
Hey.

546
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,559
Don't worry.

547
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,599
I'm all right now.

548
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:00,840
I'm sorry.

549
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,639

Luckily, the operating system...

554
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,039
logged the records of the file getting copied.

555
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,960
There are several records of the exam file getting copied.

556
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,480
He leaked the exams and was hired when he was underqualified.

557
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,159
This is enough. We're merely bringing up the suspicion.

558

702
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,519

718
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,639
I know that what I did was wrong.

719
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,159
I shouldn't have looked the other way.

720
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:11,559
Look the other way...

721
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,519
I've been thinking.

722
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,159
No matter how hard I tried, I still can't understand her.

723
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,679
Nor do I pity her.

724
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,199
She said she resented you when she met you again.

725
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:25,718
But she made a castle,

726

Hey.

772
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,920
What you said was really hurtful!

773
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:38,159
I didn't know you had it in you.

774
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,239
Can you say that again? Can you treat me poorly again?

775
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,840
Curse at me.

776
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,599
Our school break is way too short.

777
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,920
That was so short!

778
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:49,719
Right. I hear our school is getting a new name.

779
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,760
I bet it will be one of those lame names.

I saw the announcement from Mega Hit.

Your group was making a debut next week.

785
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,718
Don't you think you can get back in that industry?

786
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,198
Right. I've been researching.

787
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:07,639
The public has a favorable opinion of you.

788
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,800
I found some hate comments, though.

789

00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,960
Are you sure you won't regret it?

791
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,079
I should face some kind of penalty at least.

792
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:24,840
I can make an excuse and say I didn't do anything.

But there must have been moments...

794
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:29,039
I hurt them more because I didn't do anything.

795
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,360
So I should face the consequence too.

796
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,960
At least, I got to perform at the festival.

797
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:36,960

He's probably in the military.

- Yes. - What about my academy?

821

- Shouldn't we study? - Just skip it.

822

- Hey, that's not important now. - Skip it.

823
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,038
- Girls, calm down. - This is amazing.

824
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:47,039
