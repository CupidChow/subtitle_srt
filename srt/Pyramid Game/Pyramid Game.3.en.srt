Someone voted for us instead.

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,909
Who...

9
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,009
What's wrong?

(Grade F, Pyo Ji Ae, 0 votes)

11
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,079
Why is Ji Ae Grade F?

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,149
This isn't what we planned.

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,719

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,609
I don't know what's going on, but anyway...

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,150
This is good for us.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,810
We're at least off the hook.

21
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,079
Why...

22
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,650
What about Ji Ae?

23
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,450
- How did this happen? - It's obvious.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,150
She must be on the outs with her best friend.

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,790
That must've been the plan all along.

26
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,560
Did Da Yeon do this to you?

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,599
Unbelievable.

28
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,870
This is all because of those Grade Fs.

29
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,900
One of them figured out...

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,870
that even besties could turn on each other.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
It's why I said they could easily go their separate ways.

32
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,239
In a nutshell,

33
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,680
Joo Seung Yi found new friends,

34
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,349
and Pyo Ji Ae was betrayed by her one and only friend.

38

Did you not vote for me?

39
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,870
You've got to be kidding me.

40
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,469
Two votes for Myoung Ja Eun?

41
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,310
Since when was she part of the game anyway?

42
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,379
I thought...

43
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,210
the new girl was to blame.

44
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,280
What should we do about it, Ha Rin?

45
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,889
Woo Yi, what are you saying?

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,960
Why would you ask me that?

47
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,530
What?

48
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,139
Joo Seung Yi, how could you do this to me?

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,409
Seung, what's up?

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,050
- We're off to the restroom. - Are you talking to a Grade F?

51
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:57,849
No.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
Let's go.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
What can we do to help Ji Ae?

54
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,460
Does anything come to mind? It can be anything.

55
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,930
Maybe if the three of us oppose to this game...

56
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,669
You fraud.

57
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,879
- What? - I know somewhat about you now.

58
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,610
You're...

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,349
You're going to hang me out to dry.

60
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,879
Don't even think about it. I see right through you.

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,479
Is it because you're out of the woods now?

62
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,120
Of course she becomes sharper at a time like this.

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,020
You see,

64
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,430
I'm not as nice as you are.

65
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,229
I'm disgustingly normal.

66
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,699
I wouldn't have cared about this game...

67
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,199
had I not been ranked as Grade F.

68
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,199
That being said,

69
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,500
why should I help Pyo Ji Ae out of the goodness of my heart?

70
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,800
You're in Grade F!

71
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,969
Don't even bother. Let's go.

72
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,610
I'm just being as selfish as her.

73
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,310
That's hardly a crime.

74
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,680
But you wanted to put an end to this game,

75
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,479
so what you said is nothing but an excuse.

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,319
And making excuses will never change anything.

77
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,319
That I know.

78
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,490
Keep your promise, Sung Soo Ji.

79
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,219
You wanted to change our class.

80
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,129
Ja Eun, I'm sorry to say this,

81
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,930
but things have changed for me.

82
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,730
I'm no longer...

83

Congrats, Soo Ji.

89

I know it's been tough,

90
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,560
and it wasn't even your fault.

91
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,360
This will never happen to you again.

92
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:20,860

You'll help me?

Whatever. Right, Grade C.

95
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,370
I'm Grade C now.

96
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,829
I don't care if she's the game master of a psychopath.

97
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,939
There's no need for me to be hostile.

98
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,670
Thanks.

99
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,870
That sounds reassuring...

100
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,480
coming from someone who's always a Grade A.

101

You're the first to go up two grades...

102

from Grade F.

103
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,490
I got Grade F on my shoes.

120

People say you feel a pang of guilt.

129
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,389
But someone also said...

130
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,429
it's only because our conscience takes the shape of a triangle.

131
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,500
And in some cases,

132
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,960
the apex of one's conscience can be worn down...

133
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,730
turning the triangle into a round shape.

134
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,669

136

Where did you get them done?

139
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,279
I'm sorry about before.

140
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,879
Can we forgive and forget?

141
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't tell me you're one to hold grudges.

- Who will you vote for today? - Hey, Grade F!

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,789
It's fine. After all, I was Grade F back then.

145

You're not as rough around the edges than I thought.

146
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,769
Tell me about it. How cool is this of her?

147
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,529
That's the kind of people I like.

- Thank you. - What's your name?

- It's Na Yeon. - I see.

she looks a lot like you from back when you were young.

Don't you agree, CEO Baek?

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,279
I'm not sure, Mother. I...

165
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,549
I have something to sort out, so I must excuse myself.

166
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,919

168
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,600
Of course Ha Rin was more beautiful,

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,429
and I don't say that because she's my daughter.

170

Of course. I'll make sure she has everything, Mother.

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,309
Hey.

184
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:44,309
Hi.

185
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,980
- You go first. - Thank you.

186
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,610
Soo Ji, I'm sorry about before.

187
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,309
Get lost.

188
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,159
(Sung Soo Ji, 5 votes, Myoung Ja Eun?)

189
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,330
(Myoung Ja Eun, 2 votes, Sung Soo Ji?)

190
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,340
How's school? Are you fitting in?

191
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,039
It's good. By the way, there was an uptick in my grades...

192
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,450
for my mock CSAT exam.

193
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,309
I'll also be able to maintain my school grades.

194
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,990
Exams aren't everything.

195
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,120
- Schools are... - A miniature version of society.

196
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,419
That's right.

197
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,590
So conduct yourself well.

198
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,399
Also,

199
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,669
learn how to power through when faced with hurdles.

200
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,500
Don't avoid them.

201
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,500
Actually, I am going to avoid my problems.

202
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,269
To the best of my ability.

203
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,309
Right?

204
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,179
What's up? Is it something fun?

205
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,350
Ha Rin, hear this.

206
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,980
You have no idea how funny she is.

207
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,490
The eyes that look at you when you're getting harassed.

208
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,820
Haven't you ever wanted to dig them out?

209
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,889
The look in their eyes when they see a Grade F.

210
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,899
I bet they're clueless about it.

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,730
That was hilarious.

212
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,240
Are you and Ja Eun done?

213
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,269
That's too bad.

214
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,309
I voted for you guys, you see.

215
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,740
You voted for me?

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,049
- Why? - No reason.

217
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,850
Is that too hard to believe?

218
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,750
Out of those who are of a lower grade,

219
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,289
who do you think voted for you?

220
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:11,820
Let's say that it's you, then. Why did you help me out?

221
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,289
Is there something you want?

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,590
Gosh, what a quick response.

223
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,500
You're a funny one.

224
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,529
What I want?

225
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm not sure. I don't think I need anything.

226
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,840
Ye Rim.

227
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,100
I was wondering what was taking you so long.

228
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,639
What's with her?

229
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,110
Me? I'm in Grade C just like you.

230
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,279
I'm only kidding.

231
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,049
Anyway, thanks, Ye Rim.

232
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,720
She's not wrong.

233
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,090
Those of lower grade...

234
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,159
have no choice but to vote for those of Grade A and B.

235
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,929
Voting for those of similar grade is the same as suicide.

236
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,669
Rather than those of lower grade,

237
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,470
who among Grade A and B would vote for me?

238
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,980
Why on earth did they vote for me?

239
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,620
Well, I'll get going, then.

240
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,100
- Why? - Is there another dustpan?

241
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,799
- What? - Over here.

242
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,299
- It almost escaped us. - I know.

243
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,470
- Hey. - This too.

244
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,279
Let's move if you're done here.

245
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,350
- Come on. - Let's move.

246
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,350
For the second semester,

247
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,919
your landscape paintings and emoji designs...

248
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,159
will make up for your total grade.

249
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,059
I'm sure you all know that.

250
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,759
Your landscape paintings...

251
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,360
will be graded on a curve by your classmates.

252
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,029
What's this nonsense?

253
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,399
With 50 being the top score,

254
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,230
grade the work in a number that is a multiple of five...

255
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,169
but don't go below 30.

256
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,570
I will consider your scores when grading your work.

257
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,110
Focus on the composition and the level of execution.

258
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Do Ah, go ahead.

259
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,750
It'll be more comfortable without me in the room.

260
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,549
Write down the scores and hand them to me after class.

261
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,190
Do your best.

262
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,720
We're to grade each other's work?

263
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:28,629
Can you believe it?

264
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,529
This will be our actual grade.

265
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,159
- I know. - Unbelievable.

266
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,179
(Scores for landscape paintings)

267
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,450
You want the students to grade their peers' artwork?

268
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,230
Ha Rin wants you to have this.

269
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,659
(Baek Ha Rin)

270
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:03,759
Baek Ha Rin.

271
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,930
Mr. Im said it'd be a relative evaluation,

272
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,740
but why don't we start off...

273
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,599
by standing at the score we think we deserve?

274
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,640
What? What the heck is this?

275
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,950
Let's go.

276
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,089
Why aren't you coming?

277
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,700
My score would be 35.

278
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,670
But this will be reflected in my actual grade.

279
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,670
Hey.

280
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,890
That means we get 45.

281
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,809
But didn't Yu Rim get into this school on her art talents?

282
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,119
What? But this is the score she should get.

283
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,250
We agreed to all get this score.

284
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,750
Right?

285
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:38,960
What's with you, Ye Rim?

286
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,230
Do you think Cho Yu Rim did a good job?

287
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,529
Cho Yu Rim, you tell us.

288
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,960
Do you agree?

289
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,740
She does.

290
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,009
No.

291
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,009
This is my place.

292
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,549
She's lying.

293
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,079
Hold on a second. This...

294
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,849
Cho Yu Rim and Ra Hae Jun are Grade D.

295
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,190
Park Ji Young is Grade C.

296
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,789
Im Ye Rim and Jung Yeon Doo are Grade B.

297
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,059
Baek Ha Rin is Grade A.

298
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,789
These reflect our grades.

299
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,960
A, B,

300
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,630
C,

301
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,299
D,

302
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,009
and F.

303
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,710
Sung Soo Ji.

304
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,339
Why are you still standing there? Get over here.

305
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,309
Our recent rankings...

306
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,950
Just how deep does this pyramid game affect us?

307
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,119
No one is threatening them with a deadly weapon,

308
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,549
but they voluntarily chose to follow it.

309
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,789
Is the pyramid worth destroying their grades over?

310
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,089
This is bizarre.

311
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,529
Absolutely bizarre.

312
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,230
Is it okay to continue...

313
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,230
this way?

314
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:17,789
I just got here in time.

315
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,789
Hi.

316
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,900
The 15th Pyramid Game...

317
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,630
will now commence.

318
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,509
(Grade F, Sung Soo Ji, 0 votes)

319
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,910
(Grade F, Sung Soo Ji, 0 votes)

320
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,910
(Alarm)

321
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,690
(Grade C, Sung Soo Ji, 5 votes)

322
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:58,960
It's not all right.

323
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,130
I must know about the other four who voted for me.

324
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,900
(Collecting assignments: Sung Soo Ji)

325
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,440
(Do Mi Young)

326
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,779
Guys, listen up.

327
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,039
I have a proposal to make.

328
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:15,950
The good thing about ranking higher...

329
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,250
is the fact that I can stir things up.

330
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,450
Doesn't the voting system on this app...

331
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,420
puzzle you?

332
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:26,519
What? That's out of the blue.

333
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,589
- What's so puzzling? - What now?

334
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,859
Haven't you questioned it? Not even once?

335
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,599
The voting result has always been similar,

336
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,430
especially for the ones in Grade A.

337
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,529
Am I the only one who finds this weird?

338
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,269
Haven't you wondered if this could be rigged?

339
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,980
Hold it. Soo Ji, the app can be trusted.

340
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:50,710
I designed the app, you see.

341
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,980
It shuts down automatically if one tries to manipulate it.

342
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:55,390
Is that so?

343
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,150
But what if you're part of the scam?

344
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,559
How can we trust you?

345
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
Can you prove your innocence?

346
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,690
- What? - Why don't we switch...

347
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,289
to handwritten votes this time?

348
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,930
We'll write down the 5 names we voted for in the 14th game...

349
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,730
and count the votes again.

350
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,970
Of course, it'll be anonymous.

351
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,140
I'm in.

352
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,809
Ye Won, what about you?

353
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,809
Let's do it.

354
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,440
You think my app can be manipulated?

355
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:21,750
Sung Soo Ji, I didn't expect this from you,

356
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,109
but you humiliated me.

357
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:27,420
If that was the case, why would I be in Grade D?

358
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,089
Let's do it. It sounds like fun.

359
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,819
If it's anonymous...

360
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,490
Truth be told, I also had my doubts. How can I be in Grade D?

361
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,859
Anyone will agree you're Grade D.

362
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,319
I'll count the votes.

363
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,490
(Sim Eun Jung, Jung Yeon Doo,)

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
(Myoung Ja Eun, Sung Soo Ji, Baek Ha Rin)

365
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,690
(Ko Eun Byeol, Koo Seol Ha, Kim Da Yeon, Do Mi Young...)

366
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,059
Wait. It's the same.

367
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,470
How boring.

368
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,269
Sung Soo Ji, you were trolling.

369
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,369
See?

370
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,109
There's nothing wrong with my baby.

371
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,079
Right. I'm sorry I doubted it.

372
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,680
Thanks for participating, guys.

373
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm off to the teachers' office.

374
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Who hasn't handed in their assignment?

375
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,559
No one? I'll hand them in, then.

376
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,960
If something had happened...

377
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,630
- This isn't a movie, you know. - Boring.

378
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,440
(Baek Ha Rin, Kim Da Yeon, Seo Do Ah, Bang Woo Yi...)

379
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,880
(Sim Eun Jung, Jung Yeon Doo, Myung Ja Eun, Sung Soo Ji...)

380
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,450
No one?

381
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,920
I'll hand them in, then.

382
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,089
By matching the handwriting,

383
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:15,259
I'll know who voted for whom.

384
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,369
(Im Ye Rim, Kim Da Yeon)

385
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:27,569
(Bang...)

386
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,480
(Baek Ha Rin)

387
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,880
I had a hunch,

388
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,480
but these three voted for me.

389
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,920
Was I dug out from Grade F...

390
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,990
by Baek Ha Rin's design?

391
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,160
Then, if that psychopath has a change of heart,

392
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,589
I'll go back to being Grade F again.

393
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,160
Darn it.

394
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,670
Check out the details.

395
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,539
- It's the hair. - The hair?

396
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,180
How can I be sure they'll vote for me in the next game?

397
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,809
What about Ye Rim?

398
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,180
She voted for me and Ja Eun.

399
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,980
Is it safe to say she'll vote for us again?

400
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,250
As if.

401
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:19,059
- Even the dimples. - I know.

402
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,190
That's a fine drawing.

403
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,660
You look stunning.

404
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,230
Ji Ae, you look so cute.

405
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,099
You're a good kitty, aren't you?

406
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,140
That's a good girl.

407
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,740
Let's eat.

408
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,349
- That? - Creatures can't talk.

409
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,150
That's enough.

410
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,420
That fool. Why is she meddling?

411
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,490
Are you kidding me?

412
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,130
What gives, Ja Eun?

413
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,259
Did being Grade D give you confidence?

414
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,829
What should we do about her, Da Yeon?

415
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,970
Myoung Ja Eun, would you like to take her place?

416
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:05,799
Take Pyo Ji Ae's place.

417
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,309
Sure. Do as you wish.

418
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,089
Give it here.

419
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,390
Ja Eun, don't.

420
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,259
You shouldn't treat Ja Eun this way as well.

421
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,970
Apologize to her.

422
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,400
Right now.

423
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,910
(Baek Ha Rin)

424
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:55,190
Darn, I missed. It was meant for Myoung Ja Eun.

425
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,190
I'm sorry, Ha Rin.

426
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,640
I hope it's all right. I'm terribly sorry.

427
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,140
Why would you meddle in their business?

428
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,539
You're too kind for your own good.

429
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,940
Have you lost your darn mind?

430
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,309
Is that a self-introduction?

431
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,480
- Do you still see me as Grade F? - As if I care.

432
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,809
We're all Grade B anyway.

433
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,420
You must be of Grade A or have their permission...

434
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,289
to haze Grade F.

435
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,920
Isn't that the rule?

436
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,019
And as you can see, I'm no longer Grade F.

437
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,759
Meanwhile, you're not Grade A, Woo Yi.

438
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,259
Let her go, Woo Yi.

439
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,470
Soo Ji said it was a mistake, and she apologized.

440
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Let her go.

441
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,740
You're a smart one, aren't you?

442
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,180
I guess you can say that.

443
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,279
And Myoung Ja Eun,

444
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,880
I'm going to keep my promise.

445
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,890
- Your promise? - Grade F...

446
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,890
I mean,

447
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:05,190
we agreed not to haze Pyo Ji Ae.

448
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,289
Wait.

449
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,930
Can you allow that?

450
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,660
Everyone seems to turn to you for approval.

451
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,769
You seem to have the wrong idea,

452
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,109
but there's no need to ask me.

453
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,710
I'm a part of the 25 like everyone else,

454
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,440
and so are you.

455
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,779
I'm not the one who judges you.

456
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,549
The game does.

457
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,200
Guys, the hints for the literature quiz...

458
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,269
Hey.

459
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,000
What's with the mood?

460
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,769
Is something up?

461
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,369
I'll tape it to the board.

462
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,309
- Were you arguing? - No, we're just playing a game.

463
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,410
Next time, just call one of us.

464
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,579
You don't have to come by during breaks or lunchtime.

465
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,420
That's what the other teachers do.

466
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,289
Soo Ji,

467
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,920
good luck.

468
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,460
Sure. Thanks, Da Yeon.

469
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,029
Darn.

470
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,500
Right.

471
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,150
Hey, give me your phone number.

472
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,289
That was the first time I've been impulsive in a while.

473
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,779
I thought you would be here.

474
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,079
I just wanted to know if you are okay.

475
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,920
Sung Soo Ji.

476
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,089
If you're keeping the promise just because of me...

477
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:24,960
You have an overinflated ego every single time.

478
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,630
You said you knew me.

479
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,569
You think I'm doing that because of you?

480
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,769
It's because of me.

481
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,470
Ha Rin picked me.

482
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,240
Ha Rin picked you?

483
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,910
How did you know that?

484
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,380
That's none of your business.

485
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,509
I think it's better to get rid of the game...

486
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,150
than to fall back to Grade F...

487
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,779
and be outcasted by crazy girls.

488
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,019
So this is sort of a deal.

489
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,319
I hope we can make it through.

490
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,460
We have to make it through this time for sure.

491
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,289
How is Pyo Ji Ae doing?

492
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,970
You are whining so much.

493
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,710
You should cut it out.

494
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,779
Is there anyone here who wasn't bullied?

495
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,309
What? It's not the same for me.

496
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,980
I've never been bullied like that before.

497
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,920
You have no idea how scared I was.

498
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,720
I was backstabbed by my best friend.

499
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,460
I had a mental breakdown.

500
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,759
Joo Seung Yi shouldn't be doing this to me.

501
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,099
How can you say that to a friend who is crying?

502
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,670
You have no empathy for me.

503
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,609
Are you a sociopath?

504
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:21,410
You're right. I feel bad for you, Ji Ae.

505
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,109
Joo Seung Yi is such a horrible friend.

506
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,710
I'm sure you wanted to stand up for Seung Yi...

507
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,880
when she was bullied by Da Yeon.

508
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,619
You two are best friends. She should have been there for you.

509
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:28,690
How small-minded of her to get back at you.

510
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,119
I can tell from her face that she is a backstabber.

511
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,690
She would have sold the country if it was 100 years ago.

512
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,960
What a crazy trash.

513
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,460
What an evil and sly wench.

514
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,559
Stop it. That's enough.

515
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:42,099
Shall we get back to where we were?

516
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,700
- Soo Ji. - What?

517
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,299
She's weird.

518
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,640
The class wasn't like this from the start.

519
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,180
There were many girls with good backgrounds.

520
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,950
But the class was rather normal.

521
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,980
However...

522
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,079
Class president.

523
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,079
(1 year ago)

524
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,789
We are all bored. Should we play a game together?

525
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,890
That's how it got started.

526
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,119
Kim Da Yeon started it? It wasn't Ha Rin?

527
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,190
Ha Rin? No, she didn't start this.

528
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,460
She just watched it go.

529
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,430
Vote for a friend whom you want to thank for the last month.

530
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,400
We give a small privilege...

531
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,269
to whoever gets the most votes.

532
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,009
Not doing the weekly duty during the exam period.

533
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,910
Picking the order of performance assessment.

534
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,109
Eating first during lunch.

535
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,380
Those small privileges changed over time.

536
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,349
- It's her first day. - Gosh.

537
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,849
Oh, no. Are you okay?

538
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:37,319
- You shouldn't crouch down. - Gosh, you're annoying!

539
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:43,559
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,559
A privilege to look down on girls...

541
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:47,500
who are in lower grades than you.

542
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,230
- That's when our class changed. - You're getting on my nerves.

543
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,799
That's when we started to discriminate.

544
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:54,269
And we also started using violence.

545
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:55,369
Hold on.

546
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,210
Those rules weren't set from the beginning?

547
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,140
They evolved by themselves?

548
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,440
What?

549
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,650
Right, it just happened naturally.

550
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,929
Becoming a monster is infectious.

551
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,929
Becoming a monster is infectious.

552
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,630
Anyway, we could bully the girls who were in lower grades...

553
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,840
for the first few weeks.

554
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,210
Then...

555
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,039
Grade F was created.

556
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,440
What are you looking at?

557
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,219
Oh, my goodness.

558
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,090
Hey, Grade F.

559
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,289
I'm sorry I cursed at you earlier.

560
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,190
Is my apology accepted?

561
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,630
Grade F means you are an outcast.

562
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,530
There was this new rule that only Grade A or anyone...

563
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,530
with Grade A's permission could bully the outcast.

564
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,199
There wasn't a rule about leaving evidence...

565
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,610
of violence then.

566
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,539
So? Who was in Grade F?

567
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,610
(Grade F, Cho Woo Ri, 0 votes)

568
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,380
Cho Woo Ri?

569
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:12,719
So the girl in Grade F for the entire freshman year was her?

570
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,449
What happened to her?

571
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:16,289
I am not sure.

572
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,050
I don't think we have been...

573
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,019
in Grade F since Year Two.

574
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,329
She dropped out of school a few months before the summer break.

575
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,670
(Baby sister)

576
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,170
Is that why they came up with a new attendance number?

577
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,469
To get rid of her?

578
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,940
The video that you sent me...

579
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,110
You got it from someone else too, right?

580
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,760
I'm sorry. It took me too long to thank you.

581
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,289
You sent the video to Ja Eun, right?

582
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,590
That's the edited version.

583
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,800
Only the girls in Grade A have the original video.

584
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,099
Why did you help me?

585
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,300
"Leak contents,"

586
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,809
"and you will face the utmost penalty."

587
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,710
Why do you think such provisions and consent...

588
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,909
were necessary?

589
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,250
Justification? I'm not sure if it helps at all.

590
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,780
You all set the rules anyway.

591
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,320
You are right.

592
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,849
We just thought that justification wasn't good enough.

593
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,760
We didn't want to see anyone getting fired again...

594
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,119
just because of that.

595
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,630
Is that why you tried to separate the homeroom teacher from me?

596
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,829
What about when we voted by hand?

597
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,929
You knew that I was the one...

598
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,070
who took the ballot papers.

599
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:38,530
I thought it was put carelessly.

600
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,800
I knew you would pretend that you didn't know about this.

601
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,110
You were the one who set the rules for Grade F.

602
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,079
"Drop whatever you're doing when the bell rings."

603
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,639
You wanted to interrupt them.

604
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,710
The reason why hazing happens the day after the vote...

605
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,280
is because all the girls get too excited on the very day...

606
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,820
that those in Grade F could be bullied too much.

607
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,579
- So? - Would you help me?

608
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,449
I'm going to make a Grade D ally.

609
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,559
Of course, we have to help you with the school management committee.

610
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,030
If you take charge,

611
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,530
Principal Im will be relieved.

612
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,699
Do Ah cares a lot about Ha Rin.

613
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,880
We, the parents, should help the kids and stand by them...

614
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,949
so that they can trust each other.

615
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,280
They are friends for life.

616
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:31,750
This time,

617
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,489
you are being very sloppy.

618
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,860
- I guess I overestimated you. - What?

619
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,030
Why do you think I would help you?

620
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,059
I don't have any reason to change.

621
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,599
I have no intention of hurting my current position, power,

622
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,300
or relationships with the other girls.

623
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,539
Rules?

624
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,469
The rules don't hurt me.

625
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,480
I will never step out...

626
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,949
of the circle I drew.

627
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,489
That's my rule.

628
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,989
Those darn rules.

629
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,789
Is she a rule addict?

630
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,159
So?

631
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,190
You have no intention of helping me? Ever?

632
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,260
I'll never help you.

633
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,630
You better be more careful.

634
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,570
Grade D ally?

635
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:21,699
How many girls in Grade D do you think...

636
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,309
have zero connection with girls in higher grades?

637
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:26,079
I'm not sure if they'll be convinced.

638
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,840
It seems like what you can give to girls in Grade D...

639
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,579
isn't much compared to what girls in higher grades can give.

640
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:39,219
How many girls in Grade D do you think...

641
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,559
have zero connection with girls in higher grades?

642
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,530
So there are girls in Grade D who have connections.

643
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,199
What was that? I thought she wasn't going to help.

644
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,099
Did she mean herself when she said...

645
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,630
there was one person who was against the game in the past?

646
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,940
Do Ah.

647
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,199
(Library)

648
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,510
What's with the two?

649
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,440
Why are they coming out of the library together?

650
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,349
Isn't she in Grade D?

651
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,250
Her family runs Palm New Chemicals?

652
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,449
That's what I heard in the restroom.

653
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,960
Step aside.

654
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,789
There is this place in front of my house...

655
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,130
(Palm New Chemicals)

656
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,059
("QB Group Merges With Palm New Chemicals")

657
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,099
- So this is what that meant. - What?

658
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,739
I found it strange...

659
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,340
that the girls participate in the game without complaining...

660
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,969
when they aren't in the higher grades.

661
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,309
Their parents have connections.

662
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:35,980
So they couldn't go against it.

663
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,210
That transfer student...

664
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,150
What was her name again?

665
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,750
Sung Soo Ji?

666
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,320
Eun Jung. You aren't interested in anyone.

667
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,329
You should remember her name. She's our classmate.

668
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,789
You like her, don't you?

669
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,260
I can tell.

670
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,530
Isn't she something new?

671
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,730
Who would provoke Ha Rin like that?

672
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,110
Stop.

673
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,340
Stop paying attention to her.

674
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,880
What was that?

675
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,510
Are you jealous?

676
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:12,519
Oh, come on.

677
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,119
Are you crazy?

678
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,559
(Baekyeon Girls' High School Swimming Varsity)

679
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,429
Gosh, you scared me.

680
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,440
- Did I scare you? - You scared me.

681
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,309
- Goodness. - You definitely scared me.

682
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,769
I've never been here when it's free.

683
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,280
It feels like we rented the whole place because nobody is here.

684
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,079
Oh, well. It's Ye Rim's anyway.

685
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,949
Yeon Doo. I told you not to talk about it.

686
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,119
Hey!

687
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Spare me!

688
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,219
- Hey, stop it. - Ye Rim!

689
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,590
Stop it.

690
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,019
Hey, stop.

691
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,969
What brings you to my place?

692
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,969
I'm on my way to a club with her.

693
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,070
Did you hear that we're having our next meeting in Kota Kinabalu?

694
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,469
One night on a yacht.

695
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,710
It won't be fun with the parents. It sounds too wholesome.

696
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,139
Can you get to the point?

697
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:15,780
I have an online class to take.

698
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,710
What a nerd.

699
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,219
You know how all the girls...

700
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:25,219
won't last long after graduation except for you, me, and Ha Rin.

701
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,789
Do what you normally do.

702
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,360
We can't backstab each other.

703
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:31,090
You and I have to see Ha Rin for the rest of our lives,

704
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,360
whether we like it or not.

705
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,099
I am going to see you for the rest of my life like what you said.

706
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,570
- I told you. - It's just...

707
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,570
that I'm not like you.

708
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,300
I'm not playing the game because I want to.

709
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,639
I just do what I can.

710
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,340
Thinking about it again makes me angry.

711
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,110
She always acts arrogant and neutral.

712
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,050
You picked her as the host.

713
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,719
She acts as if she's someone important.

714
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,690
I won't let it slide if Seo Do Ah backstabs us.

715
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,860
- Woo Yi. - Yes?

716
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,789
Do you want me to buy this painting for you?

717
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,559
This?

718
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,300
It looks very expensive.

719
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,099
But there is one thing you can do for me.

720
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
What is it?

721
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,139
I would do anything you ask me to do.

722
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,570
All right.

723
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,909
Could you please...

724
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,010
know your place?

725
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,650
Listen, Woo Yi.

726
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,489
Do Ah has been trained since she was a kid...

727
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,420
on the power she shouldn't miss,

728
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:34,590
the position she shouldn't leave,

729
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,389
and the trust she shouldn't lose.

730
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,989
Do you know what that means?

731
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,500
I crossed the line, didn't I?

732
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,300
I definitely crossed the line.

733
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,239
I mean... Why would Do Ah backstab you?

734
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,809
Do Ah and you are good friends.

735
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Friends?

736
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,380
Do people call that friendship?

737
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,690
- A game? - Yes.

738
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:10,059
I wish there was a social class system.

739
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,389
Like a pyramid.

740
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,059
Doesn't it sound fun?

741
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:20,400
How about we decide on the grade by playing a game?

742
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,340
What do you think, Do Ah?

743
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,340
Do you want to ask your father?

744
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:31,610
I heard that you're a good girl who listens to her dad.

745
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:37,849
How can we get rid of the game?

746
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,219
The Grade D ally.

747
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:40,789
We can make use of the desire to go up.

748
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:44,190
Let's gather the girls in Grade D. Then we all go up to Grade C.

749
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,230
What? I can be in Grade C?

750
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,699
Were you tempted just now? Now, that's the desire to go up.

751
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:50,670
Anyone would be tempted.

752
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,340
One person can use up to five votes per game.

753
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,269
I did the math.

754
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:58,170
You need five votes to stay in Grade C.

755
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,010
There are 3 of us. We can get extra 3 girls in Grade D.

756
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,210
We can share the votes.

757
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,780
We will all end up in Grade C by sharing five votes each.

758
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:07,650
Grade C.

759
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,690
Then there will be 11 people in Grade C.

760
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,889
There will be more girls in Grade C than in Grade D.

761
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,219
Then it works out like this.

762
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:19,159
The pyramid will collapse more easily than we think.

763
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,699
The game will be over when the pyramid game...

764
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:23,869
doesn't stay in a pyramid shape.

765
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,699
So the conclusion is...

766
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:28,969
we have to gather girls in Grade D who want to go up to Grade C.

767
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,980
Which three girls in Grade D are we selecting?

768
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,179
She has a point.

769
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,780
How can we find girls who aren't related...

770
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,880
to the girls in higher grades?

771
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:39,719
I don't even know the girls in my class that well.

772
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:41,679
Me neither.

773
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,159
- Here you go. - Right?

774
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,530
Sir. I'm here to run errands for my homeroom teacher.

775
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:51,690
Could you please open the cabinet?

776
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,400
- Make sure you lock it. - Thank you, sir.

777
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,139
(Student Record)

778
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,880
Yesterday was the last day to fix the student record.

779
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,280
Our homeroom teacher wasn't there. It was a chaos.

780
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,719
I asked the math teacher to open the cabinet,

781
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,119
saying I was running errands.

782
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,019
You are...

783
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,789
unbelievably smart, Soo Ji.

784
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,460
You are good at lying too.

785
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:25,360
It's not that hard. You just have to be quick-witted.

786
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:26,860
You can be quick-witted too when you're desperate.

787
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Sometimes, you remind me...

788
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,730
of someone.

789
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,340
The way you think and act.

790
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,269
Who?

791
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,449
Forget it. You can picture it now, right?

792
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,750
Picture what?

793
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:48,079
The homeroom teacher recorded it in the special note.

794
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,389
I'll just explain it only once.

795
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:52,789
Let's start with Grade C.

796
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:55,059
Park Ji Young's parents work for Baekyeon Food.

797
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,360
She's connected to Ha Rin in a way.

798
00:45:56,929 --> 00:45:58,389
Cha Seon Ju's dad owns SJ Company.

799
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,760
It's the vendor company that works for Da Yeon's parents.

800
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,360
There are more girls other than these two.

801
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,699
But nothing important was there. So let's skip them.

802
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,769
Let's move on to Grade D. They are important to us.

803
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,440
Yang Soo Young's parents are the doctors at Seosim Hospital.

804
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,539
Choi Yu Hyun is sponsored by Baekyeon Group.

805
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:11,969
Without those related to the higher grades,

806
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:15,210
six girls remain in Grade D.

807
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,179
Yoon Ye Won, Ko Eun Byeol, Cho Yu Rim,

808
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:19,719
Ra Hae Jun, Song Jae Hyung, and Joo Seung Yi.

809
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:21,980
We can select three out of them.

810
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,650
We can never choose Eun Byeol. She's a mythomaniac wacko.

811
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,090
We can't choose Joo Seung Yi either.

812
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,079
So this is how you program it.

813
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,280
I've never seen it in person before.

814
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,750
Are you creating malicious codes?

815
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,780
No, it's just my hobby.

816
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,150
What? Are you doubting me again on fabricating?

817
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,320
You proved me wrong already.

818
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,519
Let's be cool, my friend.

819
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:00,960
Are you analyzing the codes?

820
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,719
Why? Are you interested?

821
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,159
Can you even differentiate between a hacker and a cracker?

822
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,360
Gosh, you're belittling me.

823
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,829
Let's not meet in person to talk from now on.

824
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:09,130
Let's use our group chat instead.

825
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,969
Ja Eun and I should be hanging out with the girls more.

826
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:15,369
Only then we will have a chance to drag them to us.

827
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:16,710
(Sung Soo Ji, Pyo Ji Ae, Myoung Ja Eun)

828
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,710
It's "Show Me the Money."

829
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,480
He was a hit last night.

830
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,880
Shownu's body line was amazing when he danced.

831
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,320
Are you in his fan club?

832
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,780
- You too? - Me too!

833
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,820
Have you ever been to the fan signing event?

834
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,820
Of course.

835
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,389
- How about you? Never? - Really?

836
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,559
(The more I try to hide)

837
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,619
How cute.

838
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,099
Hey. Who are they?

839
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,170
- They are funny. - What?

840
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,400
What did they do to you? Why are you picking on them?

841
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,570
Is that how you do it?

842
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,110
Ye Rim. Do you want to use it?

843
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,079
Thanks.

844
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:00,849
This is how you play it.

845
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,449
- Look at this. - You know what I mean?

846
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Don't laugh.

847
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:08,260
You are good!

848
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,530
- Isn't there one more? - Yes, there is one more.

849
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,489
It's because...

850
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,800
That's what my parents want. But I have a dream.

851
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,099
I want to enjoy the food that my parents make.

852
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,639
Second.

853
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,340
Let's act like we don't care when Ji Ae is bullied.

854
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,570
What? Why?

855
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,579
Then what do I do?

856
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,210
We are friends.

857
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:30,650
We shouldn't draw people's attention anymore.

858
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,980
We have to seem like...

859
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,550
we broke out of the clique after defying to the upper class.

860
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,619
(Okay.)

861
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:35,980
Are you making fun of me, Ja Eun?

862
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,519
(Sung Soo Ji, Pyo Ji Ae, Myoung Ja Eun)

863
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,329
(Dragonite)

864
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,429
It's Dragonite.

865
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:49,199
I want it. Give it to me.

866
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,030
Great.

867
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,840
I'm giving it to Ra Hae Jun.

868
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,539
It's the perfect way to talk to her.

869
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:03,880
- It's delicious. - It is.

870
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:11,849
Outside, now.

871
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:28,599
Can I have a go?

872
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,940
You can't handle this.

873
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,210
Gosh, you can't ruin this.

874
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,940
Don't worry. I'll save you five dollars.

875
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,679
- Cut them like mine. - No way.

876
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:38,750
- Can you cut them for me too? - You can't cut them like mine.

877
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,920
- I'll cut them now. - Goodness.

878
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,550
Soo Ji is good.

879
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,719
- Your turn? - Yes.

880
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,659
Hi. The weather is nice today.

881
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,960
Hi. The weather is nice today.

882
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,730
Are you reading a book or what? You should smile.

883
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,929
Are you Joker? Don't smile.

884
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,070
Just do this.

885
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,670
"Do you want to go have mala soup after school?"

886
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,239
- "It's on me." - "Mala soup?"

887
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:03,340
Follow me.

888
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,070
"Do you want to go have mala soup? It's on me."

889
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,980
"Do you want to go have mala soup? It's on me."

890
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,750
- "Do you want to go have..." - What?

891
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:20,190
Hold on, Myoung Ja Eun.

892
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,030
I have to ask you. It has been bothering me.

893
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,630
Could you tell me?

894
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,800
Is there any bullying in your class?

895
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,150
Well...

896
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,619
Ma'am...

897
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:49,949
Hello, ma'am.

898
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,519
Hi, Ha Rin.

899
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,190
Ja Eun, aren't you getting changed to P.E. uniforms?

900
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,929
Do Ah will lock the door if you get in late.

901
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,900
Oh, right. You should go back to class.

902
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,699
I'll talk to you again next time.

903
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,909
You look tired. Is everything okay?

904
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,559
You joined the international hacking defense contest before.

905
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,030
Gosh, you are talented.

906
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:34,730
How did you end up making the Pyramid Game app?

907
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,500
I was the one who wanted to make the app.

908
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,869
Writing them with your hands, and opening them manually.

909
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:41,369
Goodness, it's very primitive.

910
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:42,369
You volunteered?

911
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,139
Didn't you...

912
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,340
Oh, right.

913
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,250
- Nothing. - What?

914
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,510
Bang Woo Yi made the logo, and she is in Grade B.

915
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,949
But I'm in Grade D. Were you saying that?

916
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:56,519
She's feeling inferior.

917
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,789
She even provided the app.

918
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,420
It's 99 percent sure that she is unhappy to be in Grade D.

919
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,860
No, 100 percent.

920
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,429
Were you going to tell the literature teacher?

921
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:08,800
No, I would never tell.

922
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,730
I was going to tell her that it was none of her business.

923
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,570
Why? She might help you out...

924
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:15,300
if you tell her.

925
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,239
But I know things will be out of control.

926
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:20,539
We can't make the school violence committee...

927
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,349
examine the case.

928
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,480
Are you doing this for me?

929
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,780
You think I'll be in trouble?

930
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,190
Thank you.

931
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,260
But why did you do that?

932
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,530
Why did you even think of getting out of Grade F?

933
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,789
How dare you.

934
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,929
Why did you exchange votes with the new girl?

935
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,130
Tell me.

936
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:50,969
Ja Eun.

937
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,039
You can't do that to me.

938
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,400
(Yoon Ye Won)

939
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:25,369
She has a high self-esteem and desires to be recognized.

940
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,809
She hates losing.

941
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,079
But she would give in when things are in her favor.

942
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:31,449
She looks for benefits from her friends.

943
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,420
(Are you doing it okay? Meet me at the rooftop.)

944
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,349
What? She read the message. But why isn't she coming?

945
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,230
What happened?

946
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,900
You are all strained.

947
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,159
What?

948
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,300
No, I'm not.

949
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,570
How's the plan going? Ji Ae has been texting me.

950
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:57,639
Right.

951
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,079
(Pyo Ji Ae)

952
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,909
I don't have enough information about the girls.

953
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,949
Information...

954
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:08,150
It would be simple if we could hack their phones.

955
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,519
Hack?

956
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,550
Can you hack cell phones too?

957
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,320
I wouldn't be here doing nothing if I knew how to hack.

958
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,519
I would have hacked their phones already by now.

959
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,329
But that's a crime.

960
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,099
What are you talking about?

961
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:27,199
I can make friends with the one who can actually hack.

962
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,480
(Winner)

963
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,420
(Baekyeon Girls' High School Field Trip: September, 2022)

964
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,960
Would you take charge for Yoon Ye Won?

965
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:57,500
She has a high self-esteem. She likes to show off as well.

966
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,630
She also has a desire to go up.

967
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:00,340
She wouldn't keep her guard up toward you...

968
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,940
because you two are both in Grade D.

969
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:04,710
You just have to find that one thing to convince Ye Won.

970
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,409
Hey, Ye Won. Did you get a new laptop?

971
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,949
It looks like it can perform well. Is it MacBook Pro?

972
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,309
You know MacBook well?

973
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,579
I know that it's expensive.

974
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:17,289
I heard that if you get the best graphic and memory cards,

975
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,519
it costs more than 10,000 dollars.

976
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,059
Was it MacBook Pro?

977
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:21,590
I got a new laptop at home. That's the one.

978
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:23,289
Nice.

979
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:29,260
- I'll see you in class. - Okay.

980
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,969
Bye.

981
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,940
- What was all that about? - You don't know what that is?

982
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,369
I've never seen one before.

983
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,960

(Father: Runs Yoon Toast, Mother: A full-time housewife)

986
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:15,610
(She has a strong desire to get recognized. She hates losing.)

987
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,650
(She would conform to benefits.)

988
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,550
Conform to benefits?

989
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:32,929
I just have to watch her?

990
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,780
I'm doomed.
