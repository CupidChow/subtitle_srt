1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,879
You answer, Ja Eun.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,560
Do you want to be Grade F forever?

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,360
No.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
I don't want to.

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,239
You heard that.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,239
Get lost.

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,320
You rich, pretty,

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,920
and manipulative school bully.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm a bully?

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,799
If I'm a bully, what are you, Ja Eun?

11
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,530
I wondered...

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,679
why I had hope for you.

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,679
It's okay, Ja Eun.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,479
I'll crush that for you soon.

15
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,280
Ha Rin ruined our grades, didn't she?

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,689
What about Woo Yi, then? She was dropped completely?

17
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,119
I don't know.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,239
Shoot. Are you okay with this?

19
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,409
If Ha Rin ditches me...

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,439
If Dad finds out...

21
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,120
Darn it.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Im Ye Lim.

23
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,239
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,280
Are you in love?

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
For real?

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,040
I thought it was a teenage fascination.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,359
Listen up, Sim Eun Jung.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,120
If your unrequited love...

29
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,119
drags me down and I can't debut...

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
That won't happen.

31
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,400
You can debut.

(Episode 6)

36
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,520
Look.

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,359
We need to gather more people.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,679
Not by blackmail...

39
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,319
but like how you convinced Jae Hyung.

40
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
We won't follow Ha Rin's method.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
We'll follow yours, Ja Eun.

42
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,800
Myoung Ja Eun's method.

43
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,920
What would you do...

44
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,399
if it were you?

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Seung Yi.

46
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,050
About last time.

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
What?

48
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,920
If I really hurt and tormented you.

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,279
I mean it.

51
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,079
What?

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,609
Okay.

53
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,000
Thanks for accepting my apology.

54
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,959
Again, I'm sorry.

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,879
Good for you.

56
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,519
Hi, Ji Ae.

57
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
What?

58
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,079
Are you and her close?

59
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,439
No, I just greeted her.

60
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,050
We can say hi.

61
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,199
Grade F...

62
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,680
doesn't exist now.

63
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm thinking of...

64
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
getting rid of the Pyramid Game too.

65
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,560
What do you think, Ha Rin?

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,680
With 21 votes, you got one from almost everyone.

67
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
You're not just Grade A. You're at the top.

68
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,600
If the Pyramid Game were to be canceled,

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,920
I think you'd feel worse about it.

70
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,680
Oh, right.

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,319
You said you were just one of the 25 in our class.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,959
It won't be a problem if everyone agrees to it.

73
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,279
Right?

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,599
- You psycho! - Sung Soo Ji, you witch!

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,680
Not so suddenly, Woo Yi.

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,680
What if you scare Ha Rin?

77
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,398
Contact me if you agree.

78
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,480
Messenger, Instagram, Facebook, text, X.

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,120
You can reach me at any time.

80
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, yes.

81
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,839
That goes for you too, Ha Rin.

82
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,160
That was awesome.

83
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,319
Hi, Myoung Ja Eun.

84
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm sorry. I mean it.

85
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,439
What?

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,560
Hi, Ji Ae.

87
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,240
Hi, Myoung Ja Eun.

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm thinking of getting rid of the Pyramid Game too.

89
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,720
You said you were just one of the 25 in our class.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,800
You want me to tell you who voted for whom?

91
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,959
- Why? - Just because.

92
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,359
Da Yeon, let's go to the cafeteria.

93
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
It's on me.

94
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,399
Seo Do Ah. Cafeteria?

95
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,079
What are you staring at?

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Seo Do Ah, Kim Da Yeon, and Bang Woo Yi.

97
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,959
Their long-term hold on the class got broken.

98
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,839
Koo Seol Ha seemed to be one of them,

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
but Ha Rin never really liked her.

100
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,560
How on earth did Eun Byeol become Grade A?

101
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,120
Do Ah, Da Yeon.

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,600
If you're going to the cafeteria, get me a chocolate milk.

103
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,959
Calculus makes my blood sugar drop.

104
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,399
- What? - You heard me.

105
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,720
Chocolate milk. Get me a carton.

106
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Ha Rin just came in.

107
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,959
Ye Lim, Ha Rin, do you want something too?

108
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,759
They can get it for us.

109
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,120
Is that really Ko Eun Byeol?

110
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,919
Not her twin or something?

111
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,919
She came to school with a completely different soul.

112
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,599
Until yesterday,

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
she was just a loser whose grades were second-best.

114
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,090
Ko Eun Byeol must've been Ha Rin's hidden card from the start.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,090
Ha Rin. I was waiting for you.

116
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,679
Is there anything you want me to do today?

117
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,519
I have...

118
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,159
something to tell you.

119
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,279
Well done.

120
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,279
Here's your reward.

121
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,639
Thanks.

(Year 2 Physics Midterm Exam)

124
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,960
Come to the chairman's office at lunchtime tomorrow, Eun Byeol.

125
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,159
Do you feel a bit better?

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,399
Do Ah and Da Yeon.

127
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,519
Your sidekicks went down to Grade B.

128
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,398
Do Ah had it coming,

129
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,479
but substituting Da Yeon with Ye Lim...

130
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,639
wasn't part of our plan.

131
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,039
It's the result of the stupid girls acting stupidly to back others.

132
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,450
It's so annoying.

133
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,360
Still, you don't have to worry.

134
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:57,759
I'll do my best at anything you tell me to.

135
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,679
In return,

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,450
will you help me out with the final exam?

137
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
So...

138
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,480
this is our finalized membership?

139
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,840
Instead of Pyo Ji Ae, we have Ye Lim.

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,039
Everyone will know about her, and she'll be the face of her group.

141
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,879
Oops.

142
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,210
Don't say that.

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,210
I was just kidding.

144
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,719
This is Im Ye Lim.

145
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,360
She's a popular idol trainee.

146
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,679
She's just as influential as Ha Rin.

147
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,798
Aren't you Cho Woo Ri's brother?

148
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,959
Sorry, Ye Lim.

149
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
We all reacted like that already.

150
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,279
Did you?

151
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,450
Is Woo Ri doing okay?

152
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,210
She never leaves the house.

153
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Were you responsible too?

154
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,519
Yes.

155
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,039
I was a bystander.

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,519
Not this time.

157
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,320
So, Soo Ji. Did you hear from anyone?

158
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Of course...

159
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,879
not.

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,399
They won't trust us enough to bet on us.

161
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,679
Then what will we do now?

162
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,559
I'll turn the princess into an ordinary student.

163
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,038
Our first task.

164
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,440
Bring down Baek Ha Rin.

165

(Everyone helps to clean up)

166
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
Ha Rin. Where are you going?

167
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,440
You're cleaning the classroom.

168
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,279
Eun Byeol gets the all-purpose room in the corner of the second floor.

169
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
What?

170
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,080
Ha Rin never does this.

171
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,519
What? Why not?

172
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,840
We're all classmates and equals.

173
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,480
Sung Soo Ji. We're Grade A.

174
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,600
I see.

175
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,279
Ye Lim, I need your help with that.

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,038
So what?

177
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,480
Ye Lim's Grade A too.

178
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,879
And she's helping out.

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,878
I am.

180
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,639
Sorry, Eun Byeol.

181
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,879
I can't stand that slang.

182
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,480
It's old, isn't it?

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Watch it.

184
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:17,840
Do you think you're special because Ye Lim sided with you...

185
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
Shut up.

186
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,199
What did you say?

187
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
What? You're no longer the violent Grade A.

188
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,000
And why is cleaning such a big deal?

189
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,080
It wasn't your idea, was it, Ha Rin?

190
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,840
Do you think sweeping is beneath a Grade A?

191
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,319
So you're just leaving?

192
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,799
But that looks even worse. Right?

193
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,320
Yes. A lot.

194
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,759
You can get extra brooms from the teachers' office.

195
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
See you.

196
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,720
You can't do it?

197
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,559
Did you think...

198
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,720
I was asking, Ye Won?

199
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,960
Thanks for the laptop.

200
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,279
But I'm a technician,

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,278
not someone who uses my skill to grovel.

202
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,200
That's an insult to the app I made.

203
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
And...

204
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,039
in the last game, with one vote, I got Grade D.

205
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,039
Do you think I even care about that?

206
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,039
Everyone's so stupid.

207
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,279
Oh, no.

208
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,519
This cost 4,840 dollars.

209
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Darn it.

210
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,840
(Baek Ha Rin sent you 4,840 dollars)

211
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
That darn witch.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
Look. It's from Jae Hyung.

213
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,240
What's this?

214
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,038
- Was it Ha Rin? - No.

215
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,240
There was a leak under the sink.

216
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,840
- What? - I mean.

217
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,359
The plumbing was wonky,

218
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,679
so I tried to fix it and...

219
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I see.

220
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,799
You're really coming?

221
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,039
Why? You don't want me to?

222
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't mind. But the building's really old.

223
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Okay. Let's go.

224
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,120
What? You won't go in?

225
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,840
The sink's not fixed yet.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No.

227
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
It's done.

228
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,879
Here. Wipe yourself with this...

229
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,679
Thanks. Tomorrow, I'll...

230
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,999
I'll buy you malatang.

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,840
- You don't have ramyeon? - Ramyeon?

232
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,200
You want to eat here?

233
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,320
- Yes. - I see...

234
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,519
Jae Hyung says this is popular these days.

235
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,120
If you don't want this,

236
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,279
there's cheese ramyeon too.

237
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,559
Or this, if you like fishcake ramyeon.

238
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,038
Rice cake ramyeon.

239
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,319
If you like dumplings in ramyeon, I got some of that too.

240
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,479
Are you flexing?

241
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
Why did you buy so much?

242
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,960
Because I don't yet know...

243
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,080
what you like.

244
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,919
How about ramyeon and tteokbokki?

245
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,480
Let's eat.

246
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,960
Are you a good cook too?

247
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,159
Only with the stuff I can make.

248
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,960
The squeaky door hinges.

249
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,360
Get an anti-corrosion spray.

250
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,480
- An anti-cor... - Corrosion spray.

251
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Okay.

252
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,279
How do you know all that?

253
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
You fixed the sink too.

254
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,240
I learn from YouTube videos and fix most things myself.

255
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,600
I don't have a mom.

256
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,639
Sorry.

257
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,120
Is that your mom in that photo?

258
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,159
She lives elsewhere, right?

259
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,399
Yes.

260
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,799
She moved to Busan after Dad died last year.

261
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,038
I'll move there after I graduate.

262
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,080
I'll farm and help out at the orchard.

263
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,839
Mom says she wants me to be a civil servant.

264
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,680
What about you?

265
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,759
A building owner.

266
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,200
I want to produce documentaries.

267
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,359
I think you'll be good at anything.

268
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,119
You do well in school too.

269
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
Sorry.

270
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,890
Isn't that yours?

271
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,279
(New message from Ha Rin)

272
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,359
(Come outside. Now.)

273
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,920
How long have you known Ha Rin?

274
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,960
I don't know how, but you seem to go way back.

275
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
In elementary school...

276
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,960
Until Ha Rin moved away,

277
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,119
we were in the same class.

278
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,170
Eat as much as you want.

279
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,720
Have you heard of Madagascar?

280
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,039
My mom is there on business.

281
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,170
She goes to Italy and America too.

282
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,000
My dad works at a large company in Seoul.

283
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,599
Do you know what a conglomerate is?

284
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,119
It's the biggest company in the country.

285
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,409
Anyway, I spent all my allowance on the new Nintendo,

286
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,960
so I'll treat you next time, Myoung Ja Eun.

287
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,319
Thanks.

288
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,720
Sorry. I'm not Grade F anymore.

289
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,410
(Myoung Ja Eun)

290
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,920
Did any of the girls get in touch?

291
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
No.

292
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,920
Our next task is to spread rumors.

293
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,759
Rumors?

294
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,838
Wait. Where's Ja Eun?

295
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,119
We have to start without her.

296
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,410
The rumor we'll spread is about her.

297
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,039
Jae Hyung, this is your specialty.

298
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,440
No. It's one of my specialties.

299
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,410
You're not betraying her, are you?

300
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,599
Did you hear about Myoung Ja Eun?

301
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,079
I feel bad for her.

302
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,719
I thought she was Grade F because she was dark and freaky.

303
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
But she was betrayed.

304
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,279
- For real? - Yes.

305
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,200
Yeon Doo spewed it on me last time.

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,358
How did that happen?

307
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,759
Ja Eun! Over here.

308
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,119
Ye Lim. Why...

309
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,319
You haven't talked with her, have you?

310
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,839
Wouldn't it be nice to all be friends?

311
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,920
Baek Ha Rin. If your goal is to make Ja Eun Grade F forever,

312
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,279
my goal is the exact opposite.

313
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,719
We'll go through composers and their works...

314
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,318
of the Romantic period.

315
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,598
One of the main composers is Franz Schubert.

316
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,798
Who has heard of him?

317
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,319
None of you?

318
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,650
- When did he die? - Ja Eun.

319
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,838
Don't you think she's more ordinary than we thought?

320
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,358
- He was 31. - She's meek.

321
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,960
Geniuses tend to die young.

322
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,598
Who on earth betrayed her?

323
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,650
I wonder too.

324
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,650
She's among us.

325
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,839
I think I'd be freaking out.

326
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,078
Sung A. I'm on weekly duty,

327
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,649
but can you take these to our teacher?

328
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,680
Me? Why?

329
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,079
You got one vote.

330
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,079
- I'll go. I'm really strong. - What?

331
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,959
You got more than one vote.

332
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,000
It's fine.

333
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,920
We're friends.

334
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,838
- A knight in armor? - What was that?

335
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,200
Why was she Grade F?

336
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,358
If you think about it, since she participated,

337
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,078
she never went down to Grade F.

338
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,519
Then did she refuse to take part because she hated the game?

339
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,519
That's too cool.

340
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,170
See how she just helped Sung A?

341
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,519
Ja Eun the big sister.

342
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,720
Anyway,

343
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,169
the third task is to change the game rules.

344
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,170
(The Buddies)

345
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,920
I'll fill you in on Monday.

346
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
You're home.

347
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,920
- You're going somewhere? - The convenience store.

348
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,759
See you later.

349
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,409
I just got reappointed.

350
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,279
I'm starting at Paju next month.

351
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,170
Get ready to move schools again.

352
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,759
What?

353
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:48,170
Earlier today, a distribution hub in Gyeonggi Province caught fire.

354
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,598
Around 30 people are inside,

355
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,200
unable to contact anyone for over seven hours.

356
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,838
- The building... - What if out of those 30 people,

357
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,559
The fire's still raging.

358
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,920
Only you could be rescued?

359
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,999
Shin is on the ground to report.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
What would you do?

361
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,240
Isn't survival instinct a cheat key?

362
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,799
I'd choose to live.

363
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,279
With the guilt.

364
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,879
- Who? - This?

365
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
- What? - In kindergarten.

366
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,160
I think this is you.

367
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,839
I can go back to how things were.

368
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,519
I can get out of here.

369
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
- See you tomorrow. - On my own.

370
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,799
Inform your teacher of the transfer this week.

371
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,279
(The Buddies)

372
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,680
Do we go ahead with Task Three today?

373
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,358
(Okay.)

374
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,359
Okay.

375
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,920
Why don't you take point, Ye Lim?

376
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,759
I'll just back you up.

377
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,759
I think this is more you.

378
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Guys.

379
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,319
If there are no Grade Fs in the next Game,

380
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,559
how about we scrap the Grade A privilege too?

381
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,879
If there are no Grade Fs to bully,

382
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,400
there's no point in being Grade A.

383
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,200
And Kim Da Yeon, Bang Woo Yi, Koo Seol Ha.

384
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,880
Apologize to Ja Eun.

385
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,440
You broke the rule.

386
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,160
"You are to never leave a mark."

387
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,759
You know that.

388
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,079
What?

389
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,640
- When did I do that? - Don't deny it.

390
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,319
- There's a witness. - I saw them.

391
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,959
August 31, after fourth period PE, in the warehouse...

392
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,038
where the PE stuff is kept.

393
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,440
You beat her so hard you left bruises.

394
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
We did not!

395
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:07,799
Then can all three of you...

396
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,240
say at the same time where you were?

397
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,839
Ye Lim.

398
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,559
There's no way there won't be a Grade F in the next game.

399
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,399
How are you so sure?

400
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,559
We didn't have one this time.

401
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,599
You're against it, then, Ha Rin?

402
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,960
Do you want another vote?

403
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,880
Sure. Let's do that.

404
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,079
If there's no Grade F in the next game,

405
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,279
Grade A will lose their privileges.

406
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,279
They've begun to change.

407
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,720
Even if I leave,

408
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,039
it won't be like before.

409
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,640
Are you not well?

410
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,518
You look like you lost weight.

411
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,838
(Mom)

412
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,319
Is it because you're on screen?

413
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,880
What did you have for dinner?

414
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,719
I'm not sick.

415
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,239
My friends and I had ramyeon...

416
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,960
Ramyeon? You must eat rice.

417
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,279
- And you? - I ate, of course.

418
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,079
Ramyeon.

419
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,200
Ja Eun.

420
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,400
Yesterday, So Woon was here.

421
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,200
- Kim Da Yeon. - Here.

422
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,719
- Do Mi Young. - Here.

423
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,078
- Ra Hae Jun. - Here.

424
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,160
Myoung Ja Eun.

425
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,599
She's not here yet again?

426
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,599
She's absent without leave two days in a row?

427
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,799
Mr. Im. Ha Rin's not here either.

428
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,880
She took a field trip day.

429
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,079
That's all.

430
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,640
The first period is music.

431
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,959
The call can't be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

432
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,879
(Myoung Ja Eun)

433
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,119
She's not answering yet?

434
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,759
She has been ignoring my calls since yesterday too.

435
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,319
I don't like it.

436
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,039
I'll apply for the transfer a few days later.

437
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,679
(Myoung Ja Eun)

438
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,639
I wondered why you took me to the department store.

439
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,839
Tell the truth.

440
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,639
Where did you get all the gift cards from?

441
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,079
- Let's talk inside. - I'm so happy.

442
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,480
Hello. I live downstairs with Lieutenant Colonel Sung.

443
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,960
Oh, you came by with the potted plant last time.

444
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,680
- Are you back from class? - Yes.

445
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,839
You have a lot to carry. Do you need help?

446
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
You don't have to.

447
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,240
Thank you.

448
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,960
(Hong Sang Gu)

449
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,440
(Personnel Appointment Notice)

450
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,680
(Colonel Hong Sang Gu)

451
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,519
(Hong Sang Gu)

452
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,839
There's no way there won't be a Grade F in the next Game.

453
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,160
Why would I be the only one to get rescued?

454
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Is it the eyes?

455
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,200
Because it seems like a coincidence?

456
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,318
A transfer? So suddenly?

457
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,400
Yes, suddenly. It wasn't planned.

458
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,559
I thought you could graduate from this school.

459
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,359
(Contacts)

460
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
(Baek Ha Rin)

461
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,200
It's Sung Soo Ji.

462
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Soo Ji?

463
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,839
I don't know what it's about,

464
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,599
but I'm a bit busy.

465
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,319
(Sung Soo Ji)

466
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,200
(Sung Soo Ji)

467
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,279
SOS.

468
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,519
Did you want to call for help?

469
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
Too bad.

470
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,839
It's just us two again.

471
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,880
The popular song from back then.

472
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,359
Do you remember it?

473
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,720
You forget everything so easily.

474
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,720
I haven't forgotten anything.

475
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,079
Does your mom know...

476
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,559
why I'm harassing you...

477
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,720
so much?

478
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,680
You can tell her.

479
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,839
It was wrong of me.

480
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,599
Can I tell your new friends too?

481
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,839
It was wrong of me.

482
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,039
You know this place.

483
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,000
It wasn't a coincidence.

484
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,598
- Was it? - What?

485
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,318
You need to know what I'm saying.

486
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,038
You spent a fortune just so...

487
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,400
you could bully her in peace,

488
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
but I won't transfer schools because of you.

489
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,200
You can't get rid of me.

490
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Transfer schools?

491
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,119
I thought you'd be pleased.

492
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,759
I would've been.

493
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,400
Because...

494
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,680
the Pyramid Game, Soo Ji.

495
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,559
It won't end.

496
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,799
It can't end because of Ja Eun.

497
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Can you guess how far I'll go?

498
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,039
I can't.

499
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,559
Run away. Now's the time.

500
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:35,799
You psycho.

501
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,838
You'll really get rid of the game?

502
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,039
No. You too.

503
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,319
I must crush you to crush the game.

504
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,119
The Pyramid Game...

505
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,119
is you.

506
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Why...

507
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,400
are you trembling, Soo Ji?

508
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,038
Were you waiting for me?

509
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,200
For how long?

510
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,119
You should've called.

511
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,720
I dropped my phone three days ago and it broke.

512
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
I didn't wait too long.

513
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,000
Why did you miss school?

514
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,880
I caught a cold.

515
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,440
Once the game disappears,

516
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,839
I want to tell you and the others something.

517
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,839
Will you be around...

518
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,480
until then?

519
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,359
Dad, I'm not moving schools.

520
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
I'll graduate from Baekyeon.

521
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,880
If that's what you want,

522
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
then okay.

523
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,720
Do as you wish.

524
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,318
Let's go. Mr. Im will chew you out...

525
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,039
for going AWOL for two days.

526
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Yes.

527
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,359
It was wrong of me.

528
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,559
Right.

529
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,960
Let's drop by the convenience store first.

530
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,359
Welcome.

531
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,720
Are the recordings safe?

532
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,399
(Recordings)

533
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,920
There are quite a few. The stuff you taped with my app.

534
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,240
How will you release them?

535
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,639
It can't be traced if you go through...

536
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,319
a YouTube account from another country.

537
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,079
I plan to release this soon.

538
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,919
High School Year Class Five.

539
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,199
- The Pyramid Game. - Shut up.

540
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll crush you.

541
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,038
- Weren't you curious? - You psycho!

542
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,118
Shut up!

543
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,919
- The reason you were Grade F. - Darn you.

544
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,480
There's no way there won't be a Grade F in the next Game.

545
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,838
I put together a tantalizing clip to get people interested.

546
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,519
This works the algorithm, word of mouth, and views.

547
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,839
But...

548
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,319
When this gets out,

549
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,960
you could end up like my sister.

550
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,079
I'm going public so I don't.

551
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,440
Politicians' sons and famous celebrities.

552
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,000
Do you know what they fear the most?

553
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,440
Tips that go straight to the public.

554
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,640
Isn't it fortunate for us...

555
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,759
that Ha Rin's an heiress?

556
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,798
It's Ja Eun.

557
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,039
You're here today.

558
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,599
- Hi, Ja Eun. - Hello.

559
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,920
Ha Rin. We're friends.

560
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,399
I'll fix everything you don't like about me.

561
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
I really will. I won't bother you again.

562
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,000
I promise. I do.

563
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,400
You can tell her.

564
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,809
It was wrong of me.

565
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Ja Eun!

566
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,639
I'll put her in her place for you.

567
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,039
I'll crush her.

568
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,079
We're friends?

569
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Woo Yi.

570
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,039
I don't do this to a friend.

571
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,960
Hey. Quit your comedy sketch,

572
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,119
and get lost.

573
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,199
Hi, Do Ah.

574
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,678
You too.

575
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,639
Ha Rin and I have a lot to say to Da Yeon.

576
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,599
The material's so soft.

577
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,239
How much is something like this?

578
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,119
Expensive, right?

579
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,880
Hey. Did you like the photo?

580
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,159
Was it taken just to your liking?

581
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:31,809
Yes.

582
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,960
- I like it. - Good.

583
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,599
I think the class morons...

584
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,840
need to be reined in.

585
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,118
They can hope all they want,

586
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,360
but the game will continue.

587
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,519
Forever.

588
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,769
Is that the theme you want?

589
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,239
Yes.

590
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,038
PE should be perfect for it.

591
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,329
I'll arrange something.

592
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,329
That was so childish.

593
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,920
What are you doing here?

594
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,199
I think we swapped phones by mistake earlier.

595
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,679
Seo Do Ah.

596
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,399
Lunchtime, the ballet studio.

597
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,559
Ballet studio. Ha Rin's gang is meeting?

598
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I see.

599
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,880
You're being cute again, Do Ah.

600
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,159
It's worthless.

601
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,158
It's fine. Leave it.

602
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,360
We have enough already.

603
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,519
- Is it dinner? - Yes.

604
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,809
My sister used to make that exact face.

605
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Do you know when?

606
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,719
When she walked home alone from school late at night.

607
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:03,840
What are you on about?

608
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,038
Are you serious?

609
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,840
- Ha Rin. Let's go. - Let's.

610
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,039
Today's class will be crazy fun.

611
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,840
Look forward to it.

612
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,199
Today's PE final exam activity is dodgeball.

613
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,039
Target dodgeball.

614
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:47,519
"Target dodgeball?"

615
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:50,400
- What's that? - This is our final exam?

616
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:52,999
Just so you know, the teacher has to work on our school trip,

617
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,199
so she won't be present.

618
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Don't worry.

619
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,840
Our class president will take immaculate records.

620
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,289
The rules are simple.

621
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,038
Within the 20-minute time limit,

622
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,480
the first person to score six points will get full marks.

623
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,400
Get zero points, and you get zero marks.

624
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,639
Your final mark depends on how many points you score.

625
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,199
To score points, you must hit a target.

626
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,518
To be exact, you must hit the four people in Grade D...

627
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,679
who each got one vote in the last Pyramid Game.

628
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,480
They're calling collective bullying a class activity?

629
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,078
And so proudly too?

630
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,119
Targets?

631
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,840
Why Grade D who got one vote each?

632
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,809
They'll substitute Grade F.

633
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:34,599
If Grade F disappears...

634
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:37,679
The fear that Grade D could become like Grade F.

635
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,809
Everyone has 20 minutes to stack six points.

636
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,159
A mission with limits where you fend for yourselves.

637
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,960
That trifecta drives you crazy.

638
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,119
They'll go crazy to attack those beneath them.

639
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,920
Once you get into it, there's no getting out.

640
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,679
How interesting.

641
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Wait.

642
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,809
Why are we playing target dodgeball?

643
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,159
- Was it the teacher's idea? - Of course not.

644
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,960
She said we could pick the activity,

645
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,879
- so Ha Rin and I planned it. - Why?

646
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,440
Because you're Grade A?

647
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,809
That hurts.

648
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,199
I'm Grade A too.

649
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,839
Do you have a suggestion?

650
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
I do.

651
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,329
The targets.

652
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,959
I want everyone in Grade D to be included.

653
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,679
(Ask to include all Grade D for 1 point, 3 for the low rank.)

654
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,400
One point if we hit someone who got two or more votes.

655
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,039
Three points if we hit someone who got one vote.

656
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,079
What?

657
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,079
Why?

658
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,158
Why, Ye Lim?

659
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,159
Why include us?

660
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,919
There are 12 people in Grade D who got more than two votes each.

661
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,960
That's too many.

662
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,960
I can't let those 12 gang up on the four with just one vote.

663
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:01,119
Because that's what Ha Rin wants.

664
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,960
She wants to stop the four one-voters from being bullied.

665
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,719
But that's about all she can do. What should I say?

666
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,559
I can't turn down a suggestion from another Grade A.

667
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,039
Soo Ji knows that...

668
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,719
which is why she got Ye Lim to speak up.

669
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:18,809
Deal.

670
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,289
We'll play with three balls.

671
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,999
One for Grade A, one for Grades B and C, and one for Grade D.

672
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,480
Can the four one-vote Grade D people take their places infield?

673
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,769
You lose two points if you step on the line.

674
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,559
Shall we play?

675
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,599
(Koo Seol Ha)

676
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,079
Hey!

677
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Throw the ball.

678
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,440
- Darn you. - This is a mess.

679
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,159
Screw you.

680
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:25,840
- Hand it over. - No!

681
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
No!

682
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,199
What are you doing?

683
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,198
You're ruining the game!

684
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,559
I am? You are!

685
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,769
Darn you. Throw the darn ball!

686
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,639
- No! - Let go!

687
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:54,880
Let go, psycho!

688
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,679
Pandemonium.

689
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,599
It's just what you wanted, right?

690
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,769
I can't stand that athlete girl.

691
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,399
Should we have banned the one-voters from using the balls?

692
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,920
It's everyone's game.

693
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,039
Eun Jung is doing her part.

694
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:33,840
Let go!

695
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,239
I see. She's making people angry.

696
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:40,638
Screw you, Ji Ae.

697
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,280
Why did you throw the ball to Eun Jung?

698
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,039
Darn it.

699
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,239
The climax.

700
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:14,480
Myoung Ja Eun. Minus two points.

701
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,959
Keep the balls moving.

702
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,598
I have just three points!

703
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,599
Hey!

704
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,480
Do Ah, isn't it unfair to monopolize the ball?

705
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,960
First, get a hold of all the balls.

706
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,599
Then stop playing.

707
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,480
What on earth...

708
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,919
Come on, Do Ah.

709
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,519
I just scored three points.

710
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,039
(Sung Soo Ji)

711
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,679
Seo Do Ah! You can't count that!

712
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,279
We're not tickling others with the ball.

713
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,399
Throw it at her!

714
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,960
There was no such rule.

715
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,799
We play with three balls.

716
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,439
Grade A, Grades B and C, Grade D.

717
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,238
One-vote Grade D in the innermost circle.

718
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:54,518
Minus two points if you step on a line.

719
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,119
Win six points and you get full marks for this.

720
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,360
That's it.

721
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,800
Stop.

722
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,840
Kim Da Yeon, Myoung Ja Eun, one point each.

723
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,760
Kim Da Yeon.

724
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,400
Not only did she go against Grade A Im Ye Lim,

725
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:44,360
but she also upset the class.

726
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,079
The tables...

727
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,000
have turned.

728
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,119
Do you want it?

729
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,039
Ja Eun, thanks for what you did.

730
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:08,760
Da Yeon acted like she played for our country or something.

731
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:10,559
She almost broke my arm.

732
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,599
When did you four get so close?

733
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,000
- What? - Do you play a sport?

734
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,480
Basketball? Volleyball?

735
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:18,880
No, I don't.

736
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,000
Are you serious about getting rid of the game?

737
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,320
Can you...

738
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,280
not tell anyone I contacted you?

739
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,480
Sorry for asking, Soo Ji.

740
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:37,639
I won't be put at a disadvantage if I go along with you, right?

741
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,719
- Where's Ja Eun? - Getting changed.

742
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,000
- And Ye Lim? - Getting changed.

743
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,079
Three club sandwiches and a BLT salad to go, please.

744
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,839
Honey oat bread with all the veggies,

745
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,280
- and your recommended dressing. - Okay.

746
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,840
Hey, Soo Ji.

747
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,360
I get that you don't trust me completely.

748
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,000
But I won't betray once I make up my mind.

749
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:15,800
I'm just saying.

750
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,280
When is MONSTA X's comeback?

751
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,159
Next month.

752
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,960
I'm organizing a group purchase. Do you want an album?

753
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,480
Who's your favorite member?

754
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,599
- Hyung Won. - He has the ultimate body.

755
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,159
Pervert.

756
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,760
He's all about the looks.

757
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,439
You go for looks?

758
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
My gosh.

759
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,679
Your food is ready.

760
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,079
I can't wait. Shall we eat here?

761
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Isn't it good?

762
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,880
This is the best combo.

763
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,119
It's nice.

764
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,719
Hyungwon's your favorite. Who's your second-best?

765
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:57,719
- Minhyuk. - Gosh.

766
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:58,719
Minhyuk?

767
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,599
What should I do?

768
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:03,239
I found a friend.

769
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,800
- Let's go see "M Countdown." - No.

770
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,840
Why not? Come with me.

771
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,559
I'll buy you a full set.

772
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,239
This is harder than dance practice.

773
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,679
They'll be uploaded tomorrow.

774
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,679
The recordings.

775
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,800
Tomorrow?

776
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,960
Sorry. I thought of Ye Lim earlier.

777
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,320
Did anyone see her face when she caught the ball?

778
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,919
Even that face is capable of being ugly.

779
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,519
I saw promise in mine.

780
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,760
I'm human after all.

781
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:55,280
You are.

782
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:57,638
Soo Ji's more like a squid.

783
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,118
Shut up, please, thanks.

784
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,598
You two got pretty close.

785
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,039
You too, shut up, please.

786
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,118
Don't be jealous, Ja Eun.

787
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,679
You're my favorite.

788
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,920
My queen who came to satisfy me.

789
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,920
I'm sorry.

790
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,039
I got so angry in the heat of the moment.

791
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,280
I'll make up for it, Ha Rin.

792
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,079
It's Ha Rin.

793
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Da Yeon crossed the line big time.

794
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,920
Can you scold her for me?

795
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,000
Take it.

796
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,639
It's your dad.

797
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,119
Hey.

798
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:12,039
What?

799
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:05,320
See a doctor.

800
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,599
Your ankle.

801
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,400
You idiot.

802
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:18,519
Click.

803
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,519
You're still friends.

804
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,679
I thought the distance meant something.

805
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,880
Then what Eun Jung still cares about...

806
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,360
is Ye Lim...

807
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
and swimming.

808
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:33,480
When's the competition?

809
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,920
Why? Will you tell the federation before the match?

810
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:39,280
That she likes girls?

811
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
No.

812
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
You can't do it.

813
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:43,800
If you do, I'll make you look like a psychopath.

814
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,920
Or will you bribe people?

815
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,559
Don't do that.

816
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,078
My family's rich too.

817
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,079
Do you know why my parents didn't come to the open class?

818
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,239
Because they don't want to suck up to your company.

819
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,159
I'm saying the tricks you use...

820
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:58,159
don't work on me.

821
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,960
I heard your parents were against you debuting.

822
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,800
So you're not close with them.

823
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,598
If this debut falls through,

824
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,840
you might not be able to make it on your own.

825
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Right?

826
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,360
- Right, Ye Lim? - Darn you.

827
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,039
Come at me.

828
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,559
What are you doing?

829
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,439
What are you doing?

830
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,999
Get up. Stand up!

831
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,439
Get up right now!

832
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,118
Stand up, Eun Jung!

833
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,239
Get up!

834
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,760
How heartbreaking.

835
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,920
I'll keep an eye on you.

836
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:35,519
Ye Lim.

837
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,479
Unless you want her to kneel again.

838
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,480
Screw you.

839
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:42,598
What's up with Ha Rin?

840
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:43,599
That witch.

841
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,839
You want to know now?

842
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,039
I never cared before.

843
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,920
Inside Grade A is another smaller pyramid.

844
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
This is Baek Ha Rin.

845
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,800
If 9 out of the 21 who voted for her turn from her,

846
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,280
meaning Grade A lacks enough votes and the game disappears...

847
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,559
One-half squared nine times over is 1 over 512.

848
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,920
Even if the game disappears by 1-512th of a chance,

849
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,679
pyramids exist everywhere.

850
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,400
That's why we submit to Ha Rin.

851
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,239
That's why I let my guard down.

852
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:28,960
You're being cute again, Do Ah.

853
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,320
So sickeningly.

854
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:33,719
Where's Da Yeon?

855
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:35,880
Getting beaten up somewhere.

856
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,599
By her trash of a dad.

857
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,639
You wench!

858
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,599
Because of you, you broad!

859
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,360
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

860
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,519
- I swear. - Stand still!

861
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:55,199
Hello.

862
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:58,280
I'll do it.

863
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,719
How about we send her abroad?

864
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,920
Mother would agree to that.

865
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,119
Mother isn't the only problem.

866
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,279
She has proof that you...

867
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,840
used the Baekyeon Foundation to launder money.

868
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,519
Why on earth does Mother like her?

869
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:23,840
She's a psycho.

870
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,599
She's ours, but still.

871
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,519
Did you get more recordings today?

872
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,639
Here's my proof.

873

How does she know?

876
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,840
I think I earned back the right.

877

You're being cute again, Do Ah.

878
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:25,719
