1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,719
I betrayed my friends.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,640
I betrayed my friends.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,280
The prisoner's dilemma.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,759
If a prisoner betrays, it could ruin all the others.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,639
But if they work together,

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,600
all of them would benefit from this psychological warfare.

7
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,759
When I first transferred to this school,

8
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,359
I hated all of you.

9
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:07,879
Does that count as a mistake?

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,239
I still hate them. I feel that quite often.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,079
I secretly took pictures of other girls.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,359
I mostly took pictures of their deltoid muscles.

13
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,439
I know it was wrong of me.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm...

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,049
good at lying too.

16
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
A long time ago...

17
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,519
Because you're so kind, I look evil compared to you.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,519
Did you think you were some heroine of a movie?

19
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,040
Soo Ji. Don't be so mean.

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,839
Ja Eun. Don't be so kind.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,079
Right. I deserve to be shot.

22
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,279
Ji Ae. Why are you acting like a saint all of a sudden?

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,719
You're the chatty one.

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,239
- Did you just diss me? - You're indeed chatty.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
But I think she's fun.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,078
Did you just smile? I told you to stop being nice.

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,559
Is this fun for you? Why are you smiling?

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,519
- Don't smile. - Why are you taking it out on me?

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,799
- You little... - What about you?

30
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,280
This is all we could think of for our mistakes.

31
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,039
What about you?

32
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,199
You know something?

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,530
Just now, you took a hit.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
As for us,

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,479
we became one.

36
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,479
Look at her, acting strong.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Look at her.

38
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,199
Oh, my. Seriously.

39
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,080
Darn it. It's all messed up now.

40
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,199
Come on.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,639
Ha Rin is sending you a signal.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
Do you want Baek Ha Rin to go nuts again?

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Stop them.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,919
Ji Ae. Come here.

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,839
I told you to come here!

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,759
Do you think I can't come after you if you're not in Grade F?

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
- That's enough. - What?

48
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,599
- Get out of my way. Darn it. - Stop it.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
You crazy jerks!

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Darn you.

51
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,439
Look.

52
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,080
Let me see.

53
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,639
Call 911 now!

54
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,159
Sung A, Hurry!

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,800
- Oh, no. - Call now.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,199
(Pyramid Game, Download the Pyramid Game app.)

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,280
(Leak contents, and you'll face the utmost penalty.)

58
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,560
(Pyramid Game)

59
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,759
(Episode 8)

60
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,800
Darn. Come on.

61
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,000
(Aunt)

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,170
(Aunt)

63
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,879
I knew those reckless girls would cause a huge problem one day.

64
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,519
So how badly is she injured?

65
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,279
Okay. I got it, you punk.

66
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,439
Just wait. Got it. You little...

67
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,719
Darn it.

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,319
(Mr. Im, Year 2 Class 5)

69
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,959
It's all my fault.

70
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,360
I don't need your apology.

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
Making sure no one talks about this is our priority.

72
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,518
The girls, their teacher,

73
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,600
temporary teachers, and so on.

74
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,639
- This can't get out. - Of course, not.

75
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,240
I'll make sure that never happens.

76
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,518
When Mr. Kim arrives...

77
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,360
That injured girl, Sim Eun Jung.

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,040
Was she a scholarship student?

79
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,639
What on earth happened?

80
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,199
Who beat up whom?

81
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,119
Ko Eun Byeol set me up earlier, didn't she?

82
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,279
She got me to get involved, so I'd be in bigger trouble.

83
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,480
That was it, wasn't it?

84
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,319
Am I right or not?

85
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,279
Why did you figure that out after you attacked her?

86
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,079
I'm going to kill her.

87
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,519
Don't answer that. Darn it!

88
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,079
Where's Baek Ha Rin? Where is she?

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
You idiot.

90
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,439
Get a grip.

91
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Do you think that witch is going to protect you from your father?

92
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,439
Quit dreaming.

93
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,480
You were so stupid to act like her slave all this time.

94
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,959
Come to your senses.

95
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,239
Seo Do Ah.

96
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,319
Did you just hear what she said?

97
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,800
How dare she when her father is my father's driver?

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
Do you think we're friends because I keep you around?

99
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,279
Know your place.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Why are you acting as if you're my friend?

101
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,639
You're...

102
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,040
nothing but my minion, Koo Seol Ha.

103
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,439
My servant and errand girl.

104
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Got it?

105
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,360
Go, and bring me liquor.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,879
Screw you.

107
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,519
Darn it.

108
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,240
Sung Soo Ji will win.

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
What?

110
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:29,160
She at least knows who's on her side and who's not.

111
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,319
Yes, Dad.

112
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,680
(A-hole Dad)

113
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,079
Things aren't looking good.

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,439
Right now, Eun Jung...

115
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,599
I mean, Kim Da Yeon who is not in Grade A beat up Sim Eun Jung...

116
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,560
who isn't in Grade F

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
She broke the rule, big time.

118
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
Which brings me to this point.

119
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,160
Please know that I'm saying this out of my loyalty for you.

120
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,720
Why don't we just get rid of the game?

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,959
Let's just call it school violence.

122
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,878
Of course. You're not a bully.

123
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,000
We'll take the blame.

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I will.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,239
It must be Pyramid Game.

126
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
What?

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,720
All right. We're going to play a game now.

128
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,840
You'll get a reward if you play well.

129
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
But you will be punished if you don't.

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Isn't this fun?

131
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,240
We're playing a game now.

132
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,279
It must be...

133
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,879
a game.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Okay?

135
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,209
There's Ja Eun.

136
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,240
- Ja Eun! Let's play! - Ja Eun! Let's play!

137
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,239
- Ja Eun! - Ja Eun!

138
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,209
- Come now! - Come over here now!

139
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,518
- Come here, Ja Eun. Let's play. - Let's play.

140
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,240
Play with us, Ja Eun.

141
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,330
I knew it. You're not showing any sign of guilt.

142
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,159
- You're back. - I'm asking you just in case.

143
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,960
You're not thinking about reflecting on your action...

144
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,799
and stopping it. Right?

145
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,600
If there's a slight chance of that, tell me now.

146
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,679
I'll take it into consideration.

147
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360
Why are you asking me that?

148
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,399
- What? - Ask Ja Eun.

149
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,090
Hey.

150
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,960
You need more clothes. Right? Do you want to borrow mine?

151
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,450
What?

152
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,240
Gosh. Take them back.

153
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,159
Do you expect her to fit into your tiny clothes?

154
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,639
- Here. Those are my clothes. - I brought mine too.

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,960
You guys.

156
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,479
You're over 174cm tall. Okay?

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,159
You're clueless about your own body.

158
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,279
Thank you.

159
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,090
Thank you. I mean it.

160
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,038
Gosh. Why are you guys so down?

161
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,039
Right.

162
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,639
What's the matter? Hey, something

163
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,329
Has spoiled the atmosphere

164
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,200
Of course, it only makes sense that our mood is down.

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,879
Is Eun Jung okay?

166
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,559
She'll probably call me once the exams are done.

167
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Where's Soo Ji?

168
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,759
She stepped out for a moment.

169
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,600
Including Soo Ji, the five of us are the final group. Right?

170
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,960
Not yet. Wait.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
What are they doing here?

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,919
Did Baek Ha Rin tell you to spy on us?

173
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,918
Or are you here to feel us out again?

174
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,080
Stop it, Jae Hyung.

175
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,799
They want to know how Eun Jung is. They're worried about her.

176
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,159
We're going to pick one of you to be in Grade F.

177
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,799
Raise your hands if you agree.

178
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,559
Ye Lim.

179
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,759
Oh, no.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,559
I'm sure Eun Jung is all right. She has big, strong bones.

181
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,720
Anyway, you must be furious at Da Yeon.

182
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,919
Ha Rin and I are on your side.

183
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,879
People in Grade A will come up with a punishment for Da Yeon.

184
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,120
What do you want us to do to Da Yeon?

185
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,159
If there's anything you want, tell us.

186
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,799
Gosh. I was wondering why you wanted to see me.

187
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,159
Take that.

188
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,120
Then I'll take it that you'll leave it to us to decide!

189
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,639
You can't back out later!

190
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,240
That annoying attention-seeker.

191
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,239
(Ha Rin.)

192
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,919
Ha Rin. I did what you told me to do.

193
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
You still...

194
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,720
haven't heard from Eun Jung?

195
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,559
Her swimming coach is with her now.

196
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
I'll hear from them soon.

197
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,279
What was that?

198
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Eun Jung...

199
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,200
was transferred to Seosim Hospital in Seoul.

200
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,720
She'll get surgery there.

201
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,278
I'm sure I won't have to point it out to you..

202
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,320
Since you saw what happened.

203
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,960
This was a careless accident.

204
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
Don't let your imagination run wild to write a made-up story online...

205
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,720
and spread rumors about the accident.

206
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,240
It's a cover-up.

207
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,399
He can't make this decision on his own.

208
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,960
Their parents.

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
The principal.

210
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,440
More than anything, Eun Jung's parents...

211
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,480
want this to be settled quietly.

212
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,759
Do you understand?

213
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,360
He's unbelievable.

214
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,679
Fine. Get rich with bribes.

215
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,080
Seriously, girls.

216
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
I told you to go easy on your pranks.

217
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,360
How is it that girls are rougher than boys?

218
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,919
Kim Da Yeon.

219
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,839
When we go back to Seoul,

220
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,638
you'll have to clean the hallway for two months. Got it?

221
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,960
Instead of calling for the school violence committee?

222
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
The school violence committee?

223
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,960
Didn't you girls say it yourselves? That this was a game?

224
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,159
Sung Soo Ji.

225
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,440
Aren't you too serious?

226
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,960
The school violence committee? That's ridiculous.

227
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,239
(Coach)

228
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,039
Eun Jung's swimming career might be over.

229
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,440
Please be there for her, and comfort her.

230
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,200
As for the cleaning punishment,

231
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,559
I can bring my housekeeper, right?

232
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,839
Gosh.

233
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
What a hassle.

234
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,639
Hey! Are you drunk?

235
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,758
- Hey! - You little...

236
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,839
- You jerk. - Stop it!

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,638
- Ye Lim. Stop it. - How will you fix this?

238
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,959
- How are you going to fix this? - Ye Lim.

239
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
You crazy jerk.

240
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,398
Darn it. Get your hands off me!

241
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,719
It's not like she's dead!

242
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,199
She's fine. She's not dead!

243
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,398
Get your hands off me.

244
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,959
I was lenient with you because your family is rich.

245
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,239
- What did you say, you jerk? - Ye Lim.

246
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,398
- You jerk! - Jae Hyung, stop Ye Lim.

247
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,678
How are you going to fix this?

248
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,959
- Jae Hyung, stop her. - Get your hands off me!

- Ye Lim! - Jae Hyung.

250
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,119
- You think I won't give you... - How will you fix this?

251
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
Penalty points on a school trip?

252
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,199
You said you wanted to be a celebrity.

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,119
Don't you care what goes into your student record?

254
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,319
- What are you doing? - It's okay.

255
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,518
- Ye Lim. - I told you guys to stop!

256
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,720
Get your hands off me.

257
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,639
Just shut your mouth.

258
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,599
I'm sorry!

259
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,079
Let's start the shoot.

260
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,120

- Ye Lim. - I told you guys to stop!

263
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,279
Ye Lim.

264
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,799
Let go of me!

265
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,440
Ye Lim. Let go.

266
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,279

267
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,360
to pieces.

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,720
What are you doing?

274
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,599
So you won't give up on the game no matter what?

275
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,920
Fine.

276
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
Let's take it all the way.

277
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,200
Hey, Eun Jung. I'm here.

278

You're here.

280
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,039
Are you okay?

281
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,440
You seem comfortable.

282
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,039
Did you eat, ma'am?

283
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,359
It's my fault.

284
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,440
It's my fault.

285
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,119
(A missed call from Mom)

286
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,759
Ja Eun. You didn't answer your phone.

287
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,170
Did you arrive in Seoul safely?

288
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,920
Someone got hurt because of me.

289
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,319
I'm scared.

290
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,839

The legal team from QB Group compensated the family handsomely.

316

That you are sloppy.

346

347

No!

I'm here to help you. Got it?

378
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,480
How much can your father pay?

379
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,000
Well, you'll be transferred out of here.

380
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,318
Based on the amount,

381
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,960
we can tell your new school you were a victim.

382
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,758

00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,319
Do you want to talk to him?

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
You stupid wench!

385
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,920
Get up!

386
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,558

391
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,759
She'll transfer out? What?

392
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,759
Does it mean this incident was accepted as school violence?

393
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,078
- What did she say? - What?

394
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,399
She'll be forced to transfer out.

395
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,598

403

Thank you. I'll share them with the girls.

404
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,720
So they'll spread the incident on this platform?

405
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,919
What is this? Oral tradition?

406
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240
Well, that might show up on our exam.

Stopping the news articles is all they know.

417
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Why?

418
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,240

00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
You go back to your class.

422

Put her back in my class.

423
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,400
You should've done better then.

424
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,480
You messed it up. Don't throw a tantrum at me.

425
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
Are you still nine years old?

426
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,640
I told you not to meddle.

I told her.

She cares about you very much.

431

457
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,559

- What about Ye Lim? - She's training now.

467
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,480
By the way, I never imagined that I would be friends with Ye Lim.

Goodness. That nosy fool.

No. The look on her face...

475
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
all of a sudden.

550
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,519
What do you think about joining me instead of Soo Ji?

551
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,679
She sounds like a sociopath.

552
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,809
She has zero empathy for other people.

553
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,959
- I spent time with her, so I know. - Do you recognize her voice?

554
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,638
- Park Ji Young. - To be honest,

555
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,359
I wanted to be friends with you from the beginning,

556
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
- Ja Eun. - Ja Eun?

557
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:50,809
Don't tell me you secretly bugged her phone.

558
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,809
Don't badmouth my friend.

559
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,400
Soo Ji is cool.

560
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,639
That's why I respect her and like her.

561
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:58,920
I heard all about you, Ji Young.

562
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,809
You spy for Ha Rin, don't you?

563
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,639
Get...

564
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Get lost.

565
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,118
You won't sell liquor to minors,

566
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:10,238
but you have no problem installing a secret voice recording app.

567
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,808
- You're a nut job. - There's a recording file...

568
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:12,920
from Baek Ha Rin's visit to Ja Eun.

569
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:16,239
If you listen to this, we'll be accomplices.

570
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,639
Deal?

571
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,679
Deal.

572
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,329
Shouldn't you say,

573
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,599
"I don't need to. I trust her" if you considered her a friend?

574
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,919
I must listen to it to trust her.

575
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
That's so typical of you.

576
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Before that,

577
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,679
read this first.

578
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,039
("Lieutenant Colonel's Connection Influences Military")

579
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,839
(The personal information of the corrupt lieutenant colonel...)

580
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,119
(has been revealed as he was suspected of corruption.)

581
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,719
So what about the witness?

582
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,439
Those crazy jerks. Why did they do that in the barracks?

583
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,719
(It was confirmed that he received bribes from the corporate.)

584
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,809
You're not reporting this to the higher-ups!

585
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,000
Watch your mouth.

586
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,400
It wasn't an assault.

587
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,400
It was an accident for now.

588
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,559
Ye Won. Do you want to try some?

589
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,239
- Sure. - Ja Eun.

590
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,960
Can you pick up my earbud next to your feet?

591
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,000
What are you doing?

592
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,919
Ja Eun, let's go to the cafeteria.

593
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,079
They still have the melon bread.

594
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,519
Sung Soo Ji brought this upon herself.

595
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,719
Ja Eun.

596
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,559
If you mess up my pyramid...

597
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,400
That naive fool.

598
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,679
I'm going to turn Soo Ji into a school bully.

599
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,839
I'll be more persistent than you guys were...

600
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,079
when you got Kim Da Yeon kicked out.

601
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,719
- What? - Wherever Soo Ji goes,

602
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,038
what she does, or whomever she meets,

603
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,119
I'll make her live as a bully for the rest of her life.

604
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,559
Is that what you want?

605
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't do that.

606
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,919
- Please don't. - Then stop being friends with her.

607
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,289
Go back to being an F.

608
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,719
Go back to your place.

609
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,289
Then I won't bully other girls.

610
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,199
Please do that, Ja Eun.

611
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:43,960
You owe me.

612
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,329
Don't you agree?

613
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,639
I...

614
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,079
I will...

615
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,400
go back to Grade F.

616
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,960
For the time being, Ja Eun will act...

617
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,039
like a bratty kid.

618
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,479
Give her time.

619
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,920
Why? What's going on?

620
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,719
I got it. Tell us our next plan.

621
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,718
There's no way our classmates didn't realize it after playing...

622
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,039
this crazy game for a year and a half.

623
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,440
That Baek Ha Rin started to crack.

624
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:32,960
And we became a strong unit.

625
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,360
Let's use that.

626
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,719
What?

627
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,920
I said I would get rid of the game.

628
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,679
I can't do it alone.

629
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,239
Can you help us, Sin Ye?

630
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,960
Let's be safe together.

631
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:53,920
All of us.

632
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,329
Hi, Sin Ye.

633
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Hi.

634
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,559
What about Jung Yeon Doo?

635
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:15,920
She's one of Ye Lim's friends. Wouldn't she join us?

636
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:19,000
Sine and cosine are different.

637
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,719
No?

638
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,959
We'll hold off on her.

639
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,079
Something doesn't sit right with me.

640
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,559
Gosh.

641
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,360
If this fails, I'll be in Grade F.

642
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,289
But I'll make this work.

643
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,159
Don't you want to join us?

644
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,440
(Ra Hae Jun)

645
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,038
I'm in.

646
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,360
Just promise me that I won't be in trouble for this.

647
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,639
Ja Eun.

648
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,920
Whatever Baek Ha Rin did this time,

649
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,480
I wasn't scared this time.

650
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,440
"Let's play together."

651
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,199
Come to think of it,

652
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,119
that was what I wanted to hear the most...

653
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,329
when I was in Grade F.

654
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,880
So you should think about that too, Ja Eun.

655
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:50,809
You said we were friends.

656
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,328
What about Ja Eun?

657
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:33,400
Isn't she in your crew?

658
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,360
She has a family matter.

659
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,039
I have a question.

660
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:43,119
How come you guys didn't tell anyone about the game sooner?

661
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm not criticizing you.

662
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,519
Even if this was called a game,

663
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,800
you must have sensed that something was off at one point.

664
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,960
This is school violence.

665
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,159
Because...

666
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,840
we couldn't be free of any wrongdoings, per se.

667
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,679
Until now, our domain was never violated.

668
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:14,400
As long as we didn't end up in Grade F,

669
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,440
we were safe...

670
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
if I'm being completely honest.

671
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:23,599
Right.

672
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,079
I would have done the same.

673
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
There will be 13 of us on the day of the game.

674
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,559
I'm contacting some girls now.

675
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:33,960
Thirteen? Then what happens once there are thirteen of us?

676
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,840
We will be the majority that day.

677
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,519
And we'll quit the game.

678
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,800
Quit the game?

679
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
How?

680
00:44:41,961 --> 00:44:43,880
This was always emphasized in our class.

681
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,519
That this was everyone's game.

682
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,639
Once the majority of us quit the game, there won't be any game.

683
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:53,239
For this strategy to work, we must trust each other a lot.

684
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:56,320
This ironclad strategy of hers doesn't match her personality.

685
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,920
That's what I thought too. Jinx.

686
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,079
Wait. This strategy sort of sounds like...

687
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Right.

688
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:07,280
I wouldn't have come up with this if it weren't for some naive fool.

689
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I will...

690
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:12,480
go back to Grade F.

691
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,199
(Sim Eun Jung)

692
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,519
(Im Ye Lim)

693
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,038
(I heard you were going to perform at the festival, Ye Lim.)

694
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,519
(You have no idea how badly I'm waiting for that.)

695
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,558
It's different from the last one, right?

696
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:30,880
It is.

697
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,559
You just have to install it secretly and press the power button.

698
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,960
Are you sure about this?

699
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:38,199
You got the recording files. I'm sure you heard everything.

700
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,239
Ending the game isn't enough.

701
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:44,159
I must finish Baek Ha Rin. That's my final goal.

702
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:46,840
That's why I need this.

703
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:49,199
Good luck.

704
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
I'm going to need it.

705
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,519
(D-Day)

706
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:02,599
(D-Day)

707
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,280
The last Thursday of every month.

708
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,360
The day of Pyramid Game.

709
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,479
(Baekyeon Festival)

710
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Hey!

711
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,159
(Look forward to the surprise guest!)

712
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:23,119
Ja Eun.

713
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,639
Hey, Ja Eun!

714
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:26,159
Hey!

715
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,039
Don't act like my friend.

716
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:30,639
What's this?

717
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,760
Why did my heart flutter just now?

718
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:36,079
A Maltese is pretending to be a Doberman.

719
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,599
That was stupidly cool.

720
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,239
Ja Eun, can you scowl at me more?

721
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,199
Are you okay...

722
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Did you see that?

723
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,519
Her body is as sturdy as a Michelin tire.

724
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,119
By the way, what's the matter with her?

725
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,440
It's like she's gone back to her old days.

726
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,199
Did she bomb the exams?

727
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,199
You really have no idea about Ja Eun.

728
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,679
She never got good grades, anyway.

729
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,079
