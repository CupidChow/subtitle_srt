1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,120
Because you were the only one who was against this game.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,879
Weren't you?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,280
Here's my plan.

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,919
Screw...

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,119
the Pyramid Game.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,679
I'll become Grade F?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,120
That's refreshing. I'll think about it.

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,719
Did you think I'd just go for it?

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,920
I might hate Ha Rin's guts,

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,879
but both of you are threatening me.

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,760
I can't go all-in on you.

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,039
Can I?

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,850
It's so darn hard.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,210
Soo Ji.

15
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,600
Will you stop if I die?

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,210
Then I'll just die.

17
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,439
Please, just stop it.

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,399
Thanks for everything, guys.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,239
What is she doing?

20
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,239
- Don't! - Joo Seung Yi!

21
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,319
Get out here, Seung Yi!

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
What are you doing?

23
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:13,799
(Joo Seung Yi)

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,560
Stop it!

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Joo Seung Yi!

26
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,159
Hurry up!

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,519
- Hey! - Seung Yi.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,399
My gosh.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,598
- She's shaking. - Oh, no.

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,760
Shouldn't we get help?

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,798
- Look. - It'll be fine.

32
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,318
- Why did you do it? - What happened?

33
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,000
- She's still bleeding. - My gosh.

34
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,718
- Will she be okay? - Let's get something.

35
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,719
Okay.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,799
Sung Soo Ji.

37
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,000
Where was she until now?

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Why did you do it, Soo Ji?

39
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,319
You made a mistake this time.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,719
A mistake?

41
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,199
If you refuse my offer, everyone will know your secret.

42
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,759
You don't want your secret to be exposed, do you?

43
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,530
You're the worst.

44
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,039
You must be crazy.

45
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,878
Hey. What are you?

46
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,158
What did you do to Seung Yi?

47
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,369
Yes, tell us.

48
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,918
- Say something, Soo Ji. - Yes.

49
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,919
Are you deaf?

50
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,919
How evil.

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,199
- And shameless. - You're shameless.

52
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,639
I think she's neat, independent, and doing well.

53
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,878
You have no idea what's happening at school.

54
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,280
But are you falsely assuming that...

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,759
your child must be doing okay?

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,039
There's school violence in your daughter's class.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Ms. Yoon.

58
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,719
Did you just say "school violence?"

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,680
Your daughter is very likely a victim.

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
What are you doing, Ms. Yoon?

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Come with me.

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,438
I'm sorry, sir.

63
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm Soo Ji's homeroom teacher Im Ju Hyung.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,840
- You can talk to me. - Say that again.

65
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,680
Did you say "school violence?"

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
If you don't believe me,

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,560
see for yourself.

68
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,198
Sung Soo Ji. At least make an excuse.

69
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,879
Why won't you say anything?

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,759
What did you do to Seung Yi?

71
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,520
She's so thick-faced and brazen.

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,039
- I hate her. - How could she?

73
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,800
- A mistake... - Darn her.

74
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,159
I don't know.

75
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,800
It's completely different. It's a show.

76
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,799
Why? Why would she put on a show?

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
You blackmailed the kids, didn't you?

78
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,919
Blackmail and manipulation are Baek Ha Rin's specialty.

79
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,360
Your blackmail's a whip,

80
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,719
but Ha Rin's is a whip but also...

81
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,159
obvious.

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,159
You're an inferior version of her.

83
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,050
Baek Ha Rin...

84
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,279
has leverage on you but she can also get you a better grade?

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,879
A better grade?

86
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,319
Then our ranking...

87
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,519
You have a point.

88
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,000
That was my mistake,

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,999
and Ha Rin, you took my mistake...

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,078
What do I do, Ha Rin?

91
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,360
If word of that gets out...

92
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,000
What grade are you, Seung Yi?

93
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,079
I said you'd find out soon.

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,079
You were wrong after all.

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
Your acting's sickening.

96
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,800
You're a psychopath, aren't you?

97
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,399
I'm not done yet.

98
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,560
Sung Soo Ji.

99
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
(Pyramid Game, Download the Pyramid Game app.)

100
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,920
(Leak contents, and you'll face the utmost penalty.)

101
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,240
(Pyramid Game)

102
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Sung Soo Ji.

103
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,040
(Episode 5)

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
My gosh.

105
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,078
- Look. - What's that?

106
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,239
- What is that? - Oh, no.

107
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,559
- What's wrong? - Goodness.

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,919
- It's blood. - Did she get cut?

109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,039
- That's bad. - I know.

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Gosh.

111
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,519
What happened?

112
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,839
You.

113
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,680
- Are you okay? - You're bleeding.

114
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Is it okay?

115
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,680
Did you play another silly game?

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,199
There's no need to be surprised.

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,958
A room full of teenage girls...

118
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,279
Mr. Im.

119
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,040
My daughter said the transfer student did something.

120
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,319
- Her? - The transfer student?

121
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,120
Is she a school bully?

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,518
How could they allow a bully here?

123
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,519
Explain it.

124
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,759
Sung Soo Ji.

125
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,079
It's nothing.

126
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,839
Soo Ji hasn't adjusted yet.

127
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,399
It's just a small mistake.

128
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,480
I think we should take care of it ourselves.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,839
Right? Mom.

130
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
Kids...

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
have their own system.

132
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,360
What do you say, Mr. Seo?

133
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,639
Well...

134
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,279
Grade C Sung Soo Ji bullied Grade D Joo Seung Yi,

135
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,920
and Seung Yi tried to take her own life.

136
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,278
Only Grade A or those with Grade A's permission...

137
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,720
can punish Grade F.

138
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,560
That's our tacit rule.

139
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,600
Soo Ji's not Grade A,

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,480
and Seung Yi's not Grade F.

141
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,160
This is something like a disciplinary committee.

142
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,638
If it's a disciplinary committee,

143
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,319
shouldn't we decide on a punishment first?

144
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,759
Is there something you'd like to suggest?

145
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,039
How about...

146
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,799
confiscating Soo Ji's votes for tomorrow?

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,199
All five of them.

148
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,958
In the 15th Pyramid Game,

149
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,680
you don't get to vote.

150
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,360
What happens to us, then?

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,879
Then the Grade D alliance...

152
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,480
It's done for.

153
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,319
Our plan will flop if Soo Ji can't vote.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,120
(Joo Seung Yi)

155
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,638
Let's do something, whether it works or not.

156
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,759
Wait. Before we decide, Joo Seung Yi...

157
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,560
Did I bully you?

158
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,240
- How? - What?

159
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,210
You threatened me.

160
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
I threatened you? With what?

161
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,679
Do you have a reason to feel threatened?

162
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,330
Don't try to get smart.

163
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,599
The fact is that you made Seung Yi want to die.

164
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,639
I'm not so sure.

165
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,720
I have no memory of bullying or threatening her.

166
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,330
Unless there's proof,

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,960
- I don't accept it. - You've gotten spunky.

168
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,960
- You almost killed... - You made others want to die too.

169
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,090
How about we decide by a show of hands?

170
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,639
Class Five belongs to all 25 of us,

171
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,159
and this is everyone's game.

172
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,359
You seem to have the wrong idea.

173
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,039
I'm not the one who judges you.

174
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,279
The game does.

175
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,600
This was part of your plan too?

176
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,519
I even gave you a hint.

177
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,519
Are they voting with a show of hands?

178
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,720
- How democratic. - I approve.

179
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,519
I think our kids...

180
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,919
are handling the problem in a sound, wholesome manner.

181
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,039
Without violence.

182
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,720
That doesn't look violent to you?

183
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,090
To me, it looks like a public execution.

184
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Ms. Yoon.

185
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,679
Is it right for us adults to just watch as this goes on?

186
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,559
If you open this door now,

187
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,159
that girl becomes my prey.

188
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
That's 21 votes.

189
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,879
Sung Soo Ji can't vote at the next Pyramid Game.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,879
She just loses her votes?

191
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,799
But she can receive them?

192
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,679
Isn't that confusing?

193
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,159
Her punishment here isn't a guaranteed Grade F.

194
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,799
She can't vote, but she can receive votes.

195
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,720
Any more questions?

196
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,480
I'm screwed.

197
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
But Baek Ha Rin.

198
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,240
I'm not done yet either.

199
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,399
Have you lost your mind, Ms. Yoon?

200
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,960
How dare a temporary teacher step out of line like that?

201
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,679
No abusive language, please.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,449
I believe Year 2 Class 5's problem...

203
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,840
is ongoing because the school tacitly approves of it.

204
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,839
The students there and the location...

205
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
That mouth!

206
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,559
Keep it shut.

207
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,879
Don't you want your contract to be extended?

208
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,039
It's over, isn't it?

209
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,519
I'll block you.

210
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,199
Don't you dare blackmail me.

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,600
Or I'll do what Seung Yi did.

212
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,360
Crazy witch.

213
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,119
Myoung Ja Eun.

214
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Sorry.

215
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
What?

216
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,279
- For what? - For thinking you were wrong.

217
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,799
Hey.

218
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,918
This was Baek Ha Rin's plan from start to finish.

219
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't you agree?

220
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,879
Only you do.

221
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,360
What I'd do, who I'd approach...

222
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,080
Ha Rin knew everything.

223
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,679
It's not impossible, but somehow...

224
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,159
And she said she wasn't done yet.

225
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,759
Your dad.

226
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,120
You said he wouldn't come.

227
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,279
That was Ha Rin too.

228
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360

(Teacher: Im Ju Hyung)

230
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,840
How about we play a game?

231
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,000
("The Pyramid" by William Golding)

232
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,320
The novel we'll discuss today...

233
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,440
is "The Pyramid," a novel about British class and hierarchy.

234
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,559
Since our parents are present,

235
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,039
I'd like them to participate too.

The adults...

238
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,519
will play the game?

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,359
Your app is a one-off version,

240
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,440
and access will be blocked after one hour.

241
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,360
Thanks, Ye Won.

242
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,039
What are you up to, Ha Rin?

243
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,879
To put it simply,

244
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,759
it's a popularity vote of our own.

245
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,080
Here are all 25 students.

246
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,279
You can pick and vote for five.

247
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,120
Here are the details for you to read and follow.

248
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
The number of votes...

249
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,918
will place you in Grades from A to F and...

250
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,919
Ha Rin.

251
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,159
I don't think this is a good idea.

252
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,200
Ha Rin. I'm sorry.

253
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,799
Shall we finish the presentation next time?

254
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,079
I apologize. I wasn't her mentor on this project,

255
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,200
so I wasn't aware of the direction she'd take...

256
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Mother.

257
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,960
What brings you here?

258
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,080
- It's the chairwoman. - Isn't that the chairwoman?

259
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,799
Of Baekyeon Group.

260
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,519
- My gosh. - Really?

261
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,440
She actually came.

262
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,279
I'll continue.

263
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,639
Grade F...

264
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,200
is the lowest of all Grades.

265
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,919
According to the novel, they're lowlifes.

266
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,798
Excuse me.

267
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,559
Why should we...

268
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,440
play this game?

269
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,679
Mom.

270
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,319
What? Did I say something wrong?

271
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,559
If it's what my granddaughter wants, do it.

272
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,360
Ha Rin must have a plan.

273
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,879
Why don't you participate willingly and happily?

274
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,559

275
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,360

281
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,439
(2 votes, 1 vote)

282
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,518

Sung Soo Ji.

284
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,399
What do you say, sir?

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,239
We just had a popularity vote,

286
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,480
we were graded into a pyramid,

287
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,120
and Soo Ji is Grade F.

288
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,200
Hierarchies exist everywhere.

289
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,319
In the military, in society,

290
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
and...

291
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,039
in schools.

292
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,719
You'll realize when you grow up...

293
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,279
that school is a smaller version of society.

294
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,638
We fall into a certain class in society,

295
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,320
and that's upheld by order and agreements.

296
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,558
- What's he saying? - You all...

297
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,559
He's such a boomer.

298
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,678
- I see where she got it from. - I can't stand it.

299
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,720
Neither can I.

300
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,639
It's order?

301
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,200
Even if it corners Grade F enough that they want to die?

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,360
Would you still say that?

303
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,960
That it's order?

304
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,559
- What do you mean? - To someone,

305
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,720
that life could be hell.

306
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,518
It's just an example.

307
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,639
Who are you talking about?

308
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,639
A game's a game and the results are results.

309
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,559
We have our Grade A to Grade F.

310
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,159
That won't change.

311
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Will it, sir?

312
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,039
Right.

313
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,879
- It won't. - That's what your dad thinks.

314
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,639
What will you do, Soo Ji?

315
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,440
Is this the preview?

316
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,200
The show you got Seung Yi to put on by hurting herself.

317
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,170
Was that your warning that as the public enemy,

318
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,680
I could go back to Grade F?

319
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,519
That I should bow to you if I don't want that?

320
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,920
Did you plan this far?

321
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,170
Then...

322
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,410
I'll just smash the pyramid.

323
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,839
Your daughter has a great spirit.

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,170
I'd like you to hand her over to Baekyeon Group.

325
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,440
I happen to be the chairwoman there.

326
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,680
Act appropriately.

327
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,920
I trust you will.

328
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,890
Why did you come here today?

329
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,200
You don't come for no reason.

330
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,038
If I'd known Grandma would come,

331
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,319
I'd have called my parents too.

332
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,558
I heard you recommended Yu Rim...

333
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,799
for a Baekyeon scholarship.

334
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,559
How could you? I'm hurt.

335
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,919
You exchanged signals just with Da Yeon earlier...

336
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,170
and didn't tell me a thing.

337
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,279
I'm disappointed.

338
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,559
Woo Yi.

339
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,679
Shouldn't you go home?

340
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,889
Can I ride with you?

341
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,359
- If you drop me off... - Bye.

342
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,519
Soo Ji was planning to gather the Grade D girls.

343
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,559
Yoon Ye Won, Joo Seung Yi, Ra Hae Jun.

344
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Who do you think gave me the hint?

345
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,650
I don't know.

346
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,359
You used to be cute.

347
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,079
(Class Motto: Everyone's happiness, everyone's class)

348
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,759
It was refreshing.

349
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,559
You were just like Ha Rin, though.

350
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,719
If I'd refused the offer from earlier,

351
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,170
would you have blackmailed me into getting in trouble?

352
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Not really.

353
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,599
I never blackmailed anyone.

354
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,680
You just assumed I did,

355
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,200
and I used that.

356
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,960
I don't care about your friendship or love.

357
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,519
If you want to keep it a secret, tell Sim Eun Jung to be careful.

358
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,170
You won't let it show, then?

359
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Why not?

360
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,480
What could be more fun than that?

361
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,559
It's not as big a deal as the fact that Ha Rin is a psycho.

362
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,680
Are you serious?

363
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,119
I'm not like Ha Rin.

364
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,839
(Convenience Store)

365
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:49,410
Forget about it.

366
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,319
The three of us can vote for you...

367
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,960
so that she's no longer Grade F.

368
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,359
On that note, Soo Ji will pay.

369
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,959
Soo Ji will pay.

370
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,409
Cup tteokbokki with a fishcake bar.

371
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,200
Oh, and a baked egg.

372
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,169
That's 21 votes.

373
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,799
Sung Soo Ji can't vote at the next Pyramid Game.

374
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,559
What's that look of distrust for?

375
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,680
Ja Eun, she doesn't trust me.

376
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,170
Hit her for me so it hurts.

377
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,079
I have to go.

378
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,039
My stomach hurts.

379
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
It's not diarrhea. Is it stress-related?

380
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Thank you.

381
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,118
It's expired stuff.

382
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,170
Not today.

383
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,359
What's going on?

384
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,650
You know the guy?

385
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,410
Wait.

386
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,170
Wasn't that Cho Woo Ri's brother?

387
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,650
How did you know right away?

388
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
You didn't know for a while?

389
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,799
Cup tteokbokki, a baked egg, and a fishcake bar?

390
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,440
And chocolate milk.

391
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,400
What are you doing?

392
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,039
Are you her bodyguard?

393
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
What's wrong, Myoung Ja Eun?

394
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,480
It's all your fault.

395
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,519
What...

396
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,799
What did I do to you?

397
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
What did I do?

398
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,839
Oh, no.

399
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,200
(Cho Woo Ri)

400
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,039
It wasn't me.

401
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,920
(Year 2 Class 5, Cho Woo Ri)

402
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,440
What did you do to my sister?

403
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,680
The Grade D alliance flopped?

404
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:14,880
What about the camera on the blackboard?

405
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,240
It's still there.

406
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,319
Though we don't have anything incriminating.

407
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,200
What? A camera?

408
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,599
It's my Plan B.

409
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,399
I want people outside the classroom to hear about the game.

410
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,559
No. If you end up like Cho Woo Ri...

411
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
That's a no.

412
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:35,799
We can't let that happen.

413
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,680
You and I, maybe,

414
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,518
but Ji Ae won't last much longer.

415
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,519
She'll get messed up.

416
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Ji Ae...

417
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:44,999
We need to gather more people.

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,399
Not by blackmail...

419
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,160
but like how you convinced Jae Hyung.

420
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,799
We won't follow Ha Rin's method.

421
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,440
We'll follow yours, Ja Eun.

422
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,439
Why did you come all the way here?

423
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Well...

424
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,559
I came to see how you were doing.

425
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
Here.

426
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,480
I got it from a pretty big pharmacy I saw on the way.

427
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,559
(Medicine)

428
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,039
Do you want to sit?

429
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,599
I haven't sat in...

430
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,319
a swing like this in a while.

431
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm fine.

432
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,959
I don't think Soo Ji's cold.

433
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,039
I think she's cool-headed.

434
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,758
That's why she can see...

435
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,880
everyone's strengths and weaknesses as is.

436
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,279
So don't...

437
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,319
get the wrong idea about her.

438
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,039
We're...

439
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,680
all friends, aren't we?

440
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,598
Sung Soo Ji can't vote at the next Pyramid Game.

441
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,240
We need to gather more people.

442
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,719
Not by blackmail...

443
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,279
but like how you convinced Jae Hyung.

444
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,720
We won't follow Ha Rin's method. We'll follow yours, Ja Eun.

445
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,200
(Notice: Sung Soo Ji can't vote in the 15th Game)

446
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,240
- Thanks. - Bye.

447
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,599
Shouldn't you go home?

448
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,839
I'm not in the mood to walk home.

449
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,680
I can make you run in less than a minute.

450
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,318
The next stop is the Bongpo store.

451
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,880
You can get it back if you get there in five minutes.

452
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Where are you going?

453
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,920
To the police station.

454
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,599
It's right next to the Bongpo store.

455
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,319
There are too many psychopaths.

456
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Darn you.

457
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,799
(New message from Joo Seung Yi)

458
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,359
At tomorrow's game, I'll make Ja Eun Grade F.

459
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
(At tomorrow's game, I'll make Ja Eun Grade F.)

460
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,559
- You're off work? - Yes.

461
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,720
- See you. - Take care.

462
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,519
It's easier to walk after a run.

463
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,919
Go on home. Bye.

464
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I think...

465
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,319
I found a way.

466
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,240
(You are on camera. Illegal Dumping will be reported.)

467
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,240
(Schedule change: 2nd period Math 2 and 4th period PE)

468
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,519
I'm not like Ha Rin.

469
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:40,880
See you tomorrow.

470
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,799
A plan to smash the pyramid.

471
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,039
Do you really have one?

472
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,559
You got the adults to play the game during open class.

473
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,480
Isn't that considered leaking the game contents?

474
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,559
Am I wrong?

475
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
No?

476
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
She's Grade A.

477
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:06,599
We must break Ha Rin's ruler image.

478
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,518
Don't worry.

479
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,640
She won't think of coming after you over this.

480
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,119
Even she knows the kind of presence...

481
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
you have in class.

482
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
I just need you...

483
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,759
to do as I ask.

484
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,839
What are you up to, Ye Lim?

485
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,480
Why are you acting fishy?

486
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
I don't know.

487
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,240
What do you all think?

488
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,039
Does anyone think I leaked the contents of the game?

489
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,559
Or was anyone questioned by their parents?

490
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
That's a no, Ye Lim.

491
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,719
Come on.

492
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
Who'd answer if you ask like that?

493
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,559
They'd be too scared to.

494
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,559
How about a secret handwritten vote?

495
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,759
Can you guarantee it'll be anonymous?

496
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,799
Then I'm in.

497
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,719
Jung Yeon Doo. What about you?

498
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm up for anything Ye Lim says.

499
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,880
Can we skip morning study hall?

500
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes.

501
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,200
Hey, don't go too far.

502
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,160
Yes. Stop it, Ye Lim.

503
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,278
If Soo Ji lost the right to vote for breaking the rule,

504
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,440
shouldn't that same rule be applied to Ha Rin?

505
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,960
Even if she's Grade A.

506
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,279
As you said, this is everyone's game.

507
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
As you said, this is everyone's game.

508
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,480
Punishments should be fair.

509
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,119
If you broke the rule too.

510
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,039
Yes.

511
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,000
It is everyone's game.

512
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,119
What happens to the Grade?

513
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,039
What now?

514
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,799
I don't know.

515
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,039
(Yes 13, No 11)

516
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,920
- No way. - Is this for real?

517
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,319
I don't believe this.

518
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,880
- Did you vote too? - Yes.

519
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,279
So? What then?

520
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,200
I'll change my request that you go down to Grade F.

521
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,759
You're to become Grade A this time.

522
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,599
Ja Eun, Ji Ae, and Jae Hyung's vote will be enough to get you there.

523
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,558
If there's anyone in our class...

524
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,199
who can gather enough supporters as Ha Rin,

525
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
it's you.

526
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,519
Our class idol.

527
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Ha Rin.

528
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,759
(Notice: Sung Soo Ji and Baek Ha Rin can't vote in the 15th Game)

529
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,279
On your marks.

530
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Darn it.

531
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,359
On your marks.

532
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,880
Vote for Ye Lim later, not me.

533
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,518
I told Ji Ae and Jae Hyung already.

534
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,400
- What? Why? - Look straight ahead.

535
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,319
I thought of another plan.

536
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,400
I tried running once already.

537
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,319
(Study hall)

538
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,359
Hey. What's this?

539
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,119
Ye Lim.

540
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,160
Isn't this about you?

541
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,920
(Foundation Chair Lobbies Agency to Debut Daughter)

542
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
What is this?

543
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,359
(Foundation Chair Lobbies Agency to Debut Daughter)

544
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,078
(Rich Entrepreneur Builds Gym for Daughter’s School?)

545
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,279
What now?

546
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,160
Ye Lim hates stuff like this more than anything.

547
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,559
Who was it?

548
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,799
Only we know about the gym.

549
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Darn it. Who told the press?

550
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,319
I went to school with Im Ye Lim.

551
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,200
She bragged about being rich.

552
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,720
Who was it? Fess up.

553
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Ye Lim's sidekick is angry.

554
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,759
If that's friendship, I have no friends.

555
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,680
- Right? - What?

556
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,920
Wasn't it you? My gosh.

557
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,480
You're such a tattle.

558
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,240
- Sim Eun Jung! - What the...

559
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,519
Sim Eun Jung, you crazy...

560
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Are you insane?

561
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,640
- Don't do it. - Stop.

562
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,799
Don't!

563
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,358
- Do something! - Stop it.

564
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,119
- Stop them! - Don't do this.

565
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,960
Stop!

566
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,400
What are you doing?

567
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,359
Why would you hit a friend?

568
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,240
Ja Eun has changed.

569
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,039
I want to ruin her now.

570
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Piss off.

571
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,240
You won't?

572
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,759
This photo of Ye Lim.

573
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,480
Isn't it a bit weird?

574
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,720
I think it was taken here.

575
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,440
As if from a hidden camera.

576
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,359
What?

577
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Is it this angle?

578
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,880
A hidden camera?

579
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,039
Where the heck is it?

580
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,079
Stop it.

581
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,159
Stop it, Eun Jung!

582
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,440
Someone filmed you in secret!

583
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,159
This photo.

584
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,329
(Who is trainee L? Secret recordings)

585
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,079
(An agency called even before she debuted.)

586
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,119
(Girl group trainee L anti account)

587
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,159
(Girl group trainee L anti account)

588
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,558
(Joo Seung Yi's personal details)

589
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,289
The owner of this secret account is Joo Seung Yi.

590
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,078
No one would believe me...

591
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,519
even if I exposed Joo Seung Yi as a cyber wrecker now.

592
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,199
That.

593
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,159
Was that always there?

594
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,559
Apologize to Ji Young first.

595
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,769
If anyone abuses my friend,

596
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,880
I won't forgive them. Not even you.

597
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,400
Apologize.

598
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,239
Or we're done being friends.

599
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Sorry.

600
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,919
But if it really is you, Park Ji Young...

601
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,159
Won't the camera have a memory card?

602
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,119
That should show who set it up.

603
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,960
And who broke the game rules this time.

604
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:36,159
What's the rule? Do Ah?

605
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,440
If you leak the contents of the Pyramid Game,

606
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,639
you will face a hardcore penalty.

607
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,840
That's mine.

608
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,639
It's yours?

609
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,440
- This camera? - Yes.

610
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
No way.

611
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,039
There's something definitely wrong with your class.

612
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,400
And I wanted to find out what it was.

613
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,329
I don't believe you.

614
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,559
What?

615
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,519
Believe me.

616
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,519
It's mine.

617
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:43,329
She set up a hidden camera in a classroom to catch a bully?

618
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,039
Who would believe that?

619
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
She knows no fear.

620
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,159
Isn't that enough to end her teaching career?

621
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,599
A hidden camera was a bit much.

622
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,329
Not just a bit much.

623
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,559
It's serious.

624
00:36:57,769 --> 00:36:58,840
What a mess.

625
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,360
Will you really say you don't know anything?

626
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,199
It's the end of my career?

627
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,289
Yes, it is.

628
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,769
I'm too embarrassed to teach.

629
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,079
My gosh.

630
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,519
I'm so scared.

631
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:22,880
Let's get back to work.

632
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Yes, let's do that.

633
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,199
Hey.

634
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,079
(Final performance assessment)

635
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,519
(Copy to USB flash drive)

636
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,598
I was shocked about that,

637
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,679
but I'm more shocked about Ye Lim and Eun Jung.

638
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,159
"Someone filmed you in secret!"

639
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,678
I could tell it was an act.

640
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,199
- Yes. - It's a close call for me,

641
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,639
- but I'm definitely sure about her. - I know.

642
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,329
- Don't you hate her? - Yes.

643
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,920
Will you vote for Eun Jung later?

644
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,719
What should we do? Should we or not?

645
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,329
The camera. It wasn't the teacher's, was it?

646
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,559
It was Soo Ji, right?

647
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,360
It's over now since she got caught.

648
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,440
Sorry. Did I hit you where it hurt?

649
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:19,639
Did you three know about the camera?

650
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,599
Where's Soo Ji at a time like this?

651
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,719
I wasn't any help at all.

652
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,880
If it's about Year 2 Class 5's school violence committee again,

653
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,289
bring me proof first.

654
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,239
I heard this was shared two years ago in July.

655
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,840
How was Year 1 Class 5 set up...

656
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,119
before the students were even enrolled?

657
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,079
Was it Baek Ha Rin's influence?

658
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,239
Watch what you say, Ms. Yoon.

659
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,518
What do you take our school for?

660
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,038
There's talk that Baek Ha Rin...

661
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,000
comes to your office as if it's hers.

662
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,769
If you refuse to answer,

663
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,360
I'll call the Office of Education.

664
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,559
Ms. Yoon. The chair of the board wants to see you.

665
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,809
I heard you wanted to...

666
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
You...

667
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,679
asked to see me?

668
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,559
It's a Baekyeon Foundation school.

669
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,599
I have a question.

670
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,159
Will you sit?

671
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Or you can stand.

672
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Baek Ha Rin.

673
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,679
What do you value?

674
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,079
Money? Your job?

675
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,329
Family?

676
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,719
Your social standing?

677
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,880
That's what makes most adults move.

678
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,289
Is that a threat?

679
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,329
Your classes are boring.

680
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,199
Study harder...

681
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:24,719
and make things more interesting.

682
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,960
You need to sign a new contract.

683
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,679
I'm...

684
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,119
darn embarrassed to be called an adult.

685
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,559
Should a teacher talk like that?

686
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:47,329
I don't know.

687
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,719
You know the camera stunt was a bit much, don't you?

688
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,809
What will you do now?

689
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm still thinking.

690
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,519
I'm an embarrassment of an adult, but if you need the help of one...

691
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,079
Call me at any time.

692
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,199
Thank you.

693
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,639
Sung Soo Ji.

694
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,719
Don't lose.

695
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,440
You don't have to yet.

696
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,639
To you, Baek Ha Rin...

697
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,559
is just a classmate who's your age.

698
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,289
Should we report Ms. Yoon?

699
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:14,558
Or get the principal to call...

700
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,158
the Office of Education so she has to quit...

701
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,159
How stupid.

702
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,329
Is that why your dad beats you?

703
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,289
Wait.

704
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,119
No.

705
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,559
You killed your brother while he was in your mom's belly.

706
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,159
Is that when he started beating you?

707
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,480
The others would laugh at you if they knew.

708
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,400
That at home, you're Grade F.

709
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,199
That's a bit too harsh.

710
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,480
Baek Ha Rin.

711
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:46,639
Is it?

712
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,639
So what?

713
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,960
Baek Ha Rin knew.

714
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,329
I think it was taken here.

715
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,809
As if from a hidden camera.

716
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,440
She knew there was a camera in the classroom.

717
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,639
Only Myoung Ja Eun and I knew.

718
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,198
What is this about?

719
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,639
The fifth period starts soon.

720
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,769
Did you mention the camera?

721
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,679
To Pyo Ji Ae.

722
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,159
It was you, wasn't it?

723
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,199
You told Ha Rin.

724
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,960
What... Why would Ji Ae...

725
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,328
When Ha Rin mentioned the camera,

726
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,919
only Ji Ae and Seung Yi didn't look surprised.

727
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,880
This photo of Ye Lim. Isn't it a bit weird?

728
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,960
I think it was taken here.

729
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,840
As if from a hidden camera.

730
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,119
Only someone who knew the camera was there...

731
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,239
and that Ha Rin knew too wouldn't be surprised.

732
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,800
- I... - Is that true?

733
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Why?

734
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,960
Why did you tell?

735
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,919
Can you really trust her?

736
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,519
You bet. Why can't I?

737
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,959
If we Grade Ds stick together,

738
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,000
we can go up...

739
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,480
Are you okay, Ji Ae?

740
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,199
A better grade?

741
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,719
Then our ranking...

742
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,079
There's a camera in our classroom.

743
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,599
Soo Ji said you wouldn't last much longer.

744
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Ji Ae.

745
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:37,519
No.

746
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,439
I'm not curious.

747
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,480
I don't want to know either.

748
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Get out.

749
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,519
And...

750
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:49,599
don't come here again.

751
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,679
Sorry.

752
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,719
I'm sorry.

753
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Sorry.

754
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:04,519
I'm sorry.

755
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,839
Hello.

756
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,360
- Hi. - You made it.

757
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,799
If it goes to plan, you and Ja Eun...

758
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,400
- Is that good? Let's see. - Yes.

759
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,840
- Hey, you won't listen? - What's yours?

760
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
Gosh.

761
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,039
So we'll...

762
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,280
Sung Soo Ji, you troublemaker!

763
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,679
- Me? - Don't fight. I'll clean up.

764
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,840
We're such a mess.

765
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,719
Nothing has changed.

766
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,920
Something has changed. You.

767
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Ji Ae...

768
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,840
I know. She couldn't trust us.

769
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:29,440
I don't think that's it.

770
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:32,840
She was friends with Seung Yi longer than she was with us.

771
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,519
That's why she wavered.

772
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:39,079
You're so unlike me.

773
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,119
I'm not strong like you.

774
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,239
You told me in PE not to vote for you.

775
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,159
Was it so you'd be Grade F and go on camera?

776
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:52,880
How did you know that?

777
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,519
I can guess a bit how you work now.

778
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,880
I couldn't do such a thing.

779
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,599
I'd be too scared.

780
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,280
Now that there's no camera, we can forget that plan, right?

781
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,360
This has a recording app.

782
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:11,840
Woo Ri's brother hid it for me.

783
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,800
I came this far.

784
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,880
I won't stop with Plan B.

785
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,880
Let's go back to the classroom.

786
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,078
Let's make something clear. In this Pyramid Game,

787
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:50,079
Baek Ha Rin and Sung Soo Ji can't vote for anyone.

788
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,360
Keep that in mind as you vote.

789
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,440
The 15th Pyramid Game.

790
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Let's begin.

Why am I Grade B?

799
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,199
Koo Seol Ha, did you vote for me?

Who was it?

804
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:38,519

- Did you tell Ko... - Stop it!

819
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:39,440
Are you a stalker?

820
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,039
Will you stop it?

821
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,400
You're scaring me.

822
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:09,039
Okay!

823
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,840
Let's do this! Break the record!

824
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,199
Keep going, girls!

825
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,639

You heard from Soo Ji, right?

828

She told us not to vote for her.

829
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,598
(Let's vote for Soo Ji.)

830
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:27,920
Let's vote for Soo Ji.

831
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,519
The situation has changed.

832
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:31,599
Yes.

833
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,119
We'll vote for you,

834
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,920
even if you say we're pretending to be nice.

835
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:37,119
We decided to.

836
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,280
Good for you.

837
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,198
- What? - I wanted to be Grade F...

838
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,399
only when there was a camera.

839
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,760
A recording isn't as captivating as a video.

840
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,559
It's not worth being Grade F for.

841
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,599
So I'll go for Plan C.

842
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:53,639
Ye Lim will vote for us.

843
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,598
Jae Hyung isn't enough.

844
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:56,599
Ji Ae...

845
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,159
We must consider her gone.

846
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,679
Also, if I'm right,

847
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:03,480
Ha Rin's goal is you.

848
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,440
She wants to make you Grade F.

849
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,119
And to stop that for now...

850
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,840
Other than you, me, and Jae Hyung,

851
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,639
we need someone trustworthy.

852
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,039
That's Ye Lim?

853
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,480
I told you to watch out for Sim Eun Jung.

854
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:17,400
Keep your distance for a while.

855
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,480
How?

856
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:21,039
Talk to your other friends.

857
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:22,920
Say Eun Jung needs to fall a few grades.

858
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,360
So no one will connect you to today's incident or suspect you.

859
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:28,360
That's best for Eun Jung too.

860
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
And?

861
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:31,480
As I said, the others will vote for you.

862
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:34,199
I want you to vote for me, Ja Eun, and Ji Ae.

863
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,079
Let's get rid of Grade F.

864
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,159
I...

865
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,840
lost?

866
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,920
To you, Sung Soo Ji?

867
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,960
Now...

868
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,599
we begin.

869
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,039
It was a mistake.

870
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,480
Letting you befriend Sung Soo Ji.

871
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,719
Can we stop this, Ha Rin?

872
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,719
Leave them alone.

873
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,999
The more you do this...

874
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,519
Why did you do that to me then?

875
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,920
You did it to me too.

876
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,480
I bet you wondered...

877
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:31,000
why you were Grade F.

878
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:34,599
Sung Soo Ji.

879
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:41,360
You caught on fast.

880
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,678
You didn't know, did you?

881
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:43,960
Come on.

882
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,559
It was because of Ja Eun.

883
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,880
The reason you were Grade F.

884
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,960
I was Grade F because of Myoung Ja Eun?

885
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,800
Everything I suffered...

886
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:00,199
was because of her?

887
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,559
Don't be stupid. It's on you, not her.

888
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,599
Ra Hae Jun, Joo Seung Yi, Pyo Ji Ae, me, and Myoung Ja Eun.

889
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:11,519
We're all from ordinary backgrounds, and we got stuck here anyway.

890
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,639
It's because we have weaknesses, and you can manipulate us.

891
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,840
What's Myoung Ja Eun's weakness?

892
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,880
I was curious, but not anymore.

893
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,760
I don't know what crazy drama you had with her,

894
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:24,559
but I caught on.

895
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:27,119
Baek Ha Rin wants Myoung Ja Eun...

896
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,679
to be Grade F forever.

897
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,079
- What if I do? - You answer, Ja Eun.

898
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,840
Do you want to be Grade F forever?

899
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,559
No.

900
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,519
I don't want to.
