00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,559
What's she doing?

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,829
My gosh.

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,899
What did I do wrong?

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,469
- What did I... - Darn it.

6
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,109
Why is she being so scary?

7
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:36,409
Is it our fault she's an outcast?

8
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:37,640
Why take it out on us?

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,210
- Psycho. - Should we suffer instead?

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,450
Is she crazy?

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,810
- What is she doing? - What is she...

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,009
- Shouldn't we stop her? - Is she really...

13
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,049
Stop her.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,880
- Do something. - I'm scared.

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,649
- Try stopping her. - How?

16
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,020
- I'm scared. - What is she doing?

17
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,460
What are you doing?

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,229
Stop it.

19
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,000
You.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
It's all your fault.

21
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,579
What did I do to upset you?

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,750
Darn you!

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,280

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,449
Hurry.

33
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,659
I couldn't even eat breakfast.

one, stop.

You're first.

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,159
- Number one. - Everyone from here...

You don't even have a name tag?

41

Year, class, name.

42
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,639
I'm a transfer student.

43
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:50,509
So what?

44
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,439
Can a transfer student be late?

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,979
My homeroom teacher told me to come by 8:10am.

46
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,250
That I'd feel awkward if I came early on my first day.

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,919
It's a lie.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,819
Sorry. I'll be on time from now on.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,759
Go ahead.

50
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,060
- You, girls. - I'm so darn jealous.

51
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,560
I should've been transferred today.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,969

Here are your name tags.

68

Lose them and you must buy new ones.

69
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,879
Okay.

70
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,520
We changed the student number system starting this semester.

71
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,789
It's in alphabetical order, and you're number 11.

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,830
You're from Jecheon?

73
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,560
There's a famous place there.

74
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,730
- Cheongpungho Lake? - Yes.

75
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,529
The Oksunbong Suspension Bridge is famous too.

76
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,139
There's a great noodle place in the train station.

77
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,839
You should eat there if you're in Jecheon.

78
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,769
Even the locals keep going back.

79
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,069
You're quite the marketer.

80
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,680
Do you have shares in the place?

81
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,079
What?

82
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,079
Class Five's new student?

83
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,980
I guess so?

84
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,720
Let's go.

85
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,889
It's a long walk.

86
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,519
Our classroom is in the annex.

87
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,540
It's not at all like the main building, is it?

88
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,170
It was built last year.

89
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,379
Just so you know, our classroom's the only one here.

90
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,279
- It's just Year 2 Class 5? - Yes.

91
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:12,319
There wasn't enough room in the main building.

92
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,850
The girls are lucky enough to study in a new classroom...

93
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,160
while the poor teacher is forced...

94
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,189
to exercise like a bug, day in and day out.

95
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,459
Hey, was that the right slang?

96
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:24,600
The bug term.

97
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:25,930
What?

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,100
Never mind.

99
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:28,569
I heard you switched schools a lot.

100
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,170
Your father's a career soldier?

101
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,040
Yes.

102
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,139
Say hello.

103
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,540
She's our transfer student.

104
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,879
She was away from Seoul for a while,

105
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,509
- so help her settle in. - I'm sick of transferring.

106
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,579
Hi. I'm from Seoul.

107
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,050
I'm Sung Soo Ji. Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,120
Let's be friends.

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,220
Applause.

110
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,959
Hello. My name is...

111
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,060
Sung Soo Ji. Nice to meet you.

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
Settling into a new class is a talent of mine.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,199
I'm Sung Soo Ji.

114
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,399
I've been to many schools, but it's my first girls' high.

115
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Let's be friends.

116
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,009
What's this? What's wrong with them?

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,519
Do you see the empty seat? That's yours.

118
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,120
Okay.

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,389
Look out for the new transfer student.

120
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,319
What kind of atmosphere is this?

121
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,290
Whatever. I just have to avoid two types.

122
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,129
- The losers. - There will be an inspection.

123
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,930
Who's on weekly duty?

124
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,129
Hi.

125
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,899
And the bullies.

126
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,839
Who's sleeping?

127
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,939
Wake her up.

128
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,379
The second notice is...

129
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,379
Pinkeye is going around.

130
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,579
Before and after meals and going to the toilet,

131
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,680
be sure to wash your hands, okay?

132
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,449
- Yes. - Yes.

133
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,449
If you think you have symptoms,

134
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,189
tell the school nurse or me so you can get treated.

135
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,529
The midterm exam's coming up. Study hard.

136
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,600
- Yes. - Yes.

137
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,269
Sorry about that. The teacher...

138
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,339
Don't act like we're friends.

139
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,480
Shoot. I think...

140
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,810
I'm screwed.

141
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,379
- Hello. - Hello.

142
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,509
You're Soo Ji, right?

143
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,050
Where did you transfer from?

144
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,980
From Jecheon in Chungcheong Province.

145
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
Chungcheong Province?

146
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,319
"If you were that busy, you should've come yesterday."

147
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,720
That's how they talk there, right?

148
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,959
In Jecheon,

149
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,490
do you know the Haneul House?

150
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,089
An orphanage in Sinwol-dong.

151
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,259
My grandma took me there a few times to volunteer.

152
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,430
I know the place. My old school was near...

153
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,240
She's the noisiest one here.

154
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,939
I can't stand that witch.

155
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,470
Why are you acting so tough?

156
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,980
You can't even talk to her face.

157
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,610
More like, I refuse to.

158
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,279
Stop your bluff.

159
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:56,680
Soo Ji.

160
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,379
Isn't Ha Rin so beautiful?

161
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,250
I'm not.

162
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,149
Ye Rim's prettier.

163
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,819
She's an idol trainee.

164
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,459
Im Ye Rim.

165
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,230
First period is music in the Music Room.

166
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,139
Move fast so I can lock the doors.

167
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,470
I'll lock you in if you're not out in the next minute.

168
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,209
That's Seo Do Ah, the class president.

169
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,769
The top student in our school.

170
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,110
You get her character, right?

171
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,879
Yes.

172
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,949
Let's go to the Music Room.

173
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,680
(Sung Soo Ji)

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,580
Who's supposed to sing today?

175
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,720
We started from the back of the roster, right?

176
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,289
- Pyo Ji Ae sang. - Ma'am!

177
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,019
I want to hear Im Ye Rim sing.

178
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,419
Let Ye Rim go first!

179
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,259
- Im Ye Rim! - Im Ye Rim!

180
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,659
- No, we can't do that. Be quiet. - Im Ye Rim!

181
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,899
- Im Ye Rim! - Silence!

182
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,799
You lot have no class at all.

183
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,399
Ye Rim, can you sing today?

184
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,210
Ma'am.

185
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,110
I accept song requests.

186
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,649
- Im Ye Rim! - Ye Rim!

187
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:02,649
Ye Rim. Sing "Magic."

188
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,080
- Im Ye Rim! - Im Ye Rim!

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,649
- I love you. - Im Ye Rim!

190
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,220
- Im Ye Rim! - You startled me.

191
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,590
It's you again?

192
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,529
Why are you here now when class started ages ago?

193
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,129
If you want to slack off that bad, why not do that away from school?

194
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,669
How many times has it been?

195
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,470
If you ruin the atmosphere...

196
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,539
Sorry.

197
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,340
- My bad. - Sit down.

198
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,409
When powerful music plays

199
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,610
We fall into the magic hole

200
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,980
Raise your voice and sing along

201
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,049
We are magic

202
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,279
The more you see the more charming we are

203
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,549
- Ye Rim? She's really good. - Awesome, right?

204
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,919
She's in the debut lineup.

205
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,620
She has everything.

206
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,990
Good looks and good grades.

207
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,090
I bet she'll go to a great college.

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,090
Ye Rim, look over here.

209
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,460
Ye Rim, over here!

210
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll tell you my secret

211
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,029
Let's Secret time

212
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,840
Oh, my magic, magic, magic

213
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,340
She's the class idol.

214
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,409
Oh, my gosh

215
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,480
You'll be surprised like that

216
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,149
Magic, magic, magic

217
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,789
You're leaving already?

218
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:20,830
Bye, Soo Ji.

219
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,429
See you tomorrow.

220
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,929
- Take care. - Bye.

221
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,019
Welcome.

222
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,820
How was your first day? Did you feel intimidated?

223
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,929
She's not like you. I bet she made friends already.

224
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,090
I can't lose Soo Ji.

225
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,529
Let's visit her in Seoul next month.

226
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,230
(Jecheon Willow High Year 2 Class 3, Leave chatroom)

227
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,330
(Leave chatroom, Yes)

228
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,820
That'll be 2.1 dollars. Do you need a plastic bag?

229
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,850
No.

230
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,350
Soo Ji, I love your profile pic.

231
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,850
How about tteokbokki after school tomorrow?

232
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,990
Can you handle the spice?

233
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,519
(Sung Soo Ji)

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,929
Deal. Tteokbokki is precious.

235
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,399
School is a microcosm of society.

236
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:43,139
- Hi. - I must figure out...

237
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,440
who will help or hurt me...

238
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,210
and find my place among these many people.

239
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,279
So I don't crash-land...

240
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,179
too high or too low.

241
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,320
Ye Rim, look over here.

242
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,120
Right in the middle, where it's comfy and average.

243
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,490
Did you get that from Zigzag?

244
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,659
I wanted to get it, but it was sold out.

245
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,159
I couldn't find it offline.

246
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,769
(1. Category, 2. Nature, 3. Theme, 4. Characteristics)

247
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,240
I smell cigarettes.

248
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,549
People like her are just harmful.

249
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,179
It's so obvious.

250
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,350
Let's not get involved.

251
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:35,889
How pretty.

252
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,899
- Look. - You're bad at this.

253
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,700
Isn't this Ye Rim?

254
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,600
It's so fascinating. She's practically a celebrity.

255
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,909
She is a celebrity.

256
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,269
- Yes. - She is.

257
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,610
She's not here today?

258
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,279
- Yes. - Does she miss school often?

259
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
It's number four.

260
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,580
The answer to question 15...

261
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,720
is number three, okay?

262
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,419
The answer to question 16 is number 2.

263
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,450
- Nice. - Sorry.

264
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Do you want to borrow it?

265
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,429
You can't handle spices, right?

266
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,269
- I totally can. - Hey, this is nice.

267
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,870
- Is it nice? - Don't touch my food.

268
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,909
Okay.

269
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,580
Where are the students from the other classes?

270
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Do you want this?

271
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,519
- What are you doing? - That's a warning.

272
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
What's up?

273
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,889
Tomorrow's this month's last Thursday, right?

274
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,230
We have HR.

275
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,529
- What do we do then? - HR?

276
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,899
This and that.

277
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,470
I want to try it too.

278
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,899
They look so much alike.

279
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,970
Do you think I'd feel bad?

280
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,250
Oh, no.

281
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,750
Sorry.

282
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,250
Did it hurt, Ja Eun?

283
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,389
Nice!

284
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,289
Here it goes!

285
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Stop it!

286
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,039
My gosh.

287
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,740
What was that about?

288
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,370
You must hate sitting next to her.

289
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,110
Myoung Ja Eun is scary.

290
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,179
I'd hate to sit with her.

291
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,450
This class is weird.

292
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,080
When do we switch the seating?

293
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,450
I want to sit in the middle of the third column.

294
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,190
That went in really hard.

295
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,730
- Can you not squirm? - Throw harder.

296
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,360
That was an insane throw.

297
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,129
Here it goes!

298
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,940
She's tough.

299
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,570
Did you see that?

300
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,309
Yes!

301
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,309
Here I go.

302
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,950
Darn it.

303
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,850
Anyone can tell she's the outcast.

304
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,690
Why do they say they're scared of her?

305
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,299
You jerk. You aren't getting it.

306
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,759
Why are you always ruining our mood?

307
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,240
Do better.

308
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,940
Why are you squirming so much?

309
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,570
Report them.

310
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,110
If you're scared, you can transfer and get away.

311
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,639
Wouldn't anything be better than putting up with it?

312
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,679
It went on for a while, right?

313
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,919
I'm being a nosy person.

314
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,649
I'm running the teacher's errand.

315
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,250
He'll think I did this.

316
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,960
The bullying will be reduced by half...

317
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,970
when we enter our third year.

318
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,870
We'll go to different classes,

319
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,840
and then we'll graduate and...

320
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,370
Sorry.

321
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,379
That's something only a nosy stranger can say.

322
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,779
I'll just give you this.

323
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,059
Those scars. You...

324
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,529
Soo Ji!

325
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,680
You were taking so long, so...

326
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,250
You're not done yet? I'll wait outside.

327
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,250
What day is it?

328
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,349
What?

329
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,519
- Thursday. - Go to the classroom now.

330
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,730
Hurry!

331
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,509
What is she doing?

332
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,950
Can you close the door? We'll begin HR.

333
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,500
Is Myoung Ja Eun absent again?

334
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,940
The transfer student will need an explanation.

335
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,539
On the last Thursday of each month,

336
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,369
we play a game in HR.

337
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,740
A game?

338
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,849
Download the application.

339
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,019
The password for the download is "rank."

340
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,049
It's about ranks?

341
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
(Download Pyramid Game)

342
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,759
We play a game? Out of the blue?

343
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,430
What game is it?

344
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,829
The Pyramid Game.

345
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,309
Simply put, it's a popularity vote.

346
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,710
It's not compulsory.

347
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,609
If you don't want to participate, you can act like Myoung Ja Eun.

348
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,150
"Act like Myoung Ja Eun?"

349
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,210
Why are you acting so tough?

350
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,849
You can't even talk to her face.

351
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,119
More like, I refuse to.

352
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,119
You must hate sitting next to her.

353
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,950
I'd hate to sit with her.

354
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,230
(Pyramid Game)

355
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,329
(Enter security code to download the app.)

356
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:22,829
(Downloading the Pyramid Game app.)

357
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,140
I'll continue to explain.

358
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,269
Depending on the number of votes you get,

359
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:32,140
you'll get a grade between A and D.

360
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Like this.

361
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,259
The grade equals your rank in the class.

362
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,960
Those in Grade A enjoy a few privileges.

363
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,799
One of them is that the lower grades...

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,099
cannot go against them.

365
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,240
You'll figure things out in time.

366
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
And...

367
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,210
There's an outlying Grade F.

368
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,210
Zero votes put you in Grade F,

369
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,819
and Grade F...

370
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,089
is the polar opposite of Grade A.

371
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,460
The polar opposite?

372
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:20,789
They'll pick an outcast...

373
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,730
to mess with her legally?

374
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,599
That means,

375
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,599
someone here has to be the outcast.

376
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,029
What stupid game is this?

377
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,170
This will help you understand.

378
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,140
(The 13th Pyramid Game, Type the name)

379
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,880
Each person gets five votes.

380
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,650
One person can vote for five others.

381
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,779
(Voting complete)

382
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,119
(Calculating voting results)

383
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,490
You can't vote for yourself, of course.

384
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,759
And you can't vote for one person multiple times.

385
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,519
As I said, it's not mandatory.

386
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,559
If you don't want to participate, delete the app and leave.

387
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,829
However, those who are absent for the vote...

388
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,630
don't get any.

389
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,269
It's not mandatory?

390
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,869
Are you kidding me?

391
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,450
Then the 13th Pyramid Game...

392
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,420
will begin.

393
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,950
I think Ji Young will vote for me.

394
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,150
And Sung A...

395
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,980
Let's not hope for much.

396
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,119
One vote? Two if I'm lucky.

397
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,390
I feel bad for Ja Eun, but Grade F...

398
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,259
It'll be you again.

399
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,759
(Park Ji Young)

400
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,410
(Class Motto: Everyone's happiness, everyone's class)

401
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,980
I gave you a vote.

402
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:22,380
- Thanks. - I went up a grade.

403
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,480
Look.

404
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm in Grade C now.

405
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,880
Remember your places.

406
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,190
"My..."

407
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,690
"grade..."

408
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,730
"went up."

409
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,299
- The three of us are Grade D. - Yes.

410
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,660
The three of us are in Grade D.

411
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,769
Sorry, but I'm in Grade C.

412
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,869
Hey, act accordingly.

413
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,910
Zero votes.

414
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,309
I told you last time, right?

415
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,839
- On the second floor of... - I visited them yesterday.

416
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,839
The captain was out, but I met his wife.

417
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,349
I bought a small potted plant with the debit card.

418
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,980
Well done.

419
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,750
Be sure to dress nicely.

420
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,789
Okay.

421
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,559
When will you be reappointed?

422
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,990
I won't move after a month like last time.

423
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,059
Don't worry.

424
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,029
We'll move in about three months, right?

425
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,000
Yes. What about friends?

426
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,829
Do you have a few?

427
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,240
Yes.

428
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,849
It'll be three months at most.

429
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,190
It's okay. Let's hang in until then.

430
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:19,329
Our break is ten minutes from now,

431
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,400
and those in Grade F start with a hazing ritual.

432
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,930
Stand up, Sung Soo Ji.

433
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,869
I must never act like a pushover. Never.

434
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,069
A hazing ritual?

435
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,269
That's childish, Da Yeon.

436
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:31,440
What if I refuse?

437
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,940
- You refuse? - Yes.

438
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,150
If Grade A gives permission,

439
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,349
they can touch you too.

440
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:41,849
Grade A?

441
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,920
That's me.

442
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,160
Hang in there.

443
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,369
Let go.

444
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,589
How about now?

445
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,430
Are you up for the hazing ritual?

446
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,029
If you don't get it, I'll say it in English.

447
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,059
Just shut up...

448
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,029
and do it.

449
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,369
Get lost.

450
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,500
You witch.

451
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,769
There are no marks.

452
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,740
Even after that beating.

453
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,839
She made it so she'd leave no visible marks.

454
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,720
(Pyramid Game, Sung Soo Ji, Login)

455
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,619
(A, B, C, D, 4 grades, Grade F get 0 votes and are outcast.)

456
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,890
(5 votes each, You cannot vote for yourself or the same person twice)

457
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,960
Why are they playing this kind of game?

458
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,859
They seemed weird from the start.

459
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,599
- It's locked. - What?

460
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,859
Who's in there?

461
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,170
I saw...

462
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,369
Sung Soo Ji go inside.

463
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:39,940
What? That psycho.

464
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
Hey. Open the door.

465
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,740
I'll tell Da Yeon.

466
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,609
They created accomplices.

467
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,279
This game...

468
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,450
makes everyone even and guilt-free.

469
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,750
- Don't you hear me? - Grade F?

470
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,750
They're using the game as an excuse.

471
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:56,150
Open this door.

472
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,319
Hey, Grade F!

473
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,589
- This class... - What are you doing?

474
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:01,759
- is crazy. - Grade F!

475
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,960
- Open up. - Open the door.

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,230
(Debate Room)

477
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,809
- Seung Yi. Yesterday... - Yes?

478
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,720
They act as if it's natural that Grade F gets bullied.

479
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,119
Complete and utter indifference.

480
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,890
In this game, that's the order.

481
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,359
Just out of curiosity.

482
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,769
Why do you keep blowing that?

483
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,099
Don't you know about Pavlov's dog?

484
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,170
I'm a trainer.

485
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,069
For you.

486
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,240
Woof.

487
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,809
Whenever I blow this whistle,

488
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:54,009
you'll do your very best as Grade F.

489
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,450
You know?

490
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:57,950
As if.

491
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,460
Guess what this is.

492
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,099
It's a narcotic analgesic.

493
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,829
Sit back down.

494
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,400
I could shove it down your throat.

495
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,509
But I'll give you a chance.

496
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,309
The probability is...

497
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,339
one in three.

498
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:50,630
Three options.

499
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,069
Pick one.

500
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,599
But here's the deal.

501
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,009
Pick a dud and you'll eat it.

502
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,869
What will you do?

503
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,170
How about a bet?

504
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,539
The probability is 50 percent.

505
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,970
Did I just take the pill or not?

506
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,769
- What? - Guess.

507
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,309
If you guess right, I'll vote for you next time.

508
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:34,740
But if you guess wrong,

509
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,420
leave me alone for the rest of the day.

510
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,049
How interesting.

511
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,190
I'll play along.

512
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,890
I bet you...

513
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,829
haven't eaten.

514
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,559
You're betting that I didn't take it?

515
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,630
Wait.

516
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:54,930
Did you take it?

517
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,099
Hey.

518
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,369
You took it.

519
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,240
We have a deal.

520
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,480
Darn it!

521
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,420
(Voice recording)

522
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,599
Sorry.

523
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,259
Go in a bit later.

524
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,599
Da Yeon's looking for the Grade Fs.

525
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,309
Thanks.

526
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,809
Soo Ji.

527
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,309
Hang in there.

528
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,819
It's not your fault.

529
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,640
(General)

530
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,240
Oh, come on. I told you voice recording wasn't allowed.

531
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,079
No evidence collection, please.

532
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,910
You'll be in big trouble if you continue to be like this.

533
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,150
What? A period app?

534
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,220
(Today is Day 1 of menstruation.)

535
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,690
This is funny. It's her day.

536
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:19,109
Does anyone have any pads to lend to Soo Ji?

537
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,740
- No. - No.

538
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:22,109
No one?

539
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,849
What do we do? Poor Soo Ji.

540
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:27,180
Her skirt might turn all red.

541
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,789
What do we do?

542
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,990
These three months won't just fly by.

543
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,059
It's a lot worse...

544
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,190
than I expected.

545
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:40,299
I must find a way out of Grade F.

546
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,980
What if she can't breathe? Can you breathe?

547
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,980
I've seen an article about the domoji.

548
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,309
It's a type of torture from the Joseon Dynasty.

549
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,190
Why didn't you just stay still?

550
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,049
Gosh, she's so strong.

551
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,089
Here's another sheet for you.

552
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,259
- Soo Ji, let me try it once. - Gosh, Sung Soo Ji.

553
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,859
You've become friends with them?

554
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,400
Yes, we're great friends now.

555
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,029
It's great to get along with each other.

556
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,839
So will you let me try it on?

557
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,609
- Come on. - Hey, let's go.

558
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Are you okay?

559
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,619
I must find a way.

560
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,089
Another way besides the security camera footage or voice recording.

561
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,900
You all must be stressed out.

562
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,230
Let's do the F Challenge.

563
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,799
I'll temporarily allow you to touch those in Grade F.

564
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,539
Hey.

565
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:57,609
My gosh!

566
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:01,410
- Gosh. - You must be crazy.

567
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,230
Come this way.

568
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,000
Hurry up.

569
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,500
- Run! - Hurry.

570
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,840
Darn it.

571
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,940
Let's think.

572
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,610
Let's think, Sung Soo Ji.

573
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,050
A way out of Grade F.

574
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,880
Da Yeon's looking for the Grade Fs.

575
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,320
Go to the classroom now.

576
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,420
Hurry!

577
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,190
The ones in Grade F.

578
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,730
Myoung Ja Eun. What happened to her?

579
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,079
(Study Hall)

580
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,119
Right here.

581
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,719
It was as expected. Myoung Ja Eun got zero votes too.

582
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,719
She gave up.

583
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,119
But why did she not participate?

584
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,860
(Grade F: Sung Soo Ji, Myoung Ja Eun, 0 votes)

585
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,559
Pyo Ji Ae got one vote.

586
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,599
Joo Seung Yi got one vote.

587
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,099
(Grade B: Im Ye Rim, 13 votes)

588
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,199
Im Ye Rim.

589
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,210
She's in Grade B? And not in Grade A?

590
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,480
Seo Do Ah and Kim Da Yeon are in Grade A with 15 votes.

591
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,449
I can't believe that Myoung Ja Eun.

592
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,550
There are five minutes left until the bell.

593
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,059
Keep quiet.

594
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,489
- Yes. - Yes.

595
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,070
Thank you for helping me out on that day, Ja Eun.

596
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,739
Don't you remember? It was on Thursday.

597
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,340
You helped me out, right?

598
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,570
You must be really nice.

599
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,409
I want to be good friends with you.

600
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,150
In the next game, I will get out of Grade F with you.

601
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
What's wrong with her?

602
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,320
- She must be insane. - What is she saying?

603
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:57,550
What's wrong with her?

604
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,860
What are you doing in front of everyone? I told you not to...

605
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,829
Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm in Grade F too.

606
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,030
What?

607
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,699
You're in Grade F too?

608
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,099
Why? You had friends around you.

609
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,510
- Was it because of me? - Forget about it.

610
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,239
I'm not lying. There will be a way.

611
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,239
You know Pyo Ji Ae and Joo Seung Yi in Grade D, right?

612
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,809
They are just one vote away from becoming Grade F.

613
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,610
They seemed like best friends.

614
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,619
We can get in between them and use that anxiety.

615
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,079
- What? - First,

616
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,619
we have to vote for each other, no matter what.

617
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:31,619
(Myoung Ja Eun)

618
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,460
Using that, we can approach Pyo Ji Ae and Joo Seung Yi.

619
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,360
Say that out of the 2, only the 1st one can exchange votes with us.

620
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,460
It's that simple. That's all we need to do.

621
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,530
One of them is bound to fall for it.

622
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,099
They both might fall for it.

623
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,139
I'll do it.

624
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,440
I'm first, right?

625
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,210
We can pick one of them then.

626
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,349
The one whom we decide not to choose will become a Grade F instead of us.

627
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,420
I told you it was all about anxiety.

628
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,719
The pressure, anxiety, and fear of getting betrayed first.

629
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,519
It will work 100 percent.

630
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,889
How do we trample on that transfer student?

631
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,789
You all saw her getting close with Myoung Ja Eun, right?

632
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,360
Getting away from Grade F, my foot. She's making it so obvious too.

633
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,400
That fool.

634
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,170
Seo Do Ah. What do you think?

635
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
I'm not sure.

636
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,539
I thought she was smart. Smarter than I thought.

637
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,369
Smart?

638
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,739
So she made it look obvious on purpose?

639
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,949
Right. If Soo Ji wants to earn votes,

640
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:34,280
she can't look like a loser even if she's in Grade F.

641
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,320
You have to have a good image to earn votes.

642
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,460
Darn it! Was that why she acted like that?

643
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,159
That sly fox.

644
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,659
What do we do, Da Yeon? What if she gets Ja Eun on her side?

645
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,059
Woo Yi.

646
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,630
Bang Woo Yi.

647
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,969
Do some thinking if you want to hang out with us.

648
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,170
No matter what Soo Ji says,

649
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,610
do you think Ja Eun will do exactly what she tells her to do?

650
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:59,409
It's Myoung Ja Eun, after all.

651
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,119
- No. - What? Why not?

652
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,090
I won't put someone in Grade F instead of me.

653
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,820
Are you fine with doing that?

654
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,789
What? What is she saying?

655
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,829
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

656
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,690
Please tell me you're acting.

657
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,360
How were all of the others like when you were getting beat up?

658
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,199
They all were glad that it wasn't them getting beat up.

659
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,869
Everyone in the class is crazy, and you're going to be the good guy?

660
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,000
I still won't do it.

661
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,539
People like you...

662
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,670
disgust me.

663
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,820
I can't believe it.

664
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,460
(Report school violence)

665
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,300
I'm on night duty.

666
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,639
Okay.

667
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,010
The lost item.

668
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,750
Is it...

669
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,780
(Sung Soo Ji)

670
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:12,949
It is yours.

671
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,349
That will be 1.1 dollars. Do you need a bag?

672
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
No.

673
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,800
(Light and savory)

674
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:30,730
- Do you want it? - No.

675
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,269
- Hey, let's go eat lunch together. - I don't want to.

676
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,139
Myoung Ja Eun. Do you want to be my partner in English class?

677
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,179
- No. - Gosh.

678
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,110
Gosh, she's a brick wall.

679
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,079
Oh, okay.

680
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,920
She's just mad.

681
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,789
She wasn't just acting like the good guy?

682
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,559
That means you're just stupid.

683
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,230
Why must I take sides with...

684
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,960
someone like Gandhi, Mother Teresa, or Buddha?

685
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,599
This is so frustrating.

686
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,539
What do I do if I can't persuade her until the next game?

687
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,940
Should I move on to Plan B now?

688
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,039
Hey, do you want to...

689
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,280
Are you laughing at me?

690
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,719
If I can't get Myoung Ja Eun, should I find the one behind this?

691
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:28,320
Speaking of which, who started this game?

692
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,360
Kim Da Yeon? Seo Do Ah? Or...

693
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,530
someone else hiding in camouflage?

694
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,710
I just copied it. It's a pyramid.

695
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,480
(1 year ago)

696
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,650
I like it.

697
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,090
What's that?

698
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,489
A pyramid?

699
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,230
No.

700
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,730
It's just a triangle.

701
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,300
Why do you play this game?

702
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,039
What an interesting question.

703
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:14,500
I've never heard of a question like that in this class.

704
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,570
What do you mean why?

705
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,869
You're a trainee.

706
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,909
You might have more to lose...

707
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,579
than what you might earn.

708
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,219
I do have quite a lot to earn.

709
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,250
My secret...

710
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,719
and...

711
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,489
my accomplice.

712
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,260
What is it?

713
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:40,860
Are you missing me already?

714
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,500
- Yes, let's do that. - Goodness.

715
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,940
- Hey! - Ye Rim!

716
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,769
- I'll see you later! - See you later!

717
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,079
- Hey! - Hey!

718
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:58,780
- Hi. - Hi, Ye Rim.

719
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,389
(Baekyeon Girls' High School)

720
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,989
Just like Da Yeon said,

721
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,690
Ja Eun wouldn't dare get in our way.

722
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,860
We'll make sure to teach Soo Ji a lesson.

723
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,090
Don't worry about it.

724
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,960
What should we do after school?

725
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,460
Can I visit your studio?

726
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,409
Myoung Ja Eun, Im Ye Rim, Seo Do Ah,

727
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,650
Kim Da Yeon, Bang Woo Yi, Koo Seol Ha, and so on.

728
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,179
I don't have enough information.

729
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,250
The loser. What was her name?

730
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,659
I have...

731
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,519
something to tell you.

732
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,130
To me?

733
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:49,630
You're Ko Eun Byeol, right?

734
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,199
Come to the Music Room.

735
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,110
I'll be there.

736
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,130
Can everyone turn to page ten?

737
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,929
We're going to practice some conversation, okay?

738
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,800
Today, we're going to talk about our life goals.

739
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,440
I was best friends with Ja Eun.

740
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,909
But I exchanged votes with someone else instead of her.

741
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,239
I was just so scared.

742
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,809
And...

743
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:38,250
Just tell me you betrayed her.

744
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,719
Betrayal.

745
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,750
Was that why Ja Eun had that serious look on her face?

746
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,190
Because it was something she went through?

747
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,960
But why is she telling me this?

748
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,360
You...

749
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:52,190
said that to Ja Eun.

750
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,659
You said you wanted to get out of Grade F with her.

751
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,300
Did you really mean it?

752
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:00,239
You want to feel less guilty through me?

753
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,070
She can come in quite handy.

754
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,980
I do wish for that to happen.

755
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,949
Ja Eun is a nice person too.

756
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,679
But I don't know much since I'm a transfer student.

757
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:15,650
Either about the kids...

758
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,750
or the game.

759
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,760
Because I want to tell people my stories.

760
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,320
You understand?

761
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,389
I need to find out if it was Im Ye Rim or not...

762
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:25,530
who made this crazy game.

763
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:28,630
That will help me make a better plan.

764
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,800
About the girls in our class?

765
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,199
There's nothing much I can say.

766
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,909
First, Ye Rim...

767
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,280
So that name does come up first.

768
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:43,380
Sorry. Keep going.

769
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,550
Im Ye Rim. How is she in this class?

770
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,980
Ye Rim is a social butterfly.

771
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,719
She has everything.

772
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,489
I heard she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

773
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,260
She never boasted about it.

774
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,659
I heard the kids talk about it.

775
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,960
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth?

776
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,869
What about the others? Kim Da Yeon, Seo Do Ah, Bang Woo Yi, Koo Seol Ha.

777
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,030
Oh, there's Baek...

778
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,039
I'll see you. Have a good day.

779
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,610
- Bye. - Bye.

780
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,659
Just wait right there, Soo Ji.

781
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,659
I'll get you something good for you.

782
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:38,630
Open wide. Here comes the protein.

783
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,170
I hope you like it.

784
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,159
Darn it. Where are you spitting it out, you crazy wench?

785
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,260
Hey.

786
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:10,670
What? Where is she looking?

787
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:14,099
Im Ye Rim?

788
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,300
Come on.

789
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,070
A handmark will be reported for school violence.

790
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,269
Don't leave evidence.

791
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:19,840
This is what we can do.

792
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,179
We should put them in her clothes.

793
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:34,590
This song.

794
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,460
You're always copying people, Bang Woo Yi.

795
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,960
You copycat.

796
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,699
Copy?

797
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:51,039
(Chair of the Board, Choi Yi Hwa)

798
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,670
Stop.

799
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,780
I'll do anything you tell me to do. Please stop.

800
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,179
I've heard that song.

801
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:32,750
Who was it?

802
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,380
Whom did I hear that from?

803
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,059
(1 month ago)

804
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:41,059
(Principal Im Soon Ae)

805
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,570
So...

806
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,710
you want the transfer student to be in that class?

807
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,010
Class Five.

808
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,630
Are you okay?

809
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,400
The smell of cigarettes?

810
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:30,510
I smell cigarettes.

811
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,639
Oh, no!

812
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,280
Hang in there.

813
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,449
It's not your fault.

814
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,519
It was you.

815
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,119
(Grade A: Baek Ha Rin, 21 votes)

816
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,639
Baek Ha Rin.

817
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:06,380
(Pyramid Game)
