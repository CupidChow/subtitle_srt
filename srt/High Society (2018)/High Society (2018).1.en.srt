00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,630
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

2
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,505
Before we begin, I have a question.

3
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:03,838
Who here is an economics major?

4
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:07,880
Okay. You all know
I'm a popular professor, right?

5
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,546
There are so many students
who want to take my class,

6
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,005
but I can't accept all of them.

7
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,671
Can you drop the class for them?

8
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:19,296
-Excuse me?
-Drop my class.

9
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,505
-That's a bit...
-I mean,

10
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:24,838
can't you leave for students
with other majors to take this class?

11
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,421
If I drop this class,
I can't enroll again.

12
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,463
Right. Okay.

13
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,921
All right, think about this.

14
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,963
As you see, young musicians and artists

15
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,671
who led the so-called "Hongdae Culture"

16
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:41,130
were chased out of the area
when Hongdae became popular.

17
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,921
They moved to Yeonnam-dong,

18
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:45,630
but had to relocate when the rent rose.

19
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:48,088
When all seemed good at Mangwon-dong,

20
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:50,505
they were chased out again
because of Starbucks.

21
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,630
All right, how do we solve this problem?

22
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:03,171
Hello.

23
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,630
Isn't that too thin?

24
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:08,463
It's 50pi, so it'll be strong enough
for most things.

25
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,296
Do you know how much the projector weighs?

26
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,505
A 20,000 lumens projector
weighs 47 kilograms.

27
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:17,088
With the brackets, it weighs 52 kilograms.

28
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,921
It's how much I weighed this morning.
Should I step on it?

29
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:22,296
We checked that already.

30
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:26,380
Everything will be ready on time, ma'am.

31
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:29,088
The quality is what's important.

32
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:30,255
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,213
Ms. Min, what is this?

34
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,338
It's Zhou Zhang.

35
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,380
Zhou Zhang? I thought we dropped that.

36
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,588
I talked with the director about this.

37
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,505
Isn't that enough, then?

38
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:44,588
Good work.

39
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,088
Director.

40
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,338
DIRECTOR LEE HWA-LAN

41
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:08,838
Wouldn't it be better to just go to court
than give up the ranch?

42
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,296
You can request alimony separately,

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,171
so that would be the best choice, but...

44
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,213
I'm absolutely sure
Yong-seok is cheating on me,

45
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:19,046
but he doesn't have any loose ends.

46
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:24,713
-What is it?
-I saw that a Zhou Zhang came in.

47
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,463
Zhou Zhang is nice. People would go crazy
for one of his pieces.

48
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:29,880
We already chose the pieces
for our new artists exhibition,

49
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,463
and the press announced it already.

50
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:32,880
Really?

51
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:34,880
I guess we'll need a new article.

52
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:38,713
Director, the reopening exhibit is about
showing our center's direction, and--

53
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:41,255
So why is the vice director having issues,

54
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:43,296
when I find the direction fine?

55
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:47,921
Just stick to your job.

56
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:53,463
You must think you'll become the director
as soon as I get promoted to chairwoman,

57
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:55,380
but not anyone can be a director.

58
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,338
Did you know Zhou Zhang was coming in?

59
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,921
I just heard about it a minute ago.

60
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:10,755
The reporter, Ms. Yoon, called.

61
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,838
Are you going to Alt Space tonight?

62
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:17,838
All the artists who worked
on the reopening exhibit are coming.

63
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,005
But the problem is that we can't just

64
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:25,380
suppress the housing market.
That is the pressing problem with reform.

65
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:30,088
Professor, when will
the reform take place?

66
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,796
People are about to get evicted,
and you're saying

67
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,421
they should just wait until then?

68
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,630
Wait a minute.

69
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:39,588
It really is a problem
that rent has risen to unbearable levels.

70
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,213
Well then,

71
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,338
is there any practical way
to resolve this?

72
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,171
Professor Jang?

73
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:49,671
They should pay the rent.

74
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:50,588
What?

75
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,921
They should pay the rent.

76
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:56,463
Are all landlords evil people?

77
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,880
They have a chance to make profit
through real estate,

78
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,921
How can we stop them from raising rent?

79
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:03,546
I get what you're saying, but the thing is

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,796
that in reality,
paying rent is extremely difficult.

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,338
We can help them pay.

82
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,796
How would that be possible?

83
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:14,505
A civic bank could offer low-interest
and long-term loans

84
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:17,338
to small business owners
to help them pay rent.

85
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:19,338
Professor Jang.

86
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,838
Small business owners
are getting chased out right now,

87
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:26,005
and we're having a serious discussion here

88
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,630
about how to protect
the rights of our citizens.

89
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,130
-This far-fetched--
-You're right.

90
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,380
Tenants are citizens.

91
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:35,213
But landlords are citizens as well.

92
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:38,505
Of course, there is a difference
in their wealth,

93
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:41,463
but both are citizens
that require protection.

94
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,338
We have to focus on mutual benefits
while coexisting.

95
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:49,130
All politicians think about is which side
they should support to get more votes.

96
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:51,921
Isn't that why they can't find
a practical solution?

97
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:54,546
He's pretty harsh.

98
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,755
-Isn't he charismatic?
-Our citizens

99
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:59,296
achieved things
that the US and Finland couldn't.

100
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,213
Forbidding desire is totalitarianism.
And letting desires go wild

101
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,880
is laissez-faire.

102
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:11,296
But encouraging reasonable levels
of desire,

103
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,255
is the responsibility of a civic society.

104
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,463
Oh, thank you.

105
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,463
-Thank you.
-I'll see you at school.

106
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,338
-All right.
-Take care.

107
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:29,921
Excuse me, Professor.

108
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:31,838
Do you remember me?

109
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,213
Were you my student?

110
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,130
I took your class before,
"The Birth of a Civic Capitalist."

111
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,130
I didn't know I'd see you again like this.

112
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:42,171
This is how we meet
after students graduate.

113
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,796
You mentioned during class
how a civic bank was necessary,

114
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,171
and you're actually doing it now.

115
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:50,921
We'll have to see. Thank you for today.

116
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,713
I'll go to the rally tomorrow.

117
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,005
Good luck, sir.

118
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:10,046
-I'll get going now.
-Bye.

119
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,130
Ma'am, you really came.

120
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,338
I didn't think you'd come.

121
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,338
I heard the rising artist exhibit
got cancelled.

122
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,588
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

123
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,380
I already told everyone about it.

124
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:37,796
We're here today
to congratulate the opening of Alt Space,

125
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,338
-so hold it.
-I trusted you.

126
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:41,255
Cheers to Alt Space!

127
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:42,921
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

128
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,088
I wanted to do something like this too.

129
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:46,171
Congratulations.

130
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:56,921
You know Zio Shin, right?
He was invited to the Documenta.
Yes. I thought he was in Paris, though.

131
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,338
Right. He's just here for a short while.

132
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:05,088
It's something about
a dance collaboration.

133
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,463
Why? Do you want an introduction?

134
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,255
It's fine, maybe later.

135
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,963
The weather was nice,
but it's raining now.

136
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:42,588
"Alternative space."

137
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:45,130
That's a really tacky name.

138
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:49,255
But it takes quite a lot of courage
to call it "alternative" himself.

139
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,546
Is it true? About Zhou Zhang?

140
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,296
I need your help, Ms. Yoon.

141
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,171
We're buying three pieces from him.

142
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:00,963
One is getting sent to a Paris auction.

143
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:03,046
-The sponsor?
-Hwayoung Group.

144
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,838
Another conglomerate story?

145
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,796
It's a bit cliché,
and there's no evidence.

146
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:09,921
How about abuse of power?

147
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,046
They suddenly backed out of the contract,

148
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,630
and they took away opportunities

149
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,713
from local artists
just to invite a foreign one.

150
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,796
So you won't even drink
with losers like us?

151
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,213
How ridiculous.

152
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:26,130
If you're a mysterious artist who doesn't
even do interviews, why are you here?

153
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:29,255
You should greet a senior artist
if you see one, you shit.

154
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,171
-What's up with you?
-You know

155
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,171
-that I'm not usually like this.
-Of course, I do.

156
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:34,463
It's okay. I'll take him.

157
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,880
-Stop. Come here.
-How could he do that to me?

158
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:40,421
-Come on.
-I was just...

159
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,171
-I didn't mean...
-Let's go, come on.

160
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,671
What an asshole.

161
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:53,255
The past love

162
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:56,796
Becomes a thorn

163
00:10:57,046 --> 00:11:00,963
That digs into me

164
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:05,296
I ask it to leave

165
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:08,296
To leave for good

166
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:12,338
But still, it keeps bothering me

167
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,755
Don't you know women hate
men singing that in karaoke rooms?

168
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,755
That's why I'm singing it at home.

169
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:23,963
I missed you like crazy

170
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:25,963
Why did you do that?

171
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:28,588
If you sing with that on,
you'll get wrinkles around your mouth.

172
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:30,255
Gosh.

173
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,088
Maybe I should just quit work.

174
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:38,421
What is it this time?

175
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:42,421
Those who do whatever they want
with their money... I hope they die.

176
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,671
That Ms. Min.

177
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,421
She'd be nothing
if it weren't for her money.

178
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,421
While I was looking at Chun Kyung-ja's
pieces on a calendar,

179
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:56,088
that bitch had the real pieces
hung on her bedroom wall. Unbelievable.

180
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:57,755
Are they expensive?

181
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,421
Should I buy one for you?
Can you afford that?

182
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:08,921
Hey, I'm doing pretty well.
I was on TV again today.

183
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:16,338
Weren't you just assisting
Professor Lee again?

184
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:18,463
It's not like that.

185
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,713
No one helps me out as much as he does.

186
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,255
I heard he's quitting to go into politics.

187
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:25,880
That's why I should stick with him.

188
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,921
-You want to do politics, too?
-There's no reason not to.

189
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:32,088
If the time comes,
and if there's an opportunity.

190
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:33,921
I believe

191
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,963
you won't lose an opportunity
if it comes to you.

192
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,713
But I...

193
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
I prefer a man who makes a chance,

194
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,213
not a man who waits for one.

195
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,921
Someone who makes their opportunities...

196
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:33,546
You're here.

197
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,796
Yes, hello.

198
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:40,546
Do you know how much
one cc of this boy's semen costs?

199
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,213
It costs the same as a one-carat diamond.

200
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:47,838
Whether it's a person or a horse,
the bloodline is important.

201
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,838
PRESIDENT'S AWARD
HAN YONG-SEOK

202
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,755
GRAND ART EXHIBITION OF KOREA

203
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:08,546
So you've visited Germany.

204
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,880
Was it nice there?

205
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,755
Nowhere is like how it used to be before.

206
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:14,005
Nothing moves me.

207
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,380
But still, you're amazing.

208
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:19,255
You make art even while you're so busy.

209
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:22,880
It's not time that bothers me,
it's my lack of physical energy.

210
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,546
I should do a piece with you sometime.

211
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:33,796
"Abuse of power from large galleries.

212
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:36,755
Local artists cannot find places
to exhibit their pieces."

213
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,005
This article was your doing, wasn't it?

214
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,921
It's fine since the name "Mirae"
wasn't mentioned, right?

215
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:45,546
Don't underestimate Hwa-lan.

216
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,671
She's not the director
just for show, you know.

217
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,713
Please let me become the director.

218
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,921
You want the director's seat?

219
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,296
What’s in it for me?

220
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,921
A partner you can trust.

221
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:11,463
I'm a pretty good partner.
Trust me with that role.

222
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:15,171
If Hwa-lan heads the foundation,

223
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,296
wouldn't you become
the next director anyway?

224
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:20,005
You're the one who gets to decide.

225
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:27,213
Out with conglomerates that kill

226
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:28,463
small businesses!

227
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:31,005
-Conglomerates, back off!
-Conglomerates, back off!

228
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:33,171
Get rid of political corruption

229
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:35,130
and help the dreams of citizens!

230
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:37,838
-Get rid of corruption!
-Get rid of corruption!

231
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,380
Professor Jang.

232
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,630
Sir, you're here again.

233
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,963
Why don't we have a drink later?

234
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,421
Could I borrow your lighter?

235
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:51,505
Here you go.

236
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,255
Hold on, I'll get you some coffee.

237
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:57,921
-Back off!
-Back off!

238
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,963
When the hell will the reform be in place?

239
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,838
We want practical measures!

240
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,921
-Practical measures!
-Practical measures!

241
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,296
Protect the rights
of small business owners!

242
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,588
Citizens...

243
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:12,505
Fire!

244
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,171
He's on fire!

245
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,046
Someone help! He's on fire!

246
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,963
Oh, no. What do we do?

247
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:42,546
Oh, my goodness.

248
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,130
Sir, are you okay? Sir!

249
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,296
He saved him.

250
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,213
Is Ms. Lee still the same?

251
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,838
She's still clueless as always.

252
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,963
Except when she bullies me.

253
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:02,963
It's amazing that you're still working
for her with your temper.

254
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,505
What else can I do?

255
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,963
I have to earn money and pay off my debt.

256
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,630
Why do you live like that?

257
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:10,296
You just had to go to Gangnam,

258
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,546
even if you could only afford
to rent a house.

259
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,255
Your fibroids grew.
Let's check again next month.

260
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,338
You're at the age where premature
menopause isn't uncommon.

261
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,213
Hey, I'm only 37.

262
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:27,796
That's why I'm saying this.
37 isn't a young age.

263
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,005
It won't matter if you don't want a baby.

264
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:33,380
I'm healthy, and I'll have a baby
after some time.

265
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:35,838
Here.

266
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:40,713
-How is Tae-jun?
-He's busy.

267
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,213
He must be doing well.

268
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,546
He bragged that he was on TV yesterday.

269
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,671
-During a rally about the rights...
-He does appear on TV often.

270
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:54,005
A man of age 73 attempted to burn
himself to death.

271
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,463
Professor Jang Tae-jun,
who was at the site,

272
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:59,546
threw himself over the man to save him.

273
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:05,671
Won't it leave a scar?
What did the doctor say?

274
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:07,588
It's fine as long as
I take good care of it.

275
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,588
Don't do things like that again.

276
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,963
Even if we ever break up,
I really wouldn't want to be a widow.

277
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,213
That's a bit harsh.

278
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:18,130
I just don't want you to get hurt
for some stranger's sake.

279
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,671
He wasn't some stranger, I knew him.

280
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:22,463
That doesn't mean you really know him.

281
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,130
Always so meddlesome...

282
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,338
How could I just stand there
and do nothing in that situation?

283
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,130
Hello?

284
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,171
Yes, that's right.

285
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,255
The Republican Party?

286
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:56,796
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THE PEOPLE

287
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,921
HEAD OF PARTY'S OFFICE

288
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,546
Is your hand okay?

289
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,380
I hope you weren't hurt badly.

290
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:18,171
Oh, it's fine.

291
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,546
What do you think is the value
of a conservative party?

292
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:24,255
Excuse me?

293
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:25,838
It's practicality.

294
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:30,088
Practical policies that will help
improve the lives of citizens.

295
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,338
The civic bank idea, Professor Jang.

296
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,171
I was very touched.

297
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,713
Thank you.

298
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:45,130
Let's work together
to make that civic bank.

299
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,838
And we'd like you

300
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,963
to run in the election for our Party.

301
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:55,546
You have great insight, sir.

302
00:19:56,171 --> 00:20:00,671
It's not easy even for a presidential
candidate to be this popular online.

303
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:03,838
What do you say, Professor Jang?

304
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,505
If you give me the opportunity,
I'll do my best.

305
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,171
I'll look forward to working with you.

306
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,588
Sure, thank you.

307
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,463
The piece you mentioned last time,

308
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:31,130
I got information that it's going to be
auctioned in Hong Kong.

309
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:34,630
You're buying another piece?

310
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:37,130
Ju-yeong likes Hopper's works.

311
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:40,546
Wow, he's different from kids these days.

312
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,755
He looks just like his father,

313
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,005
but his artistic sense is just like mine.

314
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:49,713
You have to be born with artistic sense.

315
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,463
About 800 million
would do it, right, Curator Oh?

316
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:56,963
Oh, have you forgotten
that she's the vice director now?

317
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,130
She's been so for a while.

318
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:02,296
I don't see what the difference is.

319
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,713
Don't say it like that.

320
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,755
-Is it that different?
-Of course, it was a promotion.

321
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,838
I must have drunk too much coffee.

322
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,380
Where's the bathroom?

323
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,213
Oh, I'll show you the way.

324
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,796
"Artistic sense"? How ridiculous.

325
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,838
She can't even tell apart
Gogh and Gauguin.

326
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,588
I'll get you that piece
for 1.2 billion won.

327
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:25,213
I just want that piece to find an owner
that deserves it.

328
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,005
She just said 800 million.

329
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,338
I can never get that for that price.

330
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,630
One billion, then.

331
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,171
I'm doing this because I don't want
that woman getting that piece.

332
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,838
You're really good at this.

333
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,921
But I want that Takashi piece
you have in exchange.

334
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:43,171
How much can I get for it?

335
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:46,255
Four billion if it's auctioned,
and five if you give it to me.

336
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,671
You really are something.

337
00:21:49,296 --> 00:21:51,130
When can I come get the Hopper piece?

338
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,713
Just sign the certificate I send you,

339
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,005
and we'll take good care of it.

340
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:58,005
But isn't it funny to buy a piece
for a billion won

341
00:21:58,171 --> 00:21:59,880
and not even look at it?

342
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,880
Ma'am, did you look around all the land
you bought in the suburbs?

343
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:04,921
You have a point.

344
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,421
How did it go, Tae-jun?

345
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:16,380
See you later.

346
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:29,588
Did something good happen?

347
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:31,255
Yes.

348
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:34,046
-What about those women?
-They left a moment ago.

349
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:39,838
They're always going around in groups,
gossiping about useless stuff.

350
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,671
They're so uncultured.

351
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,755
Will she give us the Takashi piece?

352
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,505
I think she might.
I read the article.

353
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:52,338
What would you gain
from going against me like that?

354
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:54,880
I'll take responsibility
and take care of it.

355
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,713
You'd better not mention
that rising artist exhibit again.

356
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,005
If you don't find a decent artist
for the exhibit,

357
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,921
this is going to be your last exhibit.

358
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:07,630
So think carefully.

359
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,713
What? Really?

360
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,046
Zio Shin said he'll work with you?

361
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,296
It's not confirmed yet.

362
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:51,171
You're unbelievable, how could you
come up with such an idea?

363
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,880
Who would want to work
with the woman who dumped him?

364
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:57,421
Why mention something that happened
ten years ago? I better go.

365
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,838
I thought interactive art
fell out of popularity.

366
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:47,963
I guess the artist
is what's more important.

367
00:24:49,796 --> 00:24:51,046
What's your agency?
I don't have one.

368
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,880
You need one to exhibit your work
in places like Mirae Culture Center.

369
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:00,005
I'm not interested in places like Mirae.

370
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,505
The name sucks, too.

371
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,421
In Korea, strange places with weird names
are the ones with authority.

372
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,630
So you are not willing
to display your work in Korea?

373
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:23,505
I heard you rejected a billion won offer.

374
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:26,380
I don't like people who start talking
money right from the start.

375
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:29,338
Right? That's a bit tacky.

376
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:33,880
Let me be frank with you.

377
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,088
I want you to be the main artist

378
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,421
for our reopening exhibit
at Mirae Culture Center.

379
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:42,338
Is that offer
a personal one?

380
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,463
I don't work like that.

381
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:52,796
You don't want some?

382
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,171
CIVIC BANK'S 1ST ACCOUNT

383
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,921
Get closer to him and talk to him a bit.

384
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:07,296
All right.

385
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:10,130
Sir,

386
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,338
how are you feeling?

387
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,630
Pardon?

388
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:25,546
It seemed like he told you something.
What did say?

389
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:28,421
Well...

390
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:33,963
He thanked me.

391
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,713
He said that the civic bank

392
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,921
must succeed.

393
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:42,921
Thank you, we'll make sure it succeeds.

394
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,421
-Can you get me some water?
-Professor Jang.

395
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,088
-Yes.
-Let's take a photo together.

396
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:51,380
-All right. Thank you.
-Smile.

397
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:53,296
Okay.

398
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,171
FOR THE PEOPLE

399
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,213
Jang Tae-jun for the Gangnam District.

400
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:07,796
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

401
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:18,005
That doesn't suit him. How about this one?

402
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:20,296
Okay.

403
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,421
Make sure that's lined up straight.

404
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:23,755
-Okay!
-Okay!

405
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:26,380
Number two, Jang Tae-jun.

406
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:27,713
-Go!
-Go!

407
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:30,838
I'm Jang Tae-jun. Hello.

408
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:32,671
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

409
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,171
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm Jang Tae-jun.

410
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,796
Wow.

411
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,046
Gosh, ma'am.

412
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:40,296
-Gosh.
-Take a photo.

413
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,713
I'll take that for you.

414
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:43,088
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

415
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:58,588
Mr. Jang.

416
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,796
Mr. Ahn isn't here.

417
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,130
You shouldn't just come in like this.

418
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,755
I came to give him the list
of supporters for tomorrow.

419
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:09,046
You could've called me,
why did you come here yourself?

420
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,213
I'm not used to this kind of thing yet.

421
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:14,088
You know we have a meeting, right?
Let's hurry before we hit traffic.

422
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:15,213
Okay.

423
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:18,130
I'm Baek Gwang-hyun.

424
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,588
I entered law school in '99.

425
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:23,421
I met you once when you were
working on the school paper.

426
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:26,755
-You can talk to me casually, sir.
-Oh, right. Nice to meet you.

427
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,921
It's nice to meet you, sir.
Please have a seat.

428
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,046
-All right.
-Here.

429
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,255
I heard from Mr. Ahn

430
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:40,755
that you're thinking
of around 3 billion to get started.

431
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:42,963
Oh, it's 30 billion.

432
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,671
What?

433
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,963
The loans will be in small amounts,
with low interests,

434
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:51,213
so I think we'd need that much
to able to earn a stable amount.

435
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:53,296
Is that a bit overwhelming?

436
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:56,296
No, it's fine. Mr. Jang,

437
00:28:56,963 --> 00:28:58,463
I'm not here to negotiate.

438
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,463
Whatever you say, you'll get it.

439
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:02,880
Is that so?

440
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:08,505
"Daeil." The company was named
to mean, "against Japan."

441
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:12,255
I named it to respect my grandfather's
part in the independence movement.

442
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,796
Wow, he's very admirable.

443
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,713
I'm putting my trust in you, then.

444
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:19,838
Thank you for trusting me.

445
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:30,338
-Mr. Oshima is here.
-I'll be there soon.

446
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:35,713
I'm sorry, but give me a moment.
I'll be right back.

447
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:36,630
All right.

448
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:41,380
He seems pretty nice.

449
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:43,671
He sponsors our Party often.

450
00:29:43,755 --> 00:29:46,880
I think he could be a politician too.
He's gentle and good with words.

451
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:51,130
But I believe you'll be
a better politician,

452
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:52,213
since you're brave.

453
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,755
I was very touched that day

454
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,713
when you ran over to the man on fire.

455
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,005
No one knew what to do,
and you were the only one who rushed over.

456
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:05,005
That was nothing, it was just instinct.

457
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,296
Someone was dying, you know.

458
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:11,213
They say that what you do
in such situations is who you truly are.

459
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,463
You're different from other people.

460
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,046
Oh, right.

461
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,838
-What's this?
-It's a bribe.

462
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:29,338
A bribe?

463
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:32,838
That means you want something in return.

464
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:35,671
Buy me a drink sometime.

465
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,296
Do you have feelings for me?

466
00:30:58,338 --> 00:30:59,630
I haven't seen that before.

467
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,796
It's a congratulatory gift from the Party.

468
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,130
It looks a bit cheap, though.

469
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:12,338
It does?

470
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:19,171
But still, the Party gave it to you,
so you better wear it.

471
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,921
Politics is about the cause, not fashion.

472
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:29,463
You know, I think you might
do better than me at this.

473
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,713
The road to the Blue House
is open, you know.

474
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,838
Are you just going to stand there
and take photos?

475
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:36,130
You're getting way ahead
of yourself again.

476
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:37,671
Getting ahead is how you win.

477
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,838
Let me see.

478
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:45,421
I think we look pretty decent today.

479
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:49,796
You're right.

480
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,421
-Hello.
-Hello.

481
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:56,130
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

482
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:57,796
-Hello.
-Hello.

483
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:03,338
-Senator, thank you for coming.
-Hello, Mr. Jang.

484
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,713
-Oh, hello.
-This is my wife.

485
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:08,171
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, Ms. Oh.

486
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:10,255
-This is my husband.
-Hello.

487
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:12,046
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

488
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:21,338
There's one of the women
I talked to you about.

489
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:25,463
Oh, the one who kept talking about Hopper?

490
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,213
She's looking, just smile.

491
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:34,838
Let's do it.

492
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:35,963
Hello.

493
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,588
I'm also a huge fan
of Edward Hopper's works.

494
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,255
I heard a piece was hung
in President Obama's office.

495
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,421
-You know Hopper?
-Of course.

496
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,921
You have a great artistic sense.

497
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,880
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:32:48,963 --> 00:32:50,796
Hello, Ms. Oh.

499
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,463
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Sure.

500
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:55,130
-I'll see you again soon.
-Yes.

501
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:00,546
Hello.

502
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,463
Who...

503
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,838
I'm Mr. Jang's political aide,
Park Eun-ji.

504
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:13,380
I heard you were his student.
You're quite a beauty.

505
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:32,130
I'm Jang Tae-jun, her husband.

506
00:33:32,338 --> 00:33:33,630
I'm Zio Shin.

507
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:36,755
Oh, this is the man
you wanted to do the exhibit with.

508
00:33:36,838 --> 00:33:38,171
It's nice to meet you.

509
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:40,588
I heard she's making a lot of effort
to lure you.

510
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,380
I see my efforts paid off,

511
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:44,921
seeing how you've come here.

512
00:33:46,213 --> 00:33:47,213
I hope you work with her.

513
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:51,171
She's putting everything
into that reopening exhibit.

514
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:54,088
There are many people like her.

515
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:59,713
But the wine is so expensive,
it's hard to pity them.

516
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,296
Is that so?

517
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,171
I know landlords have divine authority
these days,

518
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,880
but I can't afford to do business
while paying such expensive rent.

519
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:15,421
Since this is a sponsorship event,
many people ask me this.

520
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:18,088
"Which account should I send my money to?"

521
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:20,046
Don't donate your money.

522
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:24,671
Invest it, since we'll make you a profit.

523
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:27,963
I heard that this is very expensive wine.

524
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,338
Think of this as our investment

525
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:33,630
to gain many great investors.

526
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:35,255
Let's have a toast for our cause!

527
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,630
Cheers!

528
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:38,880
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

529
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:41,463
Mr. Jang, you're so good with words.

530
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:45,838
You look like a politician now.

531
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,630
All thanks to you, Su-yeon.

532
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,088
Mr. Jang, our Party leader
is waiting for you upstairs.

533
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:00,255
Really? Okay. I'll see you later.

534
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,213
Eun-ji. Why don't we have a drink
together when this is over?

535
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:11,921
Don't you see I'm working?

536
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:16,005
You're here.

537
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:18,130
Hello, sir.

538
00:35:18,796 --> 00:35:20,171
Let me introduce you.

539
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:24,046
This is the new face of our Party,
Jang Tae-jun.

540
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,380
And this is...

541
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:28,046
This is Mr. Nam Kyu-sik,
the CEO of Angel Venture Investments.

542
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,463
It's nice to meet you, sir.

543
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,796
All right, sit down.

544
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,005
Please have a seat.

545
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:39,421
Sir, Mr. Nam here agrees with our cause,

546
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:43,546
and he's decided to invest in it.
An amount of 10 billion won.

547
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:47,838
We really needed someone
to step up first for our cause.

548
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:50,505
Please, don't. Actually,

549
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,546
I haven't decided for sure yet.

550
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,588
We just can't do this openly yet,

551
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,505
but let's do it properly.

552
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:01,171
This is for a decent cause, so I'm sure
he'll think this over positively.

553
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:02,588
All right.

554
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:05,088
Let's all have a drink together.

555
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:07,713
-Have a drink, sir.
-Cheers.

556
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:19,588
Why did the free school meals policy work?

557
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:21,838
It's simple.

558
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:25,796
It's something that parents
who have packed lunches can relate to.

559
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:29,255
"Why would you stop
such a decent thing, you jerks?"

560
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,505
That's what people should say about it.

561
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:34,505
We have to do this the simple way,
nothing complex.

562
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:36,338
Why do politics

563
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:38,838
the hard way?

564
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,338
I thought he was a teaching dweeb,

565
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:46,046
but he’s a wolf.

566
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,255
So,

567
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:51,255
did you make up your mind?

568
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm not sure I can work with you.

569
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,380
Don't be like that.
Just stop by the center sometime.

570
00:36:58,005 --> 00:36:59,380
How about next week?

571
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:02,296
I'm going to Paris. I have an exhibit.

572
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:06,546
Do you want to join me?

573
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:29,630
This suits you well.

574
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:12,380
Have you ever done it with a congressman?

575
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:13,963
I'm doing it right now.

576
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,171
Did you overdo yourself last night?

577
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,421
How can you become a congressman
with that energy?

578
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:49,338
They don't get elected
based on their physical stamina.

579
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,546
What's going on, though?
You can hardly wake up in the morning.

580
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,046
I thought I should work out a bit.

581
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:59,171
And spend some time with you too.

582
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,213
Did things go well last night?

583
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:04,630
Nothing will get in my way.

584
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:06,713
Aren't you being too cocky?

585
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,255
Why? I thought you wanted
a successful husband.

586
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:10,963
You reek of alcohol.

587
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,546
Let's keep exercising.

588
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:15,130
-Come on, let's exercise.
-How much did you drink?

589
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,630
Wait for me.

590
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:20,796
What about the parents?

591
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:24,421
We scheduled campaigns
targeting women's clubs.

592
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,838
Education is an important subject,
so I want to put a lot of focus on it.

593
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:30,838
We already contacted reporters, and--

594
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:34,588
So we're preparing live broadcasts
on Facebook and YouTube.

595
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:37,713
Okay, then I'll do the speech
tomorrow morning.

596
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:39,671
-Okay.
-If there's nothing else, I'll head off.

597
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:42,088
You still have a lot of time
before your dinner appointment.

598
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:44,963
I have somewhere I need to go first.
Would you join me, Eun-ji?

599
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:45,880
Sure.

600
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,588
I'll drive, sir.

601
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:49,880
I'll drive myself.

602
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,005
One glass is 1,000 won?

603
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,338
He sold drinks by glasses,

604
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:01,380
saying some people didn't have
the money to buy a bottle.

605
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,255
I hope he gets better soon.

606
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:11,380
You can become a congressman
and take care of him.

607
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:21,255
So we're putting up a banner
with no names of any artists.

608
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,796
People will think we're not announcing
any names on purpose.

609
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:26,046
The auction will go smoothly, right?

610
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:30,338
It's Ms. Min's first time doing this,
so make sure things go well.

611
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:34,380
I'll go to Paris, Director.

612
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:37,130
Ms. Min's family company branch in Paris

613
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:38,838
promised to send people to help.

614
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:42,296
Don't you think we should be careful
about conglomerates nowadays?

615
00:41:44,088 --> 00:41:46,880
It's a sensitive issue. I believe
a professional should handle this.

616
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:52,921
Well, it's true you've never made
any mistakes.

617
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:02,171
I think this area is okay,
so just organize this part.

618
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:03,213
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:04,963
Let me talk to you for a minute.

620
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,505
Does it have to be now? I'm busy.

621
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:11,046
What happened with the Paris business?

622
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:15,255
It's your first time, Ms. Min.

623
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,421
Don't you think it's better
for me to do it?

624
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:19,046
Why are you doing this?

625
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:21,921
It’s just money laundering!

626
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:24,588
Yes, you're right.

627
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,755
But you need a name value to do it right.

628
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,421
I guess

629
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,171
you have nothing to be afraid of.

630
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,713
Why?

631
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:40,963
You thought only plutocrats have no fear?

632
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:45,505
You should think about other things too,

633
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:48,338
not just about making
your breasts bigger all the time.

634
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,380
ZIO SHIN
PHOTO EXHIBIT

635
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,421
-How do you do? Pleased to meet you.
-Thanks.

636
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:16,338
How about you guys take a selfie together?

637
00:43:16,963 --> 00:43:17,921
One, two...

638
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:19,380
-Is this good?
-Yes.

639
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:22,380
Thank you. Bye.

640
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:29,421
Take a photo with me, too.

641
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,130
Why

642
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:21,296
aren't you getting married anytime soon?

643
00:44:22,213 --> 00:44:24,880
I should at least stay single
to meet you like this.

644
00:44:40,796 --> 00:44:41,630
Here you go.

645
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,921
Don't film me.

646
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:28,796
Stop that!

647
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:30,630
-Stop it.
-Why?

648
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:32,213
Come on, stop it.

649
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,463
Come on.

650
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:34,963
-Don't do that.
-Stop it.

651
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:35,963
Stop.

652
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:38,005
Stop it.

653
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,171
The main piece for today's auction

654
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:22,171
is Zhou Zhang's Tears Of a Dragon.

655
00:47:22,255 --> 00:47:26,713
Bidding will start with 1.7 million euros.

656
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,046
Three million.

657
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,046
Four million?

658
00:47:31,713 --> 00:47:33,588
And 4.5 million.

659
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:34,921
Five million?

660
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:37,171
Six million?

661
00:47:38,671 --> 00:47:40,838
Six million. Going once...

662
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:44,005
Seven million for the gentleman.

663
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:45,713
Eight million for the lady.

664
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,505
Nine million.

665
00:47:49,296 --> 00:47:50,255
Ten million.

666
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:52,213
Ten million, going once.

667
00:47:53,463 --> 00:47:55,546
Ten million, going twice.

668
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:57,713
Ten million, going three times.

669
00:47:58,338 --> 00:48:01,088
Sold for ten million euros.
Congratulations, ma'am.

670
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,380
We will proceed to the next piece.

671
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:11,255
Next is a painting by Michael Coren.
We'll start with 950,000 euros.

672
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:28,463
Hey, what's going on?

673
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:29,463
You must be Zio.

674
00:48:29,546 --> 00:48:30,546
I am.

675
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,005
Thank you.

676
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:42,588
All right.

677
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:44,630
Su-yeon,

678
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:47,130
please contact me again next time.

679
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:50,421
So you two made a 100-million-won painting
get sold for 10 billion?

680
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:53,421
The one who sold the painting
was in on it, too.

681
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:56,505
So that deal left us with 10 billion won.

682
00:48:56,588 --> 00:49:00,046
That means you're embezzling
that much money from the company.

683
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,505
Can the company run properly?

684
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:03,505
The company has the picture.

685
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:05,713
The Zhou Zhang we bought for 10 billion.

686
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:08,963
We'll display that at the center
a few times,

687
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,880
and then get a loan of 10 billion
with it as mortgage,

688
00:49:11,963 --> 00:49:13,421
since it's a 10-billion-won painting.

689
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,380
I just did a huge deal,
so I'll treat you today.

690
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,630
How were things recently?

691
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:46,505
Oh, yes.
Good news...

692
00:49:47,963 --> 00:49:50,796
Mr. Jang, what are you doing?
Come on, join us.

693
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,755
Come over here!

694
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:55,588
I was preoccupied for a minute.

695
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:59,130
Let's drink to Mr. Jang's election!

696
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,630
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

697
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:10,880
HEY, EUN-JI. GOOD MORNING.
I'M WAITING OUTSIDE TO GIVE YOU A RIDE.

698
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:26,921
-Let's hurry.
-All right.

699
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:32,130
We should have breakfast before we go.

700
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,338
Excuse me. Ms. Oh Su-yeon?

701
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:53,921
You’re under arrest for violating
laws regarding foreign exchange

702
00:50:54,005 --> 00:50:55,505
and specific economic crimes.

703
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:58,338
-Wait a minute.
-Zio.

704
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:00,213
I'll handle this.

705
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,546
She's very pretty.

706
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,046
And you are beautiful.

707
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,171
And you have a great personality.

708
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,088
Did you have dinner?

709
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:50,963
I'll eat when I get home.

710
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:53,296
How was Paris?

711
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:57,255
Is there a problem with the picture
I bought at the auction?

712
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:59,463
That's for a slush fund, isn't it?

713
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,463
Raising the price that much
would leave at least eight billion won.

714
00:52:04,005 --> 00:52:05,546
A picture's value increasing means

715
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:08,130
that the curator
has a great artistic sense.

716
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:10,630
-You keep records, right?
-Of course.

717
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,213
Records of our members, the transactions,

718
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,338
and the art pieces we have.
Our center is very meticulous.

719
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:19,130
Not things like that. Secretive records.

720
00:52:24,296 --> 00:52:28,546
Ms. Lee of Daewon Group bought a Takashi
on her wedding anniversary.

721
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,755
A daughter-in-law of Sangjin's chairman
wanted a trade.

722
00:52:32,005 --> 00:52:34,338
Ms. Yang wanted a nude painting.

723
00:52:34,546 --> 00:52:37,005
And Ms. Lee Dong-jin wants
a painting to hang in the bedroom.

724
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:38,880
Anything by Peter Doig.

725
00:52:39,463 --> 00:52:41,838
The Prosecutor General
only wants one of his.

726
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:45,296
That's all I know.

727
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,005
And you were doing business with Zio Shin?

728
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,380
I'm preparing an exhibit

729
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,296
with Zio Shin.

730
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:03,755
Ma'am, one minute, please.

731
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:06,963
A JUST PROSECUTION FOR CITIZENS

732
00:53:15,046 --> 00:53:16,338
You can't do this.

733
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:18,755
He's her husband,
which means he's involved.

734
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:20,005
Besides, he's a politician.

735
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,463
This could lead to a huge scandal.

736
00:53:23,755 --> 00:53:26,130
It's Jang Tae-jun who's come to me.

737
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:30,921
Don't worry, and get that pretty
Ms. Oh some dinner.

738
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:36,713
Oh, gosh.

739
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,296
I was excited to hear
that a rising politician was here.

740
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,963
Prosecutor Cho Yeong-seon
of the Seoul Central District.

741
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:58,005
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Jang Tae-jun.

742
00:53:58,088 --> 00:54:00,421
What did my wife do wrong?

743
00:54:00,505 --> 00:54:01,880
You didn't know?

744
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:05,213
Ms. Oh is a professional
at making slush funds for the wealthy.

745
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:07,255
And at amounts up to several billion.

746
00:54:07,338 --> 00:54:11,171
How could a culture center curator
make money like that?

747
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:13,463
But you made several billion, too.

748
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:15,546
The fund for that civic bank
you're preparing,

749
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,588
I know it's a lot of money.

750
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,713
You're starting with 30 billion won?

751
00:54:20,588 --> 00:54:23,463
This is how I think. I guess this is
why people call me a nut case.

752
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:28,796
I'm actually more interested in you
than your wife.

753
00:54:29,296 --> 00:54:33,463
The suspicious connection between
Mirae Group and the Republican Party.

754
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:36,838
The connection between Mirae Group
and the Republican Party?

755
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:39,921
When Ms. Oh launders black money
and makes it clean,

756
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:42,963
you make the civic bank with it.
Isn't that how it goes?

757
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,963
That's what usually happens in movies.

758
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,338
I don't think that kind of imagination
is a skill you need.

759
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:51,213
It's a reasonable suspicion.

760
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:53,630
You can't detain someone
based on suspicion.

761
00:54:53,713 --> 00:54:57,505
The Korean law lets us detain people
for 48 hours based on suspicion.

762
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,838
I thought you'd know everything
since you're a professor,

763
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:04,213
but I guess you don't.

764
00:55:08,255 --> 00:55:12,755
Did you actually think that you became
a candidate all on your own?

765
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,921
You really are a nut case.

766
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:30,380
Did you get a warrant?

767
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:32,213
I think I need to look into this.

768
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,213
I told you not to get ahead of yourself.
Let her go right now.

769
00:55:56,463 --> 00:56:00,213
Your husband already has
as many connections as top politicians.

770
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:02,796
Excuse me.

771
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:07,838
Could you get me some water?

772
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:35,380
The Party is pretty sensitive about this.

773
00:56:35,463 --> 00:56:37,921
Any scandals before the election
could cause trouble.

774
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,630
We just met, and that's what you say?

775
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:43,255
I'm just saying, be careful.

776
00:56:44,255 --> 00:56:45,463
Tae-jun.

777
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:47,463
You've changed.

778
00:56:47,546 --> 00:56:49,921
No, I haven't. I'm just making an effort.

779
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:53,338
Do we really have to hear things
like slush funds and money laundering?

780
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:55,296
You could just quit
working for that center.
I can earn enough
without you doing dirty work.

781
00:56:57,796 --> 00:57:00,005
-"Dirty work"?
-If I knew what you were doing,

782
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:01,880
-I wouldn't have let you.
-You didn't know?

783
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:04,213
Are you stupid? This is ridiculous.

784
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,046
Don't cross the line.

785
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,921
You're mistaken about something.
I decide what to do with my life.

786
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:11,963
You think your ambition is some great
dream, but mine is nothing?

787
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:58,505
You're a wannabe congressman,
but you have no respect for the law.

788
00:57:58,671 --> 00:58:00,088
Stop picking a fight.

789
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:10,005
I don't think
it's just because of the center.

790
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,213
But I don't know what they're after.

791
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:15,171
She talked about the Republican Party,
then Mirae Group.

792
00:58:15,255 --> 00:58:16,421
Anyway,

793
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:18,713
I've been to the Prosecutor's Office,

794
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:21,630
so I'm qualified for a wife
of a congressman now.

795
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:27,921
Let's raise it.

796
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:36,338
I can see it has every element
of a hot art piece.

797
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:39,588
First, the piece has to
be large and expensive.

798
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:42,546
-And it--
-It has to be hard to understand.

799
00:58:43,046 --> 00:58:45,171
I guess you know
since you're an international artist.

800
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:49,088
Is everything okay?

801
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,880
I learned all this in school,
but I can't remember anything.

802
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:04,088
That's what you filmed in Paris.

803
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,213
Why would you suddenly
withdraw your investment?

804
00:59:30,713 --> 00:59:33,130
I'm just a powerless businessman,

805
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:35,880
but I can't waste
my company's money anymore.

806
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:38,463
Don't say it like that, sir.

807
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:41,630
Investments from businessmen like you
are necessary

808
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:43,671
for the civic bank to have a good start.

809
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:44,588
-Investments?
-Yes.

810
00:59:44,671 --> 00:59:47,005
I've already given enough
for the slush funds.

811
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:50,588
We're not a conglomerate,
I can't just give 10 billion won.
Chairman Han can get that money easily.

812
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:55,963
Why make smaller companies
suffer like this?

813
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,921
You just want us to be the scapegoat
if something goes wrong, right?

814
01:00:02,588 --> 01:00:04,838
I guess it was a mistake coming here.

815
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:07,838
But you tell Mr. Ahn this.

816
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:11,963
I won't just stand by
if he sends people to scare me again.

817
01:00:14,088 --> 01:00:15,088
Wait...

818
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:38,963
Don't film me.

819
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:41,921
Stop that!

820
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:42,880
Stop it.

821
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,880
Yes, I took some medicine.

822
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:51,005
No, it's not that. I know the date.

823
01:00:52,255 --> 01:00:53,713
Okay, I will.

824
01:00:54,463 --> 01:00:57,713
I'll stop by after work. All right.

825
01:01:05,296 --> 01:01:07,546
There's a guest here to see you.

826
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,963
Tae-jun cheated on me?

827
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,338
Do you have evidence?

828
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:14,421
Pardon?

829
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,005
Photos, voice recordings, videos.
Anything like that.

830
01:01:19,296 --> 01:01:22,380
No, I don't have anything like that.
I was just worried

831
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,213
about Eun-ji and Mr. Jang.

832
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:26,671
Really?

833
01:01:28,546 --> 01:01:29,588
So,

834
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:32,255
what did you actually come here to say?

835
01:01:33,546 --> 01:01:35,630
Are you telling me

836
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:37,880
to keep my husband in line?

837
01:01:42,755 --> 01:01:44,296
Why don't you leave now?

838
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,171
Mr. Jang.

839
01:01:47,713 --> 01:01:49,380
About that thing
you asked me to look into.

840
01:01:49,463 --> 01:01:52,380
-I looked through the list of graduates.
-Yes?

841
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:55,546
But there was no Baek Gwang-hyun.

842
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:58,880
There were some with the same name
among other years,

843
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,546
but none of them were in law school.

844
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:04,588
Daeil is registered as a loan company,

845
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:06,921
and it's connected
to gambling and prostitution.

846
01:02:07,005 --> 01:02:09,338
I'm sure it's not just a normal company.

847
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:13,255
Mr. Nam said he'll withdraw
his investment.

848
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:17,755
What did he mean when he said
you sent people to bully him?

849
01:02:18,046 --> 01:02:19,921
What are you talking about?

850
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:23,213
Hey, do you even know
what you're implying right now?

851
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:25,588
And there are many suspicious things
about Mr. Baek.

852
01:02:25,671 --> 01:02:27,046
Hey, Mr. Jang!

853
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:29,588
We have enemies everywhere. You know that?

854
01:02:29,921 --> 01:02:32,713
Don't get swayed by nonsense,
and make sure you know your side.

855
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:36,505
You have responsibilities.
You have to keep your focus.

856
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,171
I'm going to check if there isn't

857
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,796
anything fishy
about the companies that are investing.

858
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,005
That's my responsibility.

859
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,755
He's really going to cause trouble.

860
01:02:44,921 --> 01:02:48,130
Hey! Stop bringing those inside.
I'm already annoyed as it is.

861
01:02:48,213 --> 01:02:49,838
Do you think this is a botanical garden?

862
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:52,505
I gave them the hospital address,
but they keep sending them here,

863
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:54,088
saying they hope he recovers soon.

864
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:58,880
Nonsense. That man who put himself
on fire is irrelevant.

865
01:02:58,963 --> 01:03:01,046
We need something fresh!

866
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,505
Do you like Tae-jun?

867
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:19,963
Excuse me?

868
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:25,296
He's a pretty decent man.

869
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:27,421
But

870
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,338
you almost ruined that decent man's life.

871
01:03:36,171 --> 01:03:39,505
Let me give you some useful advice.

872
01:03:41,755 --> 01:03:44,088
When there are still some guys
who want to sleep with you,

873
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,713
find a nice guy and hold on to him.

874
01:03:49,463 --> 01:03:52,796
Or else girls with mediocre skills
like you will live a difficult life.

875
01:04:05,255 --> 01:04:06,505
What brings you here?

876
01:04:17,796 --> 01:04:20,921
I don't know where you heard
some nonsense to end up here,

877
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:23,213
-but you're mistaken.
-Mistaken?

878
01:04:26,088 --> 01:04:30,255
Have I ever made you upset
about something like this?

879
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:33,421
Did I ever say anything to you
about something like this?

880
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:42,921
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

881
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:44,963
Are you sorry about cheating on me?

882
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:47,463
Don't fool yourself.
I don't care about that.

883
01:04:47,546 --> 01:04:49,296
-Hey...
-But

884
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:52,171
don't get caught by anyone else.

885
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:55,171
If you ruin your life,
it's going to affect mine, too.

886
01:04:58,505 --> 01:04:59,588
You sound

887
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:01,755
just like Hillary.

888
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,546
Exactly.

889
01:05:05,505 --> 01:05:08,005
So, have an affair
when you become like Clinton, not now.

890
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:23,838
They launder money through the center
and blackmail companies for money.

891
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:27,005
And they empty citizen's pockets
by offering high-interest savings.

892
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:29,630
Some of that is given
to politicians as hush money,

893
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:32,921
and the rest is invested
in paper companies made beforehand.

894
01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:36,130
Then it goes bankrupt,
and everyone loses their deposits.

895
01:05:36,213 --> 01:05:38,963
The government must then give
50 million to each person as compensation.

896
01:05:39,046 --> 01:05:42,046
As civil servants, we can't sit and watch
while the government loses money.

897
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:45,046
That seems exactly the same
as the Busan Savings Bank case.

898
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,588
They've just changed the name.

899
01:05:46,671 --> 01:05:50,171
And plus, they're emphasizing their
noble cause, talking about gentrification,

900
01:05:50,296 --> 01:05:51,671
so there's no one criticizing them.

901
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:53,588
That Jang Tae-jun, though.

902
01:05:53,671 --> 01:05:55,630
His profile doesn't really suit
this kind of thing.

903
01:05:55,713 --> 01:05:58,255
Whether he started knowing
about this or not,

904
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,671
he'll become a congressman
thanks to that civic bank.

905
01:06:00,921 --> 01:06:03,171
-He won't be able to play innocent later.
-Never mind that.

906
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:06,005
Aside from Mr. Jang,

907
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,921
you know who's behind all this, right?

908
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:11,713
CIVIC BANK
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MIRAE CULTURE CENTER

909
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:15,880
Han Yong-seok is a conceptual artist

910
01:06:17,255 --> 01:06:18,880
who makes intangible things into objects.

911
01:06:19,546 --> 01:06:23,630
His works of art are radical.

912
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:28,921
The inspiration he gets as an artist...

913
01:06:31,546 --> 01:06:33,463
Add "infinite" before "inspiration."

914
01:06:37,588 --> 01:06:42,505
The infinite inspiration he gets
as an artist comes from...

915
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,046
Comes from...

916
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:05,338
She says, "It's nice to meet you.
I'm Minami."

917
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,171
I can understand that much.

918
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:11,838
What do you think is art, Minami?

919
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,505
Come on, interpret that.

920
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:28,963
"Something beautiful."

921
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,380
Art is
shit.

922
01:07:40,796 --> 01:07:41,713
Is that funny?

923
01:07:45,046 --> 01:07:46,296
Yes.

924
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,671
Oh, what is it, Mr. Ahn?

925
01:07:51,588 --> 01:07:53,130
What are you doing? Hold him.

926
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,630
-Is that enough?
-Bring him here.

927
01:08:03,421 --> 01:08:05,630
You were happy to invest that money.

928
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:07,255
Do you think you can just say

929
01:08:07,338 --> 01:08:09,963
you've done enough and back out?

930
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:13,005
I wasn't ready yet...

931
01:08:13,921 --> 01:08:16,005
That's your problem, you shit.

932
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:18,421
Why did you agree
when you weren't even ready?

933
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,296
Gosh, that hurt.

934
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:40,046
I'm taking one, and two. They're all mine.

935
01:09:46,713 --> 01:09:48,755
How was it, sir?

936
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:51,796
I accidentally hurt my hand, damn it.

937
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:55,796
You really have a strange hobby, sir.

938
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:57,505
What about Jang Tae-jun?

939
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,588
Don't worry, we're meeting together
with Mr. Ahn tomorrow.

940
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:10,713
Tell Mr. Ahn that
Mr. Nam is taken care of.

941
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:21,296
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

942
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,005
The Republican Party...

943
01:10:46,338 --> 01:10:47,296
Sir.

944
01:10:48,088 --> 01:10:49,421
Were you awake?

945
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:52,713
It's you, Professor Jang.

946
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:56,130
Yes, it's me.
Candidate number two, Jang Tae-jun.

947
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,421
Is my pub

948
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:03,755
taken care of now?

949
01:11:04,963 --> 01:11:06,171
Your pub?

950
01:11:07,213 --> 01:11:08,588
What do you mean?

951
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:12,213
They said they would

952
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:14,713
take care of the rent

953
01:11:15,463 --> 01:11:18,296
and everything if I set myself on fire.

954
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:22,296
I did everything they told me to,

955
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:27,213
so tell them to keep their promise.

956
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:55,546
You said it's a cultural foundation.

957
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,588
It seems like a charity foundation to me.

958
01:11:58,755 --> 01:12:00,338
Do you even know what art is?

959
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:03,213
I see art on Instagram.

960
01:12:04,838 --> 01:12:06,838
What cheerful bullshit.

961
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:08,921
I mean it.

962
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,005
I have hundreds of artist friends.

963
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:14,546
Then why are you here instead of living
in the States with those friends?

964
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:25,338
Move.

965
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:35,380
I need to think some more
about being the director.

966
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:40,963
That son of a bitch.

967
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,963
The director?

968
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:48,588
The board will decide soon.

969
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:52,005
It's out of my hands.

970
01:12:57,171 --> 01:12:59,171
Does the chairman know about this?

971
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:02,630
Is there something you discussed with him?

972
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,421
He called Jason here himself.

973
01:13:11,046 --> 01:13:13,088
You should've known whom to suck up to.

974
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,338
God, this is suffocating me.

975
01:13:20,713 --> 01:13:22,130
This goddamn thing.

976
01:13:25,505 --> 01:13:26,546
Mr. Park,

977
01:13:26,838 --> 01:13:28,171
come massage my feet.

978
01:13:28,338 --> 01:13:29,463
Yes, ma'am.

979
01:13:32,255 --> 01:13:34,046
I'll do a three-level massage.

980
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:42,380
I'll begin with your metatarsal bones.

981
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,671
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to leave?

982
01:14:01,463 --> 01:14:03,963
E-MAIL FROM MIN HYUN-AH

983
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,838
Ms. Oh, this...

984
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:48,796
The woman is so annoying.

985
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,796
She's fussing
over this fucking lousy center.

986
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,338
Hold that fucking lousy center

987
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,213
and shake it up.

988
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,046
I thought you'd get me something nice.

989
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:01,838
When you're ready,

990
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:04,921
I'll get you something bigger.

991
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:10,380
Turn around.

992
01:16:18,671 --> 01:16:20,296
It's better to get a used one
for your first car,

993
01:16:23,255 --> 01:16:26,255
since you'd scrape it and crash it.

994
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,171
So you're saying running the center

995
01:16:29,796 --> 01:16:31,005
is just for practice?

996
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,713
Lie down.

997
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,171
Yes.

998
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,713
Dad,

999
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:55,546
are you exercising?

1000
01:17:01,046 --> 01:17:02,171
Get out.

1001
01:17:08,088 --> 01:17:09,671
I meant you. Get out.

1002
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:23,088
All right, let's turn over a new leaf
and focus

1003
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:24,130
on the civic bank.

1004
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,046
That's why I invited you here.

1005
01:18:28,046 --> 01:18:31,421
Sir, you heard something strange
from Mr. Nam?

1006
01:18:32,213 --> 01:18:34,171
There were several strange things.

1007
01:18:35,755 --> 01:18:36,963
Did you pay the man

1008
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:39,505
who set himself on fire?

1009
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:55,921
My company, Daeil. It means "Great Japan."

1010
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:02,005
I named it like that
after my grandfather said

1011
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,421
useless hate toward Japan

1012
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:06,546
will only ruin Korea.

1013
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:16,088
Why don't you try this?

1014
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,755
It's nice.

1015
01:19:34,171 --> 01:19:37,755
That old man was always sitting
in the front of the rally.

1016
01:19:37,838 --> 01:19:40,171
He got the money to pay his rent,

1017
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:42,005
so it turned out well for him.

1018
01:19:42,255 --> 01:19:45,671
We take care of things neatly
without any legal problems.

1019
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:46,755
What?

1020
01:19:46,838 --> 01:19:48,130
Are you familiar with knife laws?

1021
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,796
It's very difficult to get permission
to own katanas,

1022
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,963
but this doesn't apply to that law

1023
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:58,130
because it's just a kitchen knife
for cutting sashimi.

1024
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,130
By the way, Mr. Jang.

1025
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:06,463
Which parts do you like?

1026
01:20:06,546 --> 01:20:08,421
I like

1027
01:20:09,713 --> 01:20:11,338
the Achilles heel.

1028
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:14,755
If you stab the stomach or the chest,
you could serve 20 years.

1029
01:20:15,505 --> 01:20:16,380
But...

1030
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:20,088
stabbing the Achilles heel
isn't that serious,

1031
01:20:24,088 --> 01:20:25,588
since people don't die

1032
01:20:26,296 --> 01:20:28,255
by getting stabbed there.

1033
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:36,046
It might be hard to go jogging, though.

1034
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:39,046
Do you still go jogging every morning?

1035
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,963
With your sexy wife, Su-yeon?

1036
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,046
Are you threatening me?

1037
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:49,463
Come on, don't be like this
when we're here for a good cause.

1038
01:20:49,546 --> 01:20:52,463
"Threatening"? You're so clueless.

1039
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,880
Coming out.

1040
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:58,463
I'm revealing my true self.

1041
01:20:59,963 --> 01:21:02,671
We're close friends now, aren't we?

1042
01:21:03,963 --> 01:21:07,005
I should support you properly,

1043
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:08,838
like family.

1044
01:21:10,921 --> 01:21:13,505
Come on, look.

1045
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:15,213
Look at that.

1046
01:21:15,296 --> 01:21:17,755
Don't you feel like it's waiting for you?

1047
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:20,671
You should get in there, don't you think?

1048
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:23,630
Congressman Jang Tae-jun!

1049
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,213
That sounds great.
Now, let's drink together.

1050
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:29,005
Come on, drink with me.

1051
01:21:29,838 --> 01:21:31,046
Here...

1052
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:05,338
You think using money is bad,
but selling your body is okay?

1053
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,380
This USB can hold up to 30,000 books.

1054
01:22:11,463 --> 01:22:13,255
And about 2,000 photos.

1055
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:17,671
I wonder how much video
it can hold. It was pretty long.

1056
01:22:19,046 --> 01:22:22,046
So what are you going to do with it?

1057
01:22:25,796 --> 01:22:27,505
You're still a snob, Su-yeon.

1058
01:22:34,338 --> 01:22:36,338
What would happen if this gets out?

1059
01:22:37,046 --> 01:22:40,630
Your husband would go back
to being a professor.

1060
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,796
You might not get divorced,

1061
01:22:44,838 --> 01:22:47,505
but I guess you might get
into a huge fight.

1062
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:15,546
It's so strange.

1063
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:20,755
Why are you always rallying
against conglomerates?

1064
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:23,588
I know you envy the wealthy.

1065
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:32,255
Listen, Su-yeon.

1066
01:23:33,296 --> 01:23:35,588
Only the wealthy live without fear.
You shouldn't be the same,
you should have fear.

1067
01:23:40,588 --> 01:23:44,213
You should be afraid of me,
and Hwa-lan as well.

1068
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:14,171
Okay, I'm going.

1069
01:24:14,713 --> 01:24:16,963
I said I'm going! Fuck!

1070
01:24:27,338 --> 01:24:29,213
Shit, that's disgusting.

1071
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,880
Hey, are you okay?

1072
01:24:34,296 --> 01:24:36,171
Stand up straight.

1073
01:24:36,255 --> 01:24:39,338
Come on, don't fall down.

1074
01:24:39,755 --> 01:24:41,130
Look at this.

1075
01:24:41,213 --> 01:24:42,255
What's this?

1076
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:45,880
Take-out?

1077
01:24:49,255 --> 01:24:51,630
All right, let's go.

1078
01:24:51,713 --> 01:24:52,921
Come on.

1079
01:24:56,338 --> 01:25:00,255
Hey, don't stare at me like that.

1080
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,713
I like you.

1081
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:05,921
You said you wanted a civic bank.

1082
01:25:06,171 --> 01:25:09,046
Things will be so easy
when you become a congressman.

1083
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:10,505
Don't you think so?

1084
01:25:10,921 --> 01:25:13,171
Stop touching my nose!

1085
01:25:13,255 --> 01:25:15,588
What do you think you're doing?

1086
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:17,296
Let me go!

1087
01:25:17,838 --> 01:25:21,005
You're a bunch of sick thugs!

1088
01:25:21,713 --> 01:25:23,421
That bullshit about being my junior...

1089
01:25:23,588 --> 01:25:27,546
All you know is how to use sashimi knives.

1090
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:31,963
You just got knocked down
by a kick in the knee, you losers.

1091
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:35,838
What? You take care of things
neatly with no legal problems?

1092
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:38,963
Everything you do is so sloppy!

1093
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:42,755
If you take care of things so neatly,
how would I know this?

1094
01:25:43,421 --> 01:25:45,588
I know you made that man
set himself on fire.

1095
01:25:46,213 --> 01:25:49,171
You're all dead
if any reporter gets this information.

1096
01:25:49,255 --> 01:25:51,755
-Get that?
-I told you that's never going to happen!

1097
01:25:51,838 --> 01:25:53,088
Hey, you.

1098
01:25:54,255 --> 01:25:57,505
Fuck you, asshole.

1099
01:25:57,588 --> 01:25:59,796
Why are you swearing like this?

1100
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:04,130
You son of a bitch.
Go to hell, you fucker.

1101
01:26:04,588 --> 01:26:06,921
I'm really good at swearing, you know.

1102
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:10,171
That Congress badge isn't even real gold.

1103
01:26:10,255 --> 01:26:13,088
It's silver, and it only costs 35,000 won.

1104
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:18,088
-What the...
-I know that, you little shit.

1105
01:26:18,671 --> 01:26:19,838
Damn it.

1106
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:24,755
The Republican Party...

1107
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:30,296
is fucking damned now, you suckers!

1108
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,630
God... That crazy idiot.

1109
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:50,088
It's cold, let's talk inside.

1110
01:26:52,255 --> 01:26:53,755
I just met Ms. Min.

1111
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,005
What did she want?

1112
01:27:00,088 --> 01:27:01,380
She wants me ruined.

1113
01:27:04,463 --> 01:27:05,463
I'm sorry.

1114
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,338
"Sorry"?

1115
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,296
That's a useless word.

1116
01:27:12,005 --> 01:27:15,671
If the video gets out,
I lose my family and my work.

1117
01:27:16,046 --> 01:27:18,796
You could just run away to Paris,
but not me.

1118
01:27:19,338 --> 01:27:20,713
Let's leave together.

1119
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:22,505
To where? Paris?

1120
01:27:23,546 --> 01:27:25,838
I'm not leaving.
I have no intention of running away.

1121
01:27:25,921 --> 01:27:27,505
You said you weren't happy here.

1122
01:27:29,255 --> 01:27:31,046
You can't even love someone freely.

1123
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,463
Go look at the video.

1124
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:37,171
Go see how dirty that love seems.

1125
01:27:54,005 --> 01:27:55,046
Goodness.

1126
01:27:57,713 --> 01:27:59,755
INCOMING CALL
JANG TAE-JUN

1127
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:05,380
Su-yeon! My amazing Su-yeon.

1128
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,796
I told you I'd make you happy, right?

1129
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:13,421
I have tuna sashimi.

1130
01:28:14,005 --> 01:28:16,213
I have the best parts.

1131
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:18,713
You love this,

1132
01:28:19,421 --> 01:28:20,380
right?

1133
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:25,171
I'll hurry home with this.

1134
01:28:26,755 --> 01:28:27,630
Okay?

1135
01:28:32,005 --> 01:28:33,338
But where am I?

1136
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,963
Where is this place?

1137
01:28:49,588 --> 01:28:51,380
I'm sorry to call you at this hour.

1138
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:15,255
WE SUPPORT THE CIVIC BANK
What are you looking at so intently?

1139
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,546
It's nothing, sir.

1140
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,296
I heard

1141
01:30:28,338 --> 01:30:30,130
you're the one who called Jason.

1142
01:30:32,088 --> 01:30:35,338
You said I'd be the next director.

1143
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,921
Of course, it's your turn.

1144
01:30:41,338 --> 01:30:44,005
You've done so much until now, right?

1145
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:46,338
And we're partners.

1146
01:30:52,463 --> 01:30:53,588
I like things...

1147
01:30:56,546 --> 01:30:58,005
that are certain.

1148
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:02,630
Certain?

1149
01:31:05,671 --> 01:31:07,421
Yes, I like that, too.

1150
01:31:10,505 --> 01:31:11,463
Ms. Kim!

1151
01:32:41,463 --> 01:32:44,213
Mr. Han, let's talk for a minute.

1152
01:32:44,296 --> 01:32:45,380
Be quiet.

1153
01:32:45,838 --> 01:32:47,796
Art is not made with words.

1154
01:32:52,838 --> 01:32:54,463
Wait. Please.

1155
01:33:10,171 --> 01:33:11,421
Make sure you get good shots.

1156
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,213
I've caught you at the scene.

1157
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:16,713
They say there's no law
against adultery anymore,

1158
01:33:16,796 --> 01:33:18,338
but that's criminal law.

1159
01:33:18,421 --> 01:33:23,088
Why don't we figure out how much
compensation you'll pay in a civil suit.

1160
01:33:25,005 --> 01:33:25,921
You bitch.

1161
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,213
I guess you succeeded today.

1162
01:33:37,796 --> 01:33:39,380
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1163
01:33:40,046 --> 01:33:41,921
You can't even get it up.

1164
01:33:44,588 --> 01:33:45,713
Just not with you.

1165
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:47,755
I'm doing well
with other women, you bitch.

1166
01:34:00,171 --> 01:34:02,921
Mr. Jeong Shin-woo,
who set himself on fire

1167
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:06,088
in front of the National Assembly Building
died around 5 a.m. today.

1168
01:34:06,255 --> 01:34:07,713
The cause of death is assumed to be

1169
01:34:07,796 --> 01:34:10,630
the incident's aftereffects affecting
his heart disease. Mr. Jeong's...

1170
01:34:11,213 --> 01:34:13,088
There's a press briefing in 30 minutes.

1171
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:15,296
What briefing?

1172
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:17,171
Mr. Jang, how do you feel right now?

1173
01:34:17,505 --> 01:34:18,588
This way, sir.

1174
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:20,463
-Mr. Jang, please give us a comment.
-Mr. Jang.

1175
01:34:20,546 --> 01:34:22,213
The press briefing will begin
in 30 minutes.

1176
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:24,588
-Mr. Jang!
-Please give us a comment.

1177
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:25,838
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

1178
01:34:29,046 --> 01:34:29,921
HEAD OF PARTY'S OFFICE

1179
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:33,880
You surprised me.

1180
01:34:35,505 --> 01:34:36,963
Your timing is perfect.

1181
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:39,421
I was just about to find you
to get complimented.

1182
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:41,380
-What?
-I took care of things

1183
01:34:41,463 --> 01:34:43,213
really neatly, just like you said.

1184
01:34:46,171 --> 01:34:47,421
You bastard!

1185
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:50,880
Unbelievable.

1186
01:34:52,296 --> 01:34:54,338
You idiot.

1187
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:56,838
-It hurts.
-I'm supposed to be a thug,

1188
01:34:56,921 --> 01:34:59,005
it'll be embarrassing to get beaten twice.

1189
01:34:59,755 --> 01:35:01,046
Don't you think so?

1190
01:35:04,796 --> 01:35:08,005
What kind of professor uses such violence?

1191
01:35:20,963 --> 01:35:22,380
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
FOR THE PEOPLE

1192
01:35:22,463 --> 01:35:25,130
The civic bank project began
with Mr. Jeong's sacrifice,

1193
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,380
but I don't think
it's going well right now.

1194
01:35:33,463 --> 01:35:37,755
Starting today, we're holding off
the project temporarily.

1195
01:35:40,421 --> 01:35:44,546
First, I want to find a new,
better way to proceed

1196
01:35:45,338 --> 01:35:47,005
in honor of Mr. Jeong.

1197
01:35:47,588 --> 01:35:48,713
That will be all.

1198
01:35:50,463 --> 01:35:53,171
Mr. Jang, what did you mean
when you said it's not going well?

1199
01:35:53,255 --> 01:35:55,130
Is it the official position of the Party?

1200
01:35:55,213 --> 01:35:57,046
What will happen
to the civic bank project?

1201
01:36:14,963 --> 01:36:16,880
I owe you a lot this time,

1202
01:36:18,838 --> 01:36:20,463
Su-yeon.

1203
01:36:22,588 --> 01:36:26,213
Don't say it like that, Ms. Lee.

1204
01:36:27,338 --> 01:36:31,963
You sacrificed yourself
and played the lead of a crazy drama.

1205
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:33,296
Good work.

1206
01:36:38,588 --> 01:36:40,713
An article was added to guarantee you

1207
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:42,963
the position of director
for at least five years.

1208
01:36:44,046 --> 01:36:47,921
You've finally become the director
of Mirae Culture Center.

1209
01:36:48,005 --> 01:36:49,380
CO-DIRECTOR
JASON HAN

1210
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:53,755
You're the director.

1211
01:36:55,421 --> 01:36:56,963
Jason is the director, too.

1212
01:36:58,171 --> 01:36:59,630
You're co-directors.

1213
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,880
I don't understand what you mean.

1214
01:37:04,963 --> 01:37:08,963
When you came to me that night
and suggested tricking Yong-seok,

1215
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,088
I was a bit surprised, to be honest.

1216
01:37:11,796 --> 01:37:16,005
I just thought you were
that desperate for the position.

1217
01:37:17,755 --> 01:37:21,380
But why did you suggest
having Ms. Min be the vice director

1218
01:37:21,463 --> 01:37:23,505
when you didn't even like her?

1219
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,005
It seemed strange.

1220
01:37:27,671 --> 01:37:29,213
So I called her and asked.

1221
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,463
The piece is sincere, I like it.

1222
01:38:02,463 --> 01:38:06,588
I heard a rumor that Professor Jang
had an affair with his student.

1223
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:09,588
And his wife had affairs
with the culture center artists.

1224
01:38:10,755 --> 01:38:14,380
People love gossip like this,
couple sex scandals.

1225
01:38:17,046 --> 01:38:18,630
Jang Tae-jun

1226
01:38:19,546 --> 01:38:21,546
keeps acting out of line.

1227
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:24,880
That's going to cause us trouble.

1228
01:38:27,088 --> 01:38:30,755
So Su-yeon,
talk some sense into him, okay?

1229
01:38:31,088 --> 01:38:33,755
It wouldn't be nice
for your husband to see this video.

1230
01:38:34,588 --> 01:38:36,880
The relationship between
a husband and a wife is precious.

1231
01:38:36,963 --> 01:38:38,505
Stop the bullshit.

1232
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:46,338
Hey,

1233
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,588
I look forward to working with you.

1234
01:38:57,505 --> 01:38:59,463
Can't you even eat by yourself?

1235
01:38:59,546 --> 01:39:02,046
Hey, watch your mouth.

1236
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:05,046
If you've eaten enough,
why don't you leave now?

1237
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:08,255
Since you earned lots of money,
you could pay the bill.

1238
01:39:08,338 --> 01:39:09,671
Close the doors.
So what will it be?

1239
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:21,463
Honestly, I'd prefer to have you
on my side than him.

1240
01:39:21,838 --> 01:39:23,713
Jason isn't even my son.

1241
01:39:25,463 --> 01:39:26,546
But

1242
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:28,963
no matter how hard you try,

1243
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:34,088
you can't beat a single drop
of Yong-seok's blood in him.

1244
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,963
You know that, right?

1245
01:39:59,838 --> 01:40:02,880
And you know that the reopening exhibit

1246
01:40:02,963 --> 01:40:04,505
is important, right?

1247
01:40:06,838 --> 01:40:08,255
So I think...

1248
01:40:08,963 --> 01:40:13,380
It'll be hard to exhibit
Zio Shin's pieces, don't you think?

1249
01:40:14,005 --> 01:40:15,713
Let's cancel that, okay?

1250
01:40:17,421 --> 01:40:18,796
-Then...
-Zhou Zhang.

1251
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,171
It'll be better to stick
to the original plan.

1252
01:40:21,796 --> 01:40:23,588
You'll help out, won't you?

1253
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:27,796
Oh, right.

1254
01:40:29,171 --> 01:40:32,130
I have a copy of that video as well.

1255
01:40:32,546 --> 01:40:35,213
I probably won't have any use for that,
but you never know.

1256
01:40:36,963 --> 01:40:39,796
Why do people film that kind of stuff

1257
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,880
when they have no intention
of showing others?

1258
01:40:49,005 --> 01:40:50,255
Those two people

1259
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,921
might fight over money,

1260
01:40:53,755 --> 01:40:55,421
but they'll always be on the same side.

1261
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:58,546
They could fight violently
inside the house,

1262
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:02,588
but they'll never let their money seep
outside their walls.

1263
01:41:04,713 --> 01:41:06,338
They're different from people like us.

1264
01:41:47,963 --> 01:41:49,088
Are you sleeping?

1265
01:41:52,213 --> 01:41:53,255
Yes.

1266
01:42:12,588 --> 01:42:13,463
Should I

1267
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:15,713
stop doing this?

1268
01:42:19,255 --> 01:42:21,213
Why all of a sudden?

1269
01:42:25,338 --> 01:42:26,630
It's just...

1270
01:42:30,088 --> 01:42:31,838
It's just a bit hard for me.

1271
01:42:38,963 --> 01:42:40,755
If you're drunk, get some rest.

1272
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:43,963
We'll talk tomorrow.

1273
01:42:57,546 --> 01:42:58,671
Okay.

1274
01:43:18,963 --> 01:43:21,963
ZIO SHIN

1275
01:44:16,213 --> 01:44:18,838
If you want to change the order,
just choose the folders

1276
01:44:19,463 --> 01:44:21,005
like I showed you last time.

1277
01:44:22,005 --> 01:44:22,963
I don't think

1278
01:44:23,755 --> 01:44:25,130
we can do the exhibit.

1279
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,755
I'm sorry.

1280
01:44:30,088 --> 01:44:31,755
I should be here until the end.

1281
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:44,755
Did you know that suicide attempt

1282
01:44:45,421 --> 01:44:46,755
was the Republican Party's doing?

1283
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:51,505
What will you do if I knew?

1284
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:54,130
You should have told me.

1285
01:44:56,005 --> 01:44:59,546
Professor, when we were
taking photos in the hospital,

1286
01:45:01,338 --> 01:45:05,005
what did Mr. Jeong say to you?

1287
01:45:06,296 --> 01:45:09,296
Did he even say anything?

1288
01:45:12,088 --> 01:45:14,671
Sir, how are you feeling?

1289
01:45:16,838 --> 01:45:17,671
Pardon?

1290
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:20,588
Give me some water.

1291
01:45:24,171 --> 01:45:26,546
It seemed like he told you something.

1292
01:45:30,296 --> 01:45:33,546
He thanked me. He said that the civic bank

1293
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:35,088
must succeed.

1294
01:45:36,796 --> 01:45:39,088
The Party that manipulated
the whole incident,

1295
01:45:39,671 --> 01:45:42,005
and you, who used that to become a star,

1296
01:45:42,588 --> 01:45:45,005
and me, who was desperate
to keep my place.

1297
01:45:46,505 --> 01:45:47,796
We're all the same.

1298
01:45:49,171 --> 01:45:50,255
Now that I think of it,

1299
01:45:51,005 --> 01:45:53,088
those people were at least honest.

1300
01:45:55,963 --> 01:45:57,088
Yes,

1301
01:45:58,671 --> 01:46:00,005
you're right.

1302
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:02,755
I'm so pathetic.

1303
01:46:04,296 --> 01:46:06,755
I made all this stupid fuss

1304
01:46:07,296 --> 01:46:08,755
just to become a congressman.

1305
01:46:10,921 --> 01:46:11,880
But still,

1306
01:46:12,755 --> 01:46:15,005
there are lines that you shouldn't cross.

1307
01:46:16,463 --> 01:46:18,588
You might ignore someone who's dying,

1308
01:46:19,546 --> 01:46:21,296
but actually killing someone...

1309
01:46:22,421 --> 01:46:23,630
That's crossing a line.

1310
01:46:24,838 --> 01:46:26,796
Mr. Jeong didn't just die.

1311
01:46:28,588 --> 01:46:30,005
They murdered him.

1312
01:46:33,546 --> 01:46:34,463
I really do

1313
01:46:35,463 --> 01:46:37,380
want to become a congressman,

1314
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:42,005
but I just can't work with people
who murder others.

1315
01:46:47,963 --> 01:46:49,588
What can I do to help?

1316
01:46:53,421 --> 01:46:54,255
SECURITY LOCKED

1317
01:46:54,338 --> 01:46:56,421
ID CARD
SECRETARY PARK EUN-JI

1318
01:47:02,838 --> 01:47:04,880
This is evidence showing
that the Republican Party

1319
01:47:04,963 --> 01:47:07,421
made illegal funds
using the civic bank project.

1320
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:09,880
If this gets out,

1321
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,505
the project will be shut down,

1322
01:47:12,963 --> 01:47:15,005
and it would affect the Party as well.

1323
01:47:17,005 --> 01:47:20,296
And Mirae Group, which tried to profit
from the bank, won't get away unharmed.

1324
01:47:22,546 --> 01:47:23,713
And it might

1325
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:25,921
affect you, too.

1326
01:47:35,838 --> 01:47:37,546
Hey, how do you have so many followers?

1327
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:39,505
-It's not that many.
-It's awesome.

1328
01:47:39,588 --> 01:47:42,171
-Let's take a photo together.
-One, two, three.

1329
01:47:43,255 --> 01:47:44,255
One...

1330
01:48:42,213 --> 01:48:44,796
This rice wine fills me up,

1331
01:48:45,838 --> 01:48:47,046
and it's cheap, too.

1332
01:48:48,296 --> 01:48:49,463
It's a great drink.

1333
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:54,088
What do you want?

1334
01:48:55,255 --> 01:48:56,421
Money.

1335
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:59,213
Money?
Money.

1336
01:49:03,963 --> 01:49:07,463
Right, you need money to campaign.

1337
01:49:09,296 --> 01:49:11,463
All right, I'll give you money.

1338
01:49:17,963 --> 01:49:18,838
But

1339
01:49:19,588 --> 01:49:23,005
you should put people before money.

1340
01:49:25,463 --> 01:49:27,505
People who have everything
never pay for their meals.

1341
01:49:28,421 --> 01:49:32,546
The ones who want something
should come and pay for it.

1342
01:49:34,005 --> 01:49:35,713
I'll give you some pocket money.

1343
01:49:36,796 --> 01:49:39,046
And keep these records,

1344
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:41,463
instead of cutting ties with me.

1345
01:49:41,546 --> 01:49:42,921
I'm not making deals with you.

1346
01:49:44,338 --> 01:49:46,796
I give you those records, get my cash,

1347
01:49:47,713 --> 01:49:48,921
and go home.

1348
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:50,546
How much do you want?

1349
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,630
Thirty billion won.

1350
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:53,671
That idiot.

1351
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:57,796
Don't go overboard.

1352
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,671
Just give me that money!

1353
01:50:03,338 --> 01:50:06,046
You're the one who went overboard.

1354
01:50:16,546 --> 01:50:17,713
I don't negotiate.

1355
01:50:19,713 --> 01:50:21,088
Do you see that?

1356
01:50:21,171 --> 01:50:23,130
"Fixed price. Cash only."

1357
01:50:24,838 --> 01:50:26,380
He got the spelling wrong.

1358
01:50:34,755 --> 01:50:37,130
Do you think
they're the original documents?

1359
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,838
Would that jerk act like this
if he knew about his wife's video?

1360
01:50:53,005 --> 01:50:54,296
This is nice.

1361
01:50:56,213 --> 01:50:59,588
This is why people have insurances.

1362
01:51:00,421 --> 01:51:03,338
They could get bitten
by a mad dog someday,

1363
01:51:03,796 --> 01:51:06,380
or their pet could become a mad dog.

1364
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:14,671
Hey, Director Oh.

1365
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,296
That video...

1366
01:51:22,796 --> 01:51:24,338
What are you doing with the lights off?

1367
01:51:30,546 --> 01:51:31,880
This is the original.

1368
01:51:32,921 --> 01:51:35,713
If they don't answer by tomorrow,
I'll send this to the prosecution

1369
01:51:36,255 --> 01:51:39,463
and finish them once and for all.
Those dirty assholes.

1370
01:51:41,213 --> 01:51:44,338
I'm now a director.
Would you congratulate me?

1371
01:51:46,546 --> 01:51:47,588
Congratulations.

1372
01:51:50,171 --> 01:51:51,130
So

1373
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:53,546
stop this.

1374
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:56,171
-What?
-Stop all this.

1375
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:00,296
Did you even hear what I said?

1376
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:01,546
I heard you.

1377
01:52:02,505 --> 01:52:03,421
But

1378
01:52:04,088 --> 01:52:05,505
if you mess with Mr. Han,

1379
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,088
that puts me at risk, too.
Didn't you think of that?

1380
01:52:14,255 --> 01:52:15,796
Is your position

1381
01:52:16,838 --> 01:52:17,796
that important?

1382
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,130
Yes, it is.

1383
01:52:20,005 --> 01:52:21,880
You becoming a congressman
is important, too.

1384
01:52:21,963 --> 01:52:22,921
Su-yeon.

1385
01:52:23,421 --> 01:52:25,713
Just look at this first.

1386
01:52:25,796 --> 01:52:27,588
This has nothing to do with us.

1387
01:52:29,213 --> 01:52:30,505
What are you talking about?

1388
01:52:30,588 --> 01:52:33,588
Thousands of people will get hurt
if I don't do anything about it.

1389
01:52:34,213 --> 01:52:35,546
Is that so bad?

1390
01:52:35,755 --> 01:52:37,505
It's fine as long as we aren't harmed.

1391
01:52:37,588 --> 01:52:40,630
Stop that. If you say anything else,
I'm going to be disappointed in you.

1392
01:52:40,713 --> 01:52:41,963
"Disappointed"?

1393
01:52:42,713 --> 01:52:43,838
How can you say that?

1394
01:52:43,921 --> 01:52:46,005
Do you think life is easy now

1395
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,005
since you had a congress seat
handed to you?

1396
01:52:48,421 --> 01:52:50,921
Do you even know what lengths people go to

1397
01:52:51,005 --> 01:52:52,380
to get such a position?

1398
01:52:52,463 --> 01:52:54,880
No matter how hard I try,
I can't spot an old man

1399
01:52:54,963 --> 01:52:56,671
setting himself on fire.

1400
01:52:56,755 --> 01:52:57,880
Oh Su-yeon!

1401
01:52:59,005 --> 01:53:01,630
That old man died, okay?

1402
01:53:01,838 --> 01:53:02,838
Don't you get it?

1403
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:05,796
-They killed him!
-That's what I mean.

1404
01:53:06,796 --> 01:53:09,880
If you mess with Mr. Han,
do you think you'll get away with it?

1405
01:53:10,296 --> 01:53:11,838
Who do you think you are?

1406
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:15,546
I'd rather get killed
than live as his slave!

1407
01:53:15,630 --> 01:53:16,880
What about me?

1408
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,630
I've worked so hard to get here!

1409
01:53:22,838 --> 01:53:26,713
Let's just keep living as his slaves.

1410
01:53:31,463 --> 01:53:32,588
You're crazy.

1411
01:53:44,546 --> 01:53:45,838
What do you think you're doing?

1412
01:53:48,546 --> 01:53:49,505
Are you crazy?

1413
01:53:49,588 --> 01:53:51,838
-Yes, I am crazy!
-Let go.

1414
01:53:54,421 --> 01:53:55,546
Stop it!

1415
01:54:06,588 --> 01:54:08,255
Damn it.

1416
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:14,546
Do whatever you want.

1417
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,046
Are you filming me?

1418
01:54:27,255 --> 01:54:28,796
Don't film me.

1419
01:54:31,171 --> 01:54:32,796
Stop that!

1420
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:51,963
Oh Su-yeon.

1421
01:54:54,463 --> 01:54:55,588
Come over here.

1422
01:55:06,421 --> 01:55:07,505
Open the door!

1423
01:55:10,713 --> 01:55:12,213
Open the door, Su-yeon!

1424
01:55:22,796 --> 01:55:24,213
Su-yeon.

1425
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:32,046
She didn't tell you
she had fibroids, did she?

1426
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:33,630
No.

1427
01:55:33,713 --> 01:55:36,505
She felt a lot more pain than others.

1428
01:55:36,588 --> 01:55:39,671
She should have had surgery treatment,

1429
01:55:40,421 --> 01:55:42,713
but she just endured it with medicine.

1430
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:45,505
What do you mean by surgery?

1431
01:55:45,588 --> 01:55:47,005
Removing the uterus.

1432
01:55:48,921 --> 01:55:51,213
But then she'd have to give up pregnancy.

1433
01:55:56,755 --> 01:55:57,671
She is

1434
01:55:58,421 --> 01:56:00,171
not interested in having a baby.

1435
01:56:00,255 --> 01:56:01,755
She is.

1436
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:07,588
She might not have told you that,

1437
01:56:08,921 --> 01:56:12,005
but if she wasn't interested,
she would've had the surgery.

1438
01:56:14,005 --> 01:56:17,588
Su-yeon isn't in a good state right now.

1439
01:56:35,338 --> 01:56:39,963
I guess they serve food to visitors too
since this is an ob-gyn ward.

1440
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:52,546
I made a mistake too.

1441
01:56:54,755 --> 01:56:57,505
And you let it slide,

1442
01:56:58,546 --> 01:57:01,005
so I should do the same

1443
01:57:02,255 --> 01:57:04,796
and let it slide, right?
I'll be cool with it.

1444
01:57:07,421 --> 01:57:10,546
But you know, Korean men aren't cool.

1445
01:57:11,546 --> 01:57:13,130
And I am a Korean man

1446
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:15,588
to the bone.

1447
01:57:21,755 --> 01:57:22,838
Should we

1448
01:57:24,338 --> 01:57:25,546
get divorced?

1449
01:57:26,796 --> 01:57:27,713
No.

1450
01:57:28,338 --> 01:57:29,588
I don't want to.

1451
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:43,921
I'll pretend I didn't see this.

1452
01:57:46,046 --> 01:57:48,463
At least we can be happy together.

1453
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:10,630
I know you're not at an age
to worry about your later years,

1454
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,588
but you should at least

1455
01:58:13,005 --> 01:58:15,796
have some buildings bought
under your children's names.

1456
01:58:16,463 --> 01:58:19,671
Other people seem
to like cars and buildings,

1457
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:23,171
but now that I'm older, I prefer nature.

1458
01:58:24,296 --> 01:58:25,838
I want to get an island.

1459
01:58:27,296 --> 01:58:29,838
I have several in mind in Namhae County.

1460
01:58:33,463 --> 01:58:34,505
You really have

1461
01:58:35,046 --> 01:58:36,255
excellent taste.

1462
01:58:38,588 --> 01:58:41,755
Packaging the savings bank
as the civic bank was a great idea.

1463
01:58:42,338 --> 01:58:45,213
I was worried since using savings banks
was becoming too common.

1464
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:50,463
And people seemed pretty interested
in the civic bank.

1465
01:58:52,005 --> 01:58:55,088
The good thing about this nation
is that everyone feels they're lacking.

1466
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:58,421
Nobody thinks that they have enough money.

1467
01:58:58,838 --> 01:59:02,671
Everyone jumps at the chance to earn more,
even if they have to go into debt.

1468
01:59:04,796 --> 01:59:05,671
Jang Tae-jun

1469
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:07,880
won't be a problem, right?

1470
01:59:09,338 --> 01:59:12,046
The good thing about this nation
is that everyone feels wronged.

1471
01:59:12,171 --> 01:59:14,213
Nobody is satisfied with his or her place.

1472
01:59:14,546 --> 01:59:17,046
Everyone believes
that their place is at the top.

1473
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,421
Jang Tae-jun

1474
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,713
can't teach anymore
since he's had a taste of power.

1475
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:27,630
That's the power of this nation.

1476
01:59:27,963 --> 01:59:30,505
Everyone wants
what people around them have.

1477
01:59:30,755 --> 01:59:33,088
It isn't just Korea that's like this.

1478
01:59:34,171 --> 01:59:36,505
"You shall not covet
your neighbor's wife."

1479
01:59:37,338 --> 01:59:39,046
It's written in the Bible.

1480
02:00:52,546 --> 02:00:55,130
Mr. Jeong, Mr. Ahn, welcome.

1481
02:01:00,713 --> 02:01:01,796
This way, please.

1482
02:01:04,588 --> 02:01:07,380
Here they are. Zhou Zhang...

1483
02:01:09,505 --> 02:01:11,046
Let's look at the next piece.

1484
02:01:15,338 --> 02:01:16,463
What's this?

1485
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:22,255
Jason, what's going on?

1486
02:01:22,671 --> 02:01:24,671
This is different from the rehearsal.

1487
02:01:24,755 --> 02:01:28,255
Gosh. What's happening?

1488
02:01:33,588 --> 02:01:35,171
What is that?

1489
02:01:39,963 --> 02:01:41,380
I wonder what that is.

1490
02:02:51,005 --> 02:02:52,338
It's our turn now.

1491
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:54,880
Are you okay with this?

1492
02:02:56,755 --> 02:02:59,213
Yes. What about you?

1493
02:03:02,505 --> 02:03:03,921
If you're okay,

1494
02:03:05,046 --> 02:03:06,338
then it's okay with me.

1495
02:03:09,546 --> 02:03:10,546
Let's go.

1496
02:03:27,338 --> 02:03:28,546
Are you filming me?

1497
02:03:29,338 --> 02:03:30,380
Don't film me.

1498
02:03:30,921 --> 02:03:34,463
Stop that!

1499
02:03:41,296 --> 02:03:43,130
I'll film you.

1500
02:03:45,255 --> 02:03:46,505
Look at me.

1501
02:03:47,963 --> 02:03:49,296
Come on.

1502
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:08,005
I wanted to succeed.

1503
02:04:09,588 --> 02:04:11,213
I wanted people to know my name,

1504
02:04:12,463 --> 02:04:15,463
and I wanted to be the director
of this huge culture center.

1505
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:19,671
That desire

1506
02:04:20,963 --> 02:04:23,421
gave me the energy to come all this way.

1507
02:04:25,296 --> 02:04:27,421
So for this culture center's
first exhibit,

1508
02:04:28,421 --> 02:04:29,463
my first exhibit,

1509
02:04:34,046 --> 02:04:35,713
I chose to display this piece

1510
02:04:37,755 --> 02:04:39,463
that showed my desires.

1511
02:04:40,296 --> 02:04:43,380
Don't. Stop it!

1512
02:04:43,546 --> 02:04:46,713
Come on, give me the camera.

1513
02:04:46,796 --> 02:04:48,463
Give me that.

1514
02:04:49,463 --> 02:04:50,838
Give that to me.

1515
02:04:58,046 --> 02:04:59,380
Oh, my gosh.

1516
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:12,213
I was blackmailed because of this video.

1517
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:13,588
I was afraid.

1518
02:05:14,588 --> 02:05:17,213
I couldn't sleep, thinking about

1519
02:05:18,088 --> 02:05:20,005
how much I could lose.

1520
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,255
I spent so many nights awake,

1521
02:05:24,255 --> 02:05:25,630
and when dawn arrived,

1522
02:05:27,671 --> 02:05:29,755
everything became clear to me.

1523
02:05:35,963 --> 02:05:37,630
I was the one

1524
02:05:37,921 --> 02:05:39,463
who held myself back.

1525
02:05:41,213 --> 02:05:43,088
Not the ones blackmailing me.

1526
02:05:45,296 --> 02:05:47,463
It was my desire that stopped me

1527
02:05:49,546 --> 02:05:51,046
from letting go and moving on.

1528
02:05:56,088 --> 02:05:56,963
I want...

1529
02:05:58,296 --> 02:06:00,046
to find myself.

1530
02:06:01,005 --> 02:06:03,171
I want to find freedom for myself.

1531
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:08,921
I own

1532
02:06:09,421 --> 02:06:10,963
my desires.

1533
02:06:11,838 --> 02:06:13,838
I will not become a slave of them.

1534
02:06:20,296 --> 02:06:22,255
Do you think that I'm crazy?

1535
02:06:24,671 --> 02:06:26,921
You might point fingers at me,
saying I'm shameless.

1536
02:06:29,796 --> 02:06:30,921
But...

1537
02:06:33,005 --> 02:06:34,380
I'm not ashamed.

1538
02:06:36,755 --> 02:06:38,463
I'm proud of myself.

1539
02:06:39,713 --> 02:06:41,296
I'm proud of myself

1540
02:06:42,838 --> 02:06:44,338
for being shameless.

1541
02:08:32,588 --> 02:08:36,088
You got a delivery,
but there's nothing written on it.

1542
02:08:36,171 --> 02:08:38,921
PROSECUTOR CHO YEONG-SEON

1543
02:08:40,338 --> 02:08:42,713
Mirae Group’s transfer receipts,

1544
02:08:43,296 --> 02:08:45,380
mortgage loans...

1545
02:08:45,505 --> 02:08:47,713
They seem to be loan applications

1546
02:08:47,796 --> 02:08:50,338
from paper companies to the civic bank.

1547
02:08:52,046 --> 02:08:53,713
This isn't the original copy.

1548
02:09:01,338 --> 02:09:03,755
Jang Tae-jun is a nut case too.

1549
02:09:07,921 --> 02:09:09,671
Mr. Han Seung-hoon.

1550
02:09:12,380 --> 02:09:14,421
Mr. Jang Tae-jun.

1551
02:09:14,921 --> 02:09:16,588
CIVIC BANK FOUNDATION CEREMONY

1552
02:09:16,671 --> 02:09:18,380
Mr. Lee Jung-ki.

1553
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:23,546
Lastly, please give a round of applause

1554
02:09:24,046 --> 02:09:26,088
to Chairman Han of Mirae Group,

1555
02:09:26,755 --> 02:09:30,213
who donated 30 billion won
for the civic bank.

1556
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:38,380
Is the suspicion
about Mr. Jeong's death true?

1557
02:09:38,463 --> 02:09:39,963
Tell us about the incident.

1558
02:09:40,046 --> 02:09:41,463
Are you refusing to answer?

1559
02:09:41,546 --> 02:09:43,380
Do you admit to making illegal funds?

1560
02:09:44,296 --> 02:09:47,338
I will answer everything truthfully
to the prosecution.

1561
02:09:47,421 --> 02:09:50,046
-About Mirae Group's...
-Give us a comment, sir.

1562
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:50,963
Is that right?

1563
02:09:52,588 --> 02:09:55,255
You're really something.
You even gave up becoming a congressman.

1564
02:09:56,255 --> 02:09:58,921
We received the documents you sent.

1565
02:09:59,338 --> 02:10:02,421
But we noticed that you left out
some important parts.

1566
02:10:02,838 --> 02:10:04,671
You're not going to send
the original, right?

1567
02:10:07,005 --> 02:10:08,255
If everything gets out

1568
02:10:08,338 --> 02:10:10,796
and the civic bank project gets canceled,
what good will it be?

1569
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,963
Even if it's black money,

1570
02:10:14,046 --> 02:10:16,130
isn't it better to use it
for a good cause?

1571
02:10:16,338 --> 02:10:18,255
Are you admitting to the crime?

1572
02:10:18,338 --> 02:10:19,880
Mr. Han, give us a comment.

1573
02:10:19,963 --> 02:10:22,796
-Mr. Han!
-Please give us a comment.

1574
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,588
-Mr. Han!
-Give us a comment!

1575
02:10:25,088 --> 02:10:28,630
-You're admitting to the crime, right?
-Give us a comment, Mr. Han.

1576
02:10:28,713 --> 02:10:30,171
Just a moment, please.

1577
02:10:31,171 --> 02:10:34,796
I was so upset since I had
no evidence to lock him up,

1578
02:10:35,005 --> 02:10:38,255
but I hit the jackpot
when I searched his clubhouse.

1579
02:10:38,338 --> 02:10:41,046
He'll at least be in jail for assault
and attempted murder.

1580
02:10:42,296 --> 02:10:43,671
Mr. Han! Please say something!

1581
02:10:43,755 --> 02:10:44,963
Mr. Han!

1582
02:10:45,046 --> 02:10:46,255
You really are...

1583
02:10:48,088 --> 02:10:49,338
a nut case.

1584
02:10:51,505 --> 02:10:53,713
I don't see Director Oh Su-yeon here.

1585
02:10:54,005 --> 02:10:55,421
She went to work.

1586
02:10:55,505 --> 02:10:57,005
But not as the director, though.

1587
02:12:26,796 --> 02:12:27,671
Ms. Kim.

1588
02:17:03,171 --> 02:17:06,380
THE STORY, ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, AND INCIDENTS

1589
02:17:06,463 --> 02:17:09,463
PORTRAYED IN THIS PRODUCTION
ARE FICTITIOUS
