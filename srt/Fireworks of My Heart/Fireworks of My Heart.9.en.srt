00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
I'm really sorry.

579
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,730
Be careful.

580
00:34:54,170 --> 00:35:00,650
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

581
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,580
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

582
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,580
[What are you doing?]

583
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,050
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

584
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,950
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

585
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,950
[You're welcome.]

586
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:32,970
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

587
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:32,970
[You're welcome.]

588
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,830
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

589
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,830
[You're welcome.]

590
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,830
[When you're free, I want to...]

591
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:43,990
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

592
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:43,990
[You're welcome.]

593
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,970
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

594
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,970
[You're welcome.]

595
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,970
[If you want to thank me, shouldn't you treat me to a meal?]

596
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,760
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

597
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,760
[You're welcome.]

598
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,760
[If you want to thank me, shouldn't you treat me to a meal?]

599
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,940
[I've transferred money. Please check. Thank you.]

600
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,940
[You're welcome.]

601
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,940
[If you want to thank me, shouldn't you treat me to a meal?]

602
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,980
[You're welcome.]

603
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,980
[If you want to thank me, shouldn't you treat me to a meal?]

604
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,980
[Okay. What do you want to eat?]

605
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,160
Suo Jun

606
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,410
left like this.

607
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,840
I feel

608
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,110
quite sad.

609
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,200
He's strong.

610
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,710
He'll get through it.

611
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,910
But I think

612
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,550
what he said before he left

613
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,690
is quite right.

614
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,870
You

615
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,770
should have

616
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,510
more things to do other than working.

617
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,630
But I know

618
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,080
you

619
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,190
are still thinking about Xu Qin, right?

620
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,640
Mrs. He.

621
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,000
Slow down.

622
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,920
Miao.

623
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,260
Yan is back.

624
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:18,860
Mrs. He.

625
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,920
There is so much delicious food.

626
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,140
Try the bacon which was brought

627
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,300
from my hometown.

628
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,860
Great.

629
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,290
Let me put it in my bowl.

630
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,100
There is no hurry.

631
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,360
It doesn't matter. You can keep the bowl.

632
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,630
No.

633
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,060
Yan.

634
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,070
How are you?

635
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,610
Do you have a girlfriend this time?

636
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,540
Not yet.

637
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,500
No wonder your aunt is anxious.

638
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,090
You have many strengths.

639
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,680
Tell me.

640
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,540
What kind of girlfriend do you want?

641
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,720
Do you want a lively girlfriend

642
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,180
or a quiet girlfriend?

643
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,130
Dongmei.

644
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,260
This is the chili sauce

645
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,320
which was freshly made by my husband. You must try it.

646
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,360
It tastes so good.

647
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,050
I can smell it.

648
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,930
It can make my food delicious.

649
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,230
Look.

650
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,550
This young person is so nice.

651
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,940
He can help you to do the housework.

652
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,180
Kang

653
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,490
only knows how to play games.

654
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,280
Enough.

655
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,980
Kang is also a good boy.

656
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,620
I have to go back.

657
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,900
The meat is being stewed in my pot.

658
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,530
Yan, come visit us when you have time.

659
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,330
What was I talking?

660
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,010
Right.

661
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,340
I want to say

662
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,090
in today's society,

663
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,320
people have new concepts.

664
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,500
Unlike the past,

665
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,460
people don't always care about family backgrounds.

666
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,770
Aunt.

667
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,570
Just get to the point.

668
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,420
I mean

669
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,290
although we don't advocate the idea,

670
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,620
I think the old saying

671
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,570
makes sense.

672
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,580
If there's a big gap between the two people's family backgrounds,

673
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,340
it's hard for them to be happy together.

674
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,500
Here's the thing.

675
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,320
It's not just about

676
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,540
whether you're a good match

677
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,170
or whether you can

678
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,760
be in a relationship.

679
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,420
This is a matter of the two families.

680
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,010
If...

681
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,720
I know.

682
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,160
Don't worry.

683
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,360
I know what to do.

684
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,060
Where is my uncle?

685
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,810
Your uncle found a recipe

686
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,030
for Stinky Mandarin Fish

687
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,030
on the Internet.

688
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,670
He said he is going to make it for you.

689
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,880
He went to buy fish.

690
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,460
He's still not back.

691
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,750
Don't mind

692
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,050
what I just told you.

693
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,190
Don't wrong yourself.

694
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,500
The food at the hospital must be terrible.

695
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,810
Eat more.

696
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,620
The food at the hospital is not actually bad.

697
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,570
Enough, Mom.

698
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,940
Help yourself.

699
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,920
You have dark rings around your eyes.

700
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,460
Did you meet

701
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,440
Jiang Yu?

702
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,940
I texted him on WeChat and asked him out for coffee.

703
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,530
But something came up at the hospital.

704
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,430
I left first.

705
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,960
You're so busy.

706
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,990
I think you're fitted

707
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,490
to work at a research institute

708
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,760
in a university.

709
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,420
Let me get you a new job.

710
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,470
I think my job is good.

711
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,660
I don't think so.

712
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,050
You're getting thinner.

713
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,320
I introduced

714
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,660
so many girls

715
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,780
to your brother.

716
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,170
He likes none of them.

717
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,310
I don't know what you're thinking.

718
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,070
Isn't it good to get married early?

719
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,110
Mom.

720
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,560
There is a boy

721
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,380
I have feelings for.

722
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,790
I

723
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,570
like him.

724
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,650
Is he Jiang Yu?

725
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,350
No.

726
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,500
Who is he?

727
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,330
When I

728
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,890
studied abroad,

729
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,320
did you receive

730
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,110
any letters from someone?

731
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,010
What?

732
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,500
Nothing.

733
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
I'm full.

734
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,610
I'm leaving.

735
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,860
I have work to do tomorrow.

736
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,950
Qin.

737
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,110
Don't force me

738
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,220
to be a cruel person again.

739
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,740
[Xu Qin, how are you?]

740
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,020
[I don't know what you're doing now.]

741
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,020
[Song Yan]
