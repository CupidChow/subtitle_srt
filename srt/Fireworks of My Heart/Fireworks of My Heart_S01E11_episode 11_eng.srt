00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:34,712
   

3
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:37,105
   

4
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:40,072
   

5
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,120
 Qin Qin, 

6
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,083
 it's time to go home. 

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,040
 Who is he? 

8
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,759
 My brother. 

9
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,319
 You think I'm stupid? 

10
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,119
 It's true. 

11
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,419
 You're not leaving with him. 

12
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,680
 Let her go. 

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,719
 It's none of your business! 

14
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,680
 Stop fighting. Stop! 

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,399
 Stop fighting, Brother! 

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,960
 Stop fighting. That's enough. 

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,789
 Whom will you go with? 

18
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,239
 With whom? 

19
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,339
 Song Yan, I have to go home. 

20
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,919
She's drunk. She'll catch a cold in the cool wind.

21
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,540
Adjust the backseat vent lower so it doesn't blow straight at her.

22
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,879
Where are we heading?

23
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,864
To my parents' house.

24
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,719
You're taking her back there in her state? Are you crazy?

25
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,759
My parents will be asleep at this hour. They won't see her drunk.

26
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,560
Meng Yanchen.

27
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,623
She was in a bad mood, so she drank to vent a little.

28
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:16,190
Is this really necessary?

29
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,571
Can't you be more understanding of your sister?

30
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,779
 You don't like me that much, do you? 

31
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,879
 Why won't you walk toward me? 

32
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,160
 You don't like me that much, do you? 

33
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,240
 You definitely don't like me that much. Why did you say that to me? 

34
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,600
 Why did you say you liked me so much you'd give up your life? 

35
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,279
  I believed you! 

36
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,880
  I believed you! I believed you! 

37
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,119
  Sister. 

38
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,347
 What's the matter? 

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,040
 Brother, I'm scared. 

40
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,639
 It's all right. I'm here. 

41
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,139
 Don't be scared. 

42
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,779
 Come, you can sleep with me. 

43
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,818
Brother, are you going to look for her?

44
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,000
Brother, I want to remind you.

45
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,360
She was drunk and acted out of character. Those words didn't mean anything.

46
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,043
The problem between you two is still there.

47
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,959
I know.

48
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,659
Then why are you still going to her?

49
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,320
You're 29, not 19 years old.

50
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,380
If you go through this ordeal again, you'll totally burn out.

51
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,920
Zhai Miao,

52
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,200
after what happened last night,

53
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,539
what will happen now if I don't go see her?

54
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,859
She probably won't ever look for you again.

55
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,980
That's why I'm going to her.

56
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,159
Brother, do you really like her that much?

57
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,340
You said it yourself. It's better when you don't see her.

58
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,539
Then you don't need to see her.

59
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,939
But she's here, so I have to get her.

60
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,699
She's here?

61
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,583
Where? How come I didn't see her?

62
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,039
All right. Go to school.

63
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,060
Stop meddling in my affairs.

64
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,139
Brother!

65
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,759
- Brother! 
 - Today's soy milk looks very fresh.

66
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,639
Dad, Mom, help me stop my brother.

67
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,399
- What's wrong? 
 - He's looking for Xu Qin again.

68
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,391
He put on a front and denied his love for her.

69
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,799
Now the girl waved at him, and he's rushing over to her.

70
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,320
Take this, Miao Miao.

71
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,840
- Go have breakfast inside. 
 - That's right.

72
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
- Go eat breakfast. Open the door. 
 - Dad.

73
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
- Just go inside. 
 - Hurry up. This is heavy.

74
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,468
Hurry up and go.

75
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,279
Talk to him.

76
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,879
You're going to look for Xu Qin?

77
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,320
Yan'er,

78
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,159
after your dad left, you were raised by me and your aunt.

79
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,320
We treat you like our own son.

80
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,759
I know very well how you are.

81
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,679
You're more bark than bite.

82
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,679
You said you don't like her and despise her.

83
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,200
Those were lies.

84
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,689
No matter how much you've suffered, the moment you see her, everything...

85
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,120
Since childhood,

86
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,720
you've been stubborn.

87
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,440
When it comes to love,

88
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,519
you never listen to your aunt's and my input.

89
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,240
If you wish to go, then go.

90
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,240
However, just this time.

91
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,559
This one time.

92
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,589
No matter what,

93
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,559
it's not right for them to trample on a person time and time again.

94
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,249
Understand, Child?

95
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,950
   

96
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,820
Hello?

97
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
It's me.

98
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,839
I know.

99
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,740
Are you sober?

100
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,639
Where are you?

101
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,960
At home.

102
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,540
 I'll come see you. 

103
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,359
I'm at my parents' house.

104
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:57,100
Wait for me. I’ll be there.

105
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Okay.

106
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,279
Miss Xu, is that your friend? He's waited a long time.

107
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,479
You weren't home, so I didn't let him in.

108
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,299
- Got it. Thanks. 
 - No problem.

109
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

110
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,608
Have you had breakfast?

111
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,720
Not yet.

112
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,580
What would you like to eat?

113
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,060
Porridge.

114
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,320
What kind?

115
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,020
Plain porridge.

116
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,859
I don't think there's any nearby.

117
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,999
There's rice and water at my house.

118
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,700
Let's go.

119
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,240
You don't even cook.

120
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,840
Why do you have rice?

121
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,914
The hospital gave it to us.

122
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,000
When did they give this out?

123
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,487
I don't remember.

124
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,000
Is it expired?

125
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,279
Rice doesn't expire, does it?

126
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,617
Do you even have common sense?

127
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,699
Just that bit of rice?

128
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
It expands when cooked.

129
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,760
I'll get a bowl.

130
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,919
Do you never cook at home?

131
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,840
Then what do you eat?

132
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,340
Takeout?

133
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,480
Sometimes, I get food delivery.

134
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,697
Sometimes, I eat at the hospital canteen.

135
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,297
What about you?

136
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,950
The station has a canteen.

137
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,720
If I'm off, and I'm home,

138
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
my aunt cooks.

139
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,140
Aunt Zhai's cooking is delicious.

140
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,720
How's the food at the station canteen?

141
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,399
Not too bad.

142
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,799
Yours?

143
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,879
So-so.

144
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,679
It's not very good.

145
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,559
Have some water.

146
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,860
It smells good.

147
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,640
You must be hungry.

148
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,040
It's almost done.

149
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,620
Okay.

150
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,859
Xu Qin.

151
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,259
Do you remember...

152
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,841
what you said yesterday?

153
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:35,609
I remember parts of it, but not everything.

154
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
You said...

155
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,932
you'd never come toward me again.

156
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,240
Do you remember that part?

157
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,639
You're not drunk now, right?

158
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,019
So are you...

159
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,566
still going to say that now?

160
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,839
I don't know.

161
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,839
What if I go toward you?

162
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,739
Can you wait?

163
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,408
Waiting without certainty,

164
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,182
even I feel bad for you.

165
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,580
I don't know...

166
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,179
what I should do right now.

167
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,599
I don't know how to ask you...

168
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,180
or ask myself.

169
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,820
I also don't know...

170
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,640
how to face you or my family.

171
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,180
- I... 
 - I know you're scared.

172
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:19,680
I just want you to know.

173
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,240
If you're determined enough,

174
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,675
I will bear whatever happens after.

175
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,319
If you are brave enough,

176
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,450
then I'll shoulder it.

177
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,299
But I get it.

178
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,559
The words sound nice,

179
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,699
but they're useless.

180
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,440
I don't have enough courage.

181
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,560
To be honest,

182
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,060
I feel bad that I put you

183
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,679
in this predicament.

184
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,654
I know your good intention.

185
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,119
What I can promise you is to treat you well.

186
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,960
I'll be good to you every day.

187
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,279
I'll never betray you. I'll not be indifferent.

188
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,219
I'll do everything I can to give you a better life.

189
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,920
What I cannot guarantee

190
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,799
is whether or not my commitment to you fits your

191
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,060
or your family's requirements.

192
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,940
I know you're in a difficult position.

193
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,879
I also know...

194
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,948
that if we do get together...

195
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
you'd be aggrieved.

196
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,539
I understand that.

197
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,420
But...

198
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,340
you can't keep barging into my life recklessly like this.

199
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,019
Be together...

200
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,585
or never see each other again.

201
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,156
Make your choice.

202
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
 Did I not tell you? 

203
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,019
 Stay away from those shady people. 

204
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,179
 You don't have any self respect at all. 

205
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,179
 If you insist on being with him, 

206
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,620
 then forget about attending the university. 

207
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,199
 You can discard this family, too. 

208
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,079
 From now on, you can't call me "Mom" anymore. 

209
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,520
 Mom. 

210
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,339
 Qin Qin. 

211
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,457
 Please listen to me. 

212
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,881
 I only want the best for you. 

213
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,580
 I'm willing to give you the world. 

214
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,539
 But if... 

215
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,519
 you're going to act willfully and disregard this family, 

216
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,599
 then I'm going to find a way to send you away. 

217
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,279
 There's no use pleading to your father or brother. 

218
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,859
 I will do what I said. 

219
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,359
 Mom. 

220
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,259
 Qin Qin. 

221
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,640
 His parents aren't good people. 

222
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,240
 What do you expect from their child? 

223
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:12,240
 I'm truly disappointed in you. 

224
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,580
 You break my heart 

225
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,300
 because of a guy like that? 

226
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,559
 The care and love I gave you all these years... 

227
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,000
 has all been in vain. 

228
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,159
 Mom. 

229
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,219
 I'll do as you say. 

230
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:59,860
♫  If saying goodbye is to have another chance to meet,  ♫

231
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,180
♫  love follows a parabolic curve after missing someone  ♫

232
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:12,580
♫  When time goes on from where we started, we grow distant and frequently pass by each other  ♫

233
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:22,490

234
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,970
♫  it is also the dividing line after sleepless nights  ♫

235
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:36,230
♫  Spring has already begun to shed its leaves, and it will snow in July  ♫

236
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,860
♫  I just missed the heavy rain, the summer I couldn't have  ♫

237
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:49,530
♫  Are you those drifting clouds, one after another?  ♫

238
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,430
♫  I wish I were the wind passing by you  ♫

♫  Why can't I get around this unchangeable summer?  ♫

241
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,390

242
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:21,390
♫  Those words that I didn't have the courage to say  ♫

243
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,759
Why are you here so early?

244
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm picking you up to go to work.

245
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,660
Have you eaten?

246
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,460
Yes.

247
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:42,819
Let's go.

248
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,960
 Actually, you didn't have to take me home yesterday. 

249
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,580
Even if you didn't remind me,

250
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,058
I wouldn't dare resist.

251
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,700
What are you scared of?

252
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,444
Do you think because I'm an adult,

253
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:11,460
I've strengthened my wings and will leave everything behind by flying away?

254
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,860
Do you know how an animal trainer tames animals?

255
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,639
While the animal is young,

256
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,979
they beat it, starve it, and lock it up.

257
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:28,860
But they also adore it, feed it, and care for it.

258
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,839
When the animal grows up and has more power,

259
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,340
when they see the whip and food bowl, they'll no longer resist.

260
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,439
It no longer dares to return to the wild.

261
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,300
All of you say

262
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,899
he's not good enough for me.

263
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,919
But the fact is, I'm not good enough for him.

264
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,340
When I'm with him,

265
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
I feel like...

266
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,399
I could hurt him everywhere I go.

267
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,201
Because the truth is, I'm a despicable person.

268
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,270
I want everything,

269
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:12,499
but I'm scared of losing everything.

270
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,680
I want Dad, Mom, and you.

271
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,359
I also want Song Yan.

272
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,460
I...

273
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,639
I don't have the courage or the guts.

274
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,219
I can't bear to face anything. I only know to run away.

275
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:38,259
I'm incapable of love,

276
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,079
nor do I have the right to love.

277
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,640
I don't deserve love from anyone.

278
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,649
Let's leave the country.

279
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,319
Qin Qin, let's go abroad together.

280
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:05,520
We'll never return, okay?

281
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,659
Goodbye, Brother.

282
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,279
Well? The air is good, right?

283
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,240
You should come outdoors more often.

284
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,920
You really know what the hospital staff needs, Mrs. Meng.

285
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,440
 We're overwhelmed by the smell of disinfectant in the hospital. 

286
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,019
 It's nice to be out enjoying the fresh air. 

287
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,759
 Assistant Director Liu, I was going to ask you. 

288
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,680
My child has been working at the hospital for a while now.

289
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,983
How is it?

290
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,322
Are the seniors and professors happy with her performance?

291
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,400
Very pleased.

292
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,359
Junior Dr. Xu is serious about work.

293
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,319
And she's compassionate with patients.

294
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,180
The hospital has chosen her to be a key candidate for promotion.

295
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,720
I thank you for the guidance on my daughter's behalf.

296
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,420
It's my pleasure.

297
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,559
Department Chief Xu.

298
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,413
May I know why my interview application was rejected?

299
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,979
Trying to get a promotion through connections doesn't work with me.

300
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,620
Go back and tell your family.

301
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,825
Quit asking Assistant Director Liu to contact me.

302
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:52,599
My medical team needs only young people who have a sincere passion for the job,

303
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:58,119
but not someone who thinks they can get what they want by taking shortcuts.

304
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,179
But you know I have the best skills among the young doctors.

305
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,640
A doctor needs to have comprehensive skills.

306
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,981
I don't think you're the best at that.

307
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,079
If you talk about being arrogant,

308
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,974
you might be the strongest.

309
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,480
Department Chief Xu,

310
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,639
honestly, I believe Dr. Xu has what it takes.

311
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,559
Maybe you should reconsider.

312
00:34:22,472 --> 00:34:25,992
   

313
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,438
- Xiao Yang. 
 - Yes.

314
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,360
Did you hear anything about the new instructor?

315
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,960
Is he easy to get along with? What kind of character is he?

316
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,400
I don't know if he's easy to get along with.

317
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,920
But if Brother Yan can get along with him, then I can, too.

318
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,360
No need to think so much. We'll know when he arrives this afternoon.

319
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,039
I heard he came from the headquarters.

320
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,159
He comes from a prominent family.

321
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,400
Why isn't he sitting in an air-conditioned office

322
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,579
but is choosing to come here instead?

323
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,164
I reckon he decided to get a jumpstart and gold plating. 
  (T/N: enhance this resume ) 

324
00:34:57,164 --> 00:35:00,979
I won't be surprised if he doesn't last long.

325
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:02,960
Knowing our captain's temper,

326
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,519
who can say whether he'll get gold plated or skinned?

327
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:10,600
Honestly, I miss Brother Jun.

328
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,379
An instructor like Brother Jun?

329
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,039
There won't be a second one.

330
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,480
In the past, we were tired of his nagging.

331
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,999
Now that it's quiet, I'm not used to it.

332
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,960
Brother Chi.

333
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,800
Brother Yi. The new instructor is about to arrive.

334
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,920
- Not this afternoon? 
 - They pushed it forward?

335
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,519
Speak of the devil. Let's go welcome him.

336
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,767
All right! Stop what you're doing!

337
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,280
Let's go greet the new instructor!

338
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,099
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

339
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,320
Hello, Captain Song.

340
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,599
Long time no see.

341
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,519
You said I could look for you at Shili Tai Fire and Rescue Station.

342
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,479
Hello.

343
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:04,760
Where's the new instructor?

344
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,460
I'm the one.

345
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,699
This is my assignment order.

346
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
You are Jiang Yu?

347
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,748
I guess you don't remember me from last time.

348
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,840
Then allow me to formally introduce myself.

349
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,119
My name is Jiang Yu.

350
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm the new instructor based at Shili Tai Fire and Rescue Station.

351
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,920
Starting today, I'll be joining the team.

352
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,535
Pleased to meet everyone.

353
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,800
- Yang Chi. 
 - Here.

354
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,239
What are you people doing just standing there?

355
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,960
Are you all electric poles or what?

356
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,919
- Hello, Sir. 
 - Welcome, welcome.

357
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,519
- Don't mention it. 
 - Thanks for coming.

358
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,541
Don't mention it, Guys. I can manage, yes.

359
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,599
The instructor has a kind face. He should be friendly.

360
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,519
But why does it seem like there's tension between him and Captain?

361
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,719
Brother.

362
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,619
Right now, could you just zip that big mouth of yours?

363
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,090
Let's go.

364
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,219
Close the door.

365
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,410
   

366
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:33,059
Thank you for coming to the interview.

367
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,781
I hope there's another opportunity to see you again.

368
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,920
- Thanks, Sir. 
 - Keep up the good work, okay?

369
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,999
All right, that's all for today.

370
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,539
Department Chief Xu.

371
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,407
What are you doing here?

372
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,559
Your name is not on the list of interviewees.

373
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,559
I'm sorry. I wish to fight for my spot.

374
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:02,320
The interview session has concluded.

375
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,119
Please take a look at my application

376
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,159
before you decide whether I deserve a chance.

377
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,519
I believe that a hospital is where professionalism is valued.

378
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,920
If you think I'm lacking in certain areas outside of my expertise,

379
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,959
please tell me so that I can learn from you.

380
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,600
Are you mocking me?

381
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,099
No, Sir. Don't get me wrong.

382
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,719
Fine.

383
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,819
Tell me, then. Why do you want to be a doctor?

384
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,000
Don't be nervous.

385
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,944
Think before you answer.

386
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,620
Because...

387
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,159
the job is secure.

388
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,719
I've got to hand it to Dr. Xu.

389
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,239
Knowing how the director is, she still dared to test his patience.

390
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,960
I heard from the Assistant Director,

391
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,900
when Dr. Xu answered the first question like that,

392
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,360
she almost passed out and thought it was over.

393
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,440
Who would've thought she could pass the interview in the end?

394
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,639
Odd, isn't it?

395
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,099
What to do? She has the ability. You can't fault her for being smug.

396
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,000
It's going to get interesting.

397
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,159
She's now on the same team as the ultra-smug Yang Si Jia.

398
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,679
Let's wait and see what drama unfolds.

399
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,660
Am I smug?

400
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,560
Dr. Yang.

401
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,679
Where's my phone?

402
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,719
- Where's my phone? 
 - Maybe you left it in the lobby.

403
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,414
I'll go look for it.

404
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,440
Dr. Xu!

405
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,440
Welcome to the team.

406
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,380
Let's shake hands.

407
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,239
I just washed my hands, so I won't shake hands.

408
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,559
Well, here's a gentle reminder.

409
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,106
Department Chief Xu is very strict.

410
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,440
Be prepared to suffer while working under him.

411
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,000
Being strict is a good thing.

412
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,280
I don't think enduring is a form of suffering.

413
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,880
 Sir, upstairs is where the dormitory and entertainment space are. 
   

414
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
Through the courtyard, we'll come to the canteen.

415
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,099
It's so big.

416
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,679
The fire station has a dog?

417
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,800
Yes, our captain took him in.

418
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,039
- What's its name? 
 - Xiao Meng.

419
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,519
Xiao Meng is well-trained by our captain, almost as good as a professional K9.

420
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,780
Hello, Xiao Meng.

421
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,480
- Sir! 
 - Why did it bite?

422
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,760
- It's okay. Calm down. It doesn't bite. 
 - It doesn't?

423
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,239
- Sir. 
 - That's enough. Down.

424
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,480
Let me show you the canteen. It's that way.

425
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,519
Nice to meet you, Master Meng.

426
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,380
Captain Song.

427
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,115
Yang Chi gave me a tour of the station already.

428
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,719
I have some things I'd like to know more about from you.

429
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:27,800
You should rest early.

430
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,960
I normally sleep late.

431
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,660
I'm still wide awake.

432
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,199
I need to go on patrol.

433
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,320
Let me go with you.

434
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:39,640
