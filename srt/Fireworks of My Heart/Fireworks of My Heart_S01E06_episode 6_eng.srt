00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,262
   

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,164
   

4
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,067
   

5
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,709
- You're back. 
 - You're back, Dr. Xu.

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,706
Dr. Xu, you were impressive today.

7
00:01:56,706 --> 00:01:58,195
You saved someone whose heart had stopped.

8
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:00,362
I was just doing my job.

9
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,925
The family members of the patient kept thanking you.

10
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,046
Do you feel a sense of accomplishment being a doctor now?

11
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:10,245
Don't you find the gratitude from the family touching?

12
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,100
They will soon forget.

13
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,168
Why would they?

14
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,846
If a police officer saved you, would you forget about them quickly too?

15
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,455
I would.

16
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,592
Humans are forgetful creatures by nature.

17
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:43,071
Have you ever seen a patient come back to thank their doctor after going home?

18
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,209
She's such a weirdo.

19
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,820
Bye bye, Dr. Xu.

20
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,039
 - Bye, Dr. Xu. 
 - Bye bye.  

21
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:01,848
Actually, I think being thanked once at that time should be enough.

22
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,787
Besides, don't you feel proud when patients and their families express their gratitude?

23
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,586
For me, treating patients and saving lives is just my duty.

24
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,166
So you think this is merely fulfilling your duty

25
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,285
and you don't need others' gratitude.

26
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:21,145
I find your attitude quite unique.

27
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,040
Whether or not the patients feel grateful is their choice,

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,207
and it doesn't affect my attitude.

29
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,943
Medicine as a scientific field has its limitations.

30
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,380
If a patient's condition goes beyond the limits of medicine,

31
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,766
even the most skilled doctor can't do anything.

32
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:38,398
We are just ordinary people. We have no superpowers.

33
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,013
That's the reality.

34
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,556
Dr. Xu,

35
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,359
you really are an unlikable doctor.

36
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,528
We already have a likable doctor like you in our hospital, Dr. Yang.

37
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,818
We don't need one more like me.

38
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:52,199
Xu Qin, what does that mean?

39
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,679
Are you mocking me?

40
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,999
I genuinely meant it as a compliment.

41
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,879
What are you doing here?

42
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,215
I'm busy as hell here.

43
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,150
I missed you.

44
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,759
I was nearby, so I'm paying you a visit.

45
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,421
As if.

46
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,057
I mean it. It's been a few days since I saw you. And I missed you.

47
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,358
I want to talk to you.

48
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,825
I don't have time. Go somewhere else.

49
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,997
I really need to talk to you.

50
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,959
I need a favor.

51
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,605
What favor do you need from me?

52
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,403
I'm working on a project recently.

53
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,356
I wanted to ask you to invest in it.

54
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:35,576
Are you mocking me?

55
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,549
Don't you have money yourself?

56
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,647
I'll be honest with you.

57
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,218
The thing is, I'm doing this for my ex-girlfriend, Zhan Xiao Yao.

58
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,585
As you know,

59
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,512
she hasn't been doing anything these past couple of years.

60
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:49,790
So I thought...

61
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,420
So you want to use me as an excuse?

62
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,995
Come on, don't put it like that.

63
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,023
You're a big investor, right?

64
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:59,879
Just let a little profit slip through your fingers to us.

65
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,300
Besides, I thought it would be fun for a few of us to do something together.

66
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,240
Wouldn't it be great?

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,733
The money that she needs, I can lend it to her personally.

68
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,178
Leave me out of your project.

69
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,246
I'm not interested in small projects like this.

70
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:17,484
- You... 
 - I have some work to attend to.

71
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,884
You should go.

72
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,279
I'm going to finish my tea first.

73
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,113
Finish it alone then.

74
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,773
Recently, Qin'er has been...

75
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,066
If you have something to say, just spit it out, otherwise leave.

76
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,147
Weren't you just saying that you're busy?

77
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,067
Now you suddenly have time?

78
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,322
She met with Song Yan.

79
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:59,039
Aren't you afraid that they would get back together?

80
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,020
She won't.

81
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,620
Right.

82
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,859
With Auntie Fu pressing down on her like a mountain,

83
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:08,446
she can only suppress herself more and more.

84
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:12,377
That's why I'm worried about her mental well-being.

85
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,179
I think Qin Qin is doing fine.

86
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,279
That's according to your standards.

87
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,573
The way I see it, you also have issues.

88
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:26,053
Both of you are living an unhappy life.

89
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,173
And there's nothing you can do about it.

90
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:30,566
You have such a mother, after all.

91
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:33,727
I mean, look at you young people,

92
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,360
you have everything, but you just can't live happily.

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,633
It's always cloudy and gloomy.

94
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,933
What's the point?

95
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,140
Qin'er hasn't had any friends since she came back.

96
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,399
She's all alone.

97
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,319
Our girl has grown up.

98
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,980
She doesn't have any heart-to-heart talks with me anymore.

99
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,784
And of course, she never shared them with you, either.

100
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,197
Tonight, invite her to my place for a drink.

101
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,099
I'll also invite Xiao Yao.

102
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,236
Introduce them to each other. Let them be friends.

103
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,227
Their personalities are too different.

104
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:20,173
They can't become friends.

105
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,845
The greater the differences, the more likely they can become good friends.

106
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,913
Do you want to bet on it?

107
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,149
- What a waste of time. 
 - I'm being serious.

108
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,959
I mean, look at us.

109
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,787
Haven't we been friends for so long?

110
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,173
Why? Do you have a problem with this?

111
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:37,599
It's not that.

112
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,680
But you talk too much nonsense, and it's hurting my ears.

113
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,180
Just go.

114
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,266
All right.

115
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:57,079
Cheer up.

116
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,478
Be good to yourself.

117
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,424
Otherwise, I'll feel sorry for you.

118
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,466
Allow me to introduce.

119
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,801
Qin'er.

120
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,836
This is Xu Qin, my sister.

121
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,519
This is Zhan Xiaoyao, my ex-girlfriend.

122
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,041
Hello.

123
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,441
Hello.

124
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:38,284
Brother.

125
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,682
You two really are siblings.

126
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,726
You are both aloof and quiet.

127
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,559
I can't stand your OCD. 
  (T/N: Obsessive-compulsive disorder) 

128
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,326
Are your eyes microscopes?

129
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,695
Everything seems dirty to you, huh?

130
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,864
- Mind your own business. 
 - You're quite a character.

131
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,439
Xiao Yixiao, you're always poking your nose into others' affairs.

132
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,165
You can't tell me what to do.

133
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,070
Where's your new boyfriend?

134
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,605
Bring him over and let me check on him for you.

135
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,807
I didn't see you bringing your girlfriend either.

136
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,389
- We broke up. 
 - Congratulations.

137
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,946
Get us a glass.

138
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,539
Xu Qin, do you have a boyfriend?

139
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,727
I don't.

140
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,329
You have to get one. Don't be like Meng Yanchen.

141
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,653
Every time I see him, I think he's about to become a monk.

142
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:34,234
I'm afraid I'll have to visit him at the temple next time.

143
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,639
Director Zhan, return the investment fund to me.

144
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,975
Meng Yanchen is like a god among mortals. No one in this world is worthy of you.

145
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,039
Does that mean I don't have to repay that money now?

146
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,159
Xu Qin, how about we find a boyfriend right here today?

147
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,335
Don't corrupt my sister.

148
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,352
Xu Qin.

149
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,179
Here's to our first meeting. I'll bottom up. Be my guest.

150
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,533
- I like you. 
 - Slow down.

151
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,969
Can you handle your drinks? Don't get drunk right away.

152
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,838
Or Meng Yachen is going to scold me.

153
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,879
I don't think you can outdrink me.

154
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,879
Well, let's find out about that today.

155
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,279
Xiao Yixiao.

156
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,413
Bring us shot glasses.

157
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,813
Yes, Sir.

158
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:32,058
- You girls are really doing this? 
 - Of course.

159
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,494
- All right. Here. 
 - We will start first.

160
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,039
Take it slow.

161
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,600
Easy, girls.

162
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
 Xiao Yixiao, stop pulling me. 

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,519
- I'm not drunk. 
 - You are unbelievable.

164
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,842
Why didn't you stop if you knew you couldn't handle it?

165
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,810
- You're an adult. 
 - How could I possibly lose? 
    

166
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,280
- Zhan Xiaorao, when it comes to embarrassing yourself, no one can beat you. 
 - How could I've lost?

167
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,815
You lost.

168
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,054
No, I didn't, Xu Qin. Let's keep drinking.

169
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:58,879
Sit tight.

170
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,353
My car is over there. I'll take her home.

171
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,012
- Okay, I'll take this one home then. 
 - Xu Qin...

172
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,039
I want to sleep with Xu Qin.

173
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,080
Get up. Listen, Zhan Xiaorao, you're now blacklisted at my bar.

174
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,529
Give me a hand.

175
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,287
Xu Qin!

176
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:13,159
I don't want to go back. I want to drink!

177
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,600
 Just stay still. 

178
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
We're here.

179
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,700
Get in.

180
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,706
Hold the bag.

181
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,716
Excuse me. Is this your car?

182
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,399
Yes. Why?

183
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,354
I scratched it by accident.

184
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,754
Where?

185
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,727
- It's okay. 
 - Sorry?

186
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,460
No need to pay for the damage.

187
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:21,399
 Auntie and I are here to pick you up. 

188
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,624
 And Brother Yanchen too. 

189
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,065
 We are taking you home. 

190
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
 Yanchen, 

191
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,579
 stay here with your sister. 

192
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:42,959
 - Okay. 
 - We'll be right back. 

193
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,287
 Qin Qin, 

194
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,672
 I'm your brother. 

195
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:08,385
 Qin Qin, I like cleanliness. 

196
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,845
 This is too dirty. 

197
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,279
 Let's throw it away. 

198
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,779
 Let's get rid of it. 

199
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,679
 It's so dirty. 

200
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,399
 Look. 

201
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,200
 Your fingernails are all black. 

202
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,256
 I am Meng Huaijin, Xu Haishan's comrade. 
  

203
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,458
 This is my wife, Fu Wenying. 

204
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,229
 The Civil Affairs Bureau is working on our adoption procedures. 

205
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:38,123
 We are taking the child home today. 

206
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,060
 How did you... 

207
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,399
 Yanchen. 

208
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,539
 - Let's go. 
 - Okay. 

209
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,981
 Come on. 

210
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,026
You're up.

211
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:22,346
Brother, you slept here last night?

212
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,213
I cooked the dumplings in your fridge.

213
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,913
Eat while they're warm.

214
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,520
Try them.

215
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,666
The shrimp are quite big. It probably wrapped the whole thing.

216
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:47,701
That's why I love eating this. It really is good.

217
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:52,439
I didn't expect you would get along so well with Zhan Xiaorao.

218
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,630
She's very likable.

219
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,200
So are you.

220
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,599
I'm annoying...

221
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,418
and unlikable.

222
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:12,967
Qin Qin, don't say that.

223
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:17,285
I tried to reconcile with Song Yan,

224
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,488
but he turned me down.

225
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,713
Actually,

226
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,352
it's better that he did.

227
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,548
If he had agreed,

228
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:41,352
I wouldn't know what to do.

229
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,624
I don't even dare to tell Mom.

230
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,066
He must have realized it, too.

231
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,870
I wasn't resolute,

232
00:18:57,813 --> 00:18:59,812
so he detested me.

233
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,419
I must have looked ugly at that time.

234
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,079
Brother,

235
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,749
after I went abroad, did he ever write me a letter?

236
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:20,679
It's okay.

237
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,875
Keep eating.

238
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,475
It's getting cold.

239
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,392
Mom knows it's your day off.

240
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,365
She asked me to tell you to go home.

241
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,871
Got it.

242
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,464
Take a 20-minute break right here.

243
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,873
Next up, rope climbing.

244
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:38,172
The break time in between is too short.

245
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,920
Let them rest a little longer.

246
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,999
Ten minutes.

247
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,199
Ten...

248
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:52,640
When parents argue, the ones who suffer are the unlucky children.

249
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,319
Just shut up. You know very well why they are fighting.

250
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,319
Have some water.

251
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,338
 Hi, is there anyone home in 1101? 

252
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,238
 We are firefighters. 

253
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,145
Coming!

254
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,628
Hi, Miss Xu.

255
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,031
They're from the firefighting force. The child from Unit 1201

256
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,618
climbed out onto the balcony and got stuck in the air conditioning unit.

257
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:15,925
His parents aren't home.

258
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:17,926
Can we borrow your balcony?

259
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,339
Please come in.

260
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,919
Old Jiang, put on the gear.

261
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,860
Set up another safety pivot point.

262
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,340
Kid, I've got you. I'm holding on to you.

263
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,979
Don't move, okay?

264
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,680
You mustn't move.

265
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,380
What's your name?

266
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,019
Liu... Liu Siqi.

267
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:11,920
Liu Siqi,

268
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,327
that's a really good name.

269
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:14,693
You are very brave

270
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:18,240
as long as you don't move. Stay still, okay?

271
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,740
We will get you up in no time.

272
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,545
Ready. It's fine, it's okay.

273
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,245
Push him up!

274
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,324
Come.

275
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:45,440
Easy.

276
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Lower. Easy.

277
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,840
Hold him.

278
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,199
Hurry, hurry.

279
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,579
Easy.

280
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,779
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

281
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,389
Come on.

282
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,801
Don't cry. Daddy and Mommy will be here soon.

283
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,921
Sorry for the trouble.

284
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:35,960
Okay, hang in there. The pain will go away soon.

285
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,279
Stretch your arm.

286
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
Come here.

287
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,061
Thank you, thank you.

288
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,867
- Let me. Captain, are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

289
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,167
Don't worry.

290
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:07,012
You're such a brave boy.

291
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,220
- Done. 
 - It's done.

292
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:32,032
Qi Qi! Qi Qi!

293
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,467
My baby boy!

294
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,766
Slow down.

295
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,180
Are you hurt?

296
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,569
You scared Mommy.

297
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,086
Don't be afraid, Qi Qi. Daddy is here now.

298
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:42,779
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

299
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:46,559
Listen, don't leave your child alone at home again.

300
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,049
We've been really busy with work.

301
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,617
We had no other choice today.

302
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,866
We will never do this again.

303
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,680
And seal off your balcony.

304
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,400
- It's too dangerous. 
 - You're right.

305
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
The glass has been broken for a long time.

306
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,491
This is your fault.

307
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,627
I kept telling you to seal it, yet you just installed a net there.

308
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,995
What good does it do?

309
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,164
I shouldn't have been careless. I'm sorry for the trouble.

310
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,132
- Thank you. 
 - Don't forget that.

311
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,972
Take your son to the hospital for an examination first.

312
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:10,571
Say "thank you" to them now. Go on.

313
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:13,032
Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Ma'am.

314
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,473
We are leaving now. Thank you.

315
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,209
- Seal off your balcony immediately. 
 - I will, I will.

316
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,212
Miss Xu, thank you for your help.

317
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,557
Thank you for your help.

318
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,067
Hi.

319
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:35,900
Can you give me Song Yan's WeChat ID?

320
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,540
- I... 
 - Please.

321
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,568
Don't tell him you got it from me.

322
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:43,168
Thank you.

323
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:03,522
It's all done.

324
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,492
Have a cup of tea before you go.

325
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,686
You've sweated a lot just now. You need to rehydrate.

326
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,165
It's a bit hot.

327
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,205
Why don't you sit for a while?

328
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:15,667
Never mind.

329
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,139
I should go and pack up the equipment.

330
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:19,298
Let me treat your wound.

331
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:22,942
Have a seat.

332
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,997
You must have hurt your wrist, right?

333
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:43,912
Give me your hand.

334
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:44,200
Are you usually busy at work?

335
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:46,859
It's all right.

336
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,059
There's always something to do every day, big or small.

337
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,592
Not as busy as you.

338
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:54,072
I'm currently on rotation in the emergency room.

339
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:55,759
Otherwise, I wouldn't be this busy.

340
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,900
Besides, our work is not as dangerous as yours.

341
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,039
Your work can also be dangerous enough.

342
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:05,711
Done.

343
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:08,285
Thanks.

344
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:28,686
Thanks.

345
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:34,246
I should go.

346
00:29:48,258 --> 00:29:49,658
Bye bye.

347
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,605
Song Yan!

348
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,859
You're off this weekend, right?

349
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,519
According to this development trend, 
    

350
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,525
we can achieve 18% annual return on investment.

351
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:37,499
After five years, the project's profit can reach ¥135 million (~$18 million).

352
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,831
How can we guarantee an 18% return on investment?

353
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:44,236
We conducted market research.

354
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,840
The local property prices are high and still have room to rise.

355
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,709
Also, their company's property sales profits are currently flowing back smoothly.

356
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:59,351
The most common mistake investors make is believing that recent trends will continue,

357
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,421
assuming that what seems like a good investment now

358
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,055
will definitely remain a good investment in the future.

359
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:08,228
Past high returns only prove that the asset will become more expensive.

360
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:11,440
If you treat it as an investment target, it will only get worse,

361
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,940
not better.

362
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:18,639
Neither political factors nor human factors can eliminate economic cycles.

363
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,279
There will always be a reckoning.

364
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,679
Next.

365
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:31,503
Yunji Pharmaceuticals.

366
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,699
This company primarily focuses on the R and D of anti-cancer drugs.

367
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:38,557
The initial investment-to-output ratio may not be very promising,

368
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,592
but in the long run,

369
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,763
I have great confidence in this company.

370
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:44,852
Have you visited their R and D center?

371
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:46,920
Yes, I have. Their owner was very welcoming.

372
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,680
You can go and visit to learn more.

373
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,565
What about the list of company management?

374
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:53,106
They are on page 23 in the folder.

375
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:58,933
And the list of R and D personnel?

376
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,013
Pages 46 to 57.

377
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,722
Set up an appointment for me. Book the flight.

378
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:13,475
Director Meng, this company's financial statements aren't viewed favorably in the market.

379
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:15,909
Investors must always remember

380
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:19,839
that what we pay is the price, and what we get is the value.

381
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,069
A good company will shine eventually.

382
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:25,862
Before that, all we need to do is wait.

383
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,459
Excuse me.

384
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,620
   

385
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,600
   

386
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,820
   

387
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,522
Dr. Yang, that's a nice purse.

388
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,398
Your new haircut looks good too.

389
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,860
"New haircut"?

390
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,032
I haven't made any changes.

391
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,185
   

392
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,985
   

393
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,413
   

394
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:28,806
   

395
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:36,858
   

396
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,320
Dr. Xu.

397
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,120
We need you.

398
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,660
   

399
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,887
 Brother, Mom said the weather is getting cold. 

400
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,853
 She wants me to bring you some warm clothes. 

401
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,119
 I'll come see you later. 

402
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,072
 If you're not around, I'll leave them with Brother Suo Jun. 

403
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,672
No need. If I'm not around, just leave them at the security desk.

404
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,590
   

405
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,518
Hello, Mom.

406
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:48,359
 You can't come home again on Sunday? 

407
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,264
 Are you really that busy? 

408
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:52,470
There's some work I need to take care of.

409
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,070
Do you have any disagreements with your company's shareholders?

410
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,010
What's the issue?

411
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,367
Not really.

412
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:05,678
They probably just have some objections to one of my decisions.

413
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,913
You've been doing a good job these past two years

414
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,553
and haven't made any major mistakes, but...

415
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:16,054
Mom, I know what I'm doing.

416
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,662
Are you driving?

417
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,161
We will talk later.

418
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,713
 - You should focus on the road.  
 - Okay.

419
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,342
I say, Wenying,

420
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:40,447
aren't you meddling too much?

421
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:42,482
Don't meddle in his company's affairs.

422
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:44,751
Let's not get involved with his work.

423
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:46,553
I'm doing this for your sake.

424
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,612
If our son can take over sooner,

425
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:52,226
you won't have to work so hard.

426
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,826
Let's take it slow.

427
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:57,497
Given my current health, I can work for another ten years or so.

428
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:59,680
You should

429
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,220
worry a little less.

430
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:25,791
Come in.

431
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,265
President Yanchen, these are the financial statements of Xingya.

432
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,277
Please sign on the last page.

433
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:42,639
By the way, the investment signing ceremony with Yunji is also ready.

434
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,748
Chen Mingyu.

435
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,448
Who is your boss?

436
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,820
Who is your boss?

437
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:03,397
President Meng, you are my boss.

438
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:04,897
Am I?

439
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,572
Chairman Meng has never asked me about your work.

440
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:21,645
Well, Board Member Fu did ask me once.

441
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,525
But I didn't...

442
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:29,694
I'm sorry, President Meng.

443
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:40,999
Maybe I should arrange for you to work for her instead.

444
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,379
No, please.

445
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:46,404
I've learned my lesson.

446
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,099
President Meng.

447
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,839
You may leave.

448
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,280
Thank you, President Meng.

449
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,854
Water Gunner Number 1, Zhan Dapeng, in position!

450
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,360
Hey, Brother Chi,

451
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,480
what task did you get?

452
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,704
Nothing major. Just someone's head stuck in a fence.

453
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,830
When can we also get assigned a task? It'd be great to have a big one.

454
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,840
Brat, shut your mouth.

455
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,796
Don't jinx it like me.

456
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,418
Don't worry, Brother Yi, I wouldn't dare take your nickname. 
    

457
00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:54,119
You have quite a bad reputation.

458
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,199
It's experience.

459
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,159
What are you doing up there? Get down!

460
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,959
Yes, Captain.

461
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,229
Yang Chi, please service the car later.

462
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:07,421
Captain, you have a visitor at the door.

463
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,223
Pardon me?

464
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:11,502
There is a girl waiting for you at the door.

465
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,664
It's my sister. She's just here to bring me clothes.

466
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:19,164
Excuse me.

467
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,586
Listen, Captain's sister is really cute.

468
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,165
She's perky. Not bad at all.

469
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:28,405
I don't think that's his sister.

470
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:31,320
I think it's that female doctor.

471
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,445
- "Female doctor"? 
 - That female doctor?

472
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,681
- Why are we still here then? Let's go! 
 - Come on.

473
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:37,951
It's none of your business. Go back to your training.

474
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,751
I'm coming, too.

475
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:52,150

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,130
♫  Crossing the abysses and cliffs  ♫

493
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:36,000
♫  Doesn't matter if it's painful stepping on flames   ♫

494
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,830
♫  The ones who are lost in the story, have they found their home yet?  ♫

495
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:47,860
♫  Whispering sweet words under the light, yearning for you  ♫

496
00:45:47,860 --> 00:46:01,930
♫  Without you under the firework, this home is incomplete  ♫
