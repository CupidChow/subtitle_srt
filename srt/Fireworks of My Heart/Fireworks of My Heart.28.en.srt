[Episode 28]

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,420
Hey.

5
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,620
Let me send you home.

6
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,660
I'll come back

7
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,380
when you get home.

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,860
No need.

9
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,539
It's very convenient for me to drive back.

10
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,100
And if my mom sees

11
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,259
I didn't drive back,

12
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,580
she'll ask questions again.

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
It's troublesome.

14
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,420
Don't miss me too much.

15
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,180
You wish.

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,060
But I...

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,360
will miss you.

18
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,790
Okay, I'm hanging up.

19
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,300
She's been glowing lately.

20
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,829
"But I'll miss you."

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,530
I almost have

22
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,390
goosebumps!

23
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,700
Zhai Miao.

24
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,680
Come.

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,720
What is it?

26
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,100
Are you itching again?

27
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,940
Wait, Brother.

28
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,300
When people are in love,

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,980
they become better people.

30
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,650
Why did you become so grumpy?

31
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,040
Let go of me.

32
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,220
Let go.

33
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,800
You messed up my hair!

34
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,370
You keep coming home.

35
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,730
Have you written your thesis?

36
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,070
It's just because

37
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,170
you are finally resting at home,

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
so I came to see you.

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,440
Aren't we so close?

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,860
Just get to the point.

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,460
Hurry up.

42
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,340
Actually, I just want to

43
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
borrow your straight male perspective

44
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,260
to take a look for me.

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,140
Which photo

46
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,579
is better?

47
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,060
Look.

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,180
This one

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:23,980
and this one.

50
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,100
Aren't they the same?

51
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,010
How are they the same?

52
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,930
Take a closer look.

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,470
There are minute differences

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,180
in each photo.

55
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,070
See for yourself.

56
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,560
There are no differences.

57
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,710
They're clearly the same.

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,690
It's the same person.

59
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,100
You're really a straight man.

60
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,740
If Xu Qin asked you,

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,579
and you say that,

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,940
you'll drive her crazy.

63
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,060
She never asked me.

64
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
She never asked you?

65
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,640
How is that possible?

66
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,780
What kind of girlfriend

67
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,560
doesn't send photos to her boyfriend?

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,680
Does this mean

69
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,550
she

70
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,740
treats you as an outsider?

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,900
Get out.

72
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,550
Why did you get angry?

73
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,690
You don't study

74
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,780
and do these things every day.

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,700
Do your parents know?

76
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,940
I just want to

77
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,940
tell them

78
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,860
after I make big money.

79
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,220
Making big money

80
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,560
isn't as easy as you think.

81
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,180
Let me ask you.

82
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,490
Even if she really gets popular,

83
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,430
she'll go solo.

84
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,370
What will you do then?

85
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,050
We are classmates. She won't do that.

86
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,300
Besides,

87
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,690
the account is mine.

88
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,900
The account is yours,

89
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,590
but the face is hers.

90
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,190
We'll divide our earnings equally.

91
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,460
But you're right.

92
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,180
I should find a time

93
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,620
to sign a contract with her.

94
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,210
Brother.

95
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,820
You know what?

96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,590
I can earn 10,000 yuan

97
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,190
a month.

98
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,290
Aunt!

99
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,590
Brother.

100
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,380
Come here.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
Sit down.

102
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,300
Brother, I'll buy Sister-in-law a bag.

103
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,690
Buy her a bag?

104
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,490
That's more like it.

105
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,260
You've grown up.

106
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,780
Yan'er.

107
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,980
What is it?

108
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,300
Brother, please.

109
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,330
It's nothing, Aunt.

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,890
Brother, you're so nice.

111
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,680
H-How is it?

112
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,060
Harder.

113
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,870
Okay.

114
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,860
Alright.

115
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,800
Come on.

116
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,640
Here.

117
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,900
The door is open. Please come in.

118
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,500
Your brother came back last week,

119
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,780
but you didn't.

120
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,810
You came back this week,

121
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,150
but your brother didn't.

122
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,130
Did you two

123
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,530
discuss this?

124
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,600
Maybe it was a coincidence.

125
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,390
It's the end of the year,

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,300
everyone is busy.

127
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,860
Have more soup.

128
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,430
It's been over a month.

129
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,950
I think you've lost weight again.

130
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,540
Here.

131
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,710
Thank you, Dad.

132
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,100
You and your brother

133
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,900
haven't seen each other for a long time.

134
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,340
I always feel

135
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,500
he has something on his mind.

136
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,620
You can ask him.

137
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,830
I asked him, but he didn't say anything.

138
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,670
Without you two,

139
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,460
this house is too empty.

140
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,850
You should get married early.

141
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,040
With children,

142
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,610
this home will be lively again.

143
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,220
That's really...

144
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,380
Dad, Mum.

145
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,100
I have a boyfriend.

146
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,860
How long has it been?

147
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,540
Not long.

148
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,250
Less than a month.

149
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,380
Break up then.

150
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,500
I've known him for over ten years.

151
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,020
He is...

152
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,200
my boyfriend

153
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,840
from university in China,

154
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,380
Song Yan.

155
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,180
Wasn't I right?

156
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,710
She hasn't been home lately.

157
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,940
That's all I could think about.

158
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,930
Qin.

159
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,580
Your father and I don't approve.

160
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,980
Qin.

161
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,440
Song Yan was a hooligan

162
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,020
back in school.

163
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,060
His parents got into trouble

164
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
a few years ago.

165
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,310
Why do you have to

166
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,380
get involved with him?

167
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,860
What do his parents

168
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,710
have to do with him?

169
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,220
He was also a victim.

170
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,790
He was just rebellious.

171
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,040
He's not a bad person.

172
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,210
Once a girl

173
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,159
falls in love,

174
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,170
she cannot remove herself from the situation.

175
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,310
Your mother and I

176
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,110
are worried

177
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,460
you would get lied to.

178
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,940
He's not lying to me.

179
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,060
Why would he lie to me?

180
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,580
Even if he's not lying to you,

181
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,820
does he have

182
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,340
anything that you have?

183
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,400
Your education background, family background,

184
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,440
and living standards don't match.

185
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,080
They're too different.

186
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,820
Your difference in values

187
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,040
will be exposed sooner or later.

188
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,710
By then,

189
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,330
all sorts of problems

190
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
will keep surfacing.

191
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,850
There are no

192
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,659
problems

193
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,020
between us.

194
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,820
Other than your objection.

195
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,179
Qin, just because there aren't any now

196
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,220
doesn't mean there won't be any in the future.

197
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,150
Let me give you an example.

198
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,300
For example...

199
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,300
For example, you like French cuisine.

200
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,340
But he can only

201
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,820
take you to eat street food.

202
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,500
Of course, you can eat it.

203
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,180
You can also

204
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,820
eat street food with him every day.

205
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,280
But can he eat French cuisine with you

206
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,500
every day?

207
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,820
No way.

208
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,660
Because two French meals

209
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,460
may be

210
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,860
a month's salary for him.

211
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,060
Qin.

212
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,100
You two live in

213
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,660
two completely different worlds.

214
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,580
Your understandings of the difficulty of life

215
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,860
are completely different too.

216
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,130
Dad, Mom,

217
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,260
I understand everything

218
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,620
that you said.

219
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,810
I've been thinking these days.

220
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,220
I've made up my mind.

221
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,220
I don't want French cuisine.

222
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,300
I don't want to eat street food either.

223
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,730
I just want

224
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
his cooking.

225
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,930
For the past ten years,

226
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,740
I've been eating at restaurants every day.

227
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,780
I'm tired of it.

228
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,540
Now,

229
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,870
I just want to marry him.

230
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,160
I just want to have my own home

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,550
and eat the food he cooks for me.

232
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,470
Okay?

233
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,180
What

234
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,460
did he do to you?

235
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,500
You can't even listen to

236
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,180
what we said?

237
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,580
If you get married

238
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,060
and are unhappy

239
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,380
or fall on hard times,

240
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
we will feel guilty.

241
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,940
We will feel that we've let down your birth parents,

242
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,890
do you know that?

243
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,310
We raised you with all our hearts,

244
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,640
spoiled you, and loved you

245
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,600
not so that

246
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,270
you can go to someone else's house

247
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
to do the dishes,

248
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,440
do the laundry,

249
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
and mop the floor.

250
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,700
Dad, Mom.

251
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,420
I know you're worried about me

252
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,380
and you care about me.

253
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,940
You don't trust him.

254
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,140
But I know

255
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,300
what kind of person he is.

256
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,740
Please trust me, okay?

257
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,380
Qin.

258
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,290
Frankly speaking,

259
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,300
in your relationship with Song Yan,

260
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,610
he's the one who benefits.

261
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,730
How many years less will he have to grind

262
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,180
because he's with you?

263
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,680
Have you thought about that?

264
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,300
In our relationship,

265
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,940
I'm the one

266
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,610
who benefits.

267
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,160
I really like him.

268
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,470
I really like him.

269
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,810
I'm happy when I'm with him.

270
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,420
I just want to be happier.

271
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,180
Can't I?

272
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,380
Yes.

273
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,740
Mom said

274
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,940
we can't want everything.

275
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,300
If being with him

276
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,300
means I have to lose something.

277
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,860
If being with him

278
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,700
mean I'll have to face

279
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,020
what you said,

280
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,620
I still want to choose him, okay?

281
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,490
I just want him, okay?

282
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,260
I've always listened to you.

283
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,460
Just this once, okay?

284
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,300
Just this once.

285
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,140
Qin.

286
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,300
Even if you lose your parents

287
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,250
and your brother,

288
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,770
you'll still choose him?

289
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,610
Really?

290
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,980
Why do you have to do this?

291
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,700
I don't want you to marry anyone in particular.

292
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,530
But you should at least pick someone

293
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,980
who is a good match.

294
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,100
If he's not,

295
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,730
there's no room for discussion.

296
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,460
Try it if you don't believe me.

297
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,330
Sorry.

298
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,060
I'm sorry.

299
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,820
For this man,

300
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
you want to leave

301
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,110
this family and your parents?

302
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,420
Right?

303
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,780
Even if I get kicked out,

304
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,500
you will always be my parents.

305
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,950
I will never forget

306
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,860
that you raised me.

307
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,220
I'll visit you every week.

308
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,110
If

309
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,080
you don't want me to come in,

310
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,650
I will come too.

311
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,590
If you are not happy,

312
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,900
just scold me.

313
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,540
If you don't even want to scold me,

314
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,740
or talk to me,

315
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,860
I will still come.

316
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,450
I will do my best

317
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,550
to be filial to you.

318
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,770
Do you think

319
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
I will be softhearted

320
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,320
because you're coaxing and pestering me?

321
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,550
Dad.

322
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,810
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,980
I have no other choice

324
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,020
but to do this.

325
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,540
Qin.

326
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,920
You're too immature.

327
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,670
You're breaking my heart.

328
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,780
It seems

329
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,140
Qin is determined this time.

330
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,890
Don't worry.

331
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,670
She's no match for me.

332
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,940
I raised her.

333
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,260
I know

334
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,940
she is as softhearted

335
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,940
and filial

336
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,380
as Yanchen.

337
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,900
She won't leave us.

338
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,730
She's just infatuated.

339
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,860
After a while,

340
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,060
when she sees

341
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,020
that family's true colors,

342
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,340
she will withdraw.

343
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,380
She can't get used to

344
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,700
that kind of life.

345
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,460
She'll be back soon.

346
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,070
Of all the men in the world,

347
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,140
why does it have to be

348
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,580
Song Zhiyong's son?

349
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,100
Meng.

350
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,580
You must

351
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,860
stand on my side this time.

352
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,220
You can't play nice.

353
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,090
What's wrong with Miaomiao?

354
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,570
She came back and went in her room right away.

355
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,570
She's disappeared.

356
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,700
What is she doing?

357
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,340
Maybe she's writing her thesis.

358
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,020
Yan.

359
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,460
I want to talk to you about something.

360
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,770
I just want to talk to you

361
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,520
about you and Qin.

362
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,540
Of course.

363
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,000
Your uncle and I

364
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
have nothing to say about

365
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,070
you two being together.

366
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,970
Aunt,

367
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,720
if you have something to say,

368
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
just tell me.

369
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,140
I just want to say

370
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,100
many things happened

371
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,890
between us and their family.

372
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,340
Qin might not know,

373
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,770
but we do.

374
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,910
All of those things

375
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,430
hurt your father

376
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,450
and hurt you.

377
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,150
There's such a big thing

378
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,320
between the two of you.

379
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,910
The grudge is heavy.

380
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,450
I'm afraid...

381
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,500
Uncle.

382
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,940
Aunt.

383
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,000
If I say that

384
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,490
I don't want to

385
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,810
think about

386
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,060
what happened in the past,

387
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,340
and I just want to cherish the present,

388
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,660
will you think

389
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,010
I'm a loser?

390
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,290
I wanted to let her go,

391
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,260
but somehow,

392
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,920
we met again.

393
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,819
We kept meeting.

394
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,859
It would've been fine if we didn't meet.

395
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,470
But once we met,

396
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,800
nothing else mattered.

397
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,849
I'll just be a loser.

398
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,170
What do you mean by loser?

399
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,490
Our Song Yan

400
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,710
is the best.

401
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,500
Right?

402
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,500
Back then, you...

403
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,780
Say something.

404
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,100
Be gentle.

405
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,900
Yes.

406
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,380
This...

407
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,020
This isn't being a loser.

408
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,520
In life,

409
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,150
fame and fortune are all illusory.

410
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,890
Living with someone

411
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,670
you don't like

412
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,020
is meaningless.

413
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,540
Uncle.

414
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,500
I'm sorry

415
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,180
for what happened back then.

416
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,980
My child.

417
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,660
You've suffered so much.

418
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,750
There's nothing to be sorry for.

419
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,660
Your aunt and I

420
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,450
don't mean anything else.

421
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,920
Looking at

422
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,540
how they handled it back then,

423
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,990
they will never approve of you two.

424
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,130
I'm afraid Qin

425
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,630
can't get the better of her family,

426
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,180
and you'll get hurt again, right?

427
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,470
I know.

428
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,200
But you don't know her.

429
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,800
It's hard for her to make a decision.

430
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,020
But as long as she's determined,

431
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,750
she won't give up.

432
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,810
Because she knows

433
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,320
I will never

434
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,750
let her down.

435
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,930
What are we eating today?

436
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,570
We've been waiting for you.

437
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,770
Hello?

438
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,140
Where are you?

439
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,170
I'll be right there.

440
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,350
I need to go out.

441
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,570
What's wrong?

442
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,410
What's going on?

443
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,290
You must be cold.

444
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,240
You...

445
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,600
I don't want to tell you.

446
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,900
Okay.

447
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,340
You don't have to.

448
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Song Yan.

449
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,700
I don't want to go back to that home.

450
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,620
Do you want to come to

451
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,550
my house?

452
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,850
[Zhai’s]

453
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,900
What is this?

454
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,830
The keys to my house.

455
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,100
Two of them.

456
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,160
One for the door,

457
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,400
one for my room.

458
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,750
When I return to the team,

459
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,760
it'll be for a week at a time.

460
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm afraid I won't have time for you.

461
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,330
I'm leaving you the keys

462
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,570
so you'll have a place to stay.

463
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,920
[Zhai's]

464
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,030
[Zhai's]

465
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,940
I didn’t think

466
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,260
the first time I brought you back

467
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,280
would be in such a rush.

468
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,410
I know you don't like

469
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,340
dealing with people.

470
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,310
When we get in, if you feel uneasy

471
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,730
or uncomfortable,

472
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,460
you must tell me.

473
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,220
It’s not the first time.

474
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,750
[Zhai’s]

475
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,860
Let's go home for dinner.

476
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,350
Brother, Sister-in-law, hurry up.

477
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,330
We're waiting for you to eat.

478
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,620
Come on in.

479
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,400
You must be hungry.

480
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:04,940
Of course.

481
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,880
Uncle, Aunt.

482
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,920
I-It's cold outside, right?

483
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,170
Yes, Zhai Miao.

484
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,720
Pour Qin a cup of warm water.

485
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,310
Okay.

486
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,610
You haven't eaten?

487
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,190
We were about to eat,

488
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,810
when my brother got a call from you.

489
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,470
My dad said we should wait for you.

490
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,760
My mom added two more dishes.

491
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,150
You're so talkative.

492
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,230
It's the truth.

493
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,940
Song Yan suddenly called

494
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,220
saying you'll come for dinner.

495
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,620
We couldn't prepare much.

496
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,740
Come again next time.

497
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,700
Next time, I'll cook

498
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,780
more delicious food for you.

499
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,180
It's already a feast.

500
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,440
They are all my favourites.

501
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,640
Really?

502
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,010
That's great.

503
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,370
Wash your hands and eat.

504
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,210
Yes, let's eat.

505
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,380
It's on the left.

506
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,460
What are you doing?

507
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,810
Aunt was afraid you'll wash your hands with cold water.

508
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,510
Hot water's on the left and cold water's on the right.

509
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,480
I'm not a fool.

510
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,710
Yes.

511
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,010
Make yourself at home.

512
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,540
Uncle and Aunt are too kind.

513
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,640
I feel embarrassed.

514
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,270
You'll just have to get used to it.

515
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,620
Let's go.

516
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,690
Mom.

517
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,300
Your food is too bland.

518
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,390
Which one?

519
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,750
This one? Let me try.

520
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,660
It's not bland. It's good.

521
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,970
Your taste in food is too heavy.

522
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,830
It's good for me too.

523
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,310
It's not healthy to eat too much salt.

524
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,490
Qin.

525
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,300
If there's anything

526
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,140
not to your liking,

527
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,180
tell me.

528
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,540
Your food

529
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,610
is very delicious.

530
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,180
Listen.

531
00:24:59,410 --> 00:24:59,860
Uncle.

532
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,810
Aunt.

533
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,230
Qin is moving in.

534
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,810
We're getting married.

535
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,010
Welcome!

536
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,070
Qin, remember.

537
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,030
From now on,

538
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,060
this is your home.

539
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,260
Yes, don't be shy.

540
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,330
We're family now.

541
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,260
It's really your honeymoon phase.

542
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,370
Brother, at your age,

543
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,710
it must be a very passionate romance.

544
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,420
By the way, Yan.

545
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,540
Over the weekend,

546
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
take Qin

547
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,000
to buy some furniture.

548
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,780
Right?

549
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,460
It's time for you

550
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,520
to change out some of your furniture.

551
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,350
You can get them all changed out.

552
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,910
Sister-in-law, I'll help you move.

553
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,280
Right, you should do your part.

554
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,460
By the way,

555
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,610
are you going to

556
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,400
stay here tonight?

557
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,820
Why are you asking so much?

558
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,160
I didn't ask you.

559
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,640
Sister-in-law,

560
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,790
if you think my brother's room

561
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,380
is too cramped,

562
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:50,860
I can go back to school

563
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,670
tonight.

564
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,820
You can stay in my room.

565
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,200
By the way,

566
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,020
I have a lot of pajamas.

567
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:54,890
If you don't mind,

568
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,670
you can wear them.

569
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,500
I have a lot.

570
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,690
I talked too much.

571
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,910
Don't take me too seriously.

572
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,820
Don't take me too seriously.

573
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,780
Let's eat.

574
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,500
Let's eat.

575
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,540
Eat more, Qin.

576
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,070
Aunt is really something.

577
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,700
She even laid out two blankets.

578
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,450
Isn't that unnecessary?

579
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,610
What are you doing?

580
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,860
This is nice.

581
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,270
Listen to Aunt.

582
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,730
Okay, listen to Aunt.

583
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,730
Here, here, here.

584
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,550
[Zhai’s]

585
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,460
Where should I put it?

586
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,620
Here. Look.

587
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,930
Here, here.

588
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,690
Yes, here. Okay.

589
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,460
Okay.

590
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,780
Thank you, everyone.

591
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,520
You're welcome.

592
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,630
Thank you.

593
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,890
You have such a good attitude.

594
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,700
What are you doing at this hour?

595
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,910
Honey, come here.

596
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,690
I asked my acquaintances

597
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,990
to pick some good materials.

598
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,420
Tomorrow, I'll make a dressing table

599
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,710
for Qin.

600
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,820
Let them

601
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,340
pick one out themselves.

602
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,700
What if she doesn't like it,

603
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,260
but is too shy

604
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,220
to refuse?

605
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,780
No, she...

606
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,690
Why wouldn't she like it?

607
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,940
Look, my design is fashionable.

608
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,690
Look at the drawer.

609
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,120
It's much more exquisite than the store-bought ones.

610
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,540
Well,

611
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,940
it is pretty nice.

612
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,180
It's okay.

613
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,170
If she doesn't like it,

614
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,950
I'll take it.

615
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,940
If she likes it,

616
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,090
I'll make you another one.

617
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,670
Okay.

618
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,460
The things in the house

619
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,380
are old.

620
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,620
Shouldn't we replace them?

621
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,780
Replace them all.

622
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,420
Okay.

623
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,260
Is this house soundproof?

624
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
Lower your voice.

625
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,060
Zhai Miao's going to hear you.

626
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,950
What's wrong?

627
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,410
My back is itchy.

628
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,330
Help me scratch it.

629
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,790
Here?

630
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,260
No.

631
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,710
A little lower.

632
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,620
Lower.

633
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,840
A little to the left.

634
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,390
Where is it?

635
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,140
My heart is itching.

636
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,530
Still itchy?

637
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,170
Does it still itch?

638
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,250
Does it still itch?

639
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,040
It tickles.

640
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,620
[Missing a city because there's someone in it to miss]

641
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,420
Let me help you.

642
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,510
It's almost done.

643
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,570
Help me roll up my sleeves. Hurry.

644
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,930
Qin.

645
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,250
You're too thin.

646
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,020
Are you too busy at the hospital

647
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,070
and can't eat well?

648
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:10,950
In the future,

649
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,540
I'll make some nourishing food

650
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,700
for you.

651
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,170
You're doomed.

652
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,790
Be careful.

653
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,860
You'll be nourished into a pig.

654
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,790
Did I feed you into a pig?

655
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,570
Yeah.

656
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,350
Have an egg.

657
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't want it, Aunt.

658
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,630
I just had one.

659
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,650
One more.

660
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,420
I'll eat it.

661
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,180
Okay.

662
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,700
Yan needs some nourishment too.

663
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,650
You work too hard.

664
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,220
Yes.

665
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,960
Millet porridge, red eggs,

666
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,580
and steamed buns.

667
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll nourish myself too.

668
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
You

669
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,140
do need some nourishment.

670
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,470
You need to energy

671
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,890
to help Qin move.

672
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,550
Listen,

673
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,840
don't let Qin touch

674
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,110
any heavy or sharp things.

675
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,980
Her hands are

676
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,090
a surgeon's hands.

677
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,580
Did you hear what your mom said?

678
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,660
Don't worry.

679
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,630
I won't slack off.

680
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,680
My hands

681
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,870
don't need to hold scalpels.

682
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,380
It doesn't matter if they break.

683
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:58,640
Look at you.

684
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,840
Dad, look, Mom hit me again.

685
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,300
No.

686
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,210
But it makes sense.

687
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,970
Because compared to

688
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,040
Qin's hands,

689
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,300
her hands are indeed more valuable.

690
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,510
You'll have to bear with it.

691
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,580
[Zhai’s]

692
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,040
No need to change your shoes.

693
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,830
Okay.

694
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,390
Sister-in-law,

695
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,340
your house is so big.

696
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,300
Take all the seasonings.

697
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,260
Don't waste them.

698
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,610
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

699
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,180
Brother,

700
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,800
how much is this house worth?

701
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,610
But it doesn't matter.

702
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,750
Your place is not worse than this.

703
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,840
Although it's a little small,

704
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,630
it's cosy.

705
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,180
Once it's renovated,

706
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,160
it'll be better than here.

707
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,150
Why did my mom call again?

708
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
Hello, Mom.

709
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,250
Sister-in-law.

710
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,250
My mom asks what you want to eat.

711
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,160
Fish.

712
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,500
Fish.

713
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,690
And?

714
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,110
Beef and broccoli.

715
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,470
Beef and broccoli.

716
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,700
Sister-in-law.

717
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,740
You have such a good house.

718
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,760
Do you feel sad

719
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,920
about moving out?

720
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,940
Not really.

721
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,670
I'm usually busy with work

722
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,300
and I don't spend much time at home.

723
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,680
It's just

724
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,940
a place to stay.

725
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,850
I thought you should have some memories

726
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,340
of the place you live.

727
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,360
So I was afraid you'll feel sad.

728
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,690
I don't have

729
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,090
many memories here.

730
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,840
I just return home

731
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,080
from the hospital,

732
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,190
wash up, and go to bed,

733
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,830
day after day.

734
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,040
I don't know my neighbors

735
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,550
and people rarely come to visit.

736
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,260
It's just a house.

737
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,970
Really?

738
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,110
If someone asks me

739
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,740
to move out from that shabby yard,

740
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,380
it might be hard

741
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,770
for me to part.

742
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,590
A house is different

743
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,740
from a home.

744
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,200
By the way,

745
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,290
aren't you

746
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,400
bringing these things with you?

747
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,930
These

748
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,600
were from my mother.

749
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
I rarely

750
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,380
have a chance to carry them.

751
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,530
It's such a big house.

752
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,150
You're only bringing these?

753
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,300
These are the only things

754
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,780
that belong to me.

755
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,130
Xu Qin, don't be sad.

756
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,050
Our whole family

757
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,240
will treat you well.

758
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:00,910
Look.

759
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,170
I used to hate you most

760
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,330
in our family.

761
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,000
Now that I've said so,

762
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,440
don't worry.

763
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,310
Right.

764
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,980
These bags you're not bringing away.

765
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
I'll buy them for you

766
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,070
when I make money.

767
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,860
My brother

768
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,850
will buy them for you too.

769
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,440
Although

770
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,980
