We always think love and marriage

It's a one-sided chat.

365

I asked him out for supper,

366
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,460
but he actually refused me.

367
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,450
Then, I sent many more messages,

368

but he didn't even reply.

369
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,300
This man is so cruel.

I'm chasing him because I like him. What's wrong?

378

Isn't this what men do all the time?

379
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,030
Why can't women do it?

380
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,500
Right?

381
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,340
Of course you can.

382
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,500
I didn't say you can't.

383
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,730
He has agreed to see me!

384
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,000
Why are you freaking out?

385
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,110
What are you doing?

386
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,570
I have to go on a date.

387
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,630
I don't have time for you.

388
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,340
Who is he?

389
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,570
Why are you so interested in him?

390
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,210
A firefighter

391
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,500
who saved my life.

392
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,920
And he has

393
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,830
a very nice name,

394
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,660
Song Yan.

395
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm leaving.

396
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,440
I need to wash my hands.

397
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,050
Are you okay?

398
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,160
What's this smell?

399
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,800
Come here.

400
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,460
What are you doing?

401
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,490
-It stinks.
-Come on.

402
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,300
It's said online that

403
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,450
it has to be pickled for a week.

404
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,270
It's been less than a week.

405
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,430
Why is it already so stinky?

406
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,320
Did you put too little

407
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,230
salt?

408
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,010
Cover it.

409
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,210
Cover it. Cover it. Cover it.

410
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,550
Is the fish originally this smelly?

411
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,490
Nonsense.

412
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,740
This mandarin fish is quite expensive.

413
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,040
You've wasted it.

414
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,630
Anyway, you'll have to eat it. I'll definitely not eat it.

415
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,350
It's too smelly.

416
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,400
Too smelly?

417
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,040
Who was the one who initially said durians

418
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,900
are too smelly and that she wouldn't eat them for the rest of her life,

419
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,810
and then later said that

420
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,370
it's addictive and that the smellier the better?

421
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,880
Why are you

422
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,720
so annoying?

423
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,790
You're annoying.

424
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,130
Okay, I'll stop.

425
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,030
Well, what is Yan'er doing?

426
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,160
He's upstairs.

427
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,480
He went to look for

428
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,470
Qin yesterday, right?

429
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,470
Why is he so...

430
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,430
It seems like this won't do.

431
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,850
We must be stricter with him.

432
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,200
What do you mean?

433
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,080
He should be reprimanded for his mistakes.

434
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,490
Make strict rules for him.

435
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,730
From now on, he's not allowed to see

436
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,650
Qin again.

437
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,560
If he's always sad after seeing her,

438
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,740
why should he see her?

439
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,490
You're right.

440
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,740
Let's talk to him now.

441
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,620
Let's go. I'll go with you.

442
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:16,990
Okay.

443
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,080
Yan'er.

444
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,470
Are you going out?

445
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,070
Is anything the matter?

446
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,400
Your uncle has something to tell you.

447
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,380
Go ahead.

448
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,760
Wait...

449
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,780
What is it?

450
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,380
What's stinking up the place?

451
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,710
Yes, that's what I want to talk about.

452
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,070
This stinky mandarin fish

453
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,990
is indeed very stinky.

454
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,560
It's so stinky that it's fragrant, don't you think so?

455
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,930
That's it?

456
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,690
W-Where are you going?

457
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,730
To take a walk.

458
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,350
Yes, go get some fresh air.

459
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,360
The night is very beautiful.

460
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,390
The air is good too.

461
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,460
Uncle.

462
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,440
Did you drink?

463
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,740
A little.

464
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,120
Come back early.

465
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,120
Why didn't you say it?

466
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,610
How can a man like me talk about such matters?

467
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,710
Commander Miao, you do it yourself.

468
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,490
I’ve already taught you everything.

469
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,230
What do you mean?

470
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
We agreed that you'll be the one saying it.

471
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,600
What's wrong with you?

472
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,540
I disguised it well, didn't I?

473
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,250
Come on.

474
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,020
You're useless.

475
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,700
Come in.

476
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,840
I don't want to go in. It stinks.

477
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,830
I'll get changed and take you for a walk

478
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,970
and let the smell in the house dissipate.

479
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,940
One more.

480
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,330
Give Boss' bottle

481
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,190
of Ardbeg Scorch to me.

482
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,610
Another one.

483
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,080
Boss, here's your wine.

484
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,410
Okay.

485
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,780
I bought this bottle of scorch

486
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,850
from an auction.

487
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,810
Try it.

488
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,550
Drink it yourself.

489
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,860
Why isn't Qin back yet?

490
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,150
Don't tell me she left again?

491
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,470
Let's go have a look.

492
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,610
Ye'zi.

493
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,970
What's wrong, Boss?

494
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,420
Go to the women's bathroom

495
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,580
to see if our friend is there.

496
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,620
She was at the bar counter just down

497
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,600
drinking alone.

498
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,550
She has left.

499
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,150
She just left.

500
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,390
[The Bar of Charm Color]

501
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,040
Qin.

502
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,010
Let me send you home.

503
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,280
No, I can go on my own.

504
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,380
Sir, Lanxuan Apartment.

505
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:40,930
Drive slowly.

506
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,570
Did Qin

507
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,160
drink to drown her sorrows?

508
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,360
No.

509
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,900
It was to strengthen her courage.

510
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,820
Come with me.

511
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,820
Sir, Wufang Street.

512
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,010
Didn't that gentleman say

513
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,050
to head to Lanxuan Apartment?

514
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,870
Wufang Street.

515
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,990
I want to go there. Thank you.

516
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:07,690
Okay.

517
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,150
She's not going home.

518
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,800
You were right.

It's you?

527
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,910
What are you doing?

528
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,680
Do you know what time it is?

529
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,100
Stop right there!

it is now?

533
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,050
Song Yan, are you asleep?

It's me.

00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,790
Stop knocking.

537
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,910
My brother is not here.

538
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,540
Where did he go?

539
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,200
He went on a date with someone else.

540
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,990
He's not coming back tonight.

541
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,790
You should go.

542
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,590

543
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,230
There's no point in living.

544
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,180
What's wrong?

545
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,600
Are you okay?

Why don't you have a seat?

These are my brother's shoes.

Why did you come here?

557
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,580
I'm sorry.

00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:53,920
Let's go.

576
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,760
Yes.

577
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,010
You're not good enough for me.

578
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,430
You're definitely not good enough for me!

579
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,620
Because I like you

580
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,740
more than you like me.

581
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm not good at socializing.

582
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,690
I don't like making friends.

583
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,260
Finance,

584
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,760
Law,

585
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,610
and Management.

586
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,970
Many professions don't suit me.

587
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,410
Only as a doctor,

588
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,800
where I just have to focus on my studies,

589
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,070
do I not have to worry about losing my job.

590
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,540
I can support myself.

591
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,570
After I came back from abroad,

592
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,680
I moved out from home.

593
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,040
I was planning to

594
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,590
gradually

595
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,470
stop taking money and things

596
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,930
from my family.

597
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,540
I was thinking of

598
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,390
how I could

599
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,390
appease my mom and dad so that they wouldn't be angry,

600
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,840
wouldn't go against me,

601
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,130
and wouldn't disown me as their daughter.

602
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,290
Maybe if I focused on my studies

603
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,090
and quickly became

604
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,230
a famous surgeon,

605
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,360
they would approve of me

606
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,180
in other aspects,

607
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,600
be proud of me,

608
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,100
and indulge me a little.

609
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,760
But what about you?

610
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,430
Song Yan, what did you do?

611
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,220
What did you do for me?

612
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,410
Let me ask you.

613
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,760
What did you do for me?

614
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,260
Yes.

615
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,440
I keep approaching,

616
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,540
and hesitating.

617
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,880
I keep going back and forth,

618
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,510
and I'm hesitant and weak.

619
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,140
I don't see any hope and I'm scared.

620
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,570
You've never

621
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,360
done anything

622
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,620
for our relationship.

623
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,970
Never.

624
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,570
Am I right?

625
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,670
Am I right?

626
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,420
Song Yan.

627
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,830
Am I right?

628
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,940
You don't like me that much, do you?

629
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,580
Do you not like me enough?

630
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,470
Otherwise, how could you

631
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,200
have never tried anything?

632
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,950
You never thought of getting close to me.

633
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,660
Why should I

634
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,560
go towards someone like you?

635
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,020
You always stay where you are

636
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,490
and wait for me to go to you.

637
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,220
Even if you saw me fall,

638
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,630
you wouldn't come and help me.

639
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,740
For someone like you,

640
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,080
Why should I...

641
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,940
Why should I go to you?

642
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,640
Yes.

643
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,320
I'm selfish.

644
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,560
I'm very selfish.

645
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,700
I'm selfish to the person I like too.

646
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,370
I only want to see you put in some effort

647
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,500
before I go towards you.

648
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,120
Otherwise, I'll lose everything,

649
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,800
while you stay where you are.

650
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,890
Then, what will become of me?

651
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,090
I'm not pure.

652
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,990
I'm the one who wants to argue.

653
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,990
I also want to see you put in some effort.

654
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,500
I also want you

655
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,290
to take a step towards me.

656
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,150
But why won't you come?

657
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,940
Song Yan, why won't you come?

658
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,160
Why won't you come?

659
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,780
I can't feel

660
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,770
your love for me at all.

661
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,550
You definitely don't like me that much.

662
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,800
You don't like me that much, do you?

663
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,460
You don't like me that much, do you?

664
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,500
You definitely don't like me that much.

665
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,140
You don't like me that much.

666
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,440
Why did you say that?

667
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,120
Why did you say

668
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,260
you like me to death?

669
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,170
I took it seriously.

670
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,190
I took it seriously, Song Yan!

671
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,540
I took it seriously.

672
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,210
-I took it seriously!
-Let's go home!

673
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:43,850
Get up.

674
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,660
Listen.

675
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,900
I won't go towards you ever again.

676
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,790
I won't.

677
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,570
It's not what you think!

678
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,270
It's not what you think!

679
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:20,840
Zhai Miao!

680
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,500
Brother.

681
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,400
♫Watch the sun go down slowly♫

682
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:49,370

♫Thank you for traveling through time and living in my heart♫

Brother!

689
