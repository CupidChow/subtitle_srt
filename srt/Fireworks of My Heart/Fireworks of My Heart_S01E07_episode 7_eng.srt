2
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,713
   

3
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:37,072
   

4
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:40,032
   

5
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,480
I was passing by after work.

6
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,480
So I casually asked if you were around.

7
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,139
I didn't think they'd ask you to come out here.

8
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,939
Why are you here?

9
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,479
I already said what I wanted to in WeChat.

10
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,079
Please leave.

11
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,522
Let me treat you to a meal.

12
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,439
I've already said no.

13
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,240
Then you can treat me.

14
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,739
What did you say?

15
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,100
Or tea is fine too.

16
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,780
Why would I treat you to tea?

17
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:08,321
Yesterday, I lent you my place to carry out your rescue mission.

18
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,390
As the person in charge,

19
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,280
shouldn't you show some gratitude?

20
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,400
I waited the whole day yesterday,

21
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,119
but you didn't even call to thank me.

22
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,800
Should I have hired drummers while I presented you with a pennant?

23
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
That's fine too.

24
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,439
Otherwise, I became a model citizen for nothing.

25
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,499
How could you do that?

26
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Xu Qin,

27
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,780
do other people know about this side of you?

28
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,699
Which side?

29
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
Fine.

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,822
As you wish, my lady.

31
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,379
- Move! 
 - Let's get out of here!

32
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,879
Jiang Yi.

33
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,260
Captain.

34
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,317
We saw everything.

35
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,500
I dare you to give my number away again.

36
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:18,387
They can add you on WeChat, but you don't have to approve it.

37
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,480
I was wrong! I was wrong!

38
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,399
Captain, I was wrong!

39
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,439
- Get back here. 
 - I was wrong, Captain!

40
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,427
Come back here!

41
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,367
   

42
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,199
Xiao Yao, call me when you're up.

43
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,799
It's urgent.

44
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,860
Coming.

45
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,415
Xu Qin!

46
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,628
Xiao Yao, you got here so fast.

47
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,439
I-I don't have extra slippers.

48
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,600
Just come in.

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,219
It's okay. I'm fine without them.

50
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,166
Your house is so nice.

51
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,079
I like the color scheme too.

52
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,639
My dad bought it for me.

53
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,430
He said it's only 10 minutes from my work.

54
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,039
Sit.

55
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,539
Your house is so...

56
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,450
clean.

57
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,639
What you mean is that it lacks personality, right?

58
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,680
No. So much stuff is strewn around my house,

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
there's hardly any place to sit.

60
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,199
Every time the cleaning lady comes, she regrets it.

61
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,240
Check these out.

62
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
That was fast. Where did you get these?

63
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
I stockpile.

64
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,759
It's important to have extra sets of cosmetics and skincare.

65
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,360
You don't want to run out just as you need them.

66
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,236
See? Isn't it nice?

67
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:14,639
How much is it? I'll transfer it.

68
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,040
Stop that or I'm leaving.

69
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,199
- I can't— 
 - Hurry. Where should we do it?

70
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,999
Bring the stuff.

71
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,539
Keep still. Don't blink.

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Close your eyes.

73
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,600
Look how beautiful you are with makeup.

74
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,673
Let me add a bit more.

75
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,160
I must say you're a rare breed.

76
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,079
Are there really people who still don't know how to do makeup in this era?

77
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,680
I'm a surgeon. Makeup messes with hygiene.

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,260
You can use makeup when you're off work.

79
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,659
Where are you going today that you're dressing up?

80
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:02,159
I...

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,199
I'm going on a blind date.

82
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,759
"Blind date"?

83
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,294
That's great!

84
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,600
You know what?

85
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't know why, but my friends who've gone through thick and thin to be together

86
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
somehow rarely had good endings.

87
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,920
On the contrary, those who followed their parents' arrangements

88
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,540
are now in happy, stable relationships.

89
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,519
- Really? 
 - Yes.

90
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,439
Do your parents mind you a lot?

91
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,946
Me? About marriage?

92
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,439
They let me do what I want.

93
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,560
I've already made it clear to them. I only want to be in a happy, dating relationship.

94
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,680
Just dating?

95
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,260
Don't you want to be with the person you love forever?

96
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,959
"Forever"?

97
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,279
I don't even know if I can love one person forever,

98
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,759
let alone be with him for life.

99
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,319
I just want to enjoy life.

100
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,760
If I'm happy, I'll date.

101
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,200
If I'm not, then bye-bye.

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Let's contour the double chin.

103
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,000
- It's full of nicks. 
 - Hush!

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,639
Can you really do it, Brother Chi?

105
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,360
- I mean, it's not even. 
 - You do it then.

106
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,422
- It's looks good. 
 - See? It looks good.

107
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,560
- There are nicks everywhere. 
 - Stay still!

108
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,728
- You look handsome. 
 - Listen to Jun Ping. He knows his stuff.

109
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,720
Let me wash my hands.

110
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,179
Captain, your hair is long, too. You should get a trim.

111
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,199
Captain, do you want a haircut?

112
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,399
I'm almost done with Da Peng. You can be next.

113
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,360
Stop there.

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,000
Captain's hair is always cut by the instructor. No need for you.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Give me a break.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Captain.

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,279
Captain, don't listen to Brother Chi.

118
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,203
This is the last time I'm letting him cut my hair.

119
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:37,340
What the heck? I have the nickname Tony Yang because of my skills.

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,988
Look at all the nicks.

121
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,623
I'm sorry, Brother.

122
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,200
What was that?

123
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,299
- Don't you have faith in me? 
 - Chi, can you cut hair or not?

124
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,479
Fine, I quit. No one appreciates my skills.

125
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
You want a haircut?

126
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,960
I'll do it.

127
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,240
Instructor.

128
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,840
Hey, Instructor.

129
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
It's a waste that you're not using your skills on cutting grass.

130
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,960
I'm not kidding. My nickname is Tony Yang.

131
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,260
Sure.

132
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,239
No one believes me.

133
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,040
The usual?

134
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,580
♫  Deep down, I long to say "I'm sorry"  ♫

135
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,300
♫  I'm sorry I missed so many wonderful years  ♫

136
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,890
♫  I still like it after all these years  ♫

137
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,700
♫  The feeling of being liked by you  ♫

138
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,080
♫  As I look at you, I see some differences  ♫

139
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,140
Did you wait long?

140
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,659
No, I just got here, too.

141
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,259
Where are we going?

142
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,199
That way.

143
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,200
♫  Eagerly anticipating your anticipation  ♫

144
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,240
♫  I muster up the courage, but you never appear  ♫

145
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,630
♫  Memories filled this empty room  ♫

146
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:48,440
♫  Your shadow is fading away on this lonely street  ♫

147
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,359
Let's eat here.

148
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,060
Is that okay?

149
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:04,490
   

150
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,810
♫  I've gone in circles before standing in front of you  ♫

151
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,940
 Well? Do you want to try it? 

152
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,699
 I'm not hungry. 

153
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,639
Since you're buying, I'll order what I want.

154
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,159
Excuse me, one fried chicken, sweet potato fries,

155
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,240
fried calamari, and yam balls.

156
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,399
Two glasses of Coke as well.

157
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,879
All right.

158
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,189
Salt and pepper or chili powder?

159
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,759
Both, please. He doesn't eat spicy food.

160
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,900
Okay. It'll be right up.

161
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,419
Food's here!

162
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,840
Thanks.

163
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,640
You're welcome.

164
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,579
Please enjoy.

165
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,799
It's weird.

166
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,199
What is?

167
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,472
It tastes just like it used to.

168
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,777
At many restaurants, the taste and quality tend to drop once business picks up.

169
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,759
But not this place.

170
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,855
It's still as good as I remember.

171
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I think the taste has changed.

172
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,697
It's been almost ten years.

173
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,419
How could it not change?

174
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,519
I don't think it has.

175
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,119
Perhaps...

176
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,373
it's your own tastes that have changed.

177
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,519
That's true.

178
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,456
My tastes are different now.

179
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,920
The food I used to like before, I don't anymore.

180
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,840
Boss, two portions of yam balls.

181
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,240
Okay. Please take a seat inside.

182
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
The school uniform is still the same.

183
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,460
It still looks as nice as before.

184
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,508
Don't talk while you eat.

185
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,366
Can you not dilly-dally?

186
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,460
Xu Qin.

187
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
You're too old to be acting cute, got it?

188
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,340
What?

189
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,159
You eat.

190
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,699
I'll wait for you outside.

191
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,780
A bunch of tricks.

192
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,327
- Hello? 
  - Hello, Cousin? 

193
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,919
 Come and save me. 

194
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,159
What is it? What's happened?

195
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,679
I'm at the police station.

196
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,159
Please come quick.

197
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,120
Don't tell my parents!

198
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
Which police station?

199
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,240
Fuming Police Station.

200
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,820
 Okay. Wait there. I'm coming right now. 

201
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,919
What's the matter? Something happened?

202
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,679
Yes. I have to go.

203
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,400
It's traffic hour. I'll give you a ride.

204
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,828
 Hi, Xiao Lin. 

205
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:05,925
 I'm here. 

206
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,160
Navigate to Fuming Police Station.

207
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,080
 All right. Here's the way to Fuming Police Station. 

208
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,799
Don't worry too much.

209
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,471
Zhai Miao is a student. She won't be in too much trouble.

210
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,519
You don't know her.

211
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,441
It's either she ran into a car,

212
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,839
or she got into a fight with someone.

213
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,079
She speaks without using her brain.

214
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,839
I'm worried she'll get beaten up.

215
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,519
I don't need your help.

216
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,760
No need to make any calls.

217
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,000
Where is Zhai Miao studying now?

218
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,403
Yancheng University.

219
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,039
Her grades must've been good.

220
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,178
I remember she was quite naughty when she was younger. She didn't like studying.

221
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,511
But she's smart.

222
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,319
Why the sigh?

223
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,140
It's easier for smart people to find shortcuts to success.

224
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,720
The more they do it, the less respect they have for customary rules.

225
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,560
When everything seems to work out, they become careless and go overboard.

226
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,359
I've realized you'd make a good parent.

227
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,480
Thank you. You can go.

228
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,640
I'll go in with you.

229
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,259
A bystander is neutral. Perhaps it'd be easier for me to talk to her.

230
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,359
What happened?

231
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,680
Did you fight again?

232
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,039
No, I didn't.

233
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,439
I...

234
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:09,039
Why is she here?

235
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,279
Zhai Miao, be serious.

236
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,685
This is no time for tantrums!

237
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,799
Are you her cousin?

238
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,425
Yes. What did she do?

239
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,760
Selling fake goods.

240
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,062
The person who made the complaint just left.

241
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,708
What's going on?

242
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
My part-time job was a scam!

243
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,519
I didn't know.

244
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,240
You didn't know?

245
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,799
Aren't you a college student?

246
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,119
You sold fake goods.

247
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,700
You're educated enough to know this is illegal.

248
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,160
Officer, I really didn't know.

249
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,880
I didn't know they were fake goods.

250
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,240
Besides, there were other part-timers. Why did you only apprehend me?

251
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I'm just a poor student. I've never used these brands before.

252
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,296
How would I know whether they were genuine?

253
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,440
Cousin, you have to help me explain to them.

254
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,240
Explain what?

255
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,480
I thought you had gotten beaten up instead of asking for it!

256
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,240
Listen up, Zhai Miao.

257
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,244
You created this mess. You figure it out.

258
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,463
How am I supposed to do that?

259
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,599
Then tell me.

260
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,939
Who gave you these goods?

261
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,160
I asked her already.

262
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,280
She refuses to name her supplier no matter what.

263
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
I'm asking you one last time.

264
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,979
Who gave you these goods?

265
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,599
I don't know!

266
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,300
You're still refusing to admit it?

267
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,860
Contact her school.

268
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,799
Cousin...

269
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,160
Okay. Which university?

270
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,985
Song Yan,

271
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,880
let me talk to her in private.

272
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
What's there to talk about?

273
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,039
Look at her.

274
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,340
She's unrepentant. She must be put in her place!

275
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,100
What if you tell the school and they expel her?

276
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,300
How will you explain that to your aunt and uncle?

277
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,400
Sorry, Officer.

278
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Could I have some time to talk to her in private?

279
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,240
Fine. Make it quick.

280
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,979
Thank you.

281
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:25,579
Zhai Miao.

282
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,919
Just say what you want.

283
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,559
You heard what Song Yan said just now.

284
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,119
You know very well how upright he is.

285
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,161
It's always reason over personal ties.

286
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,019
If you still won't name your supplier, he'll really inform your school.

287
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,720
This is my problem. I didn't ask for your help.

288
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,960
Zhai Miao, don't act clever if you can't back it up.

289
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,359
- What— 
 - You think you're great, right?

290
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,965
Your little tricks are laughable at best.

291
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,519
What you did today is a minor offense.

292
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,640
 Song Yan could probably get you out by paying a fine. 

293
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,079
 But what if someone got scarred or poisoned and they want you in jail? 

294
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,119
That won't happen.

295
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,229
I tried all the products myself. What you said won't happen.

296
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,039
Which means you're not going to name the supplier.

297
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,119
Or are you planning to continue once this blows over?

298
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,359
- I'm not! 
 - Stop lying!

299
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,359
Honestly, I couldn't care less about you.

300
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,920
If not for Song Yan today, I wouldn't even be here talking to you.

301
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,655
You're an adult. You're responsible for your own actions.

302
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,759
Stop making trouble for Song Yan.

303
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,720
Xu Qin, stop acting all self-righteous.

304
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,680
You really are a hypocrite.

305
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,060
 I know what I am. 

306
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,700
 But you... you have no idea where you stand. 

307
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,519
I can't believe Song Yan called you smart.

308
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,800
You look like a dumb fool to me.

309
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,411
With good grades at a good school, your postgraduate future is bright.

310
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,680
There's plenty of money waiting for you.

311
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,559
But you don't study when you're supposed to

312
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,440
and were tempted by a quick profit.

313
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,586
What are you if not dumb?

314
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,759
It's not too late if you name the supplier now.

315
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,666
I don't think Song Yan actually wants you to fail.

316
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,103
But if you won't repent,

317
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,416
he's not afraid to do this.

318
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,960
Go and apologize.

319
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,939
This is my supplier.

320
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
Xiao Wang.

321
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,589
- Look into this person. 
 - Okay.

322
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,580
Go on. How did you meet her?

323
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,319
We met in a group for part-timers.

324
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,960
She was really nice right from the start

325
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,039
and introduced me to a lot of part-time work.

326
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,519
She's quite reliable. She gave me all the fees she promised.

327
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,920
A month ago, she said her friend had some lipsticks that were seized by customs.

328
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
She asked if I knew of any way to sell them.

329
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,399
She even showed me the paperwork issued by customs.

330
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,200
Oh right, she also sent me dozens of samples.

331
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,000
I was worried they might be fake too, so I checked at the stores.

332
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,680
I started selling them near campus only after verifying the authenticity.

333
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,567
There were some foreign students who approached me for the goods.

334
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,000
I made ¥30 ($4) for each lipstick.

335
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,680
I never would've thought she'd send me authentic samples first

336
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,659
but fake ones later.

337
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:38,039
That's how scammers do it.

338
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,160
You won't be lured if they don't bait you.

339
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,960
Why wouldn't you name the culprit just now?

340
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,599
When I realized something was off, I called them.

341
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:49,521
They said that the warehouse sent the wrong goods.

342
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,200
If I reported it to the police,

343
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,040
they wouldn't give my money back.

344
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,319
How many did you sell?

345
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,019
Probably... about 500?

346
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:04,000
"Five hundred"?

347
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,799
I've got to hand it to you.

348
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,219
You make 30 yuan for one lipstick. Where's the money you made?

349
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,900
I spent it to stockpile more.

350
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,380
You...

351
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:17,484
What did you find?

352
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:20,743
The WeChat account isn't active. It won't be easy to find them.

353
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,460
Officer, what happens now?

354
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,359
First off, your cousin sold counterfeit goods.

355
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,240
She'll need to refund the buyers in full

356
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,960
and pay a fine of three times the amount of goods sold.

357
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,000
This is the fine ticket.

358
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,279
You can transfer money to the account.

359
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,240
Okay.

360
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,119
Second, we only heard the story from your cousin's side.

361
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,519
We can't be sure she's telling the truth.

362
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,759
We'll have to find her supplier and verify if she's also a victim

363
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,559
who was unaware of the situation.

364
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,920
Only then can we let her go.

365
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,440
Otherwise, she'll either be detained or her school notified.

366
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,599
Cousin, the school can't find out!

367
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,279
If they know, there goes my degree!

368
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,280
Now you start to worry?

369
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,130
   

370
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,119
There's an urgent family matter requiring money.

371
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,680
I'll pay you back soon.

372
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,800
Okay. It's fine.

373
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:50,279
I really think this project is going well.

374
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,160
Who knew it might actually work? Right?

375
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,580
Still, it's all thanks to your support.

376
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,619
Look who's calling.

377
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,959
I doubt the actual brother gets such treatment.

378
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,680
Qin'er, did you miss me?

379
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,599
 Xiao Yi Xiao. 

380
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,319
 - Can you lend me some money?  
 - What?

381
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,300
Wait, hang on.

382
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Tell me.

383
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,639
Where are you?

384
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,960
Officer, this happened suddenly. I only managed to get 100,000.

385
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,954
I'm Song Yan, the captain of Shili Tai Fire and Rescue Station.

386
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,319
This is my identification. You can verify it.

387
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,960
Look, could we do this?

388
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,319
Let me take my cousin back first.

389
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,000
As for the remainder, I'll pay within three days.

390
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,440
Captain Song, this isn't only about the money owed.

391
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,037
Before we verify the matter of the supplier, as per protocol,

392
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,374
she must be detained for further questioning.

393
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:58,834
However, we won't notify her school for now.

394
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,759
One should answer for their own actions. Just detain me.

395
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,400
I trust that the police officers would render justice and prove that I'm innocent.

396
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,920
Innocent, as if.

397
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,599
You made this mess, and you say, "Innocent."

398
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,805
Cousin, please tell my mom

399
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:15,799
that I'll be staying in the school dorm to prepare for my exam.

400
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,200
Tell her not to worry.

401
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,319
All right.

402
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,960
Xiao Lin, take her away.

403
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,039
Okay.

404
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,739
Come with me.

405
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,779
Captain Song.

406
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,079
This is the cross-examination consent form. Please sign it.

407
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,759
Hello? Come straight in.

408
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,839
I'm in the office.

409
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,359
Why did you bring him?

410
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,639
I was with him. I couldn't stop him from coming.

411
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,039
Qin Qin,

412
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,883
you didn't tell me.

413
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,880
I came as soon as I heard.

414
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,861
Turns out it was to help him.

415
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,752
You're not the one I called.

416
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,960
You're not needed here.

417
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,760
You can go.

418
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,559
Watch how you speak to her.

419
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,820
It's the same way I speak to you.

420
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,559
- Brother. 
 - What's your problem?

421
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,485
Are you asking for a fight?

422
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,920
What is this?

423
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,180
You're at the police station. You can settle your business outside.

424
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,119
- Song Yan! 
 - Just leave.

425
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,880
Just take the money as a loan, okay?

426
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,279
You've already borrowed money from friends.

427
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:48,359
You can't possibly find enough money in three days.

428
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,119
Zhai Miao will—

429
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,839
She's an adult! She'll bear responsibility for her mistake!

430
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,640
How?

431
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,410
Song Yan.

432
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,210
Song Yan!

433
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,319
She can say she's at school to keep it from her family.

434
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,960
But when she misses class while being detained,

435
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,334
what will you tell the school?

436
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,237
How will you explain it?

437
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
I can't believe you asked me for such a small amount.

438
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,680
Were you scared your mom would see the record?

439
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,084
I should never have asked you.

440
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,960
Don't blame me. Your brother is too sharp.

441
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,079
Don't worry. He won't tell your mother.

442
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,759
I know that, but why did you use his card?

443
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,759
What am I supposed to do when he forced it on me?

444
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:34,409
Are you worried that Song Yan won't be happy about it?

445
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:35,759
Oh, please.

446
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,640
You did all this to get him the money but worry about his feelings?

447
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
I don't know what else to say.

448
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,400
No need to worry. His cousin should be released soon.

449
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,440
Why?

450
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,920
Your brother has all the connections. You know that.

451
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,079
He just asked about it.

452
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,880
Coincidentally, he saw someone he knew.

453
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,999
They were handling a case that overlapped with Song Yan's cousin's.

454
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,148
I've paid the fine.

455
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,039
Long time no see, Mr. Meng.

456
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Captain Zhang, sorry to trouble you.

457
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,799
Not at all.

458
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,039
Let me introduce you.

459
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,879
This is Captain Wang, head of the Economic Investigation Detachment.

460
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:01,872
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

461
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,680
They found the supplier of the fake goods already.

462
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,680
They're a repeat offender the EID have long been watching.

463
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,519
Come. Let's talk over there.

464
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,759
Thanks.

465
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:26,000
Here's the thing.

466
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,079
The supplier is named Li Hong Li.

467
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,559
We've been investigating her for half a year already.

468
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,839
We found that others were backing her, so we didn't rush to apprehend her.

469
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,954
But an arrest is imminent.

470
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,480
Captain Song's cousin was indeed tricked.

471
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,720
She didn't know those goods were fake.

472
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,119
She's still a student and lacks real world experiences.

473
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,559
How about this?

474
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,480
Captain Zhang, give her a good talking to, then she can be released.

475
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,206
Okay. We'll wrap up the case then.

476
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:55,839
I have another assignment this afternoon. I'll take my leave now.

477
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,459
Let me see you out, Captain Wang.

478
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,079
Take care, Captain Wang.

479
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,639
Xiao Lin, bring the girl here.

480
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,440
Captain Song.

481
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,799
Since Captain Wang of EID has already explained the situation,

482
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,119
you can take your cousin and go.

483
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,440
If there are further questions, we'll need your cooperation.

484
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,759
Sorry for the trouble.

485
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,459
It's all right.

486
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:31,939
Cousin, are they with the Mengs?

487
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,200
Come on, let's go home.

488
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
Cousin, I won't have you ask them for help.

489
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,000
Just let the police detain me. I don't need their help.

490
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,800
Stop your nonsense.

491
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,680
I'll return the money in three days.

492
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,859
Cousin.

493
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,399
We're leaving.

494
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,039
Cousin, don't look back.

495
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,740
Stop looking. He's not turning around.

496
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,080
Should we go somewhere for afternoon tea?

497
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,500
You didn't come home this weekend because you were out frolicking with him?

498
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,159
What? Are you going to control me like Mom?

499
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,639
- You two. 
 - I went out of the way to come.

500
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,008
I also got someone to resolve the matter.

501
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,559
Shouldn't you thank me?

502
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,960
Were you trying to help him or embarrass him?

503
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,800
What now? Did I hurt his sensitive ego?

504
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,079
Meng Yan Chen, what is it that you want?

505
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,939
I should ask you that.

506
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,355
It's fine if you're just playing around.

507
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,360
But if you're serious about him,

508
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,094
I urge you to stop.

509
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:30,100
This is my own business. Stay out of it.

510
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,000
So what are you going to do?

511
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you going to turn on your family because of him?

512
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,719
How old are you, Meng Qin? Why do you still have such unrealistic dreams?

513
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,039
Take care of your own matters before talking to me.

514
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,199
That's enough!

515
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,699
Qin'er, you can't talk to your brother like that.

516
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:50,099
Same goes for you. You're all adults. Be more mature.

517
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,679
She's the immature one.

518
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,188
- He's immature. 
 - You are!

519
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,239
- You are. 
 - You are.

520
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,360
Enough!

521
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,679
Fine, I'm the immature one. Okay?

522
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,440
You, get out. Let me talk to Qin'er alone.

523
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,340
Hurry up.

524
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,920
Cousin, I'm sorry.

525
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,840
I won't do anything illegal again.

526
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,880
Next time, I'll use the money I earn to buy you a Porsche for your wedding.

527
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,199
I'll buy your wife bags.

528
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,719
I'll bring home all the good stuff from my in-laws. You can have everything.

529
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,760
Zhai Miao, it seems you still don't get the picture.

530
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,800
Is that what you should be thinking about right now?

531
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,900
I-I'm sorry.

532
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,880
Your lemon juice.

533
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,520
Your milk tea.

534
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,700
Cousin.

535
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,139
Do you still like her?

536
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,059
Do you like her?

537
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,220
It was fine before I met her.

538
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,920
Really.

539
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,059
It was fine before meeting her.

540
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,559
And now that you've seen her?

541
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,720
Now that I've seen her, I want to see her.

542
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,079
Fine.

543
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,199
I'll be more courteous next time I see her.

544
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,880
I won't pick on her again.

545
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,860
Thank you very much.

546
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,760
Cousin, it's true that I don't like her,

547
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,159
but I feel bad seeing you like this.

548
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,519
Actually, I can tell she still cares about you.

549
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,519
Why don't... you two date again?

550
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:03,519
You don't get it.

551
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,679
Hurry and eat.

552
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,840
- Hurry up. 
 - I totally get it.

553
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,599
It's because our two families don't get along.

554
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:11,480
Her family thinks there's a mismatch in our status.

555
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,359
How obnoxious.

556
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,063
It's not just that.

557
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,563
I think you're just too stubborn.

558
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,920
What do people pursue nowadays?

559
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,239
It's to be free and happy, to enjoy the present.

560
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,039
Just be together if there's affection.

561
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,559
The future is so uncertain. Don't worry about marriage and whatnot.

562
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,159
Just have a relationship. Take it one step at a time.

563
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,280
If it works out, good. If not, break up.

564
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,159
It's better than you two right now, in perpetual limbo, so close yet so far.

565
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,440
At least you'd experience the joy of being together.

566
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,800
Besides, say you two get together again and you learn her true colors,

567
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,760
so you change your mind and move on.

568
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,920
Isn't that great?

569
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,280
Where do you get all your weird ideas?

570
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,679
This isn't a weird idea.

571
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,960
Who says relationships always have happy endings?

572
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,639
Cousin, you were born with a face that can attract dozens of love interests.

573
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,719
However, it came with a faithful, unchanging heart.

574
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,119
Just shut up.

575
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,039
Hurry and eat.

576
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,320
Okay, thanks.

577
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,220
Enjoy.

578
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,400
Are you for real?

579
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,199
What?

580
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,180
Stop pretending. Should I ask Song Yan?

581
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,027
I can't believe you.

582
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,239
Get over it, will you?

583
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,599
There are plenty more wonders in life.

584
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,260
What?

585
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,059
I really wish I could be as you say.

586
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,320
Then tell me.

587
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,800
What is it about Song Yan that made you like him so much?

588
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't know.

589
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,039
That means you like him a lot.

590
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,239
Are you against it, too?

591
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:46,384
Now that was uncalled for.

592
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,656
When you two dated previously, did I ever stop you?

593
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,419
But now, I have to dissect it for you.

594
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:58,760
Let me ask you. What if your mom adamantly opposes it?

595
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,798
She believes his parents and family are no good.

596
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,159
And she insists you find someone of equal status.

597
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,380
Then what?

598
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,559
Some things aren't normally obvious.

599
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,000
But when it's time to talk about marriage, they become a massive hurdle.

600
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,519
But don't blame your mom.

601
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,639
She's wiser than you.

602
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,639
Love comes and goes in an instant.

603
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,780
But reality is a mountain even a foolish old man can't move.

604
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,699
But it's only when I see him...

605
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:30,780
that I feel alive.

606
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,580
You'll be the death of me.

607
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:42,959
That said, does Song Yan think the same way you do?

608
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,619
Just now at the police station,

609
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,079
you saw how he was.

610
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
Your mother and brother don't like him.

611
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,150
I'm sure he knows.

612
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,855
Today, he got another reality check from your brother.

613
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,854
He's such a proud man.

614
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,280
That couldn't have felt good for him.

615
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,649
If he can let go of his pride to be with you,

616
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:04,290
then I think he's even more unreliable.

617
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,032
Heed my advice.

618
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,360
You aren't suited for each other.

619
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,860
I mean it.

620
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:32,070
