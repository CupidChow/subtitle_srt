1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,570


2
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,795
   

3
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,140
   

4
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,013
   

5
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,068
   

6
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,047
Thank you.

7
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,526
Dr. Xu, why are you drenched?

8
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:52,526
I'll go and get changed first.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,540
Miss, how do I get there?

10
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,599
- Wait outside. 
 - Okay.

11
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,223
Thank you, Doctor!

12
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:14,400
How is his condition?

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,038
He has a serious case of pericardial effusion. Take a look at the report.

14
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,532
Look.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,900
Team Leader, his heart rate is raising.

16
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,627
His pulse is weak, and his breathing is shallow.

17
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,400
Prepare for pericardiocentesis.

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,840
Pericardiocentesis is a second-level surgery. Can we perform it on our own?

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,099
Am I or are you the team leader?

20
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,960
Xu Qin, you don't have the qualification to execute this procedure.

21
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,639
The patient might die due to pericardial tamponade.

22
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,719
You're only being responsible to the patient if you don't do anything uncertain.

23
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,120
How do you know if I’m certain or not?

24
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,545
If you do it improperly, the patient might die on the operation table.

25
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,760
Have you considered the consequences?

26
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
Can you bear the responsibility?

27
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,360
I can.

28
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
With what?

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,781
With this pair of hands, he won't die.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
Xu Qin, didn't I make myself clear enough?

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,919
Department Chief Xu is already on his way. Must you take this risk?

32
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,800
Dr. Yang, he is a patient of Team B. Please leave.

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
This isn't something you can do.

34
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,680
You're fooling around with a patient's life, you know?

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,553
Please leave the room.

36
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,832
Team Leader.

37
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,313
   

38
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
Let me clean your hands thoroughly.

39
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,600
- Dr. Yang. 
 - How is she?

40
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,079
Kiddo, look what I've got you.

41
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,759
Dear, I bought you some cakes.

42
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,060
Your father is fine now. Don't worry about him, okay?

43
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,099
Has she always been like this?

44
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,672
Leave her to me. You can resume your work.

45
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,174
Okay. You can go ahead.

46
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,319
She's a child of a single parent.

47
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,560
Her father has been taking care of her.

48
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Now, her father is in the ICU.

49
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,399
That's right. Poor girl.

50
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,739
This storm has caused many accidents and affected many families.

51
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,719
Does she have any other relatives?

52
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,120
Yes. I called her aunt just now.

53
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,060
She said she would pick her up soon.

54
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,168
Don't be afraid.

55
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,920
Sha Sha, the doctors are nice, aren't they?

56
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,160
They bought so much food for you.

57
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,879
Tell me what you want...

58
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,639
- Please wait. 
  - We'll go and...

59
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,710
Doctor?

60
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,744
Hello.

61
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,879
What is this?

62
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,720
This is a list of things you need to pay attention to when you get back.

63
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,800
I wrote down the contact number of an excellent psychiatrist too.

64
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
The child was traumatized. She might need psychological counseling.

65
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,959
Doctor, you're so considerate.

66
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,091
Don't mention it.

67
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,416
Sha Sha, hurry and thank your doctor.

68
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,600
Thank you, Doctor.

69
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,580
Don't mention it.

70
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,560
Doctor, I'll take her home first.

71
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,845
Okay.

72
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,809
   

73
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,639
You confirmed the symptoms of the patient's condition.

74
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,739
Your effort should be acknowledged.

75
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,000
However, you took your own decision and performed pericardiocentesis on the patient.

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,393
Why did you do that?

77
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,380
Because of his condition.

78
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,680
Have you done such surgery before?

79
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,033
I did it during my internship.

80
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,759
Only during your internship?

81
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,120
You were lucky this time.

82
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,519
Will you be as lucky next time?

83
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,680
Department Chief, it's not that I was lucky.

84
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,411
You said you wouldn't wait for my arrival if the situation was critical, am I right?

85
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,000
Let me ask you this then.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Do you wish for the situation to be critical or otherwise?

87
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,480
Department Chief, I'm not an idealist.

88
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,440
I will take corresponding measures according to the situation I face.

89
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,180
That's all.

90
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,220
Xu Qin, do you understand what a doctor's benevolence means?

91
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,897
Department Chief!

92
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,980
Our team leader was reprimanded by Department Chief Xu again.

93
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,240
That was to be expected.

94
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,514
She was reprimanded even though she saved someone.

95
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,679
Don't you think that's unfair?

96
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,360
Now that she has offended Department Chief Xu,

97
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm sure her slot in the research team will be affected.

98
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,960
Department Chief Xu didn't like her from the start.

99
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,760
She always pulls a long face, unlike Dr. Yang.

100
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,159
Dr. Yang cares for her patients. She's friendly too.

101
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,759
There's nothing wrong with that.

102
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,999
It's fine as long as she can save people. 
    

103
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,200
Miao Miao, when will your cousin come back?

104
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,199
I think he'll be home soon.

105
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,620
Brother, you're back.

106
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,159
Brother, let me introduce them to you.

107
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,559
These are my classmates.

108
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,080
This is Yi Yue. This is Ye Zi.

109
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,799
This is Yuan Yuan. This is my cousin.

110
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,691
- Hello, Brother. 
 - Hi, Brother.

111
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,292
Hello.

112
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,080
What do you think about my cousin?

113
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,759
I can finally see him in person.

114
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,600
He's much hotter in real life.

115
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,769
That's for sure.

116
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,639
By the way, I'll help my cousin to clean the house first.

117
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,040
You guys can have a seat inside.

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,559
Go ahead.

119
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,620
He's so hot.

120
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,320
Where are your parents?

121
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
They went to the park for a walk.

122
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,086
They prepared our meal before they left.

123
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,522
We starved as we waited for you to come back.

124
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,159
Why were you waiting for me?

125
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,039
They thought you were hot after looking at your picture.

126
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,979
They wanted to have a meal with you.

127
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,663
Zhai Miao, are you out of your mind?

128
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,919
If you have so much free time, you can get yourself a boyfriend.

129
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,840
Do you think I'm a monkey in the zoo?

130
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,619
Brother, are you angry?

131
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,300
I just thought that I had a hot older brother.

132
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,879
That's why I wanted to show off in front of my classmates.

133
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,780
Don't embarrass me, okay?

134
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,039
- Don't do this again. 
 - Okay.

135
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,284
Let's go.

136
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,700
Here, have some water.

137
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,840
It's so hot out here.

138
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,080
Do you think Zhai Miao's plan will work?

139
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,320
Why are we doing this too?

140
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,879
I don't care if it'll work or not. Let's just give it a try.

141
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,799
Every time I arrange a blind date for him, he says that he's busy with work.

142
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,120
Besides, we're doing this for his sake.

143
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,639
I think arranging the blind date at home is a good idea.

144
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,155
I don't expect much from my future daughter-in-law.

145
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:06,114
I think anyone is a good match for him as long as she's not related to the Meng family.

146
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,898
God, please be kind to Yan'er this time.

147
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,080
I still remember he came to our house

148
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
when he was still a child.

149
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,695
 Who's there? It's so late. 

150
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,260
 - So cold. 
 - Coming. 

151
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,782
 You're right. 

152
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:24,969
 Uncle! 

153
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,840
 What are you doing here? 

154
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
 Child, why are you wearing so little clothes? 

155
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,679
 Yes. Hurry and come inside. 

156
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,900
 I think Dad is dead. 

157
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,564
 What did you say? 

158
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,577
 When I left the house, 

159
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:43,300
 I saw him lying outside. 

160
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,097
 He was motionless. 

161
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,559
 Uncle, 

162
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,679
 I couldn't move him myself. 

163
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,800
 Can you please help me? 

164
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,039
 It was so cold back then. 

165
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,820
 And he was so young. 

166
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,560
I had no idea how he came to our house on foot.

167
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,879
- His mother... 
 - His mother wasn't a good person.

168
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,159
His mother was proud and vain.

169
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,399
She could even abandon her own son.

170
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,279
Don't bring her up in front of me again.

171
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,780
I'm just scared.

172
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
Yan'er is honest and single-minded.

173
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,540
He's just like his father.

174
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,979
Don't tell me he'll get a partner like his father...

175
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:31,159
Knock on wood. What are you saying?

176
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:33,799
Don't spout nonsense.

177
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,316
She went overseas, right? Why did she come back?

178
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,720
I mean, it's okay for her to come back. But why did she come to our house?

179
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
What exactly is she up to?

180
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,800
I don't care what she's up to.

181
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,141
This time, I won't let Yan'er get hurt again.

182
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,600
It's so hot here. Why didn't you bring an umbrella with you?

183
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,639
It's too hot.

184
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,360
We can get some calcium from the sun.

185
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,559
You usually don't like being under the sunlight. Get some sun and calcium while we're here.

186
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,241
- You got osteoporosis, right? 
 -  You got osteoporosis.

187
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,427
It's good to get some sunlight once in a while.

188
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,424
Fine, I'll do it myself.

189
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,251
Miao Miao, your mother is a great cook.

190
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,460
- Yeah, right? 
 - Especially the shrimp. They taste heavenly.

191
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,138
You guys can have more if you like them. Don't be courteous.

192
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,279
Ye Zi, eat up.

193
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,831
Don't just have that.

194
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,519
Here, try this.

195
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,005
Thank you.

196
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,079
Brother, Miao Miao said that you were a firefighter.

197
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,144
Is your work dangerous?

198
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,399
It's okay.

199
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,759
Fires don't occur frequently.

200
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,159
We often deal with daily rescue missions.

201
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,740
However, it's dangerous when the situations are dangerous.

202
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:07,159
If so, Brother, why haven't you got yourself a girlfriend yet?

203
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,143
For no reason. I had my hands tied at work.

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,347
Why are you asking so many questions?

205
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,120
Is this a census survey?

206
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,020
That's not it.

207
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,279
You guys can go ahead. I have something else to attend to.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Don't tell me your cousin was upset with us?

209
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,059
No way.

210
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,799
Miao Miao, your cousin was checking Ye Zi out.

211
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah, right? You saw that, too?

212
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,679
If so, I'll head upstairs and inquire about it.

213
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,303
Hurry up then.

214
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,570
Brother, what are you looking for?

215
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,360
My lighter. Have you seen it?

216
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,759
Your lighter?

217
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,639
It's not like it's a rare item.

218
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,679
Just buy another one if you lose it.

219
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:19,919
Brother.

220
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,849
Brother, I have something to ask you. Come.

221
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,840
What do you think about Ye Zi?

222
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,200
Which one is Ye Zi?

223
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,680
It's the girl who spoke the least and looked like Xu Qin.

224
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Who said she looked like her?

225
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,159
Brother, listen to me.

226
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,519
She's my best buddy.

227
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,491
From my buddy to my sister-in-law. Isn't that great?

228
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,559
You're itching for a beating, huh?

229
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,180
Brother, I'm being serious here.

230
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,419
You should consider it.

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,200
Brother, you should consider it.

232
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,719
I know my fault now.

233
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm serious. You should consider it.

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,461
Get out!

235
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,796
   

236
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,119
Hello, Xiao Yi Xiao?

237
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,409
Hello?

238
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:18,638
I made the inquiry for you.

239
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,350
Did you find him?

240
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,143
Song something is on leave today.

241
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,440
Why are you inquiring about him?

242
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,960
Don't ask.

243
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Your mother and brother would skin me alive if they found out, you know?

244
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll buy you a meal next time.

245
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,381
Yeah, and you never do.

246
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,012
Hello?

247
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,279
Song Yan.

248
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,982
Are you passing by again?

249
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,319
I wasn't passing by.

250
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,211
I came here on purpose.

251
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,471
Do you need anything?

252
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,299
I'm here to return your uniform.

253
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,160
You saved me last time.

254
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,139
I'm here to thank you.

255
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,419
You came all the way here just to tell me that?

256
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,112
I'm here to thank you.

257
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,920
Fine. How do you plan to thank me?

258
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,320
How do you want me to thank you?

259
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,440
What if I want you to marry me?

260
00:19:03,732 --> 00:19:07,801
If I told all the people I rescued to marry me, I should be dead by then.

261
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,781
It will never be your turn.

262
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,652
Xu Qin,

263
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,599
where did you get the confidence

264
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,000
to think that I still have feelings for you after so many years?

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,433
Song Yan,

266
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,919
don't speak to me in that manner.

267
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,039
What should I do then?

268
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,640
Do I need to address you as Young Lady Meng in a courteous manner?

269
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,000
Stop pretending to be pitiful.

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,964
I won't fall for it.

271
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,820
Song Yan,

272
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,440
let's reconcile with each other.

273
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,219
I forgot about you a long time ago.

274
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:51,720
So you're here.

275
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,830
I was looking for you.

276
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,799
This is such a headache.

277
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,880
How do we train the recruits?

278
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,254
Forty percent of them failed the fitness test.

279
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,880
Only 60% of them passed the tactical action test.

280
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,680
They are tired after running for 30 minutes.

281
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
They have been training for almost two years now.

282
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,187
They haven't improved at all.

283
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,720
Just one more time.

284
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,459
If we get the first place again,

285
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,539
we can keep this here permanently.

286
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,900
Song Yan, I'm not trying to criticize you here.

287
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,319
But don't you think the standards you set are too high for them?

288
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,993
Three thousand meters in 12 minutes is your passing standard?

289
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,559
Do you know what the other fire stations are calling us?

290
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,019
They call us the Shili Tai Sports Team.

291
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm not being strict.

292
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,680
It's just that they're lazy.

293
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,640
Only if you aim high, you can achieve better development.

294
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,809
Tell me then. The veteran firefighters thought we were good-for-nothings

295
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,400
when we first joined them, right?

296
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,839
Each generation has their own strengths and shortcomings.

297
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,440
You can take a look at their inner strengths occasionally.

298
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,079
With what?

299
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,825
A microscope?

300
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,190
With their current standard,

301
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,160
how could they be the champion of the Year-End Contest?

302
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,240
You want to be the champion every year. Aren't you tired?

303
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,443
If we get the 2nd place, then we are a failure.

304
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,219
That trophy is our past.

305
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,946
This trophy is our present.

306
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:37,121
It's the testimony of the firefighters of Shili Tai Fire Station

307
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:41,600
has gone through in the last eight years.

308
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:45,824
However,

309
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm not fighting alone.

310
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,219
I still have you by my side.

311
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,232
We made a vow before.

312
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,280
That we would turn Shili Tai Fire Station

313
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,639
into the best fire station in the nation.

314
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,774
   

315
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,039
- Morning, Comrades. 
 - Morning.

316
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,119
Morning, Team Leader.

317
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,480
Morning.

318
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,680
Team Leader, the hospital's administration office just called us.

319
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,977
They said there's a seminar at 2 p.m.

320
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:31,200
They want us to send a representative there.

321
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,920
Which one of you is willing to go?

322
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,440
I got some drinks here.

323
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,759
 Give me a bottle. 

324
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,839
- I want one, too. 
 - All of you have one.

325
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,960
Each of you can take one.

326
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,116
- Distribute them. 
 - Yes.

327
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay then.

328
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,521
If that's the case, let's draw lots.

329
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,480
Team Leader, this is for you.

330
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,119
You see, as our team leader, we should hand such rare educational opportunities to you.

331
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,160
Am I right, Team Leader?

332
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,720
You can leave the drink there.

333
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,920
However,

334
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,861
we still need to draw lots.

335
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,839
God bless me.

336
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,039
Please don't let it be me.

337
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,960
I don't want to attend a fire safety lecture.

338
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,079
Please don't let it be me.

339
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,799
- You have a point. 
 - Please don't let it be me.

340
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,440
We should let Dong Dong attend it.

341
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,799
Dong Dong, you should go.

342
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,800
It's always me.

343
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:42,303
   

344
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,400
Hello, everyone. I'm Li Meng, the fire marshal of Yancheng City Yanbei Firefighting Brigade.

345
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,784
Now, I will give a fire safety lecture that's related to your hospitals.

346
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:54,987
Let us begin.

347
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,056
   

348
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,884
   

349
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,079
 Nice! 

350
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,820
Brother Yan,

351
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,640
we had a discussion.

352
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,100
All of us think that the female doctor is beautiful.

353
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,695
So?

354
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:31,411
So...

355
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,419
we've decided to find her if we have

356
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:37,799
any knocks or bruises.

357
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,019
We'll seek treatment from her.

358
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,279
Why don't I give you a bruise right now?

359
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:44,079
Stop messing around.

360
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,503
Wait for me.

361
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,147
You're too quick!

362
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,939
 Nice! 

363
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,828
 Nice! 

364
00:26:58,252 --> 00:26:59,951
Brother Yan,

365
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,725
let's be honest here.

366
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,680
- What? 
 - Honestly speaking, do you know that female doctor?

367
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,659
I feel like you two are...

368
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,200
Hey, they are watching. Spare me some pride.

369
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
What are you laughing at? Next group.

370
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,334
Pi Pi, Xiao Ge, get ready.

371
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:17,559
It's been a long day, you know? What are you doing?

372
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,904
That's all for our fire safety lecture today.

373
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,443
Thank you for coming.

374
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,561
Miss Li, is the most handsome one your boyfriend?

375
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,319
Miss Li, you're really something.

376
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,499
Your boyfriend is very handsome.

377
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,920
Hello.

378
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,603
Is the fire safety lecture one of the detachment's missions?

379
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:07,205
That's right.

380
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Have we met in a bar before?

381
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,487
So you're a doctor?

382
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:14,943
My last name is Xu.

383
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:19,680
So, Dr. Xu, are you here to learn more about our job?

384
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,979
Do you know Song Yan?

385
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,839
He's from the fire station. We're from the detachment.

386
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,654
I'm his superior.

387
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,200
I understand. You guys have different tasks.

388
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,880
The fire station is responsible for putting out fires and rescuing people.

389
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,114
But for the detachment,

390
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,886
we mainly deal with the promotion of fire safety awareness and education-based tasks.

391
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,799
So he saves people while you educate them?

392
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,679
You two are a good match indeed.

393
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,873
Thanks.

394
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:50,188
   

395
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,832
   

396
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:17,039
   

397
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,079
What do you think? How was my massage? 
    

398
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:22,039
That was so comfortable. I almost fell asleep.

399
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,599
I'm so exhausted.

400
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll give you a massage later.

401
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,725
Sure.

402
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,480
I thought I was in a massage parlor for a second.

403
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,079
Team Leader, do you want to give their special service a try?

404
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,899
That's my bonus then.

405
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:43,000
Team Leader, I finally understand the meaning of feast or famine.

406
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,759
In the past, we just needed to check body temperature, blood pressure,

407
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,880
and deal with sprains and sore throats.

408
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,279
Those were the days!

409
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,400
Weren't you guys the ones who wanted to be assigned

410
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,480
to the Emergency Department so that you could perform major surgeries?

411
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,079
We were too young back then.

412
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,040
We were hasty.

413
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,519
Three minutes before the end of our shift.

414
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,799
I hope nothing will happen...

415
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,920
Don't say things like that. The more you say it, the more bizarre it might be.

416
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,533
Knock on wood.

417
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,568
Hello, this is Emergency Department Team B.

418
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,433
 Emergency Department Team B, 

419
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,588
 a serious car accident has occurred on the Outer Ring Road. Please send help. 

420
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,591
Got it.

421
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,599
- Oh no. 
 - Accident on the Outer Ring Road.

422
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,900
- Get changed and follow me. 
 - Okay.

423
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,039
Okay, please stay put. The ambulance will be here soon.

424
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,580
Don't move. The ambulance is arriving.

425
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,000
   

426
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,680
What's the situation?

427
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,839
Two vehicles collided. The driver is pinned inside the black truck.

428
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,479
There's one more at the bottom. The driver is trapped in the water.

429
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,608
Feng Bei, check that area.

430
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,554
Xu Xi, Dong Dong, set up intravenous access.

431
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,639
The driver of the red vehicle is still trapped inside.

432
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,228
- Stay here. I'll go down. 
 - Okay.

433
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:36,471
- Yang Chi. 
 - Yes, Sir!

434
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,559
Jiang Yi! Come!

435
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,825
Old Jiang!

436
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,799
Doctor, please hurry.

437
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,897
Team Leader, judging from the pool of blood, I think he's...

438
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,400
Team Leader.

439
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,599
She's dead.

440
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,677
- If so... 
 - Doctor, let's check that area out.

441
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:10,359
- How is the victim's condition? 
 - He's still conscious.

442
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,319
Okay. Please make way for me.

443
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:16,940
Hang in there a little longer. You'll be able to come out soon.

444
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,240
Da Peng, get the pliers and crowbar.

445
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,579
Right away!

446
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:25,519
I was riding my motorcycle

447
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,000
and I was going to make a turn.

448
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,480
Suddenly, a car came from behind and crashed into me.

449
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,920
I just bought this motorcycle not long ago. My goodness.

450
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,039
Does your head hurt?

451
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,556
No.

452
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,200
Should we measure his blood pressure?

453
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,427
Give him oxygen and send him to the hospital.

454
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:41,760
- Is he okay? 
 - He's been lying there for some time.

455
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,073
Please don't take pictures.

456
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:44,960
Don't take pictures. Back up.

457
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,319
 Don't take any pictures. 

458
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:50,319
Team Leader, I'll stay here.

459
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:56,770
   

460
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,500
- Mind your steps. 
 - Okay.

461
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,920
Old Jiang, get me the winch.

462
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,839
Hurry, put the winch down.

463
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,256
Hurry up.

464
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:58,750
Hurry up. Put the winch down. Hurry.

465
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,960
Hello. How are you doing?

466
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,775
It hurts.

467
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,880
Save me.

468
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,687
Okay. Don't be nervous.

469
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:14,800
Don't worry.

470
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,360
We'll definitely save you.

471
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,920
You can tell me if you're facing any other issues, okay?

472
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,353
Okay.

473
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,442
Save me.

474
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,522
Clothes.

475
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,780
Don't worry. This is garment is to protect you.

476
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,480
Thank you.

477
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,327
It will be fine in a second.

478
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,960
Captain, the vehicle is stuck.

479
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,840
- Save the victim first. 
 - Okay.

480
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,639
Tong Ming!

481
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,184
Break into the trunk!

482
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,480
One, two, three!

483
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,010
The stretcher!

484
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,900
- Is your leg hurt? 
 - It does hurt.

485
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,880
Be careful. He can't straighten his legs.

486
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Slow down. He can't straighten his legs.

487
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,928
Support his waist.

488
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,636
- Put his waist down first. 
 - Be gentle.

489
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,000
Mind his head.

490
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
His head. Be careful.

491
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,912
- Slowly. 
 - Thank you.

492
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:43,799
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

493
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:46,520
One, two, three, up.

494
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,360
- I'll send him there. 
 - Go now.

495
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,320
Junping, go and help Captain and the rest.

496
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,660
Okay.

497
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,219
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

498
00:36:02,238 --> 00:36:03,679
We need a doctor!

499
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,000
Doctor!

500
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,139
- Pass the tools to me. 
 - Okay.

501
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,152
- Make way for me. 
 - Dong Yue, support her.

502
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:26,445
Okay.

503
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,394
- Hold this for me. 
 - Okay.

504
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,280
I need help. We need to carry him.

505
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,320
Old Yang, lend us a hand.

506
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,679
- Here. 
 - Lend them a hand.

507
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,579
Here, Junping!

508
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,519
Captain, are you okay?

509
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,919
Are you okay?

510
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,783
You're injured.

511
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,193
- Lend me a hand! 
 - Okay.

512
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:04,497
- Raise him higher. 
 - Here.

513
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:05,559
- Support him! 
 - Lend him a hand! 
    

514
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,480
Hurry! Lend him a hand!

515
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,939
- It hurts! 
 - Hang in there.

516
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,234
We'll send you to the hospital immediately. Hang in there.

517
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,355
One, two, three, go.

518
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,819
It hurts!

519
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,266
Be careful.

520
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,360
Everything is fine.

521
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,711
That's not true.

522
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,032
Song Yan, go to the hospital.

523
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:47,739
You're injured! Go to the hospital!

524
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,119
Where are you going?

525
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,520
Listen to the doctor.

526
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,119
Get in the ambulance.

527
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,460
I'm fine. I don't need to go.

528
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,160
Why are you so stubborn?

529
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,257
Just go.

530
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,163
Go.

531
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,092
   

532
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,214
Push him inside.

533
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,432
Take off your clothes.

534
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,959
I want another doctor.

535
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,619
The others are busy.

536
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,500
So I don't have a choice?

537
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,059
I didn't have a choice when you saved me last time.

538
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,256
Lie on the bed.

539
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,280
Bear with it.

540
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,033
I won't die from this.

541
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:41,481
You saved me again in the lake.

542
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,340
Thank you.

543
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,461
It was my duty.

544
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,860
That sounds like an excuse to me.

545
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,989
All right, you may go.

546
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:40,080
By the way,

547
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,720
come to me to get your dressing changed tomorrow and the day after.

548
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,700
Xu Qin, what are you up to?

549
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,079
You came to my house out of the blue and asked for a reconciliation.

550
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,634
What do you want?

551
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,199
You want to reconcile with me?

552
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,760
Have you straightened out your thoughts before reconciling with me?

553
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,159
Come, tell me.

554
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,139
How do you wish to reconcile with me?

555
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:21,400
You want me to come back when you beckon me.

556
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,000
When you're tired of me, you'll cast me aside.

557
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,310
Don't you think it's pointless?

558
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm talking to you.

559
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,160
Don't you think it's pointless?

560
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,081
What do you think?

561
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,880
I thought you already forgot about me? Why are you minding my business then?

562
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Why did you save me when the chassis broke?

563
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,239
That was my duty.

564
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,119
Am I part of your duty then?

565
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:47,099
Tell me. Answer me!

566
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,139
That's not it.

567
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,759
What is it then?

568
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,882
After all,

569
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:04,382
I once fell for you.

570
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,223
You once fell for me...

571
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,282
Really?

572
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:24,720


573
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,900
