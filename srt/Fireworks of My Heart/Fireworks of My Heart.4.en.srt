196
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,300
Why were you waiting for me?

197
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,220
They saw your photo

198
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,020
and thought you were so handsome.

199
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,250
They wanted to have dinner with you.

200
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,180
Are you crazy, Zhai Miao?

201
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,420
If you are so free,

202
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,900
find yourself a boyfriend.

203
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,180
Do you think I'm a monkey? Putting me up for show.

204
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,420
Brother.

205
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,820
Are you angry?

206
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,260
I just think

207
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,180
my brother is handsome,

208
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,580
so I wanted to show him off to my classmates.

209
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,460
Just do me a favor.

210
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,180
Just this once.

211
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,780
Okay.

212
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,460
Let's go.

213
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,780
Here.

214
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,610
Have some water.

215
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,820
It's really hot today.

216
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,500
Do you think

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,890
Zhai Miao's idea will work?

218
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,370
We're joining in the fun too.

219
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,380
Who cares if it'll work.

220
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,180
Just give it a try.

221
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,380
Every time I ask him to go on a blind date,

222
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
Yan'er

223
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,460
always says he's busy.

224
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,540
Besides, this is

225
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,610
for his own good.

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,340
I think it's good

227
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,420
that it's at home.

228
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,980
My standards aren't high anyway.

229
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,900
As long as there's nothing to do with the Meng family,

230
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,220
I'll think it's a good match.

231
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,290
Heavens,

232
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,260
please be kind

233
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,700
to Yan'er this time.

234
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,020
I still remember

235
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,140
the first time he came to our house

236
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,460
when he was a kid.

237
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,180
Who is it at this hour?

238
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,180
It's so cold.

239
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,940
Coming!

240
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,770
Yes.

241
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Uncle.

242
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,500
Why are you here?

243
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,180
Why are you wearing so little?

244
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,780
Yeah.

245
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,660
Come on in.

246
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,980
I think Dad is dead.

247
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,770
What did you say?

248
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,340
When I came out,

249
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,060
I saw him lying outside the door.

250
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,020
He wasn't moving.

251
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,580
Uncle.

252
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,500
He's too heavy.

253
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,300
Please help me carry him.

254
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,980
Okay?

255
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,300
It was so cold.

256
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,300
He was so young.

257
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,940
I don't even know

258
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,940
how he got to our house that day.

259
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,380
His mother...

260
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,180
His mother is a bad person.

261
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,680
She was greedy and vain.

262
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,330
She even abandoned

263
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,370
her own child.

264
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,260
Don't mention this person

265
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,980
in front of me again.

266
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,660
I am

267
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,060
just a little scared.

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,380
Yan'er is upright

269
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,370
and stubborn.

270
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,820
Just like his father.

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,980
Could it be that

272
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,860
he's also fated...

273
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,140
What are you talking about?

274
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,620
Nonsense.

275
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,620
She already left the country.

276
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,900
Why would she come back?

277
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
It's fine that she came back.

278
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,530
Why did she come here?

279
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,020
What does she want?

280
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,780
I don't care what she wants.

281
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,820
No matter what,

282
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,220
I can't let Yan'er get hurt.

283
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,980
It's so hot.

284
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,580
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

285
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,620
It's scorching.

286
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,060
You can get some sunlight and replenish your calcium.

287
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,660
You don't usually like sunbathing.

288
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,740
Get some sunshine. Hurry up. Replenish your calcium.

289
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,220
You're going to get osteoporosis.

290
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
You have osteoporosis.

291
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,090
Get more sun.

292
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,700
Okay.

293
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,420
I'll sunbathe.

294
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,370
Miaomiao,

295
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,380
your mom's cooking is so delicious.

296
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,730
Right?

297
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,140
Especially this shrimp.

298
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,340
It's so delicious.

299
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,460
Eat more if you like it.

300
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,170
Don't stand on ceremony.

301
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,300
Ye'zi,

302
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,250
eat more.

303
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,500
Don't just eat what's in front of you.

304
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,260
Here.

305
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Try this.

306
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,060
Thank you.

307
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,140
I heard from Miaomiao

308
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,210
you're a firefighter?

309
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,700
Your work

310
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,820
must be really dangerous.

311
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,760
Not really.

312
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,370
Actually, there aren't many fires.

313
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,740
We mostly do regular rescues.

314
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,980
But when it's dangerous,

315
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,860
it's very dangerous.

316
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,150
Then,

317
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,220
why don't you

318
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,300
have a girlfriend?

319
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,000
No reason.

320
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,100
I'm busy with work.

321
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,220
Why are asking so many questions?

322
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,170
Carrying out a census?

323
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
No.

324
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,540
You guys eat first.

325
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,490
I have something to do.

326
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,060
Is your brother

327
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,700
unhappy?

328
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,980
No.

329
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,780
Miaomiao,

330
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,610
your brother looked at Ye'zi quite a few times.

331
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,620
Right?

332
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,770
You noticed it too?

333
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,340
I'll go upstairs and see what's going on.

334
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,270
Go and have a look.

335
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,860
Brother.

336
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,060
What are you looking for?

337
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,820
Did you see my lighter?

338
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,260
Lighter?

339
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,700
A lighter isn't

340
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,380
a rare item.

341
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,860
Buy another one if it's gone.

342
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,460
Brother.

343
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,420
Brother, let me talk to you about something.

344
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,220
Come on.

345
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,300
What do you think of Ye'zi?

346
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,770
What Ye'zi?

347
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,700
The one who talked the least

348
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,060
and looks like Xu Qin.

349
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,570
Looks like?

350
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:32,980
Brother,

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,140
listen.

352
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,500
She is my best friend.

353
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,060
It'll be great

354
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,780
if my classmate became my sister-in-law.

355
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,530
Are you looking for a fight?

356
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,420
Brother,

357
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,460
I'm serious.

358
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,500
Think about it.

359
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,940
Brother.

360
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,700
Think about it.

361
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,900
I was wrong.

362
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,140
I mean it.

363
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,980
Think about it.

364
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,620
Get lost!

365
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,920
[Female Changing Room]

366
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,740
Hello, Xiao Yixiao.

367
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,619
Hello.

368
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,420
I asked around.

369
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,380
You found him?

370
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,250
Song

371
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,420
is on leave today.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Why are you asking about this?

373
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,260
Don't ask.

374
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,220
If your mother and brother find out about this,

375
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,420
they'll kill me.

376
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,150
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

377
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,300
At this point, you owe me

378
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,460
hundreds of meals.

379
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,180
Hello?

380
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,260
Song Yan.

381
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,140
You were just passing by again?

382
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,020
No.

383
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,300
I came here specially.

384
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,400
What's up?

385
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,380
I'm returning your clothes.

386
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,420
You saved me last time.

387

00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,140
Call the doctor.

775
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,510
Doctor!

776
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,580
Give me the tools!

777
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,030
Okay.

778
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,140
Excuse me.

779
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,580
Dong Yue.

780
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,060
Give her a hand.

781
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,460
Okay.

782
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,900
Hold this for me.

783
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,290
Okay.

784
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,900
Come!

785
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:40,740
Someone.

786
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,980
Carry him out.

787
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,820
Yang.

788
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,300
Lend a hand.

789
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,260
Lend a hand.

790
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,660
Come here, Junping.

791
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,340
Chief.

792
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,940
Are you okay?

793
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,980
Are you okay?

794
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,980
You're injured?

795
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,580
Lend a hand!

796
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:02,980
Okay.

797
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,820
Raise him higher.

798
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,540
Come on.

799
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,140
Help hold onto him.

800
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,540
Lend a hand.

801
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,340
Hurry up.

802
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,020
Lend a hand.

803
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,070
It hurts.

804
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,860
Hang in there.

805
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,700
We'll take you to the hospital.

806
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,220
Hang in there.

807
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,340
One, two, three, up.

808
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,340
It hurts.

809
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,500
Be careful.

810
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,940
It's okay.

811
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,900
It's okay.

812
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,150
Song Yan, go to the hospital.

813
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,580
You're injured! Go to the hospital!

814
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,650
Where are you going?

815
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,950
Listen to the doctor.

816
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,490
Get in the ambulance.

817
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,350
I'm fine. I don't have to go.

818
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,220
Are you stupid?

819
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,260
Go, now.

820
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,300
Go.

821
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,940
[Emergency]

822
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,350
Hurry, push him in.

823
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,340
Take off your shirt.

824
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,130
I want to request another doctor.

825
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,670
The other doctors are very busy.

826
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,560
That means I have no choice?

827
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,960
Last time, when you saved me, I had no choice either.

828
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,340
Lie down.

829
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,020
Bear with it.

830
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,100
I won't die.

831
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,620
Today in the lake,

832
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,890
you saved me again.

833
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,120
Thank you.

834
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,440
It's my job.

835
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,700
Sounds like an excuse.

836
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,300
All right, you can go now.

837
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,580
By the way,

838
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,460
come get the dressing changed for the next two days.

839
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,020
Xu Qin.

840
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,650
What do you want?

841
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,820
Why did you come to my house

842
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,540
and ask to make up?

843
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,900
What do you want?

844
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,800
Make up?

845
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,300
Have you thought it through

846
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,220
before you asked to make up?

847
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,210
Come on, tell me.

848
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,250
How do you want to make up?

849
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,620
You beckon to me,

850
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,990
and I come running back?

851
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,020
After you've had enough fun,

852
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,130
you can kick me away?

853
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,350
What's the point of this nonsense?

854
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,210
I'm asking you.

855
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:28,890
What's the point?

856
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,190
Is there a point?

857
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,900
Didn't you forget me?

858
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,140
Why do you care what happens to me?

859
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,830
The car's frame was broken.

860
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,860
Why did you catch me?

861
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
That was work.

862
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,500
What kind of work am I to you?

863
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,300
Tell me.

864
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,180
Answer me!

865
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,420
No.

866
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,140
Then what am I?

867
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,600
After all,

868
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,560
I used to like you.

869
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,140
Like...

870
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,460
Used to...
