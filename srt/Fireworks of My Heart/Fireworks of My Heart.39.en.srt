[Episode 39]

4
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,190
I'll start.

5
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,740
This is the first time

6
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,340
you've come to have dinner with us, Qin's father.

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,759
I want to propose a toast to you on behalf of our family.

8
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,780
Welcome.

9
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,610
Thank you.

10
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,910
Thank you.

11
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,850
Actually, I'm here today

12
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,030
to

13
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,130
have a discussion

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
with you two

15
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,620
about the kids.

16
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,100
Song Yan's parents

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
are not around.

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,829
We

19
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,440
treat him as our own child.

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,620
We should've come to your place for this.

21
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,420
Right?

22
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,420
Yes.

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,540
You're very kind.

24
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,250
Actually, it doesn't matter.

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,920
What matters is that

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,910
all parents

27
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,990
want their children

28
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,420
to be happy.

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,100
Yes.

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,990
Marriage is about the kids,

31
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,770
but it's also a significant matter to the two families.

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,630
Yes.

33
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,060
How about this?

34
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,690
I'll propose a toast to you.

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,620
Please take care of Qin

36
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,230
in the future.

37
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,940
Thank you.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,340
Okay.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,160
Cheers.

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,910
Cheers.

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,850
Rest assured.

42
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,870
We

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,500
won't let

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Qin be wronged.

45
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,500
Yes.

46
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,180
Our family

47
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,340
treats Qin very well.

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,040
She is

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,470
the queen in this household now.

50
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,820
Don't interrupt when adults are talking.

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm an adult too.

52
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,190
Why can't I?

53
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,440
Besides,

54
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,910
I was saying that on behalf of our family.

55
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,800
Sister-in-law.

56
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,220
My daughter is always like this, so lively.

57
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,300
Don't take it seriously, In-law.

58
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,329
It's okay.

59
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,079
She's great.

60
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,490
I heard that there will be a housing demolition

61
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,460
on Wufang Street.

62
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:27,920
Yes.

63
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,380
Yes.

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,180
So,

65
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,170
where will they live

66
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,910
after getting married?

67
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,860
Don't worry.

68
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,930
My brother has already...

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,020
This won't be a problem.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,380
No matter where we move,

71
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,340
we will definitely

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,590
prepare a place for them to live after getting married.

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,320
Come on, In-law.

74
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,390
Let's raise our glasses

75
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,380
and wish them happiness.

-Cheers./N-Cheers.

I wish you happiness.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,870
Wish you happiness.

[Zhai's]

81
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,060
Alright.

82
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,440
You can stop here.

83
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,890
Dad.

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,250
Let me walk you to the entrance of the alley.

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,260
No need.

86
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,540
Song Yan can walk me there.

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,300
I also want to talk to him.

88
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,900
Go back first.

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,720
Go.

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:40,170
[Zhai's]

91
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,620
Let's go.

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,940
Song Yan.

93
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,020
I can tell that

94
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,610
Qin

95
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,140
is determined to marry you.

96
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,060
I've also made up my mind

97
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,810
to marry her.

98
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,890
Actually, before I came here,

99
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,930
I was a little worried.

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,270
I was worried

101
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,400
that you might not be able to make her happy.

102
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,620
But to be honest,

103
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,020
after I came,

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,700
the atmosphere in your family

105
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,150
is so enviable.

106
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,710
I didn't expect that.

107
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,060
Song Yan.

108
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,620
I sincerely hope

109
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,900
you two's new family can also be this happy

110
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,490
in the future.

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,690
Don't worry.

112
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
I won't let her down.

113
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,540
Back then,

114
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,230
you didn't get into the military academy because of us.

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
There's no need to bring up

116
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,780
what's in the past.

117
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,420
I don't regret

118
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,620
any choice I made before.

119
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,700
Besides,

120
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,540
I'm doing well now.

121
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,640
I don't resent

122
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,550
or regret.

123
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,290
We still have a long way ahead of us.

124
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,980
What's wrong?

125
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,460
We're going to rent a house.

126
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,780
Do you feel...

127
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Stop here.

128
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,060
Don't be dramatic.

129
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,140
Speaking of which...

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,620
Are you hiding something

131
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,900
from me together with Zhai Miao?

132
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,780
What is it?

133
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,050
I'm not.

134
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,909
What is it?

135
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,820
Don't look at me like that.

136
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,840
What did I do? Stop staring at me.

137
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,590
Still pretending, huh?

138
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,330
Tell me.

139
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,190
Are you hiding

140
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,140
a lot of secrets from me?

141
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,190
I really am not, my princess.

142
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,650
Alright.

143
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,820
Let's go to sleep.

144
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,980
Here we are.

145
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,220
The key is inside.

146
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,580
The landlord said

147
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,740
you can take a look first.

148
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,100
If you like it,

149
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,340
he'll ask his wife.

150
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,980
Oh.

151
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,670
The landlord is a romantic person.

152
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,820
It's useless to praise him.

153
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,620
Whether we can move in or not

154
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,500
depends on the landlord's wife.

155
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,140
The wife is the owner of this house.

156
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,900
Let's go.

157
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,660
Restroom.

158
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,520
Come here.

159
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,040
This is the kitchen.

160
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,790
Let's check it out later.

161
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,990
Let's go check out the study.

162
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,210
How is it?

163
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,460
It's very cozy.

164
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,620
You know what?

165
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,850
I've viewed many houses online,

166
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,260
but none of them caught my eye.

167
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,500
This one is good.

168
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,530
Let's go check out the bedroom.

169
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,830
This

170
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,050
will be our bedroom.

171
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,380
Isn't the balcony spacious?

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,470
We can

173
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,810
put some greenery here,

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,280
and place our fish tank

175
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,010
and little turtle

176
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,890
here.

177
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,880
It's very suitable for that, right?

178
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,070
You know what?

179
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Although I've never met this landlord,

180
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,680
I'm already obsessed

181
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,640
with him.

182
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,780
Let's rent this house.

183
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,610
Don't rush your decision.

184
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,200
There's another place

185
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,180
I haven't shown you.

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,240
There's more?

187
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,740
Let's go.

188
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:38,250
[If you smile, the sun city]

189
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,740
It's so beautiful here.

190
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,020
How did you find it?

191
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,580
Do you like it?

192
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes.

193
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,130
It must took you a long time to find this place, right?

194
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,220
I'll call

195
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,940
the landlady.

196
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,180
We need to get her approval.

197
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,130
Call her now.

198
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,620
Wrong number.

199
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,770
You dialed my number.

200
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,900
It's you.

201
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,470
My landlady.

202
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,710
[Song Yan]

203
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,660
Hello?

204
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,660
Landlady.

205
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,550
Your place is very nice.

206
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,450
It's rare that my wife likes a place.

207
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,310
Can we move in?

208
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,660
Well,

209
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,660
how long do you want to stay?

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,840
A lifetime.

211
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,300
Are you willing to?

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Yes, I am.

213
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,770
Song Yan, I love this place so much.

214
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,600
Wait.

215
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,220
There's one more thing

216
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,940
I haven't done.

217
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,100
What?

218
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,630
Xu Qin.

219
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,950
Thank you.

220
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,620
Thank you for coming back to me.

221
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,620
Thank you for letting me have

222
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,620
expectations for the rest of my life.

223
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,780
I will protect you

224
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,160
the way I protect this city.

225
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm willing to

226
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,340
give you my everything.

227
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,220
My dawn

228
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,980
and dusk.

229
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,870
My past

230
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,020
and future.

231
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,340
All my passion and biased love.

232
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,900
I'll be sincere

233
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,770
and loyal to you forever.

234
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,640
I'll never betray you.

235
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,360
Xu Qin.

236
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,310
Will you marry me?

237
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,250
Yes.

238
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:08,910
[If you smile, the sun city]

239
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,460
What is this?

240
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,670
A ring?

241
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,820
Are you getting married?

242
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,550
You only found out now?

243
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,420
Your reaction.

244
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,180
So insensitive.

245
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,380
Show me.

246
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,760
The diamond is so big.

247
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,940
Put it back.

248
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,660
Chief Song is so generous.

249
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,260
Look at her.

250
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,170
She's been smiling more these days

251
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,750
because of this happy occasion.

252
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,160
I'm leaving.

253
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,470
What about you?

254
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,700
What's up with you?

255
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,180
I...

256
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,060
I just...

257
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,650
What?

258
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,620
Chief is getting married?

259
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,510
He proposed and she said yes.

260
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,140
Wait and see.

261
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,740
There's going to be

262
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,040
great news in our station.

263
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,220
No way.

264
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Did he ask us

265
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,670
before he did something so important?

266
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,210
Did he get the approval

267
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,380
from the station to get married?

268
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,320
Exactly.

269
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,700
So conceited.

270
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Why do I have to get your approval

271
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,290
for my marriage?

272
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,510
Chief, I was just congratulating you on your marriage.

273
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,380
Congratulations.

274
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,710
That's right. Congratulations on your marriage.

275
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,700
Congratulations, Chief.

276
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,460
Eat.

277
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,690
[One vehicle at a time. Do not tailgate.]

278
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,230
[Fire and Rescue]

279
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,740
You look pretty.

280
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,270
Don't I look the same as usual?

281
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Still, you look pretty.

282
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,930
Let's go.

283
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,380
Welcome.

284
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,860
You're the chief. Pay attention to your image.

285
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,020
It doesn't violate the rules that I'm here, right?

286
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,980
You're my family.

287
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,570
How can you not enjoy this benefit?

288
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,460
Why do you keep looking at me?

289
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,170
The lipstick color

290
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,430
is different from last time.

291
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,190
This is the one you gave me.

292
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,290
If you're not willing,

293
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,510
I'll return it to you.

294
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,340
How?

295
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,140
How do you want me to return it?

296
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,990
This way.

297
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,690
Let me formally introduce.

298
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,250
This is Dr. Xu from the city hospital.

299
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
Your sister-in-law.

300
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,020
Hello, Sister-in-law!

301
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,390
Hello, everyone！

302
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,740
Is your sister-in-law pretty?

303
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,240
Yes!

304
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,040
Guys.

305
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,310
She used to be Dr. Xu,

306
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,780
but now she's our sister-in-law.

307
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
We need to let Chief

308
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,340
give us some tips.

309
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,300
Right?

310
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,220
Tell us, Chief.

311
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,540
Tell us about it, Chief.

312
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,670
You have to give us some tips,

313
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,630
Chief.

314
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,960
Chi has been pursuing Nurse Xi.

315
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,250
But there's still no progress.

316
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,140
Do I have to tell you about the progress?

317
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,540
Go ask Jiang if there's any progress.

318
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,310
Chief and Sister-in-law

319
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,370
were high school classmates.

320
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,580
They're different from you.

321
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,300
Of course.

322
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,220
In Chief's case,

323
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,500
it's "first come, first served",

324
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,960
or "keep the goodies to himself".

325
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,730
Chief has been planning on this

326
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,200
since forever.

327
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,980
Yes.

328
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,940
Do you remember that time

329
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,859
when we went to the hospital?

330
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,780
When we went to see the dentist.

331
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,230
I knew something was not right.

332
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,180
You didn't believe me.

333
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,790
Now that I think about it,

334
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,089
there was really something wrong with Chief that day.

335
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,099
Turns out it was the day he finally reunited with Sister-in-law.

336
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,920
He was scheming

337
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,109
in secret.

338
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,880
Chief.

339
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,710
Were you already in love with Sister-in-law back then?

340
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:23,500
Of course.

341
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,540
Miao.

342
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,050
Stop slacking off.

343
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,700
Come and help me.

344
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,300
Mum, I'm busy.

345
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,780
What are you

346
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,140
busy with all day?

347
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,250
My brother is getting married,

348
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,580
but they are both so busy.

349
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,540
They haven't made any arrangements.

350
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
I have to do it.

351
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,070
Your brother said it's too hot now.

352
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,130
They won't have the wedding

353
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,390
until October, in autumn.

354
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,700
What's the hurry?

355
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,630
You don't understand.

356
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,740
Many people

357
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,470
are getting married in October.

358
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,910
If I don't book a hotel now,

359
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,980
how can we get the hotel

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,920
for the wedding by then?

361
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,930
You're right.

362
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,830
Of course.

363
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,540
Also, after booking the hotel,

364
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,180
I have to decide the menu.

365
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,310
After the menu is decided,

366
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,870
I have to do a head count

367
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,760
of the guests, right?

368
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,900
My brother and sister-in-law are so busy.

369
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,570
I even have to go

370
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,790
and try on wedding dresses for them.

371
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,260
I'm speechless.

372
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,730
I think

373
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,490
I may as well

374
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,180
get married myself instead of them.

375
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,140
This way, I can get some money as wedding gifts.

376
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

377
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,670
Mum.

378
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,740
Girls are to spoil.

379
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,100
Why do you always hit me?

380
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,210
Are you a girl?

381
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:40,850
Ms. Miao.

382
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,030
Your words

383
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
have seriously hurt

384
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,700
my body and mind.

385
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,560
Alright, continue your hotel selection.

386
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,780
Check this out.

387
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,460
How many did you pick?

388
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,020
I picked three.

389
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,980
Take a look.

390
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,460
How is it? Do you like it?

391
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,530
Yes.

392
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,790
But it doesn't matter if I like it.

393
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,410
Let's go.

394
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,390
Let's try on the next one.

395
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,940
Check out the fabric.

396
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,660
Not bad.

397
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,640
Do you like it?

398
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,780
Yes.

399
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,170
So, this is it?

400
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,610
Is there another one?

401
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,520
Here, have some water first.

402
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,660
Thank you.

403
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,480
What do you think?

404
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,550
Do you like anything you tried?

405
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,140
This one.

406
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,020
This one.

407
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:07,860
And this one.

408
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,930
They are all good.

409
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,620
So which one will you choose?

410
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,640
After my selection,

411
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,840
these three dresses

412
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,190
are all outstanding.

413
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,180
It'll be my sister-in-law's call.

414
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,620
Your sister-in-law?

415
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,660
You're not the bride?

416
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,730
I'm doing the wedding dress audition for her.

417
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,480
It can save time.

418
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,310
She

419
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,420
is a doctor.

420
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,790
She's busy

421
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,580
saving lives every day.

422
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,900
I see. Okay.

423
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,030
You've picked the main dress.

424
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,820
You still have to pick the side dress and toast dress.

425
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,360
Do you want to continue?

426
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,470
There's more?

427
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,690
How have you been recently?

428
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,500
Xiao Yixiao told me

429
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,840
you've been sleeping all the time these days.

430
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,550
It's like I've been tired for a long time.

431
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,010
Like I've walked a long way

432
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,380
with a heavy burden.

433
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,300
I've never stopped

434
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
or rested.

435
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,250
The timing was good.

436
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,100
I took advantage of this opportunity

437
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
to sleep well for a few days.

438
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,700
I think

439
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,220
you look

440
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,700
much better than before.

441
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,180
Much more relaxed.

442
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,740
Relaxed?

443
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,590
This word doesn't suit me.

444
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,330
The ring is pretty.

445
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,120
This is for you.

446
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,580
What is this?

447
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,890
A wedding gift.

448
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,180
I'm not married yet.

449
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,240
Keep it in advance.

450
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,480
Thanks.

451
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,300
By the way,

452
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,870
I'm going to work in Guokun.

453
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,180
You've made up your mind?

454
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,380
After you get married,

455
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,330
you'll have your maiden family to support you.

456
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,940
Why did you

457
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,340
suddenly

458
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,300
make such a big change?

459
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,700
I just feel like

460
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,380
our parents are getting old.

461
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,460
They also suffered quite a lot

462
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,750
in this battle.

463
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,620
Goodbye.

464
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,940
Bye.

465
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,020
Brother.

466
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,370
I'm very lucky

467
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,580
to be your family forever.

468
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,090
This kind of luck

469
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,580
was destined

470
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,140
since the first time I saw you when I was little.

471
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,340
Sister-in-law, I've made the reservation

472
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,500
for your wedding photos.

473
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,760
I've also picked some wedding dresses for you.

474
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,490
Take a look.

475
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,400
Here are three wedding dresses

476
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,550
and two gowns.

477
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,900
This...

478
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,080
This is too much, isn't it?

479
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,720
Not at all.

480
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,980
I even wanted to book

481
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,460
an entire set for you.

482
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,110
I like everything you picked.

483
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,550
These will do.

484
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,630
By the way, Sister-in-law,

485
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,460
how many relatives and friends will there be from your side?

486
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,130
I'm doing the head count for the banquet.

487
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,850
Not many.

488
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,980
Just a few.

489
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,520
It's okay.

490
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,620
There'll be a lot of people from our family.

491
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,450
We'll fill in the seats for you.

492
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,330
Okay.

493
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,840
How do I look?

494
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,350
Sister-in-law,

495
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,020
you are so beautiful.

496
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,740
Really?

497
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,870
Brother, you're back.

498
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,670
Look. Is your wife pretty?

499
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,820
I'll hand this

500
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,740
over to you.

501
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,770
I'm leaving.

502
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,980
You've grown up.

503
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,710
You're back.

504
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,820
Is this from your brother?

505
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,310
So beautiful.

506
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,100
Really?

507
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,500
You came at the right time.

508
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,940
Just now,

509
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,740
she asked me a bunch of multiple-choice questions,

510
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,670
but you weren't here.

511
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,850
Now you're here.

512
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,610
What were the questions?

513
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,310
Ask me again.

514
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,140
It's nothing, actually.

515
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,200

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,400
Do you want to

520
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,780
have our wedding held in a hotel?

521
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,670
I know.

522
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,940
You won't be familiar with

523
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,850
or even know the people present.

524
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,830
You have to keep smiling.

525
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,950
It's not fun, right?

526
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,100
How about we don't do it?

527
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,060
Let's make it simple.

528
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,480
I don't agree.

529
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,480
We still need to have a sense of ritual.

530
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,030
Come here.

531
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,630

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,860
find a sunny day

533
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,920
and hold our wedding

534
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,040
under the flag pole of our fire station.

535
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,930

a few dozen chairs placed in line.

537
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120

Dongdong, Xi, Nan, and Bei to come.

539
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,360

I won't charge you.

762
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,850
Come on up.

763
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,480
Thank you.

764
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,300
Gosh, I feel so sorry for them.

765
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,870
Someone is trapped on the highway.

766
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,880
The trees have blocked the road.

767
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,010
Many people are trapped.

768
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,510
Please stop, Sir.

769
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,650
Please stop, Sir.

770
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,310
He stopped.

771
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,660
Where are you going in such a heavy rain?

772
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,900
My wife is not feeling well.

773
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,850
She needs to go to the hospital.

774
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,990
Get in. I'll take you there.

775
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,090
Okay, thank you.

776
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,620
Come on in.

777
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,410
Come on. Get in.

778
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,110
-Okay, thank you./N-Let's go.

779
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,350
Thank you so much.

780
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,870
Did you fall, Miss?

781
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,950
I'm okay, uncle.

782
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,420
Thank you.

783
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,810
Your umbrella is broken.

784
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,830
I have a raincoat in my car. I'll get it for you.

785
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,730
Put it on.

786
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,070
Thank you, uncle.

787
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,500
Put it on.

788
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,560
Thank you, uncle.

789
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,230
You're welcome.

790
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,230
Go home now.

791
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,310
Be careful.

792
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,430
Go that way.

793
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,550
The manhole cover is lost.

794
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,560
Go that way!

795
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,330
What's wrong with you?

796
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,550
The manhole cover ahead is lost.

797
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,050
Drive a little to the right.

798
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,660
Have you been standing here all along?

799
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,640
I just called the municipal government.

800
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,010
They are stuck in traffic.

801
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,920
I'll stay a little longer. It's too dangerous.

802
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,210
Thank you.

803
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,570
Be safe, too.
