They say what they do is for our own good.

Of course I remember, Mom.

581
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,490
So I...

582
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,180
I've been restraining myself.

583
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,690
I've been suffering.

584
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,710
I just don't want to make you sad.

585
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,600
Qin,

586
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,260
I demand nothing of you.

587
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,530
I just hope

588
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,630
you can be a good girl.

589
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,750
All right. Everyone.

590
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,040
Eyes right.

591
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,520
Eyes front.

592
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,480
At ease.

593
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,730
This time,

594
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,090
in the newcomer assessment,

595
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,670
we must

596
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,710
get a good grade.

597
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,580
The chief said

598
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,040
if you can't get a good grade,

599
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,440
you'll have to pack up your things and leave

600
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,270
after you come back.

601
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,520
Are you confident?

602
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,650
Yes.

603
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,930
Can you disgrace Shilitai Fire Station?

604
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,110
Yes.

605
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,720
Yes?

606
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,260
No.

607
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,090
Louder.

608
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,150
No.

609
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,870
Let's go.

610
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:26,000
[Rescue]

611
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,940
[China Fire and Rescue]

612
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,030
[Entrance Control]

613
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,070
[China Fire and Rescue]

614
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,190
I got the highest score

615
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,020
even though I limped through the assessment.

616
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,750
Tell me,

617
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,540
how should we celebrate?

618
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,160
Yeah.

619
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,100
Let's celebrate.

620
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,560
But it's your treat, okay?

621
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,320
You were so weak.

622
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,850
Our treat?

623
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,650
You won first place, and you want us to treat you?

624
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,470
Are you out of your mind?

625
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,420
Slow down.

626
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,810
Slowly.

627
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,430
This way.

628
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,100
Slow down.

629
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,020
Here. Look carefully.

630
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,860
Hurry up.

631
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,580
Slowly.

632
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,060
Okay.

633
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,880
Yes.

634
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,470
What do you say, Dapeng?

635
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,030
What do you mean?

636
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,500
If you don't treat us...

637
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,440
You can't touch them.

638
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,790
Don't take them.

639
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,900
They are all my treasures.

640
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,870
Take care of yourself.

641
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,970
You are

642
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,340
taking this opportunity to rob me.

643
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,010
Do you know

644
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,080
how expensive they are?

645
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,900
They are all my treasures.

646
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,409
You took them all.

647
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,600
You've gone too far!

648
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,389
What's wrong?

649
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,980
Su...

650
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,080
Hello, Supervisor.

651
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,400
Supervisor.

652
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,960
They only left me this empty box.

653
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,230
They took all of them.

654
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,870
Dapeng, how's your foot?

655
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,300
I applied medicine on my foot.

656
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,300
It's much better.

657
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,929
Slow down.

658
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,139
Supervisor.

659
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,679
Today,

660
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,260
we didn't disgrace the chief, right?

661
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,520
Of course not.

662
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,510
You did very well.

663
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,949
I guess he is gloating

664
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,780
in secret.

665
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,880
Well,

666
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,389
can you take this opportunity

667
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,219
to ask the chief to let us take part in

668
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,020
fire rescue operations as soon as possible?

669
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,250
Yes.

670
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,750
Yes, Supervisor.

671
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,540
No way.

672
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,330
We have to follow

673
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,080
the rules.

674
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,630
You've been waiting for so long. Just wait a little longer.

675
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,889
There's no need to rush.

676
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,900
The rules are unreasonable.

677
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,380
Right.

678
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,850
We are strong now.

679
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,260
Then tell him yourself.

680
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,550
Forget it.

681
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,870
I'm afraid of being scolded.

682
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,940
Is he that scary?

683
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,430
Yes.

684
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,600
Song Yan.

685
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,700
It's not negotiable.

686
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,040
I think

687
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,340
these new members

688
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,660
really did well in the assessment.

689
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,000
You can entrust some fire rescue missions

690
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,510
to them.

691
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,500
And this can accelerate

692
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,060
the replacement of old firefighters in our station.

693
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,520
A fire scene is not an amusement park.

694
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,790
Passing the assessment

695
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,860
merely means their skills have reached the standard.

696
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,450
Quick reactions.

697
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,820
A strong mind.

698
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,070
Willpower.

699
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
They still need to practice.

700
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,460
That's why they need real missions

701
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,490
to help them improve more quickly.

702
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,210
They can ask me for a chance

703
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,990
only after they learn

704
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,330
the meaning of sacrifice.

705
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,270
Sometimes, sacrifice

706
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,780
can be avoided.

707
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,170
With technologies nowadays,

708
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,360
their safety

709
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,900
can be much better protected.

710
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,280
In the fire in the high-rise apartment in Dongjiang,

711
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,100
two firefighters lost their lives.

712
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,720
In the explosion that happened in the chemical factory in Ning Province,

713
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,350
four firefighters lost their lives.

714
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,880
In the mountain fire in Shannan on June 25,

715
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,520
17 firefighters lost their lives.

716
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,930
Their average age was less than 22.

717
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,150
Sacrifice is not a tradition,

718
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,210
but it is the reality

719
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,570
this team has to face.

720
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,750
I actually don't understand.

721
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,460
With your family background,

722
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,510
you can gild yourself anywhere.

723
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,500
Why did you come here?

724
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,540
What do you mean?

725
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,130
You think I'm here to gild myself?

726
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,090
What's wrong with my family background?

727
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,200
Chief Song,

728
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,140
this is reverse discrimination.

729
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,850
Can't it be that I love this job,

730
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,650
like this job,

731
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,310
and want to do something

732
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,420
for this job?

733
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,880
Yes, I know.

734
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,220
It's hard for you to accept me emotionally.

735
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,300
I'm here to replace Supervisor Suo.

736
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,270
About many things,

737
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,120
I can't empathize with you

738
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,390
and share a tacit understanding with you

739
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,430
like him.

740
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,240
But time can change it.

741
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,500
I just want you to know

742
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,310
one thing.

743
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,410
I am

744
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,960
not here to idle away my time.

745
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,270
[Student Apartment]

746
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,690
You still dare to sell cosmetics?

747
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,420
These are cheap brands.

748
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,440
They are genuine.

749
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,090
I was fined so much.

750
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,110
I need to make some money.

751
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,120
By the way,

752
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,080
do you have any ways

753
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,190
to make money quickly?

754
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,640
I really want to make money now.

755
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,290
When I find the way to make money,

756
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,400
let's do it together.

757
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,810
Thank you.

758
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,150
Do you need money badly?

759
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,280
We're going to graduate.

760
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,530
I'm very anxious.

761
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,320
And our major

762
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,420
is not popular.

763
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,040
I won't be able to make a high salary.

764
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,810
I'm not like you.

765
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,910
You are locals.

766
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,160
If I want to stay here after graduation,

767
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,290
I probably can't even afford the rent.

768
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,270
Then find a rich boyfriend.

769
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,570
Do you know?

770
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,720
Wu Qingqing from the next dorm

771
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,540
found

772
