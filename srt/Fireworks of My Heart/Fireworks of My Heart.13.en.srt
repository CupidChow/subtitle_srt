Meng Yanchen.

390
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,580
You can't even see

391
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,860
who you really are.

392
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,460
You are so hypocritical.

393
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,850
A man who can't control himself

394
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,340
would control

395
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,570
others' lives.

396
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,870
[Emergency]

397
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,570
OK.

398
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,580
Happy birthday.

399
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,980
Happy birthday.

400
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,700
Help us share it.

401
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,310
OK.

402
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,090
In an instant,

403
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,360
they grew up.

404
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,500
Exactly.

405
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,520
A child's birthday

406
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,800
is a mother's suffering day.

407
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,910
Yanchen.

408
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,600
Your mother suffered a lot

409
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,780
from giving birth to you.

410
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,460
She spent seven hours

411
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,020
in the hospital,

412
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,460
but she still couldn't give birth to you.

413
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,460
Your father also said that

414
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,760
this child

415
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,520
would be

416
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,280
a big worry for me

417
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,720
and make me sad.

418
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,390
But your dad was wrong.

419
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,260
I was wrong.

420
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,860
Our Yanchen

421
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,500
is the best child for us.

422
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,850
He's never made us sad,

423
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,650
and never let us down.

424
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,300
It's all because of you.

425
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,360
You're a good mother.

426
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,200
You've raised him very well.

427
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,840
It's all because of you, Mom.

428
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,060
Thank you, Mom.

429
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,340
Thank you, Mom.

430
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,590
Let's start.

431
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,220
Start. Come on.

432
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,680
Come on.

433
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,440
Cheers.

434
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,530
Happy birthday!

435
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,360
Morpho Cypris

436
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,490
is also known as Morpho Diamond.

437
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,910
They are only found

438
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,800
in the primitive rainforests

439
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,310
of Colombia and Panama.

440
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,770
I'm glad you like it.

441
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,870
Brother.

442
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,530
Happy birthday to you.

443
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,140
Do you know why these specimens

444
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,970
are so beautiful?

445
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,520
To maintain the perfect color,

446
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,220
their bodies need to be drained

447
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,750
little by little

448
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,570
while they are still alive,

449
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,400
without letting them die.

450
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,500
So it's important

451
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,730
to get them in shape

452
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,520
at the moment when their desire to live is at its peak.

453
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,910
It's too cruel.

454
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,360
Sometimes,

455
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,680
I think we are very similar to them.

456
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,080
We've been disciplined

457
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,430
by Mom little by little.

458
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,650
We're not allowed to have our own ideas,

459
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,170
nor to have a strong personality.

460
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,950
We can't make any mistakes.

461
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,900
We must grow up

462
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,420
according to Mom's rules.

463
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,900
We must be perfect.

464
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,370
It's the only way

465
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,190
to impress

466
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
others.

467
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,800
I think it's ridiculous.

468
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,860
But I can't resist.

469
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,230
Because she's my mother.

470
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,680
Sometimes,

471
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,060
I think it's unfair for you

472
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,150
to be in this family.

473
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,420
But sometimes

474
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,970
I'm also very selfish,

475
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,910
thinking that with you around,

476
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,270
I'm not alone anymore,

477
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,020
so I won't be so scared.

478
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,010
Today is your birthday.

479
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,120
Cheer up.

480
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
Also,

481
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,860
let's stop arguing,

482
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,680
OK?

483
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,850
I'm not arguing with you.

484
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm just reminding you.

485
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,310
About what?

486
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,810
Don't go find Song Yan anymore.

487
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,220
I told you

488
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,140
it's impossible between you two.

489
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,960
I also told you

490
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,340
to stay out of my business.

491
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,450
Qin.

492
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,850
Are you still a little girl

493
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,480
living in your dream?

494
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,360
Our parents will never agree.

495
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,410
If you want to be with him,

496
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,050
you have to give up everything.

497
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,200
Who does he think he is?

498
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,910
Why should he let you

499
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,850
do this for him?

500
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,440
This is my choice.

501
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,640
What are you going to do?

502
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,980
What do you want me to do now?

503
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,610
Do you want me to watch you

504
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,120
begging our parents for him?

505
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,260
Or do you want me

506
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,010
to watch you

507
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,920
break up with our parents for him?

508
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,580
By that time,

509
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,890
should I speak for you

510
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,690
or not?

511
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,540
Qin.

512
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,660
Are you really giving up our parents,

513
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,750
this family,

514
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,230
and me

515
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,620
because of him?

516
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,180
Why do I have to

517
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
break up with this family

518
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,180
if I want to be with Song Yan?

519
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,530
Mom didn't like him before

520
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,590
because his family was not good

521
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,590
and he didn't have any prospects.

522
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,100
But now he's really excellent.

523
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,280
He's the chief of the fire station.

524
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,670
He saved a lot of people.

525
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,140
Maybe there were some conflicts

526
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,020
and misunderstandings in the past.

527
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,940
But now,

528
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,660
we can communicate.

529
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,300
I will find a way

530
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,340
to persuade our parents little by little.

531
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,340
This is just

532
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,380
your wishful thinking.

533
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,940
They won't agree,

534
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,980
neither will I.

535
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,250
You can be with whoever you like,

536
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,730
but not with him.

537
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,820
Why?

538
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,860
If you can break up with this family

539
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,380
because of him,

540
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,570
why are we...

541
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,500
Meng Yanchen!

542
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,990
Are you crazy?

543
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,000
I won't abandon this family.

544
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,560
You'll always be my brother.

545
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,580
How dare you bring it home?

546
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,110
If Mom finds out, you'll be dead.

547
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,340
You said

548
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,660
you wanted to eat this even in your dreams.

549
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,340
It smells strong.

550
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,660
Mom will smell it.

551
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,720
Here.

552
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,390
If you die,

553
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,340
don't drag me into this.

554
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,400
It's none of my business.

555
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,470
If I die,

556
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,860
no one

557
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,740
will bring you delicious food.

558
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,940
No one will play with you.

559
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,580
Why are you eating so fast?

560
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,440
Take your time.

561
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,880
I have to eat fast.

562
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,430
If Mom finds out,

563
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,540
she'll kill you.

564
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,900
Here.

565
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,510
Here.

566
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,140
Delicious.

567
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:40,930
Wipe your mouth.

568
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,340
It's delicious. Do you want some?

569
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,190
No.

570
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,600
Meng Qin?

571
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,900
Yes.

572
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,010
We should have changed it long ago.

573
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,940
You're already

574
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,140
the daughter of the Meng family.

575
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,840
How could you still be surnamed Xu?

576
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,180
But...

577
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,880
What?

578
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,420
Mom.

579
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,690
Well,

580
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,540
we should respect her.

581
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,220
Qin.

582
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,670
What do you mean?

583
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,810
All this time,

584
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,740
you didn't think of me

585
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
as your mother?

586
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,180
No. Mom.

587
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,020
I...

588
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,290
I just want to keep my original surname.

589
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,450
Then...

590
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,570
Are you not satisfied

591
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,050
with your Dad?

592
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,730
No.

593
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,660
Dad is also nice to me.

594
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,070
Then why is it

595
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,410
that you're so reluctant

596
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,890
to be part of our family

597
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,140
and take the same surname?

598
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,340
Mom.

599
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,790
We are a family.

600
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,580
This surname...

601
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,640
I didn't ask you.

602
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,870
Enough.

603
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,180
Qin doesn't want to change it.

604
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,700
Don't force her.

605
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,700
It doesn't really matter

606
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,620
if her surname is Meng or not.

607
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,960
Isn't she my daughter

608
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,220
if her surname is not Meng?

609
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,020
Of course it matters.

610
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,530
We must change it.

611
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,530
Our daughter's surname is Xu.

612
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,680
If this gets out,

613
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,030
what will others say?

614
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,500
They might think

615
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,380
we found a daughter-in-law.

616
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,400
Wenying, about this...

617
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,300
Dad.

618
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,510
I'll take your surname.

619
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,830
This is my home.

620
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,570
I treat you as my family.

621
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,020
OK.

622
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,820
That's good.

623
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,100
Well,

624
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,570
let's eat.

625
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:07,680
Mom.

626
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,980
Why do you

627
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,460
have to change Qin's surname?

628
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
This is the only thing

629
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,560
her biological parents left her.

630
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
This is...

631
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,820
the real reason you don't want her

632
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,010
to change her surname?

633
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,850
Think carefully.

634
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,510
If she wants to stay here,

635
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,820
she must be called Meng Qin.

636
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,030
She can only be your sister.

637
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,010
If

638
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,310
you don't want her,

639
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,080
Fine.

640
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,200
I can only send her

641
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,910
to study abroad.

642
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,130
It's up to you

643
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,560
to decide.

644
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,980
Why are you here now?

645
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,460
Aren't you celebrating your birthday at home?

646
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,140
I was about to go there.

647
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,380
I saw your car at the door.

648
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,570
Happy.

649
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,050
Does this word

650
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,100
have anything to do with you?

651
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,380
What happened?

652
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,180
Pour some wine.

653
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,690
Bottoms up.

654
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,890
No wine.

655
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,940
Waitress, add more wine.

656
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,860
How old are you,

657
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,140
little girl?

658
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,700
Don't go.

659
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,300
Why did you touch me?

660
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,040
I didn't.

661
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,220
You walked

662
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,970
past me

663
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,550
and touched my hand.

664
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,880
I'm not a fool.

665
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,060
You did it on purpose.

666
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:42,850
Why don't you

667
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,170
just look at yourself?

668
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,260
Even if you're free, I'm not interested.

669
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,700
Who touched you?

670
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,620
You are

671
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,340
so shameless.

672
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,660
Who are you calling shameless?

673
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,050
You are the most shameless one.

674
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,070
Understand?

675
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,690
Will a decent girl

676
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,120
work in a bar?

677
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,590
Watch your mouth.

678
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,000
What's wrong with working in a bar?

679
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,630
She earns money fair and square.

680
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,530
We despise men like you,

681
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,060
who are uneducated

682
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,500
and have no manners.

683
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,400
What did you just say?

684
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,540
Let go!

685
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,190
What are you doing?

686
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
Do you know how expensive this bottle is?

687
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,070
It's a waste to hit him.

688
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,960
Apologize to me.

689
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,200
Apologize!

690
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,700
Don't move!

691
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,570
Don't move!

692
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,470
Don't move!

693
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,230
Stop!

694
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:38,890
What are you doing?

695
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,830
Call the police?

696
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,930
Come on.

697
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,180
Do I have to call the police?

698
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,680
Let me tell you.

699
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,220
The security cameras in my bar have caught it all.

700
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,920
You caused trouble in my bar

701
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,780
and sexually harassed my female employee.

702
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,540
Let's see what you have to say

703
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,370
when the police come.

704
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,740
I'm sick of you guys going crazy

705
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,220
when you've had a few drinks.

706
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,290
A group of men bullied women.

707
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,690
Shame on you!

708
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,680
What are you waiting for?

709
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,670
Get lost!

710
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,300
Get lost!

711
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,780
Get lost!

712
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,620
You are not welcome here.

713
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,100
Get out!

714
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,940
Get out!

715
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,620
Just wait and see.

716
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,690
Are you two all right?

717
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,260
That's good.

718
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,239
You can get off work today.

719
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,340
Go back and rest early.

720
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,370
Thank you, Boss.

721
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,929
Sorry, everyone.

722
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,350
Sorry to bother you.

723
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,110
Today,

724
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,550
all drinks are free.

725
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,020
Good for you.

726
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,010
When did you learn to fight?

727
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,489
Are you OK?

728
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,480
So many part-time jobs.

729
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,380
Don't you have classes?

730
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,740
We don't really have many major classes

731
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,010
in our senior year.

732
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,370
Are you short of money?

733
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,430
Sort of.

734
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,000
You're not suitable to work in a bar.

735
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,760
I do know a job

736
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,110
that pays more than

737
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,210
what you're doing now.

738
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,320
I won't do anything

739
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,030
against my values,

740
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,500
even if

741
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,720
I can earn a lot of money.

742
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,410
Do you think I'm gonna let you

743
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,030
do some weird work?

744
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,310
I...

745
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,090
You said that there's a job that pays more.

746
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:57,850
I...

747
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm sorry.

748
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,380
Go.

749
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:14,660
Go.

[Locker Room]

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,540
There was a fire on Anhua Road.

752
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,860
Dispatch one major urban fire truck,

753
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,230
two water tank trucks,

754
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,380
and one rescue truck.

at the west entrance of Anhua Road.

762
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,340
Got it.

763
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,380
We still need two minutes

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,180

Attention! All trucks!

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,740
I called the fire police.

776
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,860
Is there anyone trapped in there?

777
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,660
No.

778
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,520
This area will be demolished.

779
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,210
The residents

780
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,090
moved out last month.

781
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,390
Are you sure there's no one inside?

782
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,210
The water and electricity are all cut off.

783
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,080
It's impossible to live here.

784
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,380
There are no wild cats or dogs.

785
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,980
OK. Please register over there.

786
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,520
Come.

787
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,680
Jiang Yi.

788
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,140
Yes.

789
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,210
Take a team to the west.

790
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,790
Yes.

791
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,350
Yang Chi.

792
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:53,620
Yes.

793
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,740
Set up a water gun position.

794
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,100
Yes.

795
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,940
Junping.

796
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,090
The man reported that

797
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,360
there's no one trapped inside.

798
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,150
Observe carefully.

799
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,850
Yes.

800
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,660
Two water guns.

801
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,330
Hurry!

802
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,830
Control the fire on this side

803
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,170
to prevent it from spreading.

804
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,800
Yes.

805
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,700
Water.

806
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,040
Water!

807
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,900
Yes!

808
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,600
Don't let the flames spread.

809
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,490
Yes.

810
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,470
Put out the open fire.

811
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,440
Yes.

812
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,900
Chief.

813
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,690
The fire wires around have been cleared.

814
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,770
These are abandoned houses

815
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,870
that will be demolished.

816
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,150
Get ready.

817
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,230
Follow me to search around.

818
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:08,980
Search what?

819
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,610
The man

820
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,300
who called us said

821
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,460
the people inside had moved out.

822
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,490
The residents moved out.

823
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,560
The city village is well located.

824
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,800
In the west,

825
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,930
there's a food street.

826
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,270
There is a vegetable market in the east.

827
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,490
We can't rule out the possibility

828
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,820
that there are homeless elderly people living inside.

829
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,550
OK.

830
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,720
Look at this.

831
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,380
Instructor.

832
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,380
This is good.

833
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,230
Wait. Step back.

834
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,210
Stop.

835
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,340
Zoom in.

836
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,740
These are

837
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,740
all untreated wastes.

838
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,500
These bottles look like

839
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,340
they could be sold for money.

840
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,360
There might be someone inside.

841
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,300
What's going on?

842
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,220
Maybe it's too hot

843
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,980
to work.

844
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,470
Yang Chi.

845
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:00,970
Yes.

846
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,030
Take the thermal camera.

847
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,540
Let's go.

848
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:02,980
OK.

849
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,940
Chief.

850
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,300
The water hose is not long enough.

851
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,180
Lengthen the water hose.

852
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,900
Yes.

853
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,020
Go on.

854
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,360
Jiang Yi.

855
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,180
Yes.

856
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,340
Instructor.

857
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,600
Take some men to support Chief.

858
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,060
Yes.

859
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,420
Come here, Liu Kai.

860
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:09,870
Yes.

861
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,860
Zhan Dapeng.

862
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,580
Yes.

863
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,380
Come over here.

864
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,880
Follow me inside.

865
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,140
Yes.

866
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,040
Thank you, Yi.

867
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,870
Be serious.

868
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,080
Listen to me when you go inside.

869
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,950
Check your equipment.

870
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,340
Yes.

871
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,420
Hurry.

872
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,780
Be careful.

873
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,500
OK.

874
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,050
Dapeng.

875
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,190
Follow me closely.

876
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,250
I'll leave the back to you.
