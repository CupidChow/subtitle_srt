00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,890
I've gone on thousands of missions.

197
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,100
I've encountered such difficult situations

198
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
many times.

199
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,860
But this time it's different.

200
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,140
You've been a firefighter for eight years

201
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,410
and saved thousands of people.

202
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,170
What's different this time?

203
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,740
My mom was also in the disaster area.

204
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,210
My dad passed away early.

205
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,570
My mother brought me up alone.

206
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,710
She had a hard time in her early years.

207
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,580
I have yet to have the time

208
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,690
to be filial to her.

209
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:06,890
I don't even dare to think about

210
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,090
the possibility of my mom

211
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,090
being in the earthquake.

212
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,890
If she were to pass away,

213
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,600
what would become of me?

214
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,890
I have saved so many people.

215
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,690
But when my mother

216
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,990
was in danger,

217
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,740
I couldn't show up in time

218
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,880
in front of her

219
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,250
to help her.

220
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,450
When I can't even

221
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,570
protect my own family,

222
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,020
what right do I have

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,280
to protect the people of our nation

224
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,800
and the society?

225
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm not

226
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,930
a qualified son.

227
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,570
I've also not lived up to

228
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,380
this badge on my chest.

229
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,440
Filial piety

230
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,200
is our foundation.

231
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,650
Speaking of family,

232
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,890
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

233
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,740
I think

234
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,700
you have too much on your mind.

235
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,420
On our shoulders,

236
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,100
the people

237
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,340
and our families,

238
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,070
we have to bear them all.

239
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,310
Right?

240
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,100
I understand the logic.

241
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,210
Supervisor.

242
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,850
Don’t worry.

243
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,710
I will

244
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,340
work hard to adjust my condition.

245
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,220
But deep down,

246
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,170
my original intention toward firefighting

247
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,460
has never once changed.

248
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,290
This is what I'm most proud of.

249
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,440
During this earthquake disaster relief,

250
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,220
it was the first time for many new members in our team

251
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,250
to participate in

252
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,370
such a big task.

253
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,610
You should go take care of them.

254
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,930
I'm a veteran. I'm fine.

255
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,610
Don't worry about others first.

256
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,610
Take good care of yourself first.

257
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Let's...

258
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,460
play two rounds.

259
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,810
One-on-one.

260
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,830
Full court.

261
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,810
Come on.

262
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,280
I'll attack first.

No.

290
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,730
I just called you here

291
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,490
to see you,

292
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,970
so I don't forget what you look like.

293
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,850
You're right.

294
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,810
You have a bad memory.

295
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,590
Take a good look.

296
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,390
Do you remember it now?

297
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,650
I've seen enough.

298
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,100
Have you?

299
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,500
Okay.

300
00:14:59,250 --> 00:14:59,960
Then I'll get going.

301
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,610
Yes, I missed you.

302
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
That's right.

303
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,540
If you miss me,

304
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,040
you should just say so.

Yes.

If you're in an emergency

310

where you're trapped in the car,

311
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,240
smash the glass with this.

312
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,900
Remember.

313

Don't hit the middle.

315

The glass

316
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,710
in the middle won't break easily.

317
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,050
Got it?

318
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,690
Yes.

00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,630

324
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,450

Look.

326
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,210
There's a button here.

327
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,170
Twist it a little

328
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,790
and pull it out.

329
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,170
Finally,

330
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,010
when you need to use it,

331
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,930
just press it

332
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:15,840
and you're set.

333
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,410

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,320

Where should I put this?

342
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,130
I'll take this back.

343
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,950
It's useless now.

344
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,460
Put this new one in the car.

345

[Lanxuan]

346
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,430
Here.

Whether it's those

348
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,030
who died in the disaster

349
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,359
or our comrades

350
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,250
who got injured,

351
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,569
none of those are your responsibility.

352
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,930
In this world,

353
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,680
there are many uncertainties.

Disasters

355
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,099
are also one of them.

356

Next,

357
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,490
I'm going to

358
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,490
play some videos for you.

359
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,150
There are

360
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,930
the records of this Wangxiang earthquake relief

361
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,200
and other

362
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,550
disaster relief information.

363
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,550
Like I said in the beginning,

364
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,720
trauma

365
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,480
is a very painful

366
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,630
and scary experience.

367
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,480
People always

368
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,890
involuntarily try to avoid it.

369
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,810
But running away won't solve the problem.

370
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,940
These

371
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,120
will help us understand

372
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,700
and accept that trauma and anxiety

373
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,750
are not dangerous.

374
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,010
We can overcome these memories,

375
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,300
instead of letting them

376
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,900
defeat you.

377
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,920
Ms. Li is right.

378
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,130
Yes.

379
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,410
Let's watch it together.

380
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you afraid of?

381
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,100
Just watch it.

382
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,840
Right?

383
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,810
Come on, raise your heads.

384
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,310
Let me tell you two a story.

385
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,270
When I first became a firefighter,

386
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,510
my first fire scene

387
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,090
was much more exaggerated

388
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,960
than what you two encountered.

389
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,230
It scared me to death.

390
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,190
After going back to the fire brigade,

391
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
for three months...

392
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,260
I couldn't eat for three months.

393
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,450
Yes.

394
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,320
I know of that.

395
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,330
That won't do.

396
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,260
I won't describe it for you two.

397
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,090
Let's wait and see.

398
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,360
Then, do you know what my squad leader

399
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,290
taught me?

400
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,610
He said,

401
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,230
Yang Chi,

402
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,760
what are you afraid of?

403
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,060
You're a grown man, right?

404
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,140
Just look at whatever you're afraid of.

405
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,490
The more afraid you are, the more you should look at it,

406
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,380
until you're no longer afraid.

407
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,920
Don't think too much.

408
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,860
Right?

409
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,560
Well…

410
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,030
Ms. Li and Supervisor

411
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,890
are with us.

412
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,760
Let's watch. Come on.

413
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,840
Raise your heads.

414
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,080
Come on.

415
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,330
You're grown men, aren't you?

416
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,440
What's there to be afraid of?

417
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,020
Let's watch.

418
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,500
Let's watch it together.

419
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,820
There's nothing to be afraid of.

420
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,380
Watch it.

421
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,920
At this moment,

422
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,260
make sure you keep breathing.

423
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,400
Ge Zheng.

424
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,600
Breathe.

425
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,200
Breathe.

426
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,980
Breathe in slowly. Breath out slowly.

427
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,650
Keep your breathing steady.

428
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,420
Breathe in slowly.

429
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,110
Breathe out slowly.

430
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,530
Relax. Relax.

431
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,740
Thank you for today.

432
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,740
It's all thanks to you...

434
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,780
It's my duty.

435
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,080
For helping us with psychological counseling.

436
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,610
All right, go back.

437
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,410
No need to see me off.

438
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,450
Go back.

439
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,100
Li Meng.

440
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,360
This is for you.

441
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,920
What era is it now?

442
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,740
You wrote me a card?

443
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,050
So old-fashioned.

444
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,840
The new year is about to start.

445
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,600
Life should have a sense of ritual.

446
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,460
Okay, thanks.

447
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,700
Go back.

450
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,490
Jiang Yu.

451
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,800
It's nothing.

452
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,790
[Make sure to stay warm!
Drink more warm water!
Be as happy as a lark!!!]

453
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,520
Thank you for this.

454
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,950
Go back.

[Lanxuan]

458
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,130
Give it to me.

459
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,100
By the way,

460
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,250
how was your meeting with Li Meng?

461
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,240
Why do you care about my work?

462
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,810
Nothing.

463
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,640
It just feels like

464
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,570
you two are very close,

465
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,520
so I'm just showing some concern.

466
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,130
Are you jealous?

467
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,800
No.

468
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,570
Are you tired from work?

469
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,840
Have you thought about me today?

470
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,990
Didn't you tell me you were busy

471
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,390
and to wait to hear from you?

472
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:17,970
Song Yan.

473
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,500
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

474
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,810
Did what on purpose?

475
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,920
[Use the elevator civilly, let passengers out before you get in]

476
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,990
Are you trying to play hard to get?

477
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,620
I just didn't want to disturb your work.

478
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,430
Look.

479
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,680
I came as soon as you texted me.

480
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:37,600
[Use the elevator civilly, let passengers out before you get in]

481
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,670
Right?

482
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,310
I forgot.

483
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,270
I almost forgot again.

484
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,550
I have many medical cases

485
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,690
to look through tonight.

486
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,980
I may be very busy.

487
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,640
Okay.

488
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,200
I

489
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,510
won't disturb your work.

490
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,850
Rest early.

491
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,520
Okay.

492
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,850
All right.

493
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,980
I'll stop teasing you.

494
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,860
I just want to see

495
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,040
how long you'd hold it in before

496
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,110
you'd be direct with me.

497
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,100
You've changed over these years.

498
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,950
You've learned to keep things in.

499
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,540
You used to be a bully.

500
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,100
At night,

501
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,690
do you really have to study the medical cases?

502
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,960
Of course.

503
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,340
You're still up?

504
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,600
You're breathing on my ear.

505
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,700
It's ticklish.

506
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:14,940
Actually,

507
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,220
you wanted to throw a tantrum, right?

508
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,490
You wanted to blame me for not looking for you,

509
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,410
for not texting you,

510
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,100
and not coaxing you.

511
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,720
But you're afraid I'll find you pretentious

512
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,710
and bad-tempered.

513
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,620
Don't do this again.

514
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,420
Soon, we're going to get married

515
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,620
and live together forever.

516
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
In front of me,

517
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,590
you should never have any worries.

518
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,390
Sometimes,

519
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
I really envy those

520
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,090
girls with expressive eyes.

521
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,230
I want those eyes too.

522
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,470
Why?

523
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,690
Because even if

524
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,050
I don't speak up about some things,

525
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,260
my eyes can

526
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,210
convey my happiness

527
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,910
or sadness.

528
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,230
You don't need those eyes.

529
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,570
I can understand you.

530
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,420
The cereal is gone.

531
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,900
It's gone?

532
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,260
It was always here before.

533
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,620
Maybe

534
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,090
it hasn't been restocked yet.

535
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,830
Maybe.

536
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,720
I'll buy it next time then.

537
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,150
I'll come to you

538
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:16,880
after you get off work.

539
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,960
Okay.

540
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,110
What do you want for dinner?

541
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,170
Place your order.

542
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,770
Can you decide

543
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,640
and surprise me?

544
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,930
From now on, I'll surprise you every day.

545
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,000
What's wrong?

546
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,480
The scar on your shoulder

547
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,610
is strange.

548
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,210
Think about my job.

549
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,840
Isn't it normal for me to have a scar?

550
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,690
It looks like a bullet hole.

551
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,700
Your imagination is so rich.

552
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,900
I got this scar

553
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,650
from being scraped by glass.

554
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,100
Dr. Xu.

If you don't leave now,

556
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,410
I guarantee you'll be late.

557
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,680
Let's go.

558
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,250

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:52,980
Morning, Dr. Xu.

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:53,530
Morning.

Dr. Xu.

563
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,170
Morning.

564
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,290
Morning, Team Leader.

565
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,280
Dr. Xu, you used to

566
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,510
arrive a quarter of an hour early.

567
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,740
Why do you arrive later recently?

568
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,120
I've been waking up later recently.

569

Dr. Xu.

570
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,340
Have you been tired recently?

571
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
But why do I feel like

572
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,700
you look more radiant?

573
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,100
Your face is rosy.

You're glowing.

Dr. Xu.

Have you had breakfast?

577
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,630
I have some drinks here.

578

she never touched her phone.

typing on her phone

597
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,770

why hasn’t the Xinle Oatmeal

been restocked?

605
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,700
It will no longer be restocked.

I'm not.

706
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,530
I just hope she won't go down the wrong path.

710
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,830
with your idle mind all day long?

714
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,949

-Okay.

Okay.

750
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,180
Someone I knew before.

751
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,210
By the way,

his company seems to be nearby.

753
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:14,900

754
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,360
intruded into their turf.

755
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,540
Then,

756
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,150
should we go and say hello?

757
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,850
Yes.

758
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,390
Then I'll go say hello.

Wait for me here.

I'm sorry.

My friends and I

764
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,340
found this place to take photos.

765
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,910
I didn't expect it to be near your company.

766
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,120
So I thought

767
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,390
I should come and say hello.

768
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,270
No.

769
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,790
This terrace is semi-enclosed.

770
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,150
It's considered

771
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,530
the public area of this office building.

772
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,840
That's good then.

773
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,770
We were worried that we wouldn't be able to

774
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,750
publish the photos we took.

775
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,030
I thought we came here for nothing.

776
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,510
Publish what photos?

777
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,640
As Internet celebrities?

778
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,240
We plan to donate

779
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,190
our income from these stocks

780
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,860
to the Wangxiang disaster area.

781
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,240
Aren't you guys cold?

782
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,050
We brought thick clothes

783
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,200
in our luggage.

784
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,840
Excuse me.

785
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,240
Bring four cups of coffee

786
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,050
for this lady.

787
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,010
Okay.

788
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,190
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

789
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,830
Ye'zi.

790
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,960
I'll treat you to coffee.

791
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,960
My friend bought it just now.

792
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,190
Great. I'm so thirsty.

793
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,870
Miaomiao.

794
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,490
Thank you.

795
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,970
Ye'zi.

796
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,350
Your friend is a CEO, right?

797
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,820
He looks so young

798
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,010
and quite handsome.

799
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,240
How is he handsome?

800
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,980
He's just average.

801
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,240
He's really handsome.

802
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,870
Yeah.

803
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,540
Ye'zi.

804
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,800
How did you know each other?

805
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,580
Didn't I

806
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,860
work as a designated driver before?

807
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,410
Well...

808
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
Such good things actually happen?

809
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,090
Right.

810
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,710
Since he runs an investment company,

811
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,410
let him invest in your business.

812
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,180
How is that possible?

813
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,280
They invest in big projects.

814
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,600
It's almost time.

815
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,290
Let's hurry and take photos.

816
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,190
Or else, there might not be enough sunlight.

817
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,630
Let's go.

818

Mr. Meng.

Yancheng really did his father

855
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,320
proud.

856
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,710
He's getting more and more promising.

857
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,670
It's just child's play.

858
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
You're too modest.

859
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,850
Judging from the current situation,

860
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,060
Guokun will

861
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,420
be in his hands sooner or later.

862
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,230
Guokun will only be handed to

863
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,580
capable people.

864
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,250
Besides, Yancheng is currently

865
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,990
not very interested

866
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,310
in the group's matters.

867
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,650
He only cares about

868
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,710
his one acre and three quarters of land.

869
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,950
Even his mother couldn't

870
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,860
persuade him.

871
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,520
Let's

872
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,800
respect his wishes.

873
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,450
Really?

874
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,110
It's hard to say if he's interested.

875
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,340
What if he's

876
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,340
sandbagging?

[Erudite and discerning]

878
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,700
You really don't want to

879
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,780
be in charge of the group's matters?

880
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,980
Guokun's current professional manager

881
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,130
and executive management system

882
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,120
are already very perfect.

883
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,430
The thing is, most of them

884
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,680
were trained

885
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,140
by Dong Chengmin.

886
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,090
Once I retire and lose power...

887
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,820
Dad.

888
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,530
When you retire in the future,

889
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,330
you should enjoy the rest of your life.

890

Guokun's shares

891
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,010
will last you for the rest of your life.

892
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,950
Why do you care about this faux power?

893
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,500
Do you think his pension is insufficient for him

894
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,730
after retirement?

895
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,360
Isn't he afraid his power would

896
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,740
dwindle?

897
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,440
You haven't even joined the group,

898
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,310
yet he's already this afraid of you.

899
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,010
Dong Chengmin's opinion on me

900
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,090
is about to be

901
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,300
exposed to the public.
