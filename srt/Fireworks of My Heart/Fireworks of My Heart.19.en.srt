Come on.

6
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,860
Are these your cats?

7
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,220
These are stray cats.

8
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,540
They're very bold. They always come to visit us.

9
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,180
Yes.

10
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,380
Wait.

11
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,860
Why isn't it eating?

12
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,620
Usually when Lai Fu gets this,

13
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,580
it eats half of it.

14
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,540
It's called Lai Fu?

15
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,460
Yes.

16
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,700
Yi named it.

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,260
Lai Fu.

Supervisor, let me have a look.

21
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,180
Lai Fu.

22
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,620
What's wrong with you today?

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,500
Why aren't you eating?

Yi.

30
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,270
Dr. Xu is not a vet.

31
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,900
They're all doctors. It's the same thing.

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,440
Let me check it with her.

33
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,890
Are you frightened?

34
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,850
I don't think there's external injuries.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
Let me check if there's any weird smells.

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,540
Maybe something's wrong with its stomach.

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,820
Let's have a look.

38
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,690
Its mouth...

39
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,340
Its mouth is fine.

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,579
Let's see if there's anything wrong

41
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,420
with its little paws.

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,760
Smell it. Is anything wrong?

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,630
No.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,060
I think

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,060
it was frightened.

46
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,770
You've been studying it for a long time.

47
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,430
Have you found out what's wrong with it?

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,520
Chief.

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,570
Nothing serious.

50
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,740
I think it just needs to rest for a few days.

51
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,500
I think

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
you should adopt it.

53
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,500
Your house is big and spacious.

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
It's better for raising it.

55
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,660
Should you raise a cat just because your house is spacious?

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,540
It has the freedom to come and go freely now.

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,500
I think that's nice.

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,100
Aren't you lonely?

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,980
I don't want to be emotionally attached.

60
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,050
A cat's lifespan is shorter than a human's.

61
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,690
Mainly, it's because it's troublesome.

62

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,660
You're too negative.

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,780
Chief Song has the right to speak on this matter.

66
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,780
He raised Xiao Meng.

67
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,180
He has the greatest authority to speak

68
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,420

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,270
I'm going to send it away.

70

Why are you sending it away?

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,020
Do you have no emotional attachment

72

73
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,580
You're right.

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,300
You shouldn't have said that.

75
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,660
You misunderstood him.

76
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,220
He treats Xiao Meng well.

77
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,899
He even trains him.

Yes.

79
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,540

to send it to the search-and-rescue dog base

81
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,890
so that it can carry out missions with us in the future.

Yes.

83
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,820
It's just right, because we can

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,620

198
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,980
phrasing it so weirdly?

199
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,580
Are you praising me or scolding me?

200
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,710
I have an idea.

201
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,600
How much will it cost?

202
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,340
It'll cost nothing.

couldn't have made this dish of bitter gourd stuffed with meat.

Besides,

the way the soy sauce is drizzled on the bitter gourd,

247
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,500
this method,

248
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,620
is almost like how

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,500
my wife makes it.

250

I've been eating it like this for half of my life.

That was made by your dad indeed.

266
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,380
My dad made this?

267
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,020
It's true.

268
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,100
Your dad really did make it.

269

Your wife made this?

279
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,800

280
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,510

281
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,470
We haven't had homecooked food.

283
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,580

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,310
They cooked them

287
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,240

Yes.

291
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,010
but also recorded a video for you.

292
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,400

Your chief and supervisor

295
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,280
said your training is very tough.

296
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,810
They were afraid you’d be homesick,

297
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,400
so they asked me to cook some food from your hometown

298
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,470

to buy fresh ribs

303
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,010
and made them for you.

Your training is tough,

305
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,080
so you should eat more meat.

306

309
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,630
you were too skinny.

310
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,590
By the way,

311
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,130
you have to put on the face masks frequently.

312
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,690

00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,950
Slowly.

572
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,070
Be careful.

573
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,100
Be careful.

574
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,040
Be careful.

575
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,770
Get him out first.

576
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,690
Get him out first.

577
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,330
He's fine.

578
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,940
This way.

579
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,740
Are you okay?

580
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,550
I'm fine.

581
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,610
Come here.

582
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,210
Where should we put

583
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,230
your alpaca?

584
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,110
Help me bring it to that room.

585
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,150
Lulu, right?

586
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,710
Be good. Let's go back to our room.

587
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,340
That stinks.

588
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,540
Why are you even spitting saliva?

589
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,740
I've held it down.

590
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,360
Get it up.

591
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,180
Come on. One, two, three.

592
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,920
Are you okay?

593
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,180
I'm fine.

594
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,380
Goodness.

595
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,490
Chi.

596
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,500
He doesn't seem well.

597
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,100
Sir, how are you?

598
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,300
Dapeng.

599
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,730
Open the curtains.

600
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,610
Let him get some fresh air.

601
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,290
Dr. Xu.

602
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,300
Please come up quickly.

603
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,020
Quickly.

604
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,080
Roger. Let's go.

605
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,310
What's wrong?

606
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
My chest hurts.

607
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,430
My throat hurts too.

608
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,800
Does your shoulders hurt?

609
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,900
Yes.

610
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,080
Here. Does it hurt?

611
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,010
It hurts.

612
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,640
Does it hurt here?

613
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,590
It hurts here too.

614
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,150
Is it piercingly painful or suffocating?

615
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,590
It's piercingly painful.

616
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,590
Here, relax.

617
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,800
Relax.

618
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,350
What's his blood pressure?

619
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,820
147/85.

620
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,750
Measure this arm.

621
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,860
Do you have any underlying disease?

622
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,440
Diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease?

623
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,180
My blood pressure is a little high.

624
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,220
Do you take your medicine on time?

625
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,300
Yes.

626
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,450
Do you have allergies to any drugs,

627
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,530
or past medical history?

628
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,300
No allergies at all.

629
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,980
Relax your legs.

630
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,410
75/43.

631
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,020
The difference is huge.

632
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,700
Li Nan, contact the center.

633
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,030
Okay.

634
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,450
Send him

635
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,190
to do a CT scan.

636
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,240
Wait.

637
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,020
Wait, doctor.

638
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,300
W-What's wrong with me

639
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,500
that I have to do a CT scan?

640
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,780
You might have a dissection.

641
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,480
What do you mean?

642
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,700
An aortic dissection.

643
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,690
It's dangerous. Come on.

644
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't! Don't touch me.

645
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,150
I'm very healthy.

646
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,740
After a sleep,

647
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,780
I'll be fine soon.

648
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,890
It's just a checkup.

649
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,080
But I still don't want to go to the hospital.

650
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,780
It's my body.

651
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,660
I know my own health.

652
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,790
I don't want to spend the money for nothing.

653
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,940
Medical insurance can be reimbursed.

654
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,940
But I still don't want to go to the hospital.

655
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,430
Besides,

656
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,670
there are so many of you

657
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,460
at my house

658
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,340
and it's making me very uncomfortable.

659
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,050
I feel like I'm sick because of this situation.

660
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:38,980
Don't get agitated.

661
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm not agitated.

662
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,270
Get out now!

663
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,900
Go, go, go.

664
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,860
If it's really an aortic dissection,

665
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,460
it's very dangerous.

666
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,700
Go, go, go.

667
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,170
Get out of my house now.

668
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,330
Hurry up and go.

669
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,180
Why is he like that?

670
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Team Leader.

671
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,850
Are we going downstairs just like this?

672
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,710
But

673
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,310
he can't be cured like this.

674
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,050
Yes.

675
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,620
Mr. Wu.

676
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,890
Mr. Wu, please open the door.

677
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,660
Mr. Wu.

678
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,560
Yang Chi! Yang Chi!

679
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,710
Break the door inside open for me.

680
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,660
Dr. Xu, are you sure?

681
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,850
Without the owner's permission,

682
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,860
we will receive a complaint.

683
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,890
Then, the chief will be scolded again.

684
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,910
Are you questioning my medical skills?

685
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,860
No, I...

686
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,640
What's wrong?

687
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,050
Dr. Xu wants to break the door.

688
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,430
It's an emergency.

689
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,640
I want to break the door.

690
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,800
Wu Xuanyang.

691
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,190
Wu Xuanyang.

692
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,980
Feng Bei, establish vascular access.

693
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,370
Dongdong, prepare the oxygen bag.

694
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,150
Get the stretcher ready.

695
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,310
Yang Chi, stretcher.

696
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,220
The aortic dissection. Prepare for

697
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,820
an enhanced CT scan.

698
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,260
Yes.

699
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,480
Be gentle. Slowly.

700
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,330
Keep it steady.

701
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,190
Let's go.

702
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,760
Chief.

703
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,270
Do you trust Dr. Xu that much?

704
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,780
I'm used to receiving complaints.

705
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,770
I'm not afraid.

706
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,020
Stubborn.

707
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,980
Have you informed the Cardiac Surgery Department?

708
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,760
Yes.

709
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,400
Okay.

710
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,520
[Emergency Room]

711
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,220
How is it?

712
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,610
We've done

713
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,450
an enhanced CT scan.

714
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,090
and informed those at the Cardiac Surgical Department

715
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:34,860
to come for a consultation.

716
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,660
Where is Director Xu?

717
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,450
He's still in the Operating Room.

718
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,660
The surgery will be done in ten minutes.

719
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,780
His heart rate and blood pressure are too high.

720
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,350
Prepare the medicine

721
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:44,900
to reduce his heart rate

722
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,550
and blood pressure.

723
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,140
Okay.

724
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,110
Director.

725
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,380
This patient complained that he has

726
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,810
a sustained, piercing pain in his chest.

727
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,410
The blood pressure of his arms are not symmetrical either.

728
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,570
He's been having cold sweat.

729
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,830
After becoming unconscious,

730
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,040
his heart rate increased rapidly.

731
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,080
His blood pressure is also very high.

732
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,710
I suspect it's an aortic dissection.

733
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,390
We've done

734
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,390
an enhanced CT scan for him.

735
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,990
He's now in the emergency room.

736
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,780
We've informed the Cardiac Surgery Department for consultation.

737
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,810
Yes, it's this doctor.

738
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,740
Hello, Doctor.

739
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,490
Are you Director Xu?

740
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,120
Yes.

741
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,620
What happened?

742
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,830
My brother just called

743
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,030
119 for help.

744
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,260
Why did he suddenly faint

745
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:17,890
and why was he sent

746
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,950
to the hospital?

747
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,210
Don't worry.

748
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,700
The patient just finished his examination.

749
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,050
We need to wait

750
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,020
to find out what's going on.

751
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,750
Doctor.

752
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,720
We just don't understand.

753
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,630
Was the doctor sent by 119

754
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,030
from your hospital?

755
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,260
Is she reliable?

756
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,500
The joint rescue team was established

757
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,360
by our hospital and the fire department.

758
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
That's it. I'm sorry.

759
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,180
Saving lives is more important.

760
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,060
You must have sent

761
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,500

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,630
She's scolding you.

954
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,940
Do I need you to tell me that?

955
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,690
Retaliate.

956
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,770
Go away.

957
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,200
Hang in there.

958
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,670
[Thank you for the dog food. I'll feed it to Xiao Meng.]

959
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,230
[Thank you for the dog food. I'll feed it to Xiao Meng.]

960
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,230
[What dog food?]

961
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,180
[Thank you for the dog food. I'll feed it to Xiao Meng.]

962
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,180
[What dog food?]

963
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,460
[Thank you for the dog food. I'll feed it to Xiao Meng.]

964
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,460
[What dog food?]

965
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,460
[How dare you!]

966
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,710
[Thank you for the dog food. I'll feed it to Xiao Meng.]

967
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,710
[What dog food?]

968
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,710
[How dare you!]

969
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,230
It's not for you.

970
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,170
Qin.

971
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,220
Have you eaten?

972
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,570
Yes, I just ate.

973
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,950
Are you used to being at the fire station?

974
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,740
It's alright.

975
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,120
It's not very convenient, right?

976
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,500
If you need anything, take a leave

977
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,870
and I'll take you to the supermarket.

978
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
Got it, brother.

979
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,250
Thank you.

980
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,360
Are you working?

981
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
Hello, Supervisor.

982
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,180
Chi.

983
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,070
Stop your work for a while.

984
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,960
Well, I have an announcement.

985
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,340
Who wants to go grocery shopping?

986
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,750
Me! Me! Me!

987
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,470
Fine.

988
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,720
Every one of you

989
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,380
wants to slack off, right?

990
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,320
No, Chi.

991
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,770
It's just rare to go out for a walk.

992
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,660
I love you the most.

993
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,080
Enough.

994
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,390
Chi, I love you more than Dapeng.

995
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,300
All right.

996
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,580
Do you think I don’t love Chi?

997
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,610
Enough. Stop.

998
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,350
Listen to me.

999
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,640
You're all equally precious to me.

1000
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,260
Right?

1001
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,490
It's hard for me to make a choice.

1002
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,160
So I decided on...

1003
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,590
Yang Chi.

1004
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,870
I appoint Yang Chi and Chief Song

1005
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,210
to complete this difficult task.

1006
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,920
Good luck.

1007
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,820
Bye.

1008
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,880
Just him alone?

1009
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,360
Chi, you are so busy...

1010
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,850
Get to work.

1011
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,590
Isn't this

1012
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,970
your favorite shrimp dumplings?

1013
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,860
Forget it.

1014
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,810
We eat in the canteen at the fire brigade every day.

1015
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,690
I don't have time to cook this.

1016
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,020
I'll buy it when I get home.

1017
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,150
This is Nurse Xu Xi's favorite.

1018
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,180
Get a few more.

1019
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,720
That's about it.

1020
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
Let's check out the daily necessities.

1021
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,380
Okay, over there.

1022
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,360
The cereal is gone.

1023
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,800
It's gone?

1024
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,080
It was always here before.

1025
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,140
Maybe it wasn't

1026
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,210
replenished yet.

1027
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,750
Maybe.

1028
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,610
I'll buy it next time then.

1029
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,270
By the way,

1030
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,390
have you considered changing career paths?

1031
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,140
Like going to a pharmaceutical company for clinical practice?

1032
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,710
Which pharmaceutical company? Yunji?

1033
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,830
Anywhere's fine.

1034
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,810
As long as you speak up,

1035
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,970
you can go there at anytime.

1036
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,360
I'm just giving you a suggestion.

1037
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,530
I hope your work can be

1038
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,590
a little more relaxing.

1039
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,620
I like to be busy.

1040
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,220
Then, I don't have to think about anything.

1041
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,170
I hope you can be more comfortable

1042
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,390
and be happier.

1043
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,570
I'm an adult.

1044
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,280
There aren't that many happy days.

1045
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,900
I'm no longer a kid.

1046
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,590
Zhan Dapeng is really delicate.

1047
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,920
He barely has any hair,

1048
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,230
yet he still needs hair essential oil.

1049
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,460
Let's take this one.

1050
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,140
Dr. Xu.

1051
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,610
What a coincidence.

1052
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,720
We even meet here.
