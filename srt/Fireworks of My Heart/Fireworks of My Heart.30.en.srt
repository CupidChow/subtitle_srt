Hello. Excuse me.

Please enjoy.

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,740
Have a taste.

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,620
Mr. Meng.

8
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,740
Mr. Meng.

9
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,500
You come to my place for dinner

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,540
without telling me.

11
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,780
That doesn't make sense.

12
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,260
Well, our company

13
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,900
is hosting a reception here.

14
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,820
I'm here to take a look.

15
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you.

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,860
It's not that I haven't told you,

17
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,420
but you are too busy.

18
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,420
I didn't expect

19
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,460
to see you here today.

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,740
If I had known

21
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,940
I would bother you,

22
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,180
I wouldn't have come.

23
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,579
You sound

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,620
so distant.

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,940
This is...

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,550
A friend's sister.

27
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,900
She came to Yancheng for college.

28
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,950
I treat her to a meal.

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,579
No wonder she looks young.

30
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,820
Mr. Meng,

31
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,230
you are really busy.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,860
I've been asking to meet with you since last year,

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,480
but I still haven't made it.

34
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,100
People are watching me.

35

I understand.

38
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,430
Now that we meet here today,

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,330
I'd like to bother you for a few minutes

40
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,810
and finalize our deal.

41
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,470
Miss,

42
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,570
do you mind?

43
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,480
What business do you want to talk about?

44
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,770
It's an absolutely lucrative business.

45
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,790
It's highly profitable.

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,570

I've got all the resources in this industry.

Look.

53
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,660
Young girls nowadays

55
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,180

56

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,280

become customers

59
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,420

60
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,579
and take out loans.

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,990
The whole line is profitable.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,210
What do you think?

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,060
Do you think

64
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,990
it is profitable?

65
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,810
Yes.

66
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,460
Objectively speaking,

67
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,780
it's quite profitable.

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,380
But subjectively,

69
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,860
it's immoral.

what you said

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,330
is wrong.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
That's the trend right now.

74
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,060

you are a nice person.

92
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,220
Isn't that the most basic principle?

93
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,810
But for other businessmen,

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,530

and become independent.

we won't be afraid of any accidents.

583
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,800
I know what our responsibilities

584
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,900
and tasks are.

585
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,950
But I'm still afraid that

586
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,250
if we're really...

587
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,400
Everyone is afraid of death.

588
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,610
But for everyone,

589
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,450
there are more important things than death.

590
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,170
My former monitor told me

591
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,130
we

592
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,870
are the guts of this city.

593
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,910
[Rescue]

594
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,460
If we're scared,

595
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,390
the whole city

596
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,320
will be unstable.

597
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,950
I chose to be needed by this city

598
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,450
in this way.

599
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,740
I can't retreat.

600
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,680
If you protect others,

601
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,450
others will protect you.

602
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,200
Dear Supervisor,

603
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,540
we

604
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,480
never

605
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,550
fight alone.

606
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,270
[Rescue]

607
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,860
Why are you angry?

608
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,780
You can tell me.

609
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,460
My wife

610
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,480
was treated to death

611
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,310
in your hospital.

612
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,060
My daughter-in-law...

613
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
Call the hospital.

614
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,900
Morning, Dr. Xu.

615
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,650
Morning.

616
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,480
Morning, Dr. Xu.

617
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,780
What's going on outside?

618
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,620
Yesterday, Dr. Yang

619
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,810
treated a patient.

620
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,990
She couldn't save her.

621
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,350
It's not Dr. Yang's problem.

622
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,690
Her family don't believe it?

623
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,580
They can request an investigation

624
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,500
through the complaint channel.

625
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,240
If only everyone were

626
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,200
as reasonable as you.

627
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,120
The family outside

628
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,470
will stay in our hospital

629
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,630
and never give up.

630
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,620
They can act shamelessly just like that.

631
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,730
What I fear the most is that

632
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,440
our hospital

633
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,510
would give them the money

634
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,610
in order to settle this matter.

635
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,810
That's so infuriating.

636
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,070
Don't worry.

637
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,610
This time, our leaders are resolute

638
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,310
and have handed over all the information, cases

639
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,920
and images to the superior department.

640
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,190
We won't compensate them for that.

641
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,500
If this sets a precedent

642
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,290
and everyone comes to blackmail us,

643
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,600
then what is our hospital?

644
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,420
A bank?

645
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,840
Yeah.

646
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,460
If Dr. Yang compensates them for that,

647
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,060
doesn't that mean she treated the patient to death?

648
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,760
Let's go to work.

649
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,440
[Elevator Hall]

650
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,510
I knew a doctor in the emergency department

651
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,830
when I was abroad.

652
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,460
He made a rule for himself.

653
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,410
If a patient fails to be resuscitated

654
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,040
and doesn't make it off the operating table,

655
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,560
he will clutch his watch

656
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,960
and allow himself only one minute of sadness.

657
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,550
Not even one more second.

658
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,840
You've been sad for a long time.

659
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,670
The doctor you knew

660
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,910
is quite like you.

661
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,920
Some people think he's cold-blooded

662
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,150
and ruthless.

663
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,730
But he said

664
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,980
it's the E.R. doctor's responsibility

665
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,130
not to take more than a minute.

666
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,860
Because many patients

667
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,940
are waiting for you.

668
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,830
You know what?

669
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,820
Today, I've been thinking about

670
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,780
what you said.

671
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,180
You said you didn't need to be thanked

672
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,340
for saving people.

673
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,760
Medicine is just a science.

674
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,340
It has its limitations.

675
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,070
A doctor

676
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,800
is just a job.

677
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,909
It has its boundaries.

678
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,820
I've been thinking.

679
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,960
I've been thinking.

680
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,219
I actually envy

681
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,100
your attitude.

682
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
But I can't do that.

683
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,730
That's what I thought before,

684
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,960
and it's biased.

685
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,380
Look at us.

686
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,750
Ironically,

687
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,050
we're totally different.

688
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,370
Hurry. Help her.

689
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,530
Move your head to the side.

690
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,179
Install a monitor

691
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,500
and perform intravenous cannulation.

692
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,840
Where are her family members?

693
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,350
They're outside.

694
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,940
Call them in.

695
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,330
Okay.

696
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,880
Dr. Yang.

697
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,960
Dr. Yang.

698
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:08,980
Her family members are here.

699
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,820
Who are you?

700
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,500
I'm her husband.

701
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,340
This is my mom.

702
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,370
Your wife has an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

703
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,470
She's in critical condition.

704
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,340
We need to operate on her immediately.

705
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,380
You need to make a decision.

706
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,260
Doctor.

707
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,220
How much does it cost?

708
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,480
Tens of thousands of yuan.

709
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,820
How much is it, Doctor?

710
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,180
She usually has a stomachache at home.

711
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
Is it that serious?

712
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,880
I'm not kidding.

713
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,610
You must

714
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,320
make a decision now.

715
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,420
Doctor.

716
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,320
Is there a way to treat her

717
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,990
without doing the surgery?

718
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,590
For example,

719
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,620
put her

720
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,760
on a drip?

721
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,310
Auntie. Let me put it this way.

722
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,360
If we don't save her now,

723
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,500
she'll die.

724
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,330
If we save her,

725
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,390
there's still a 10% chance.

726
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,210
A 10% chance?

727
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,580
And we have to spend tens of thousands of yuan?

728
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,400
Auntie.

729
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,470
You can't make a comparison like that.

730
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,950
This is a life.

731
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,950
Doctor.

732
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:52,990
How about this?

733
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:53,950
Mom.

734
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,640
Can we talk about it again?

735
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,700
We need to talk about it.

736
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,220
Let's talk about it.

737
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,640
Hurry up.

After all, we've been together

for so many years.

747
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,170
Are you stupid?

748
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,930
It's tens of thousands of yuan.

749
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,020
Listen to me.

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm asking

754
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,170
if you're going to save her or not.

755
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,560
Hurry up.

there is still a glimmer of hope.

766

It's up to you now.

767
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,370
Will you save her or not?

768
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,050
Yes.

769
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,210
Of course.

770
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,360
Come in with me and sign.

771
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,030

[During the Operation]

773
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,050
I checked the surgery records.

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,280
You did nothing wrong.

775
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,840
It's not your fault.

776
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,760
But she did

777
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
die in my hands.

778
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,350
I just don't understand.

779
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,260
Why would I

780
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,780
encounter such a thing?

781
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,150
Why did she die in my hands?

782
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,020
Maybe God

783
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
wants to tell us

784
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,080
we are just vulnerable people.

785
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,210
We are not almighty gods.

786
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,600
Let me tell you.

787
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,790
I haven't had

788
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,170
a good night's sleep

789
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,730
since you were transferred

790
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,030
to that fire station.

791
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,810
Don't worry about me.

792
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,920
Our fire station

793
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,870
has very good safety measures

794
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,640
and the operation is also very standardized.

795
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,410
If it were standardized,

796
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,640
how could such a big thing happen?

797
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,140
You'll die if you keep doing this.

798
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,210
You always carry out difficult tasks.

799
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,910
How can I not worry?

800
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
It's too dangerous.

801
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,290
Don't worry.

802
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,840
Don't lose sleep over it.

803
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,250
Or is it because

804
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,800
Dad has made you upset lately?

805
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,650
We're talking about you.

806
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,270
Why are you talking about me?

807
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,730
You should say something.

808
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,500
Aren't you also worried about him?

809
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,100
Yes.

810
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,740
At first,

811
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,430
I didn't support him.

812
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,230
But now it's the other way around.

813
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,390
You can't

814
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,500
give up halfway.

815
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,620
Yes.

816
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,810
Look at him

817
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,560
now.

818
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,080
He is more like

819
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,740
a responsible person.

820
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,380
He learned it

821
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,290
all on his own

822
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,190
in the fire station.

823
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,430
I think it's good.

824
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,290
But

825
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,550
you need to be careful.

826
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,980
Thank you, Dad.

827
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,800
You said all the good things,

828
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,380
right?

829
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,260
You can also say something.

830
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,500
Let me tell you.

831
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,570
You must be careful.

832
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,200
Be careful.

833
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,260
Be careful.

834
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,150
Mom, don't worry.

835
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,340
Auntie,

836
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
try to persuade him.

837
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,340
Oh no.

838
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:42,940
Something's wrong.

839
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,000
The man and his mother are going to jump off the building.

840
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,430
They're already

841
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,620
on the rooftop of the outpatient department.

842
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,240
Who?

843
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,180
Who else could it be?

844
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,290
Li Rong's family.

845
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,080
They're so persistent.

846
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,310
They just won't stop.

847
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,290
I think

848
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,460
they won't jump.

849
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,420
The worse it gets, the less they'll jump.

850
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,380
Come on, let's go take a look.

851
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,050
No.

852
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,420
What if they really jump?

853
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,210
The police and firefighters are here.

854
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,620
Save them first.

855
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,390
[Firefighting]

856
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:25,380
[Firefighting]

857
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,640
They treated my daughter-in-law to death.

858
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,420
[Rescue]

859
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,240
What's going on?

860
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,350
There're two hospital violators wanting to jump off the building.

861
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,540
My colleagues have been persuading them for a long time,

862
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,080
but they don't listen.

863
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,240
They don't let anyone get close.

864
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,060
We can't come to the hospital anymore.

865
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,090
Yang Chi.

866
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,230
Take a team upstairs.

867
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,400
Prepare the air cushion.

868
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,100
Got it.

869
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,590
Okay.

870
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,180
Let's go.
