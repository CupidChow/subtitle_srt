00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,430
will cook at home.

197
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,110
Your aunt cooks so well.

198
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,200
Is the food in your canteen good?

199
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Not bad.

200
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,870
What about yours?

201
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,370
Just so-so.

202
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,690
It doesn't taste good.

203
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,579
Have some water.

204
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
It smells good.

205
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,700
You must be hungry.

206
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,120
It'll be ready soon.

207
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,570
OK.

208
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,820
Xu Qin.

209
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,410
Do you remember

210
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,940
what you said yesterday?

211
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,800
Some do.

212
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,660
Some don't.

213
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,470
You said

214
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,750
you would never come over again.

215
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,590
Do you

216
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,220
remember that?

217
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,570
You're not drunk, are you?

218
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,070
Now,

219
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,220
do you still say that?

220
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,900
I don't know.

221
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,830
If I come over,

222
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
can you wait?

223
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,190
I feel sorry for you

224
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,120
that you have to wait for me with uncertainty.

225
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,820
I don't know

226
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,070
what to do now.

227
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,350
I don't know

228
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,690
how to ask you

229
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,310
and myself.

230
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,740
I don't know

231
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,600
how to face you

232
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,490
and my family.

233
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,040
I...

234
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,390
I know you're scared.

235
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,730
I just want to tell you

236
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,180
as long as you are determined,

237
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,720
I'll take care of everything in the future.

238
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,010
As long as you dare,

239
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,170
I can bear it.

240
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,430
I know

241
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,690
it sounds good,

242
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,580
but it doesn't work.

243
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,380
I'm not brave enough.

244
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,750
To be honest,

245
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,970
I feel guilty for putting you

246
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,650
in this predicament.

247
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,850
I know you're good.

248
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,860
I can guarantee

249
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,490
I'll be good to you.

250
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,110
I'll be good to you every day.

251
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,750
I will never betray you,

252
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,910
nor neglect you.

253
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,710
I'll try my best

254
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,180
to create a better life for you.

255
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,550
I can't guarantee

256
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,880
if I'm good enough

257
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,310
to meet

258
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,950
the requirements of you and your family.

259
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,910
I know it's hard for you.

260
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,730
I know

261
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,050
if we're really being together,

262
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,540
you'll have to suffer.

263
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,460
I understand.

264
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,310
But

265
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,490
you have to stop

266
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,080
coming into my life

267
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,350
like this.

268
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,910
Be together,

269
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,450
or never see each other again.

270
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,000
Make a decision.

271
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,290
[Fire] [On/Off]

272
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,620
Did I tell you

273
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,460
not to hang out

274
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,060
with indecent people?

275
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,100
You don't love yourself at all.

276
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,140
If you want to be with him,

277
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,900
you don't need to

278
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,540
go to college.

279
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,600
You can also abandon this family.

280
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,720
From now on,

281
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,120
you don't have to call me mom.

282
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,750
Mom.

283
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,390
Qin.

284
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,430
Listen to me.

285
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,640
I won't hurt you.

286
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,390
I will give you

287
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,620
everything.

288
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,540
But if

289
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,700
you do what you want

290
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,340
and you don't care about this family,

291
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,800
I'll find a way

292
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,630
to send you away.

293
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,300
It's no use begging your father

294
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,100
and your brother.

295
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,920
I will

296
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,820
keep my word.

297
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,350
Mom.

298
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,280
Qin.

299
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,760
His parents are not good people.

300
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,360
How could he be a good man?

301
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,510
You let me down.

302
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,040
For such a person,

303
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,150
you broke my heart.

304
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,550
I've loved you for so many years.

305
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,030
It's all

306
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,080
in vain.

307
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,310
Mom.

308
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,110
I'll listen to you.

309
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,270
♫If parting is to meet again♫

310
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,040
♫I love you and I miss you♫

311

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,760
♫I'm starting to lose sleep♫

♫The leaves fall in spring and it snows in July♫

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,390

Why are you here so early?

322
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,750
I'm here to take you to work.

323
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,700
Have you eaten?

324
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,540
Yes.

325
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,740
Let's go.

326
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,880
Actually,

327
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,120
you didn't have to send me back yesterday.

328
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,240
Even if you didn't remind me,

329
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,730
I dare not resist.

330
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,770
What are you afraid of?

331
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,730
You thought I've grown up

332
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,290
and become strong.

333
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,550
I would abandon everything and get away.

334
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,710
Do you know

335
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,980
how a trainer trains a beast?

336
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,620
When the beast was very young,

337
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,610
the trainer would hit it, starve it and lock it up.

338
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,930
She also petted it, fed it and cared for it.

339
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,240
When the beast grew up

340
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,820
and became strong,

341
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,280
it would not dare to resist

342
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,300
or go to the wild

343
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,580
upon seeing the torture and the caring.

344
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,220
You all say

345
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,820
he isn't good enough for me.

346
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,640
But in fact,

347
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,750
I'm not good enough for him.

348
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,490
When I'm with him,

349
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,810
I feel like

350
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,390
I would hurt him anytime, anywhere.

351
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,420
Because I am

352
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,420
a despicable person.

353
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,330
I want everything,

354
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,700
and I'm afraid of losing everything.

355
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,720
I want

356
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,630
Dad, Mom and you.

357
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,360
I want Song Yan too.

358
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,870
I

359
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
have no courage.

360
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,550
I'm not brave enough.

361
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,730
I dare not face anything.

362
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,180
I can only escape.

363
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,350
I don't have the ability to love,

364
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,080
nor the right to love.

365
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,470
I don't deserve to be loved by anyone.

366
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,070
[Benevolence]

367
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,100
Let's go abroad.

368
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,140
Qin.

369
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,470
Let's go abroad together,

370
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,710
and never come back, OK?

371
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Bye, Brother.

372
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:43,970
How is it?

373
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,490
Is the air nice?

374
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,790
In the future,

375
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,150
come out more often.

376
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,570
Mrs. Meng, you do know

377
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,800
our medical workers.

378
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,540
In the hospital,

379
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,050
it smells like disinfectant every day.

380
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,740
The air outside

381
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,010
is so fresh.

382
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,720
Vice-president Liu.

383
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,340
I was about to ask you.

384
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,900
It's been a while for my daughter

385
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,280
to work in the hospital.

386
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,400
How do you like her?

387
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,110
Are those professors

388
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,310
satisfied with her?

389
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,590
Of course.

390
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,580
Dr. Xu

391
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,120
is serious about her work,

392
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,740
and enthusiastic about her patients.

393
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,820
The hospital

394
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,000
has put her

395
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,390
on a priority list.

396
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,380
Then I'll thank you

397
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,300
for your cultivation.

398
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,280
It's my pleasure.

399
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,510
Director Xu,

400
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,250
I want to know

401
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,430
why I didn't pass the interview application?

402
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,340
Pulling strings

403
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,370
doesn't work for me.

404
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,230
Go back and tell your family.

405
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,050
Do not ask Vice-president Liu to come to me again.

406
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,990
My medical team

407
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,230
needs young people

408
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,780
who truly love this job,

409
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,340
instead of

410
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,450
those who always think about taking shortcuts

411
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,760
and pulling strings.

412
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,380
But you know

413
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,150
I'm the most capable one among the young doctors.

414
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,660
A good doctor needs comprehensive skills.

415
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,570
I don't think

416
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,190
you have the most comprehensive skills.

417
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,880
Speaking of arrogance,

418
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,710
you may be the best.

419
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,780
Director Xu.

420
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,020
I think Dr. Xu

421
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,219
is really good.

422
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,120
Why don't you

423
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,290
think about it?

424
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,280
Yang.

425
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,150
I'm wondering

426
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,090
if the new instructor

427
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
is easy to get along with?

428
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,350
What kind of man is he?

429
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,350
I don't know if he's easy to get along with.

430
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,040
Anyway,

431
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,469
as long as Yan can get along with him, I'll have no problem with him then.

432
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,340
Don't think about it. We'll know

433
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,239
in the afternoon.

434
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,889
I heard that

435
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,190
he's from the headquarters.

436
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,650
He has a very impressive family background.

437
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:49,960
With such a good condition,

438
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,310
why does he come here

439
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,260
instead of working in the office?

440
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,500
He probably wants to take this job

441
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,150
as a springboard

442
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,010
and raise his profiles.

443
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,880
Maybe

444
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,540
he will quit

445
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,600
in a short time.

446
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,480
With our chief's temper,

447
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,590
no one can tell

448
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,220
if he can raise his profiles

449
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,250
or not.

450
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,020
To be honest,

451
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,210
I

452
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,480
really miss Jun.

453
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,510
We'll never have an instructor

454
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,010
like Jun.

455
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,440
In the past,

456
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,160
I always thought he was nagging.

457
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,730
Now it's quiet.

458
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,090
I'm not used to it.

459
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,900
Chi.

460
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,340
Yi.

461
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,800
The new instructor will be here soon.

462
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,020
I thought it was in the afternoon?

463
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,760
Ahead of schedule.

464
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,990
Speak of the devil.

465
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,860
Let's welcome him together.

466
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,480
OK. Everyone, stop!

467
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,680
Let's welcome the new instructor.

468
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,460
Go.

469
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:37,850
OK.

470
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,930
Chief Song.

471
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,750
Hello.

472
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,950
Long time no see.

473
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,090
You said

474
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,260
I could come to find you

475
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,390
at Shilitai Fire and Rescue Station.

476
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,420
Hello.

477
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,480
Where is the new instructor?

478
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,240
It's me.

479
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,500
This is my order.

480
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,710
Are you Jiang Yu?

481
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,910
You don't seem to

482
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,020
remember me last time.

483
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,070
Today, I'd like to officially

484
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,020
introduce myself.

485
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,470
My name is Jiang Yu.

486
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,980
I'm the new instructor

487
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,540
at Shilitai Fire and Rescue Station.

488
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,260
From today onwards,

489
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,530
I'm going to work with you.

490
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,460
Nice to meet you.

491
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,000
Yang Chi.

492
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,600
Yes.

493
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,620
What are you doing?

494
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,740
Why are you standing here?

495
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Are you numb?

496
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,620
Hello, Instructor.

497
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,980
Welcome, Instructor.

498
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,540
You’re welcome.

499
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,400
You must be tired.

500
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,640
You're welcome.

501
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,660
I can do it myself.

502
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,290
OK.

503
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,410
The instructor

504
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,460
looks kind.

505
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,360
He should be a nice guy to get along with.

506
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,550
Why do I feel that

507
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,940
our chief doesn't like him?

508
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,300
Come on, man.

509
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,300
At this moment,

510
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,060
you should just

511
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,920
shut your mouth.

512
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:07,900
Let's go.

513
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,330
Here, close the door.

514
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:22,860
[The First People's Hospital of Yancheng]

515
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:22,860
[Harmony, knowledge, diligence, benevolence]

516
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,400
Thank you

517
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,840
for attending the interview today.

518
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,570
Hope to see you again.

519
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,190
Thank you, Director.

520
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,070
Keep up the good work.

521
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,640
OK.

522
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,460
OK.

523
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,530
Done.

524
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,060
[The First People's Hospital of Yancheng]

525
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,060
[Harmony, knowledge, diligence, benevolence]

526
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,480
Director Xu.

527
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,250
What are you doing here?

528
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
You're not on the list

529
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,360
for today's interview.

530
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,010
Sorry.

531
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,220
I want to try again.

532
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,950
The interview is over.

533
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,880
You can take a look

534
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,030
at my application materials

535
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,890
and then decide if you can

536
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,070
give me a chance.

537
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,210
I've always thought of hospitals

538
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,180
as places

539
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,080
where professionalism matters.

540
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,040
If you think

541
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,020
I'm not capable enough in other areas

542
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:13,790
outside my major,

543
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,770
you can bring it up

544
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,040
so that I can learn from you.

545
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,580
Are you mocking me?

546
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,020
No.

547
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,960
You misunderstood.

548
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,550
Fine.

549
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,400
Tell me

550
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,110
why you became a doctor.

551
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,260
Don't be nervous.

552
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,830
Answer him properly.

553
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,480
Because

554
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,980
I won't lose my job.

555
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,270
I really admire Dr. Xu.

556
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,210
Our director is notoriously bad-tempered.

557
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,040
She even confronted him.

558
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,860
I heard from the deputy director that

559
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,480
when Dr. Xu

560
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,640
answered the first question,

561
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,040
she felt disappointed and thought it was almost over.

562
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,380
Surprisingly,

563
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,130
she passed the interview in the end.

564
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,040
Isn't it strange?

565
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,220
There is nothing we can do.

566
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,260
She's capable.

567
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,170
It's not a big deal to be more arrogant

568
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,910
than others.

569
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,520
Now,

570
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,580
she is in the same group

571
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,860
with Yang Sijia, another arrogant doctor

572
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,640
in the hospital.

573
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,500
Just wait.

574
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,590
It's going to be fun.

575
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,320
Am I arrogant?

576
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,470
Dr. Yang.

577
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,030
Where is my phone?

578
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,250
Where is my phone?

579
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,260
You might have left it in the lobby.

580
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,880
I'll go find my phone.

581
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,470
Dr. Xu.

582
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,300
We're in the same group.

583
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,980
Let's shake hands.

584
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,320
I just washed my hands.

585
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,110
Sorry.

586
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:04,930
Let me

587
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,020
remind you warmly.

588
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,660
Our director is very strict.

589
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,090
Working with him,

590
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,560
you'll suffer in the future.

591
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,550
Being strict is a good thing.

592
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,140
Training is not really suffering.

593
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,600
Instructor,

594
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,630
our dorm

595
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,460
and the entertainment area are upstairs.

596
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,260
This is the backyard.

597
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,460
Pass through here

598
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,250
and you can find the canteen there.

599
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,640
It's too big.

600
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,460
Do we still have a dog at our Station?

601
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:35,890
Yes.

602
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Our chief picked it up.

603
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,260
What's its name?

604
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:38,810
Meng.

605
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,900
Meng is well-trained

606
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,810
by our chief.

607
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,390
It's like a police dog.

608
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,270
Hello, Meng.

609
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,450
Instructor.

610
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,350
Why does it bite?

611
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,310
Don't worry. It won't bite you.

612
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,530
It won't bite you. It's OK.

613
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,280
Instructor.

614
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,060
OK. Sit.

615
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,380
I'll show you around the canteen.

616
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,330
Over there.

617
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,610
Nice to meet you, Meng.

618
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,040
Chief Song.

619
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,940
Yang Chi showed me

620
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,690
around the Station today.

621
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,700
I have a few questions

622
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,850
to ask you.

623
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,290
Go to bed early.

624
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,230
I usually stay up late.

625
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,460
I'm not sleepy yet.

626
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,600
I'll check the dorm.

627
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,190
I'll go with you.

628
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,410
[Jiang Yu]

629
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,410
[Instructor]
