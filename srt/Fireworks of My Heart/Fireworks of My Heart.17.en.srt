I just think this painting

You're too modest.

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,060
Prepare for search and rescue!

392
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,820
Yes!

393
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,140
Chief,

394
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,020
the equipment have been checked.

395
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,780
Let's go.

396
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,660
Yes!

397
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,940
Higher.

398
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,700
My head.

399
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,940
Come on, kid.

400
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
Let me take a look.

401
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,620
Mom, it hurts.

402
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,340
Dr. Xu!

403
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,180
A severely injured patient is in shock.

404
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,580
Hurry.

405
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,580
Li Nan.

406
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,740
Li Nan.

407
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,900
Coming.

408
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,100
There are many casualities now.

409
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,020
We will take charge of triage

410
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,460
and put these bracelets on the casualties

411
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,460
according to their conditions.

412
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,700
Okay.

413
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,140
We can distinguish the order of treatment too.

414
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,100
On my way here,

415
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
I've already contacted the Emergency Center.

416
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Once the ambulance arrives,

417
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,780
we can take away the severely injured casualties first.

418
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,330
Hurry.

419
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:10,970
Hurry.

420
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,820
Where is she hurt?

421
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,530
Her eyes.

422
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Only the head?

423
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,100
Yang!

424
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,060
Yang, I've got you!

425
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,340
Yang!

426
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,300
I've got you. It's okay.

427
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,340
Let's go.

428
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,740
One, two, go.

429
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,420
One, two.

430
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,340
Come on.

431
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,220
Mom, it hurts.

432
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,740
I'll come over later

433
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,020
to take a look. Hang in there.

434
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,820
Baby, don't cry.

435
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,660
I'll tie a yellow one for you.

436
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,860
When the ambulance comes,

437
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,540
you go with them, okay?

438
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,290
Come and help.

439
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,620
Lend a hand.

440
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,140
Come on. One, two, three.

441
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,900
Let's go.

442
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,100
Please be quiet.

443
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,050
Listen to me.

444
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,260
Let's help

445
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,260
those with red bracelets

446
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,860
on to the ambulance first.

447
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,940
Those with yellow bracelets,

448
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,540
get on the bus.

449
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,740
And these two parents,

450
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,380
take your kids

451
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,540
on the bus.

452
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,490
Those with blue bracelets.

453
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,540
Please wait.

454
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,740
Our car is on the way.

455
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,460
It'll be there soon, okay?

456
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,810
Dapeng, go over there.

457
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,540
OK.

458
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,260
One, two, three, go.

459
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,540
Come on.

460
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,770
No.

461
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,900
Squad Leader, push him forward.

462
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,460
Okay.

463
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,380
Okay, let's go.

464
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:46,860
How is it?

465
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,380
Here.

466
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,340
Slowly.

467
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,180
Out.

468
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,930
Slow down.

469
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,980
Speed.

470
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,940
Check carefully. Are there any more casualties?

471
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,500
Dr. Xu!

472
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,570
There's another patient here.

473
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,890
Hurry.

474
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,090
Get him on the ambulance in front

475
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,780
to the hospital, quick.

476
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,020
Okay, let's go.

477
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,860
Okay.

478
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
How many casualties are there left?

479
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,940
Chi.

480
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,100
Is there anyone else trapped down there?

481
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,700
No.

482
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,580
The one who was just sent up

483
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,380
is the last one.

484
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,300
No.

485
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,860
My friend is still down there.

486
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,700
His name is Chen Yu.

487
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,140
He has short hair and he's wearing a grey shirt

488
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,940
and a black baseball cap.

489
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Please find him.

490
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,340
Calm down.

491
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,090
Calm down.

492
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,260
The trapped people we saved

493
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,980
are all up there.

494
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,020
Why don't you take a closer look?

495
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,460
I've searched everywhere

496
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,900
but I couldn't find him.

497
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,060
He saved us.

498
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,340
When the car went out of control,

499
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,300
he broke the window

500
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,100
and pushed us out.

501
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,980
He saved us.

502
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,020
He hasn't come up yet.

503
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,130
We must find him.

504
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,220
Calm down.

505
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,140
Calm down.

506
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,020
Chi. Chi.

507
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,730
Are you sure

508
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,620
there's no one else trapped?

509
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,220
They said there's still

510
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,300
a man in grey

511
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,260
who hasn't been found.

512
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,060
Yang Chi.

513
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Expand the search area.

514
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,220
Copy that.

515
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:07,940
Jiang.

516
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,420
Hold on. There's someone. Keep looking.

517
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,380
Pipi, Dapeng, Gao Yu.

518
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,500
Keep looking.

519
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:11,900
Yes.

520
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,090
He saved us.

521
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,260
We must find him.

522
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,300
We couldn't have gotten out without him.

523
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,940
Calm down.

524
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,450
Calm down.

525
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,260
Yang Chi.

526
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
Can you look for him again?

527
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,420
He might have been flung out of the bus

528
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,540
when it fell off the cliff.

529
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,320
Let me see.

530
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,980
Could he have fallen

531
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,100
down the cliff?

532
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,380
He wouldn't stand a chance.

533
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,460
Chief.

534
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,940
We can't see the bottom of the cliff clearly.

535
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,020
Check the surroundings first. Be careful.

536
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,980
-Yes. Let's look more carefully.

537
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:04,700
Yes.

538
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,860
Chi. Chi.

539
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Here!

540
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,010
Found him!

541
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,580
They found him.

542
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,140
Let's go.

543
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,500
Here.

544
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,660
It's him!

545
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,260
It's him!

546
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,300
Great!

547
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,540
Please save him.

548
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,180
Come on.

549
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,780
Put him down.

550
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,900
Put him on the cushion.

551
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,020
Be careful.

552
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,050
Chief.

553
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,260
The situation of the casualty is very complicated.

554
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,370
We don't dare to do resuscitation rashly.

555
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,100
We need a doctor.

556
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,540
I'll go down.

557
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,260
Chief.

558
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,480
The situation is very dangerous.

559
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,430
The bus could fall again

560
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,290
at any moment.

561
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,820
He might die at any moment.

562
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,700
Put on your gear.

563
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,340
Got it.

564
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,020
Dr. Xu.

565
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,580
Come with me.

566
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,260
Okay.

567
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,740
I'll go down with you,

568
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,260
Dr. Xu.

569
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,860
Dr. Xu.

570
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,180
Be careful.

571
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,100
Okay.

572
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,450
Dr. Xu.

573
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,820
Dapeng.

574
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,500
Chen Yu.

575
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,900
Chen Yu.

576
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,100
Chen Yu, can you hear me?

577
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,340
Chen Yu.

578
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,710
Chen Yu.

579
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,380
Chen Yu, wake up, Chen Yu.

580
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,100
Chen Yu!

581
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,900
Chen Yu, you’re awake?

582
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,310
Chen Yu.

583
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,500
Where does it hurt?

584
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,900
My stomach.

585
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,620
