00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,650
There's no light.

194
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,790
It's very depressing.

195
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,910
They're just caterpillars.

196
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,720
Neither of them can escape.

197
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,350
But luckily, there are two of them.

198
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,580
They can depend on each other.

199
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,310
Although it's dark,

200
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,760
they have each other's company.

201
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,350
But one day,

202
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,840
one of them comes out of the cocoon,

203
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,930
turns into a butterfly, and flies away.

204
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,680
The other caterpillar

205
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,150
is still in the cave.

206
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,150
Still in the endless darkness.

207
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,740
The other caterpillar

208
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,440
will turn into a butterfly too.

209
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,110
There are too many butterflies outside.

210
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,350
No matter how hard it searches,

211
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
it can't find

212
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,990
that caterpillar from before.

213
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,740
You two used to

214
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,390
bear the suppression of your mum together.

215
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,590
Now, Qin

216
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,180
is pursuing her own happiness.

217
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,740
The pressure she and Song Yan will face

218
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,530
will only be 1,000 times greater than you.

219
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,090
In comparison,

220
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,910
they are braver than you.

221
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,690
No matter what,

222
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,910
as long as they fly out,

223
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,930
there'll be a vast world out there.

224
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,800
It's obviously better than

225
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,990
staying in the dark forever.

226
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,690
He's always a decent man.

227
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,260
I'm also surprised

228
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,490
about today.

229
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,940
I know.

230
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,950
I knew it long ago.

231
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,670
What do you know?

232
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
I know it's not been easy

233
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,220
for you to be in that family.

234
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,900
It's not about how difficult it is.

235
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,070
It's just that when we are with family,

236
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,350
it's not that easy

237
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,500
to tell

238
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,580
who's right and who's wrong.

239
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,910
You think my mum is tough, right?

240
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,140
Indeed.

241
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,740
She's very controlling.

242
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,470
But you know what?

243
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,940
When I had a fever

244
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,390
in my childhood,

245
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,180
she was the one

246
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,490
who kept me company all night.

247
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,050
When someone bullied me,

248
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,300
she was also the one who stood up for me.

249
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,280
Surprised?

250
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,430
It's just my mum's personality is like that.

251
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,670
She treats Meng Yanchen

252
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,030
and me in the same way.

253
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,330
My brother is very much like me.

254
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,230
We are like caterpillars.

255
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,860
We spinned ourselves in a cocoon,

256
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,000
thinking that we were hiding in a safe zone.

257
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,490
Once anything

258
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,030
changes in this zone,

259
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,630
we'd suddenly lose our sense of security.

260
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,220
My brother thinks

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,560
the other caterpillar ran away.

262
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,150
He has no companion now,

263
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,230
and he's abandoned.

264
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,190
That's why he feels uneasy.

265
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,579
From now on, your safe zone

266
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,790
will be me.

267
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,599
Warm water.

268
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,210
Where is the wine?

269
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,680
The wine was the boss's.

270
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,980
I'll buy one bottle.

271
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,490
What do you want?

272
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,350
Anything.

273
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,920
Okay.

274
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,270
I'm in the bar.

275
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Okay, got it.

276
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,670
Okay.

277
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,140
Wait a minute.

278
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,210
Okay, I'll be right back.

279
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,110
Who is the wine for?

280
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,770
Mr. Meng.

281
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,830
Who allowed you to open the wine for him?

282
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,870
He paid the bill.

283
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,760
Why can't I open it?

284
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,270
Will you be responsible if he gets drunk?

285
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,470
Yes.

286
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,550
Yes?

287
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,270
Ye'zi.

288
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,330
I remember you are from a pretty good college.

289
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,110
It's already graduation season.

290
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,540
Why haven't you been looking for a proper job

291
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,720
instead of working part-time here?

292
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
It's hard to find a job.

293
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,420
Aren't you an internet celebrity?

294
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,270
Why are you so keen

295
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,460
about this part-time job?

296
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,250
Isn't it good to work hard?

297
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,220
Listen.

298
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
Young lady.

299
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,740
You're still young.

300
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,170
Don't think about

301
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,440
unrealistic things.

302
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,910
You look like that person,

303
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,270
but you don't really.

304
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
You are alike in appearance but not in essence.

305
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,710
You're nothing like her.

306
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,850
After you finish your work today,

307
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,270
go collect your salary at the finance department.

308
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,570
Don't come tomorrow.

309
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,010
Zhou.

310
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,230
Take this.

311
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,220
Give me a bottle of water

312
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,260
and hand me the clothes.

313
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,680
I'll leave early

314
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,630
because I have things to do.

315
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,800
Call a designated driver for Mr. Meng.

316
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,740
Okay.

317
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,560
Okay, Boss.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,120
What's going on?

319
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,590
Why is he so tough today?

320
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,270
Saying things like

321
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,410
"alike in appearance but not in essence"

322
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,950
and "nothing like her".

323
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,820
Who was he talking about?

324
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,330
The purest vodka.

325
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,070
Try it.

326
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,070
Do you think I'm stupid?

327
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,860
Take a break.

328
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,380
Drink some water.

329
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,720
My dad just

330
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,390
called me

331
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,380
and asked me to go home.

332
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,660
I'm leaving.

333
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,040
Don't drink any more.

334
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,990
Don't let me see you here

335
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,080
when I come back later.

336
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
I'll tell on you.

337
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,150
Hello, Mr. Meng.

338
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,550
Kaming Designated Driving is at your service.

339
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,940
Please fasten your seat belt.

340
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,340
I thought you already quit this.

341
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,380
No one would complain about

342
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,360
how many ways there are to make money.

343
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,480
You haven't fastened your seat belt yet.

344
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,270
Are you drunk?

345
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,850
Turn left in front.

346
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,770
Change the lane in advance.

347
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,720
Looks like you're really not drunk.

348
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,190
People like you

349
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,270
never get drunk, do you?

350
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,560
What kind of person am I?

351
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,780
Extremely self-disciplined.

352
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,130
Still self-disciplined even when you're drinking your problems away.

353
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,190
Then it's an exception today.

354
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,270
Cold wind is the worst for the drunk.

355
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,930
Are you okay?

356
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,260
Are you okay?

357
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,520
Tissues. Wipe your mouth.

358
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,590
It'll be extra work for the cleaning lady.

359
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,970
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,580
Is something

361
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,780
bothering you?

362
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,430
No.

363
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,110
You look like you are lying.

364
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,580
I'm not.

365
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,590
I just don't have

366
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,520
anything happy in my life.

367
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,170
So what can make you happy?

368
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,270
Never.

369
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,230
Never again.

370
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,850
Never again.

371
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,070
[BWZ Vintage]

372
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,770
We're here.

373
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,030
This shop, right?

374
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,530
Hello.

375
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,940
Anyone here?

376
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,030
Hello, who called the police?

377
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,790
Where are they?

378
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,800
It's me!

379
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,960
Hello, what's wrong?

380
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,140
I...

381
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,690
There's a spider

382
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,940
upstairs.

383
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,540
It's massive.

384
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,380
But...

385
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,360
But I dare not catch it.

386
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,060
Please help me catch it.

387
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,340
Don't worry. We're on it.

388
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,250
Dapeng.

389
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,620
Are you afraid of spiders?

390
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,820
Hide behind me if you're scared.

391
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,300
Lady.

392
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,870
Where did you find the spider exactly?

393
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,190
Over there.

394
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,840
Pipi, Dapeng, Ge. Go!

395
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,430
OK.

396
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,900
Be careful.

397
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,220
That is expensive.

398
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,900
Ge.

399
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,120
Be careful with it.

400
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,620
Okay.

401
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,990
Be careful.

402
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,400
Be careful.

403
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,140
This is more expensive.

404
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Hello.

405
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,480
Are you sure it's over here?

406
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,720
I've searched for a long time but I didn't see it.

407
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,340
I'm sure it's there.

408
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,240
I saw it with my own eyes. It was right there.

409
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,070
Miss.

410
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,930
Is that spider really this big?

411
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,250
It's big anyway.

412
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,490
Chi. Yi.

413
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,650
I really didn't find any spiders.

414
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,060
We didn't either.

415
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,860
Not here either.

416
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,430
Did it run downstairs?

417
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,710
It's here.

418
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,400
It's on your back.

419
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,950
Don't move.

420
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,540
Dapeng, don't move.

421
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,990
It's only this big.

422
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:48,880
Pipi.

423
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,670
Catch the spider.

424
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,580
Miss, is this the one?

425
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,700
Yes.

426
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,180
Yes.

00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,260
The problem has been solved.

429
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,360
We'll leave now.

430
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,790
Okay, thank you.

431
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,270

433
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,110
Back to the station.

434
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,940
Let's go.

435
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,660
The spider is really huge.

436
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:11,920
Thank you.

437
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,640

About an hour.

Another hour?

It's not worth it for me.

487
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,350
I even lost two bottles of drinks, Yi.

488
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,700
I'll return them to you.

You're awake.

494
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,730

This is my home.

on the order page.

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,870
Just because you are a rich young man,

504
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,660
you think

505
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,980
I have some ulterior motives towards you?

506
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,000
It was you who refused to get off yesterday.

507
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,070
You refused to go home

508
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,090
even after we arrived at the underground parking lot.

509
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,190
You said you'd like to be anywhere

510
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,100
but not home.

511
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,370
I really didn't know

512
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,530
where I could send you.

513
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,010
I'm sorry.

514
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,530
I don't remember anything.

515
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,930
You said you are sorry,

516
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,540
but you're actually suspecting that I was lying.

517
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,090
It was my first time blacking out for drinking too much.

518
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,150

519
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:14,580
have left me

Where's my jacket?

522
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,300
I should go back.

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,110
Wait.

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,830

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,460

00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,070
for throwing up on the ground,

528
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,250
yet you don't show any respect

529
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,150

00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,170
last night?

534
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,880
Or what?

535
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,650
I bought

536
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,540
this toothpaste and toothbrush for you.

537
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,720
You'll only use them once,

538
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,750

this place alone?

544
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,700
I share it with a classmate.

545
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,060
She didn't come back

546
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,640
because she had classes last night.

547
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,470
So,

548
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,070
have you paid off your student loan?

549
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,850
Almost.

550
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,380
You want to ask about the rent, right?

551
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,220
Last month,

552
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,700
we gained a lot of fans.

553
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,130
Also, many people came to me for collaboration.

554
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,530
I received way too many packages, and it was too crowded in the dorm.

555
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,230
I'm about to graduate anyway.

556
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,340
It's better that I rented a house in advance,

557
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,520
so I don't have to find a place later.

all want to be internet celebrities?

560
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,610
Even in such a good college,

561
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,240
you still want to do that.

562
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,760
Or what?

563
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,990

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,360
You think too much.

766
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,190
Right.

767
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,420
If you don't choose to start,

768
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,300
how can you know

769
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,050
what the ending will be like?

770
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,980
Besides,

771
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,260
choosing to start

772
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,610
can help you push things forward

773
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,920
in a good direction.

774
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,550
If you don't choose to start,

775
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,380
surely you can avoid a bad ending,

776
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,350
but

777
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,090
there won't be a happy ending either.

778
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,130
Dr. Xu, you don't talk much.

779
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,610
But when you talk, it makes great sense.

780
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,830
Dr. Li.

781
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,270
Watch and learn.

782
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,860
But,

783
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,690
if

784
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,160
all signs indicate that

785
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
there's probably not going to be a good result,

786
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,000
why would I want to go through it at all?

787
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,620
Even if there's no result,

788
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,120
at least there's a process.

789
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,790
No matter what, if you've experienced it,

790
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,030
there wouldn't be any regrets.

791
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,400
I'm leaving.

792
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,410
[Demonstrate the Morality of the Hospital and Create Life Miracles]

793
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,280
Bye, Leader.

794
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,460
Bye, Leader.

795
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,100
Leader even

796
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,440
gossips with us now.

797
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,300
Did I hear it right?

798
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,590
Watch and learn.

799
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,520
-I'm leaving./N-I'm leaving. Bye.
