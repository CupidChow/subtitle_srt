Was it because of me?

833
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,290
Were you afraid that

No.

Why didn't you discuss with me

837
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,400
before making such an important decision?

838
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,470
I...

839
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,890
I didn't want to put you under pressure.

840
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,310
I was also afraid that you'd choose to support me

841
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,460
because you're sensible,

842
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,760
and you'd be wronged.

843
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,900

844
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,810

the first thing you think of

857
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,720
is not to share it with me,

858
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,020
but to hide it from me.
