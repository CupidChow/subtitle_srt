Why is she?

164
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,740
Just because she studied in the USA before?

165

She's only been here for a while.

167
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,580
That's why they sent her to the ER.

168
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,490
It may seem unjustifiable

169
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,500
for her to join the scientific research team

170

I would have scolded her.

578
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,850
Why should I scold her?

579
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,900
Why?

580
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,470
Have you forgotten

581
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,690
how she treated my brother?

582
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,300
I've never seen

583
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,520
such wicked people like them.

584
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,870
How dared she come?

585
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,730
Wasn't she studying abroad?

586
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,360
Why did she come back suddenly?

587
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,650
Tell me.

588

Why is she looking for your brother?

589
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,260
Perhaps she feels empty.

590
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,380
With her personality

591
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,550

593
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,950
Only my brother

594
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,300
treated her as a treasure.

595
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,060
In the past few years,

596
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,480
she found out no one else liked her.

597
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,110
So it reminds her of my brother.

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,590
Why do I feel

599
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,260
something is wrong with your brother recently?

600
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,260
Does he still like her?

601
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,150
No way.

602
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,380
My brother must have hated her so much.

603
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,840
How could he like her?

604
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,780
You don't understand.

605

I've arranged so many blind dates

for your brother these years.

607
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,780
Either he said he was too busy

608
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,460
to go on dates,

609
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
or he went on the dates

610
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
and said he didn't fall for the girls.

611
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,660
No way.

612
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,140
Even if my brother is single all his life,

613
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,380
he can't be with her.

614
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:04,900
Has he forgotten

615
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,140
how badly he was hurt?

616
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,740

No way.
