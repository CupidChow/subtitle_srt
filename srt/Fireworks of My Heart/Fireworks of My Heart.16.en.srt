00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,110
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,960
Our recent rescues have revealed

5
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,479
many shortcomings,

6
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,780
especially with regard to medical rescue.

7
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:49,140
What do you guys think?

8
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,500
Let’s talk about it.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,300
Supervisor.

10
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,020
Here's the thing.

11
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,460
If it's just stopping bleeding or bandaging,

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,740
we can definitely manage.

13
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,170
Right?

14
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Yes.

15
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,289
But when it comes to

16
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,100
more complicated wounds,

17
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,500
how are we supposed to deal?

18
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,540
Besides,

19
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,660
it's not a firefighter's job

20
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,060
to treat injuries.

21
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,420
More importantly, we don't know how.

22
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,980
Supervisor, Chief.

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,900
I have an idea.

24
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:09,500
Go ahead.

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,740
Can we

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,170
discuss with the medical unit

27
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,180
to have the ambulance arrive at the scene

28
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,300
when the firetruck arrives?

29
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,420
The injured can only

30
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,300
receive prompt treatment

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,540
when professional doctors and nurses are around.

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,530
Supervisor.

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,410
We have thought about

34
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,579
Dapeng's idea before.

35
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,500
For example, when we arrive at the scene

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,380
see people who are injured,

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,450
we call 120.

38
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,290
That's no problem at all.

39
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,540
But for ambulances to remain on standby every day

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,060
and go on missions

41
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,740
with us

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,620
isn't realistic.

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,420
After all, we're not under the same system.

44
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,140
What's the use of saying all that?

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,940
He's right.

46
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,180
What do you think?

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,500
We encounter many complicated situations

48
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,460
at rescue sites.

49
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,820
It's not hard

50
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:45,940
to think of ideas.

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,820
It's too hard to implement them.

52
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,060
It's worth doing difficult things.

53
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,780
I want to try.

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,010
Training!

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,660
Come on.

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,820
Let's go.

57
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,460
It's too hot.

58
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,340
Let's go.

[Request to Establish a Joint Firefighting and Medical Rescue Team]

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,220
You want to set up a joint firefighting and medical

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,820
rescue team.

62
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,420
Is this a spontaneous idea

63
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,110
or something you've been thinking about for a while?

64
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:23,980
Commissar.

65
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,340
During the shanty town fire,

66
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,180
the call we received said

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,340
that it's a demolition area

68
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
where no one lives.

69
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,820
But when we arrived at the scene,

70
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,940
we still found a child

71
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,180
who was severely injured.

72
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,060
After we

73
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,460
gave her emergency treatment,

74
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,860
we sent her to the hospital.

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,180
A few days ago,

76
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,060
we found a traveler

77
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,860
deep in the mountains

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,850
who was severely injured.

79
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,500
We had to use a satellite phone

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,980
to ask for help from a doctor.

81
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,100
These two incidents

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
really affected me.

83
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,260
If there had been medical staff

84
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
alongside us,

85
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,660
we could have managed the incidents

86
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,500
more efficiently,

87
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,300
and also have reduced

88
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,100
casualties.

89
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,530
I have been thinking about this recently,

90
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,660
but also for a long time.

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,940
If a doctor could

92
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
give prompt treatment at the scene,

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,060
that would be best.

94
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,020
However, the medical and firefighting departments

95
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,060
are separate right now.

96
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,019
There is a certain time lag

97
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,540
in our coordination.

98
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,660
But it's also

99
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,740
under control.

100
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,340
If we can conduct more rescue trainings

101
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,220
for the doctors,

102
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,420
we can also

103
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,580
promote the collaboration

104
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,740
between the two departments.

105
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,690
That's a good thing.

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,100
Your suggestion

107
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,340
is good,

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,740
but

109
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,659
for doctors and firefighters

110
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,340
to enter the scene at the same time

111
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,930
is no joke.

112
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,780
How can we improve their ability

113
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,100
to adapt to conditions at the scene

114
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,900
and ensure their safety?

115
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,820
Have you thought about that?

116
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
Let firefighters conduct targeted training

117
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,260
for the medical workers

118
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,060
to set rules for safety.

119
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,380
It seems you're confident

120
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,850
about the training.

121
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,900
By the way,

122
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,180
I have a proposal.

123
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,320
You came well-prepared.

124
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,940
You've always wanted to work on the ground.

125
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,380
I was afraid you wouldn't adapt to the new place.

126
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,140
How is it?

127
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,780
How's your partnership with Song Yan?

128
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,130
He helped me a lot

129
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,730
and is very supportive.

130
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,580
I know his temper the best.

131
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,240
It's not easy for you to partner together.

132
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,620
Alright.

133
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,020
As for your proposal,

134
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,780
I will request for approval from my superiors

135
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,980
to make Shilitai Station

136
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,250
a testing unit

137
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,659
for cooperation with the city hospital.

138
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,570
Thank you, Commissar.

[Internal Medicine] [Infectious Diseases] [Respiratory Disease Center]

140
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,340
Thank you

141
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,260
for specially making the trip here.

142
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,700
I hope our departments

143
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
will have a successful cooperation.

144
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,980
Also,

145
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,180
you should consider

146
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,490
a media report.

147
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,970
It's publicity after all.

148
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,460
Thank you, Deputy President Liu.

149
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,180
See you.

150
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,330
See you.

151
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,580
They only do projects to look good.

152
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,060
But it's fine as long as

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,300
it doesn't interfere with us doing real work.

154
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,580
What work?

155
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,020
I've never agreed with the plan

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,340
to set up a joint rescue team.

157
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,820
I stand by my position.

158
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,100
The doctors and nurses

159
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,300
are not familiar with fires.

160
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,060
They can't operate practically there.

161
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,140
We didn't say

162
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,620
they must enter the scene of the fire.

163
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,220
Can't I train them well

164
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,450
to watch out for their safety?

165
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,940
It's easy for you to say.

166
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,659
Are the doctors and nurses

167
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
in the hospital's system

168
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,659
or the fire station's?

169
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,900
If there's a conflict between the work

170
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,820
in the hospital and the fire station,

171
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,980
what are they supposed to prioritize?

172
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,340
That's why I always say

173
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,260
you're idealistic.

174
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,980
I'm not idealistic.

175
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,500
Let's try it out first.

176
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,180
Let's some professional medical staff

177
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,060
to cooperate with the firefighters.

178
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,180
Isn't that good?

179
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,420
You're getting more and more far-fetched.

180
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Let's get back to the point.

181
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,100
Now that the joint rescue team has been formed,

182
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,180
it needs you to guide—

183
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,820
Sorry.

184
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,090
What a coincidence.

185
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,140
Why are you here?

186
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,900
We

187
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,020
came down

188
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,020
because of the joint rescue team.

189
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,540
Let me introduce.

190
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,780
Song Yan, our Station Chief.

191
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,510
Do you know each other?

192
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,100
No.
Yes.

193
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Yes, I do.
No.

Welcome!

This is our dormitory.

Please have a look around.

423
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,740
Your men's dormitory

424
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,380
is so neat.

425
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,900
This is totally different

426
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,860
from our on-call room.

427
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,140
You say that,

428
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,180
but it's all because of you.

429
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,340
I heard you guys don't take your socks off

430
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,020
when you sleep. Is that true?

431
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,420
It's not that bad.

432
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,820
But once the siren rings,

no matter what you're doing,

434
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,540
you must put your shoes on and go.

That sounds tiring.

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,100
By the way,

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,140
you don't have any sundries?

438

Yes.

439
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,020
We kept them away

440
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,980
in the cabinet.

441
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,220

the "Panpan" you stuck on it

443
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,300

Are you shy?

447
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,530
No.

448
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,380
We're just

449
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,730
checking out the dorm.

450
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,260
Why are you shy?

451
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,090
You're quite pure.

452
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,980

461
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,910
This?

462
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,420
This is for us to go downstairs conveniently

463
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,620
when we get dispatched.

464
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,300
It's a product of the history of firefighting.

left during the fire brigade era.

467
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,260
But now,

for the sake of safety,

469
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,050

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,020
You shouldn't do this.

474
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,010
Did you forget your leg is injured?

475
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,500
Let me do it.

is to make rescues more efficient,

First,

When you arrive,

569
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,340
you must follow all instructions

and appear higher than the other side.

959
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,260
As long as these two symptoms occur,

960
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,060
we need to perform aspiration immediately.

961
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,420
In an emergency,

962
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,740
you can use a thick needle

963
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,780
to make a puncture

964
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,530
at the intersection between

965
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,300
the second intercostal space and the collar bone.

966
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,490
You can come and try.

967
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,060
Well, I...

968
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,010
Not you.

969
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,660
Supervisor, you first.

970
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,380
Okay.

971
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,580
Hurry up.

972
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,540
This is the first intercostal space.

973
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,940
This is the second intercostal space.

974
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,540
The intersection is here.

975
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,300
Good. Next.

976
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,820
Let me do it.

977
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,710
Sorry, Chief.

978
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,700
Collarbone.

979
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,140
Here. Here, right?

980
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,020
This is the first rib.

981
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,250
This is the second rib.

982
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,060
I've got it.

983
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,690
Alright.

984
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,900
That's all for the demonstration.

985
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,340
I haven’t…

986
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Why did he leave?

987
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,240
The teaching aid is gone.

988
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,660
Chief Song has such a nice body.

989
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,890
You're too boy-crazy.

990
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,380
Calm down.

991
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,250
Why did he run away?

992
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,460
Come, Pipi.

993
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,620
You're the dummy now. Take off your shirt.

994
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,700
I shouldn't...

995
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,380
Come on.

996
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,620
Let's clap for him!
