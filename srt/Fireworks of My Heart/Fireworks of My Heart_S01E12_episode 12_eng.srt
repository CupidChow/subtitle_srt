2
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,712
   

3
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:37,225
   

4
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:39,974
   

5
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,180
 Let's leave the country.  

6
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,133
 Let's go abroad together, Qin Qin. 

7
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,134
 We'll never come back here. Okay? 

8
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,509
 Bye, Brother. 

9
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,539
Excuse me, did you call for a designated driver?

10
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,182
You have three years of driving experience?

11
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:21,068
I've been working as a part-time designated driver for three years.

12
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,423
Don't worry. I drive very steadily.

13
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,906
I always get five-star ratings.

14
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,016
Are you not going to work at the bar anymore?

15
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:29,978
I just got off work.

16
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,013
Did you just graduate?

17
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,080
I'm in my senior year.

18
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,134
You have quite a few part-time jobs.

19
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,834
I want to pay off my student loan as soon as possible.

20
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,193
I'll park the car here for you.

21
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:04,344
Give me the payment QR code.

22
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,369
No need, you can make the payment on the platform.

23
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,658
I know. I want your WeChat payment QR code.

24
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,332
It's getting late. Take a cab home.

25
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,832
The car key.

26
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,129
Watch out.

27
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,133
Be safe.

28
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,045
Where is my chessboard?

29
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,687
Who let you touch it?

30
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,042
Can't I touch it?

31
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,944
You can touch it.

32
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,844
But you should ask me first.

33
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,836
Sorry, I won't make the same mistake next time.

34
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,589
Do you also like playing checkers?

35
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,891
We should play together if we have the opportunity.

36
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,050
My skills are decent.

37
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,797
We can also play Chinese chess.

38
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:26,040
Captain Song, do you usually conduct bed inspections?

39
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,120
I'll accompany you to inspect tomorrow.

40
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,140
I can observe and learn along the way.

41
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,763
Good night.

42
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,070
   
   

43
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,160
- Instructor. 
 - Instructor.

44
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,834
Hello, Instructor.

45
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,279
This is your break time.

46
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,045
Yes, it's our break time. That's why we're working out to relax.

47
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,299
It's a great stress reliever, Instructor. Let's exercise together.

48
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,482
Exercise with us, Instructor.

49
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,607
 Exercise with us. 

50
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:10,959
He's shocked. Let's continue.

51
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,199
Go on with your workout.

52
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,159
- Pi Pi, turn on the music. 
 - Music!

53
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,139
What did you say?

54
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,809
I think you're putting too much pressure on them.

55
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,160
They train during the day and exercise at night.

56
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,814
Their body never gets to rest.

57
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,742
Everything needs to be done in moderation.

58
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:39,023
I think you should reduce their volume of training.

59
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,224
If you have nothing to do, there are files over there.

60
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,024
Go read them.

61
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,695
It can't go on like this.

62
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,298
They can't achieve good results with an exhausted body.

63
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,935
Scientific training requires rest.

64
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,420
The on-site situation

65
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,000
is much more complex, difficult and dangerous than on the training field.

66
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,448
If they don't train hard, they will die in real combat.

67
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,179
Be harsh to yourself.

68
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,719
This tradition is deeply ingrained in Shili Tai.

69
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,886
I know it's deeply ingrained in Shili Tai.

70
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,192
Do you think I never did any research before I came? I read the materials.

71
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:19,760
The new recruits' physical fitness test ranked second in the city.

72
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,394
They ranked third in the training assessment.

73
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,599
Doesn't that indicate the problem?

74
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,136
The training at Shili Tai isn't about achieving good results in the assessments.

75
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,438
If we waste time on fixed subjects,

76
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,651
how is this any different from exam-orientated education?

77
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,043
Courage,

78
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,495
bravery,

79
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,840
and the will to withstand pressure.

80
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,060
These are the intangible things that they need to train.

81
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,892
Lin Hao, where is it?

82
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:56,730
The car by the roadside. Go and take a look.

83
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,230
Okay.

84
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,300
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

85
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,399
Do you have something for us?

86
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,159
- Yes. 
 - What is it?

87
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,759
- Don't you know? 
 - We have no idea.

88
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,607
Take a look at it.

89
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,498
There's so much.

90
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:09,523
We can't take all of this.

91
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,745
Da Peng, go get Pi Pi, Xiao Ge and the others.

92
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,645
Okay.

93
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,683
It's still warm. You guys are fast.

94
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,879
We're delivering food to you. Of course, we need to be fast.

95
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,559
Brothers, we have additional food!

96
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,559
Guys!

97
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:24,968
You guys eat.

98
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:27,188
It's still cold.

99
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:29,473
Take it yourself.

100
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:32,360
- Hurry up. 
 - No need to fight.

101
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,368
Having a passive attitude toward meals is a problem.

102
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,028
- It smells good. 
 - Help yourself.

103
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,600
Captain!

104
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,480
Captain, Instructor, come over and eat with us.

105
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,008
- Yes, eat it while it's hot. 
 - You guys eat.

106
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,954
Captain, you have to eat it.

107
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:47,279
It's all thanks to you. A supporter sent this to us.

108
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,349
What?

109
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:53,860
She mentioned you by name and thanked you for saving her at the mall last time.

110
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,365
Yes, she even sent several boxes of lemonade.

111
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,624
It's still cold.

112
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,624
Captain.

113
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,429
What are you doing?

114
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,964
The fire station has regulations.

115
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:07,698
You can't accept gifts and presents from the public. Don't you know this?

116
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,343
Next time.

117
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,114
We'll strictly adhere to it next time.

118
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,600
Isn't there a rule in our fire station that

119
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,729
it's prohibited to waste food?

120
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,769
Wasting is shameful.

121
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,639
He's gone. Give it to me.

122
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,759
 - Thank you, Instructor. 
 - Thank you, Instructor. 

123
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Thank you, Captain Song.

124
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,000
 Thank you, Captain Song! 

125
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,043
 Hello. 

126
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,039
Song Yan?

127
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,911
Why did you take the initiative to call me today?

128
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,720
How's the food? Do you like it?

129
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,050
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

130
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,054
Zhan Xiao Rao, I made it very clear to you that night.

131
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't send anything over.

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,912
It's my choice whether to send it or not.

133
00:12:04,912 --> 00:12:06,559
It's your attitude whether to accept it or not.

134
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,620
If you don't like it, just throw it in the trash can.

135
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,017
Do you think wasting food is a small matter?

136
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:17,040
Are you angry?

137
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,000
I really think you're great.

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,919
I want to develop a relationship with you.

139
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:23,320
You and Xu Qin are friends, right?

140
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,911
She's my first love.

141
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,888
Let's go.

142
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,568
What brings you here?

143
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,900
- What's wrong? 
 - Take it.

144
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,310
I need to read 20 pages of a book tonight. I have to work tomorrow. I can't drink.

145
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,375
You focus on your book as I drink my wine.

146
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,919
What's wrong?

147
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,427
If you want to drink, why don't you go to Xiao Yi Xiao?

148
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,200
Why would I look for him? I want to settle with you!

149
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Me? What did I do?

150
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,199
What did you do?

151
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,980
Is Song Yan your ex-boyfriend?

152
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,042
He told you that?

153
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,849
That's uncool of you. You didn't even tell me.

154
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:33,240
I didn't know how to tell you.

155
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,720
Use your lips, seriously...

156
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,287
Sorry.

157
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:50,939
Forget it.

158
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:54,679
Once we finish this drink, we'll move on from this matter.

159
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:00,941
You told me you liked him so much.

160
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,240
Are you're not pursuing him anymore?

161
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,879
I won't get involved with my best friend's boyfriend and her ex.

162
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,906
This is my bottom line.

163
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,583
Why are you laughing?

164
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,085
Did you not take me as your best friend?

165
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,719
You act as if we've been friends for very long.

166
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,153
But I feel like he still likes you.

167
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,769
Do you still like him too?

168
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,270
Why don't you two get back together?

169
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,559
We haven't seen each other for 10 years.

170
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,159
That doesn't matter. You're both single.

171
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,760
Childhood sweethearts, rekindling the past. It's perfect.

172
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,399
You don't have any other ex-boyfriends, do you?

173
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't have any ex-boyfriends. He's the only one.

174
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,091
You've only had one boyfriend?

175
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,100
I didn't have anyone before him. I didn't have anyone after him either.

176
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,815
Then what are you waiting for? Life is too short not to love.

177
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,033
Hurry up.

178
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,211
It's hard to explain in a few words.

179
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,820
Is it because your family doesn't approve of it?

180
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,039
Our parents are all the same.

181
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,039
They say it's for your own good.

182
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,883
But it's just an excuse to cover up their desire for control.

183
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,840
I won't let them have their way.

184
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,559
If parents are being unreasonable, I'll be even worse than them.

185
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,960
Create a fuss a couple of times, and they will know your bottom line.

186
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,420
I've heard about your mom's temper.

187
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:28,495
What can you do?

188
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,915
I'm not as brave as you.

189
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:34,957
I can only accumulate strength slowly to change their mindset.

190
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:38,237
If I can become a deputy chief physician this time,

191
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,040
my salary will increase.

192
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,080
At least I can achieve some financial independence.

193
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,912
You have to be mentally prepared.

194
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,791
It's not easy to change their mindset.

195
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,516
All the best!

196
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,016
All the best!

197
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,960
What do you think of the new instructor?

198
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,528
I think Captain Song doesn't like him.

199
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,449
He's definitely closer to Brother Jun.

200
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,101
I don't like him, either.

201
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,801
Why?

202
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,707
It's just a gut feeling.

203
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,726
Your gut feeling means nothing.

204
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,411
Stop blabbering here.

205
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,011
Go to sleep.

206
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,713
Go to sleep.

207
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Go to sleep.

208
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,791
You got kicked.

209
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,287
   

210
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,787
Quick.

211
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:10,624
Dress right, dress.

212
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:12,160
Eyes front.

213
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,300
Stand at ease.

214
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
Stand at attention.

215
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,680
Vice-Captain, Squad Three has assembled.

216
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,642
Eight people are present. Please give your order.

217
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,085
- Join the squad.
 - Yes, Sir.

218
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,881
Today, we're running 20 kilometers (~12.5 miles).

219
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,652
Everyone must pay attention to safety, okay?

220
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,917
You must follow the designated route.

221
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,657
 Yes, Sir! 

222
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:42,034
Instructor, why are you here?

223
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:44,053
To run with everyone.

224
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,400
Instructor, we're carrying heavy loads for 20 kilometers and also going uphill.

225
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,503
Let's take a breath of fresh air together.

226
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,905
- Let's go! 
 - Okay, Jun Ping.

227
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,141
- Depart now. 
 - Turn to the right!

228
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,619
Left turn, run.

229
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,400
One, one, one, two, one.

230
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,121
 One, one, one, two, one. 

231
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:06,904
One, one, one, two, one.

232
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:08,281
Can the instructor make it?

233
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,085
No way, I bet 5 kilometers   (~3.1 miles) .

234
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,208
He won't make it back.

235
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,960
Quick! Catch up with the squad.

236
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,413
Slow down.

237
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:46,113
Jun Ping, quick!

238
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,039
What is this?

239
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,358
Da Peng, not bad.

240
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,392
Da Peng.

241
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,758
Da Peng! Not bad!

242
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,800
- Pi Pi! 
 - You're going to fail soon. Hurry up!

243
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,836
Okay.

244
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:07,979
Oh my God.

245
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,440
Not bad. The results are still okay.

246
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,579
But compared to our time, you're way worse.

247
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,319
Jun Ping, what's the matter with you? You're even worse than the new recruit.

248
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,480
No, Vice-Captain, isn't it my job to keep them safe?

249
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,419
- Cut it out. 
 - Da Peng, where's the instructor?

250
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,680
He ran out of energy when he was climbing the mountain.

251
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,993
We tried to support him, but he refused.

252
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,880
Instructor has never run 20 kilometers. And he even carried heavy equipment.

253
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,544
- None of you waited for him? 
 - I...

254
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:35,526
All right, I bet he's worn out from running. We'll wait for a bit, it's okay.

255
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,936
I knew he couldn't handle it from the start.

256
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,200
- What do we do if something happens? 
 - He'll be fine. He's a grown-up.

257
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,706
Wait for a bit.

258
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,160
All right, guys. You may fall out. Have a good rest.

259
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,910
- Okay. 
 - Okay, Vice-Captain.

260
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,920
Take it easy.

261
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,147
Pi Pi, eat a bit more for lunch.

262
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,039
You're too skinny.

263
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,215
Thank you, Squad Leader.

264
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,355
- Let's go. 
 - Hurry up.

265
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,339
Bye, Vice-Captain.

266
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:02,954
Is this okay?

267
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:04,754
It's okay.

268
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,039
Oh my God.

269
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,218
It's so late, why isn't he back yet? His stamina is really bad.

270
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:26,220
It's getting dark.

271
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,769
Stop waiting.

272
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,089
- Captain. 
 - Captain.

273
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,329
- Call him. 
 - Okay.

274
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:37,763
The call got through. No one answered.

275
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,600
Take the car. Bring him back.

276
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,100
Okay.

277
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,693
Captain.

278
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,820
- Yang Chi. 
 - Yes, Sir.

279
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,055
No need to go.

280
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,555
He's back.

281
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,602
- Jiang Yi. 
 - Yes, Sir.

282
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,042
- Take good care of the instructor. 
 - Yes, Sir.

283
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,175
You've worked hard, Instructor.

284
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,621
Instructor, have a sip of warm water.

285
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,951
Instructor, take it easy.

286
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:27,359
The previous instructor must be excellent, right?

287
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,743
I've heard about him.

288
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:33,143
Yes, Brother Jun is very nice.

289
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:35,881
Do you all

290
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:40,420
hate me?

291
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
Not really.

292
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,324
How should I put it?

293
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:47,976
Instructor, let me tell you the truth, don't get angry.

294
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:52,383
Do you feel like you're part of our team?

295
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,357
I think

296
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:59,096
Song Yan and I have disagreements.

297
00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:00,841
"Disagreements"?

298
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,279
What do you mean?

299
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,359
He's too rigid and too harsh.

300
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,440
Instructor, you have to think the other way around.

301
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,419
He can't be lenient.

302
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,879
The value of life is above everything else.

303
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:19,459
Captain is highly sentimental.

304
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,699
But he doesn't express it.

305
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:23,359
As for his strictness,

306
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,920
it's definitely for discipline.

307
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,680
This fire station is like being at war.

308
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,060
Discipline is above all else.

309
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,911
What was

310
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,406
the former instructor like?

311
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:38,904
In the past,

312
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,781
one emphasized discipline, the other one valued emotions.

313
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,062
Instructor!

314
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:46,301
   

315
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,684
 It's now 10:13 p.m. 

316
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,643
 The temperature is 30.3 degrees Celsius (~86.5 F). 

317
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,430
Thank you.

318
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:49,243
Mom, what brings you here?

319
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,809
It's been a long time since I've been here.

320
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:57,426
I happened to pass by today. So I came up to take a look.

321
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,744
It's pretty good.

322
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:06,745
It's pretty clean.

323
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:14,668
I bought dinner for you.

324
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,464
I'm leaving.

325
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,864
Mom.

326
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:25,700
Were you thinking that there is another person at home?

327
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,015
No.

328
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:32,190
You won't do

329
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:36,600
anything that would make me sad.

330
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,841
You're right. I won't.

331
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:47,376
I've been thinking these past few days.

332
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:52,735
Can I stop being like this from now on?

333
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:54,626
Can I

334
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:58,056
be bold for once?

335
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:07,579
When your brother paid a fine to the bank, I knew something was off.

336
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:11,885
Is it that guy with the last name, Song?

337
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,160
The parents behave improperly, and their son follows suit.

338
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,526
Not a single person in that family has good character.

339
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:19,133
Mom.

340
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:23,059
You don't have to attack him like that.

341
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:25,163
Right now,

342
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:28,183
I have nothing to do with him.

343
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,964
Do you want to have something to do with him?

344
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,976
If that's the case, then you should go abroad.

345
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,580
Mom,

346
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,888
I feel very sad.

347
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:42,304
You know what?

348
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,184
He came to my house a few days ago.

349
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,060
He was there.

350
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,079
He made porridge for me.

351
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,359
I've been living here alone for such a long time.

352
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,720
It was the first time I felt at home.

353
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,319
But that feeling quickly disappeared

354
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,969
when he left.

355
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:01,520
I really wanted to ask him to stay.

356
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,303
But I didn't dare to do so.

357
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:07,508
Because you were afraid that I'd be upset. So you want to convince me first.

358
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:08,633
Mom...

359
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:11,513
You should dispel this thought as soon as possible.

360
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:17,047
I already told you. Don't go against your parents for an outsider.

361
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:19,808
He doesn't have to be an outsider.

362
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:23,816
Just a bowl of porridge?

363
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:27,849
It was just a bowl of porridge, and you can't stop thinking about it.

364
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,909
Your dad was worried you'd work too hard.

365
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:33,633
He bought an apartment near the hospital for you.

366
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:34,833
He bought you a car.

367
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,337
And the best hospital,

368
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,936
including the best team of physicians to guide you.

369
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:45,009
I joined this hospital based on my own abilities.

370
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,215
Don't be silly, Kid.

371
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,056
That's because your last name is Meng.

372
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,368
You don't have to know about the ways of the world.

373
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:55,007
You don't have to please Assistant Director Liu.

374
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:57,484
You can do whatever you want.

375
00:30:57,484 --> 00:31:00,321
It's because your family has got your back.

376
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:02,025
Look at your dad and brother.

377
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:06,079
For the sake of this family, they are facing all kinds of pressures every day.

378
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,268
They work hard.

379
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:09,968
But you?

380
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,639
For this little bit of affection,

381
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,712
a bowl of porridge, you act as if you're on the verge of dying.

382
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,592
You forget the gratitude toward your parents.

383
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:25,018
I remember it. Of course, I remember it, Mom.

384
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,621
That's why I've been restraining myself.

385
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:31,647
I've been in pain. I don't want to make you sad.

386
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,529
Qin Qin.

387
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,359
I don't ask for anything from you.

388
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,703
All I want

389
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:50,343
is that you can be an obedient child.

390
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,565
Okay. Dress right, dress.

391
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,983
Look forward.

392
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,583
Stand at ease.

393
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:04,926
For the new recruit assessment, you must get a good grade.

394
00:32:04,926 --> 00:32:07,380
Captain said that if you don't get good grades,

395
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,663
you have to pack and leave.

396
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:10,792
Do you have confidence?

397
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:11,895
 Yes! 

398
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:13,098
Will you embarrass Shili Tai?

399
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,933
 Yes! 

400
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,633
"Yes"?

401
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:18,338
 No! 

402
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:20,427
- Louder! 
  - No! 

403
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:22,127
Set off.

404
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:48,484
   

405
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:25,136
   

406
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,160
Even if I have a limp, we still get the highest total score.

407
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,642
Tell me, how should we celebrate?

408
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,187
- That's right! 
 - Let's celebrate.

409
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:31,643
But it's your treat.

410
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,214
- You guys are so weak. 
 - We treat you?

411
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:34,720
You came in in first place, and we have to treat you?

412
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,596
Are you kidding me?

413
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:38,920
Slow down.

414
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,160
- This way. 
 - Slow down.

415
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,887
- Come, watch out. 
 - Quick.

416
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,384
Slow down.

417
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:45,040
Okay.

418
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,392
Indeed.

419
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,760
What do you think, Da Peng?

420
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,931
What do you mean?

421
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,369
If you don't treat us...

422
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:57,804
Don't touch that!

423
00:33:57,804 --> 00:33:59,512
Don't take them from me!

424
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:01,041
They're all my babies.

425
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,119
Take care of your injuries.

426
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,440
 All of you are taking the opportunity to steal my things. 

427
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,240
 Do you know how expensive they are? 

428
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,039
 They're all my babies. 

429
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:10,679
You've snatched them all. You guys are over the line.

430
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,979
What's wrong?

431
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,937
- Instructor... 
  - Hello, Instructor. 

432
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:19,119
Instructor, I'm left with an empty box.

433
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,311
They've snatched them all.

434
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:23,197
Da Peng, how's your leg?

435
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:26,034
I applied some medicine to it. It's much better now.

436
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:29,373
Take it easy.

437
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,226
Instructor, we didn't embarrass Captain today, right?

438
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:35,490
Of course not.

439
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,855
You guys performed very well.

440
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,719
I think he's happy. He's elated secretly.

441
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,952
Can you take this opportunity

442
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:47,480
to ask Captain to let us go to the fire scene sooner?

443
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,987
 - Yes. 
 - Yes, Instructor. 

444
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,263
No way. We have to follow the rules and regulations.

445
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:54,840
You've been waiting for so long. Just wait a little longer.

446
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,345
It's almost there.

447
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,079
These regulations are unreasonable.

448
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,105
That's right. We're so capable now.

449
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:02,236
Why don't you talk to him yourselves?

450
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:04,927
Forget it. I'm afraid of being scolded.

451
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:07,280
Is he that scary?

452
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,309
 Yes! 

453
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,578
- Song Yan. 
 - It's not negotiable.

454
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:15,659
I think the performance of the new recruits in the assessment is really outstanding.

455
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:19,555
Some fire missions can be handed over to them.

456
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,360
It can also accelerate the transition between the new and old members of the fire station.

457
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,780
A fire scene is not an amusement park.

458
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,526
Passing the assessment only shows that their technical skills meet the standard.

459
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:32,059
Their ability to respond on the spot, psychological resilience and mental willpower

460
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,160
still need to be trained.

461
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,471
That's why they need practical experience and missions to accelerate their growth.

462
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:41,519
Once you've learned the word "sacrifice," come to me to ask for another chance.

463
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,145
Sometimes a sacrifice is avoidable.

464
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:46,679
Under current technological conditions,

465
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,781
the safety factor has greatly improved.

466
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,294
In the fire at a high-rise apartment in Dongjiang,

467
00:35:52,294 --> 00:35:53,395
there were two casualties.

468
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:58,425
The chemical plant explosion at Liaoning, four casualties.

469
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:02,533
The fire at Mountain 625 at Shannan, 17 casualties.

470
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,792
Their average age is less than 22 years old.

471
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:11,957
Sacrifice is indeed not a tradition,

472
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,359
but it's the reality this team

473
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,680
has to face.

474
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,762
I actually don't understand.

475
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:31,409
With your family background,

476
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:33,126
you can get opportunities anywhere.

477
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,495
Why do you have to come here to create trouble?

478
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,608
What's that supposed to mean?

479
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,666
Do you think I'm here to enhance my resume?

480
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,719
What's wrong with my family background?

481
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,740
Captain Song, I think this is reverse discrimination.

482
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,000
Can't I love this profession?

483
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,200
I like this profession. I want to do something for this profession, can't I?

484
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:54,366
Yes, I know.

485
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,389
It's hard for you to accept me emotionally.

486
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:59,369
I'm here to take over from Instructor Suo.

487
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,824
There are many things that I can't empathize with you like he did,

488
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:05,491
or have a tacit understanding with you.

489
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:09,272
But we can develop that over time.

490
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:12,933
I just want you to know one thing.

491
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,533
I'm

492
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:17,922
not here to fool around.

493
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,608
   

494
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:52,485
Are you still selling cosmetics?

495
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,593
These are small, cheap brands.

496
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:56,809
These are authentic products.

497
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:59,713
I've been fined so much money, I need to make up for it.

498
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:03,209
Right, do you know any quick ways to make money?

499
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:06,185
I really need to earn money now.

500
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,856
When I find a way to make money, we can make money together.

501
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,091
Thanks, Sister.

502
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:13,358
Do you need money that badly?

503
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,327
We're graduating soon, and I feel anxious.

504
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,963
Besides, our major is very niche.

505
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,798
The wages are low.

506
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,570
I'm not a local like you guys.

507
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,029
If I want to stay here after graduation, I won't even be able to afford the rent.

508
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:32,329
Find a rich boyfriend then.

509
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:33,553
You know what?

510
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:37,856
Wu Qing Qing in the next dormitory found one.

511
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:39,971
That kind of guy.

512
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,321
No wonder.

513
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,790
The last time I saw her, she was carrying a Chanel bag.

514
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,507
I thought it was fake.

515
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:46,753
It's authentic.

516
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:48,641
Doesn't she feel unethical about it?

517
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:50,625
Who knows?

518
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,192
Girls, can we have some ambition?

519
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:55,736
When it comes to making money, we should rely on ourselves.

520
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,665
Relying on a boyfriend is useless.

521
00:38:57,665 --> 00:38:59,070
Just wait and see.

522
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,498
I, Zhai Miao, will definitely become a boss through my own efforts.

523
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:05,574
Boss, I wish you success soon.

524
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:06,639
Okay.

525
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,043
I'll hold hands with the boss.

526
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,543
Come.

527
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:11,289
You can hold this hand.

528
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:13,590
Thank you, Boss.

529
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:00,913
Ye Zi.

530
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:04,023
This is your campus card, right?

531
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,504
- So you picked it up. 
  - No.

532
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,490
Someone picked it up and sent it here.

533
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,284
Who sent it here?

534
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:13,168
A young man. He was wearing a suit.

535
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,745
He's quite handsome.

536
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,959
Auntie, when did he send it?

537
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,361
He just here moment ago.

538
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:20,061
Thanks, Auntie.

539
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:25,457
Wait!

540
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,068
Thanks.

541
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:33,668
Don't mention it.

542
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,626
You said it's your dream to be a firefighter.

543
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:01,126
Is that true?

544
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,013
Of course.

545
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,672
Have you watched "Burning Flame"?

546
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,436
No.

547
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:17,990
You want to do well in this field, to make a difference.

548
00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:21,314
I'm touched.

549
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:24,718
Logically speaking,

550
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:27,264
you have plenty of choices and opportunities to try different things.

551
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:31,223
Any other profession is more glamorous than this one.

552
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:37,058
But I happen to like this profession.

553
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:41,466
If I can make some pioneering changes,

554
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,503
that would be even better.

555
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,175
What's wrong?

556
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,278
I envy you.

557
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,952
These kinds of words...

558
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:58,372
you can say it so easily.

559
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:02,923
I meant it.

560
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:08,133
Indeed. I'm being a bit audacious.

561
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:10,919
Your parents must be very supportive of you, right?

562
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:15,856
My mother supports me in everything.

563
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:19,389
My dad isn't exactly like that.

564
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:22,173
But he said, no matter what I do,

565
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,753
I just need to be a man of integrity.

566
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:26,739
That's what matters.

567
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,500
Your dad also supports you, right?

568
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:35,783
He's also a man of integrity.
