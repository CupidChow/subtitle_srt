1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,670
You're back.

3
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,590
Doctor Xu, you're back.

4
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,150
Doctor Xu.

5
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,470
You did great today.

6
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,990
You saved the patient from a myocardial infarction.

7
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,110
I was just doing what I always do.

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,430
The patient's family

9
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,830
has been thanking you.

10
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,710
You must have experienced a sense of accomplishment

11
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,910
for being a doctor this time.

12
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,110
The family has thanked you sincerely.

13
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,310
Aren't you touched?

14
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,630
They'll forget it soon.

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,870
Of course not.

16
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,270
If the police save you,

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,630
will you forget it soon too?

18
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,670
Yes, I will.

19
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,030
Humans are forgetful animals.

20
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,670
Have you seen any patient

21
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,829
who has gone back

22
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,190
comes to thank the doctor again?

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,110
What a weirdo.

24
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,590
Bye, Team Leader.

25
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,630
Bye, Team Leader.

26
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,430
Bye.

27
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,710
Actually, I think

28
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,270
it'd be enough for them to thank once.

29
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,470
Besides,

30
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,510
don't you feel proud

31
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,790
when receiving gratitude from the patients and their families?

32
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,550
To me,

33
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,270
it's my job to cure patients.

34
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,390
So you think

35
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,910
you are doing your job

36
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,310
and you don't need others to show their gratitude?

37
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,030
I think your attitude

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,310
is quite innovative.

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,910
Whether they're grateful or not

40
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,510
is the patients' choice.

41
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,350
It won't affect my attitude.

42
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,470
Medical science, as a science subject,

43
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,510
has its limitations.

44
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,070
If a patient's condition

45
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,390
exceeds what medical science can cover,

46
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,950
even the most high-skilled doctor

47
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,790
can do nothing about it.

48
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,630
You are an ordinary person.

49
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,990
You don't have superpowers.

50
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,910
This is reality.

51
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,790
Dr. Xu,

52
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,230
you are really

53
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,390
an unlikeable doctor.

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,390
It's already enough

55
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,150
for our hospital to have

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,070
a likeable doctor like Dr. Yang.

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,430
There's no need for me to be likeable.

58
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,310
Xu Qin.

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,910
What do you mean?

60
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,150
Are you mocking me?

61
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,190
I'm sincerely praising you.

62
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,150
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,590
I'm so busy.

64
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,310
I miss you.

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,870
I happened to be passing by

66
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,910
so I came to see you.

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,710
Can I trust you?

68
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,070
Really.

69
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,829
I haven't seen you for two days. I miss you so much.

70
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,990
I just want to chat with you.

71
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,990
I'm busy.

72
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,829
Go play with yourself.

73
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,630
I got something to talk about with you.

74
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,630
I need your help.

75
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,230
What else can I do for you?

76
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,510
I'm working on a project.

77
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,310
I want to ask you for investment.

78
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,790
Are you kidding me?

79
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,550
Don't you have money?

80
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,550
To be honest,

81
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,230
I am doing this

82
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:42,990
for my ex-girlfriend.

83
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,790
Zhan Xiaorao.

84
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,830
You know,

85
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,310
she hasn't done anything serious

86
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,030
for the past two years.

87
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,310
So I...

88
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,790
So you want me

89
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,190
to be a pushover?

90
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,510
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,190
You're a big investor.

92
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,390
Right?

93
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,110
Give us some tips.

94
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,750
Mainly,

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,190
I want us, a few fellow friends,

96
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,790
to do something together.

97
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,990
How awesome it is.

98
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,670
How much does she want?

99
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,230
I can lend money to her privately.

100
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,710
But I won't participate in the business.

101
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm not interested in

102
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,350
such a small project.

103
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,590
You...

104
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,510
I have something else to do.

105
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,150
Take your leave now.

106
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,830
At least I need to finish my tea.

107
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,070
Drink it yourself.

108
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,990
Recently, Qin...

109
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,070
Get to the point if you want to say something.

110
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,990
Get out if you have nothing to say.

111
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,310
Didn't you say you were busy?

112
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,030
Now you're free?

113
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,550
She met with Song Yan.

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,430
Aren't you afraid that

115
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,950
they would rekindle the past romance?

116
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,510
She won't.

117
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,510
You're right.

118
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,550
With Aunt Fu

119
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,310
taking control of the situation,

120
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,670
she will only be

121
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,150
more and more depressed.

122
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,950
So I'm worried that

123
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,310
something goes wrong with her mental state.

124
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,350
I think Qin is doing well.

125
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,230
That's based on your standards.

126
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,910
In my opinion,

127
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,350
you have a problem too.

128
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,230
You two

129
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,230
are living a hard life.

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,550
But you have no choice.

131
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,430
Because

132
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,390
you have such a mother.

133
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:30,830
Tell me.

134
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,670
A young man

135
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,390
owns everything

136
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,550
but can't

137
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,590
live happily.

138
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,510
He's even gloomy every day.

139
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,630
What's the point?

140
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,310
Qin

141
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,310
hasn't befriended anyone since she came back.

142
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,990
She's always alone.

143
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,830
Now that she has grown up,

144
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,070
she won't tell me

145
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,470
even if she has something on her mind.

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:03,990
Of course,

147
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,710
She never told you too.

148
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,990
Tonight,

149
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,390
ask her to drink at my place.

150
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,190
I'll ask Xiaorao to come along

151
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,990
and introduce them to each other.

152
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,190
Just take it as a chance of befriending.

153
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,430
Their personalities are too different.

154
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,110
They can't be friends.

155
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,030
The more different they are,

156
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,470
the more they can become close friends.

157
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,590
Do you want to bet?

158
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,430
Boring.

159
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,470
Really.

160
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,110
Look at us.

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,630
Right?

162
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,350
We are already brothers forever.

163
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,390
What?

164
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,510
Do you have any objections?

165
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,070
No, I don't.

166
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,950
But you are nagging so much.

167
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,310
My ears hurt.

168
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,070
Get out of here quickly.

169
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,150
Okay.

170
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,670
Cheer up.

171
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,909
Be good to yourself.

172
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
Or I'll be distressed by your situation.

173
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,550
Let me introduce you.

174
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,790
Qin.

175
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,150
Xu Qin.

176
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,910
My sister.

177
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,470
Zhan Xiaorao.

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,550
My ex-girlfriend.

179
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,830
Hello.

180
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,510
Hello.

181
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,230
Brother.

182
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,070
You're indeed siblings.

183
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,470
You're both so indifferent.

184
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,950
I can't stand

185
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,030
your mysophobia.

186
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,470
Are your eyes microscopes

187
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,110
or what?

188
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,030
Everything is dirty

189
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,950
in your eyes, huh?

190
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,350
None of your business.

191
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,510
You have a strong character.

192
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,150
Xiao Yixiao.

193
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,430
You're so nosy.

194
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,230
That's none of your business.

195
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,670
Where is your new boyfriend?

196
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,230
Bring him here

197
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,470
so that I can perform quality control for you.

198
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,230
I also didn't see you

199
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,510
bring your girlfriend here.

200
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,310
We broke up.

201
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,470
Congratulations.

202
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,070
Give me a cup.

203
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,710
Xu Qin.

204
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,590
Are you in a relationship?

205
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,190
No.

206
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,590
You have to.

207
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,790
Don't be like Meng Yanchen.

208
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,910
Every time I saw him,

209
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,270
I thought he was going to become a monk.

210
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,110
I'm afraid next time

211
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,030
I'll have to find him in the temple.

212
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,670
Ms. Zhan.

213
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,550
Return the investment money to me.

214
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,390
Meng Yanchen is indeed a deity.

215
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,350
No one in this world deserves you.

216
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,070
I don't need to pay back my money anymore, do I?

217
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,590
Xu Qin.

218
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,750
Why don't we

219
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,910
get a boyfriend from here today?

220
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
Don't lead my sister astray.

221
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,710
Xu Qin.

222
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,030
Nice to meet you.

223
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,190
Bottoms up.

224
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,790
I like you. Slow down.

225
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,230
Can you drink?

226
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,670
Don't get drunk with only one cup.

227
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,110
Later, Meng Yanchen will hit me.

228
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,310
I'm afraid you can't beat me.

229
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,350
If so, I must

230
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,590
compete with you today.

231
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,230
Xiao Yixiao.

232
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,750
Get a row of shot glasses.

233
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,590
Okay.

234
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,710
Are you really having a battle?

235
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,790
Sure!

236
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,430
Fine.

237
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,510
Let's drink first.

238
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,150
Don't drink too much.

239
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,190
Slow down.

240
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,990
Xiao Yixiao, don't drag me.

241
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,270
I'm not drunk. You are...

242
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,270
I'm really speechless.

243
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,870
Why did you drink so much if you couldn't?

244
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,590
How could I lose?

245
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,190
Zhan Xiaorao!

246
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,750
You're the top one for being embarrassing.

247
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,470
You've lost.

248
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,150
Xu Qin, I haven't. Let's continue drinking.

249
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,590
Sit tight.

250
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,390
My car is over there.

251
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,230
I'll send her back.

252
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,430
Okay.

253
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,470
-I'll get her back...
-Xu Qin.

254
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,270
I want to sleep with Xu Qin.

255
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,510
Get up.

256
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,670
I'm telling you, Zhan Xiaorao.

257
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,430
You've been blacklisted

258
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,070
in my bar.

259
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,270
Help me to carry it.

260
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,200
Xu Qin.

261
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,910
I'm not going back. I want to drink.

262
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,190
Can you behave yourself?

263
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,470
We're here.

264
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,470
Get in.

265
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,750
Here's your bag.

266
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,630
Excuse me.

267
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,150
Is this your car?

268
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,310
Yes, why?

269
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,390
I accidentally

270
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,670
scratched your car by accident just now.

271
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:34,870
Where is the scratch?

272
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,910
Nothing.

273
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,030
What?

274
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,270
You don't have to compensate for it.

275
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,350
Uncle Meng and Aunt

276
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,470
are here to pick you up.

277
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,710
Yanchen is also with us.

278
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,110
We'll take you home later.

279
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,230
Yanchen.

280
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,390
You stay here

281
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,430
and accompany your sister.

282
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:40,950
Okay.

283
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,150
We'll be right back.

284
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,230
Qin.

285
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm your elder brother.

286
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,430
Qin.

287
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,030
I like cleanliness.

288
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,790
This

289
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,510
is too dirty.

290
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,310
Let's throw it away.

291
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,750
We don't want it anymore.

292
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,270
It's so dirty.

293
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,230
Look.

294
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,070
The nails

295
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,910
are all black inside.

296
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,390
I'm Xu Haishan's comrade,

297
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,110
Meng Huaijin.

298
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,670
This is my wife, Fu Wenying.

299
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,990
The adoption procedure is now under process

300
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,990
at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

301
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,190
We'll take the kid with us today.

302
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,110
Why did you...

303
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,630
Yanchen.

304
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:51,950
We're leaving.

305
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,470
Okay.

306
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,790
Let's go.

307
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,950
You're awake?

308
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,430
Did you sleep here last night?

309
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,990
I cooked the dumplings

310
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,710
in your fridge.

311
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,790
Eat up while they're hot.

312
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,550
Try it.

313
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,950
The shrimp is quite big.

314
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,470
There should be a whole one in it.

315
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,870
So I like it.

316
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,710
It's really delicious.

317
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,430
I didn't expect

318
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,230
you and Zhan Xiaorao

319
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,270
could get along that well.

320
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,630
She's very likeable.

321
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,070
You too.

322
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,550
I'm annoying,

323
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,310
not likeable.

324
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,190
Qin.

325
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,750
Don't say that.

326
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,270
I asked Song Yan to make up with me.

327
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,350
He refused.

328
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,870
Actually,

329
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,150
it's good for him to reject.

330
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,590
Otherwise, if he agreed,

331
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,270
I would be at a loss.

332
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,550
I didn't even dare to tell Mum.

333
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,070
He should have noticed that

334
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,830
I'm not firm with my decision.

335
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,030
So he disliked me.

336
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,310
I must have looked ugly back then.

337
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:06,790
Brother.

338
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,950
Did he write to me

339
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,590
after I went abroad?

340
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,710
It's fine.

341
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,710
Dig in.

342
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,470
It's getting cold.

343
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,550
Mum knows that you're on leave.

344
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,550
She asked me to tell you to go back.

345
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,990
Got it.

346
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,830
Take a 20-minute break on the spot.

347
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,030
Next,

348
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,910
rope climbing.

349
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,630
The break is too short.

350
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,150
Let them rest more.

351
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,630
Ten minutes.

352
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,270
Ten...

353
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,350
I'm most afraid of parents fighting.

354
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,950
Those who suffer are always the unlucky kids.

355
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,550
Shut up.

356
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,550
Don't you know

357
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,670
why they quarreled?

358
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,510
Have some water.

359
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,150
Hello.

360
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,350
Is anyone in 1101?

361
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,350
This is 119.

362
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,190
Coming.

363
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,350
Hello, Ms. Xu.

364
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,590
They are the firefighters.

365
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,950
The kid upstairs at 1201

366
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,950
crawled out of the balcony

367
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,390
and was stuck on the air conditioner's outdoor unit.

368
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,390
There are no adults at his home.

369
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,230
Can we borrow

370
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,230
your balcony for a while?

371
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,310
Come in.

372
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,750
Jiang.

373
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:27,990
Put on your gear.

374
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,670
Set another safety pivot.

375
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,870
Kid,

376
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,590
I've touched you.

377
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,430
I've got you.

378
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,070
Don't move, okay?

379
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,110
Don't move.

380
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,670
What's your name?

381
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,870
Liu...

382
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,270
Liu Siqi.

383
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,030
Liu Siqi.

384
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,710
Very good.

385
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,030
You're very brave.

386
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,630
Don't move.

387
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,310
Just stay still, okay?

388
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,630
We can save you soon.

389
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,150
Get ready.

390
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,470
Don't be afraid.

391
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:31,990
Hold.

392
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,110
Here.

393
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,110
Slowly.

394
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,870
Down.

395
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,670
Don't worry.

396
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,670
Hold tight.

397
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,070
Hurry up.

398
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,630
Be careful.

399
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:11,950
Are you alright?

400
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,270
Are you alright, chief?

401
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,630
I’m fine.

402
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,270
Let's go.

403
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,310
Don't cry.

404
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,630
Your parents will be here soon.

405
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,950
Sorry for the trouble.

406
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,710
All right, hang in there.

407
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,030
It won't hurt anymore.

408
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,270
Come on, stretch your arm.

409
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,830
Excuse me.

410
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,790
Thank you.

411
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,390
Let me.

412
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,150
Chief.

413
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,470
Are you alright?

414
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,270
I'm fine.

415
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,390
Don't worry.

416
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,950
You're so brave.

417
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,190
Alright.

418
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,190
Okay.

419
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,430
Qi.

420
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,030
My dear son.

421
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,790
Slowly.

422
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,790
Does it hurt?

423
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,630
You scared me to death.

424
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,110
Don't be afraid, Qi.

425
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,350
I'm here.

426
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,670
Thank you.

427
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,190
Thank you.

428
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,630
Let me tell you.

429
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,790
Don't leave the kid

430
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,750
alone at home.

431
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,790
We are too busy

432
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,950
at work.

433
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,270
We have no choice today.

434
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,990
We won't do it again.

435
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,750
And the balcony at home

436
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,270
should be blocked.

437
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,510
Otherwise, it's too dangerous.

438
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,190
Yes.

439
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,950
The glass

440
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,990
has long been broken.

441
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,350
Look at you.

442
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,390
I told you to block it.

443
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,430
You just blocked it with a net.

444
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,790
It's useless.

445
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,750
I was careless.

446
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,790
Sorry for the trouble.

447
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,270
Thank you.

448
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,030
Remember.

449
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,990
Take him to the hospital

450
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,790
and have a check-up.

451
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,390
-Say thank you to him. -Okay.

452
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,150
Say thank you.

453
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,190
Thank you, uncle.

454
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,270
Thank you, aunt.

455
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,150
We're leaving. Thank you.

456
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,310
Remember to block your balcony later.

457
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,910
-Okay. -Okay.

458
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,470
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

459
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,030
Thank you.

460
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,830
Hello.

461
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,190
Can you give Song Yan's WeChat ID

462
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,830
to me?

463
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,430
This...

464
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,070
Thank you.

465
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,670
Don't say it's from me.

466
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,230
Thank you.

467
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,390
It's all done.

468
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,870
Have some tea before you go.

469
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,630
You sweated a lot.

470
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,510
You need some water.

471
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,150
It's a little hot.

472
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,030
Why don't you sit down for a while?

473
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,630
No.

474
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,550
I need to pack my equipment.

475
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,350
Let me treat your wound.

476
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:21,870
Sit down.

477
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,030
You hurt your wrist, right?

478
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,910
Give me your hand.

479
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,710
Are you usually

480
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,430
busy at work?

481
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,870
Kind of.

482
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,790
I'm busy

483
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,910
with everything every day.

484
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,590
Not as busy as you.

485
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,390
I'm in the ER now.

486
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,110
Otherwise, I wouldn't be so busy.

487
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,390
Besides,

488
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,750
our work

489
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,630
is not as dangerous as yours.

490
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,070
Your work is dangerous.

491
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,670
All right.

492
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,190
Thank you.

493
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,750
Thank you.

494
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,150
I'm leaving.

495
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,670
Bye.

496
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,710
Song Yan.

497
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,870
You're off this weekend,

498
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,750
right?

499
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,510
According to this trend,

500
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,470
we can achieve

501
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,270
a return on investment

502
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,230
of 18% per year.

503
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,310
Five years later,

504
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,390
the profit can reach

505
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,590
135 million.

506
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,070
How can you guarantee

507
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,750
an 18%

508
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
return on investment?

509
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,150
We did market research.

510
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,430
The local house price is very high

511
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,470
and there's room to rise.

512
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,350
The company's sales funds

513
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,710
flow back smoothly.

514
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,190
The most common mistake investors make

515
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,750
is to believe the recent trend

516
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,910
may continue.

517
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,670
They'll think it's a good chance of investment,

518
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,710
and it'll last till the future.

519
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,950
The high return in the past

520
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,430
can only prove that this asset

521
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,350
will be more and more expensive.

522
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,950
If you take it as an investment target,

523
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,190
it will only get worse,

524
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,110
not better.

525
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,870
Whether it's political

526
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,110
or human factors,

527
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,990
the business cycle can't be eliminated.

528
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,710
You always have to pay it back.

529
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,750
Next.

530
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,310
Yunji Pharmaceutical Company.

531
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,990
This company is mainly engaged in

532
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,270
the research and development of anticancer drugs.

533
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,390
The initial input-output ratio

534
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,470
may not look good.

535
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,990
But in the long run,

536
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,670
I think highly of this company.

537
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,990
Have you visited the R&D center?

538
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,310
Yes.

539
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,910
The boss also welcomes you

540
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,350
to have a look.

541
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,790
Where is the management list of the company?

542
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,150
It's on page 23.

543
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,550
The list of researchers?

544
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,190
Page 46 to 57.

545
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,790
Make an appointment for me

546
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:07,910
and book a ticket.

547
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,150
Mr. Meng,

548
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,950
the financial report of this company

549
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,310
is not very optimistic in the market.

550
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,310
Investors should always remember

551
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,030
we get value

552
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,550
from the price we pay.

553
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,270
A good company will shine.

554
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,350
Before that, all we have to do

555
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,390
is wait.

556
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,550
Excuse me, I need to go out.

557
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,750
Dr. Yang.

558
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,830
Nice bag.

559
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,390
Nice new hairstyle.

560
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,750
New hairstyle?

561
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,950
Nothing has changed.

562
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,590
Leader.

563
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,910
Come here.

564
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,590
Brother, my mom said it's getting cold.

565
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,150
She asked me to bring you some thick clothes.

566
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,670
I'll come to you later.

567
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,830
If you're not there,

568
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,870
I'll leave them to Suo Jun.

569
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,470
No need.

570
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,430
If I'm not here,

571
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,510
you can just leave them to the guard.

572
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:44,870
Mom.

573
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,350
You can't come back

574
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,870
on Sunday again?

575
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,110
Are you very busy?

576
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,870
I have something to deal with

577
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,670
in the company.

578
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,110
Do you have any disagreement

579
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,470
with your shareholders?

580
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,950
What's wrong?

581
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,030
Not really.

582
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,590
They probably have a problem

583
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,710
with one of my decisions.

584
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,590
You've done a good job in the past two years

585
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,670
and you haven't made any mistakes, basically.

586
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,190
But...

587
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,990
Mom.

588
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,150
I know what to do.

589
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,790
Are you driving?

590
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,670
That's it.

591
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,790
You drive.

592
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:24,590
Okay.

593
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,550
Wen Ying,

594
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:37,630
are you

595
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,390
going too far?

596
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,070
Mind your own business.

597
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:42,870
We

598
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,310
just ignore it.

599
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,750
I'm doing this for you.

600
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,270
You wouldn't have

601
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,030
had to work so hard

602
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,910
if your son had taken over earlier.

603
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,790
Take it easy.

604
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,950
I think I can handle this

605
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,710
for another 10 years or so.

606
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,870
Don't worry

607
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,430
about it.

608
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,630
Come in.

609
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,910
Mr. Meng.

610
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,870
This is Xingya's financial report.

611
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,030
The signature page is at the end.

612
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:38,950
Oh, right.

613
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,230
The signing ceremony with Yunji

614
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,950
is also ready.

615
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,310
Chen Mingyu.

616
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,390
Who is your boss?

617
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,790
Who is your boss?

618
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,910
Mr. Meng.

619
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:01,390
It's you.

620
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:03,870
Really?

621
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,510
Chairman Meng has never

622
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,710
asked about you.

623
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,590
Well,

624
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,070
Chairman Fu did ask about you,

625
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,190
but I didn't...

626
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,270
Mr. Meng, I was wrong.

627
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,150
Next time,

628
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,150
I'll arrange you

629
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,190
to work for her.

630
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,270
No.

631
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,470
I was wrong.

632
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,030
Mr. Meng.

633
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,870
Leave.

634
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,150
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

635
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,750
No.1 water gunner,

636
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,030
Zhan Dapeng is in position.

637
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,150
Chi.

638
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,270
What's your mission?

639
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,230
Nothing serious.

640
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,110
Someone's head

641
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,710
was stuck in the fence.

642
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,590
When can we

643
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,470
have a mission?

644
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,470
It's better to have a big mission.

645
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,270
Brat,

646
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,670
shut your mouth.

647
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,630
Don't be a doomsayer like me.

648
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,270
Yi, don't worry.

649
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,950
I dare not steal your nickname.

650
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,790
You're really infamous.

651
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,830
Experience.

652
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,950
What are you doing up there?

653
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:56,710
Get down.

654
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,990
Yes, chief.

655
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,550
Yang Chi.

656
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,350
Maintain the truck later.

657
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,470
Chief.

658
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,710
Someone’s looking for you at the door.

659
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:07,830
What?

660
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,390
A girl is looking for you at the door.

661
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,070
My sister.

662
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,990
She's here to send me clothes.

663
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,070
I'll go over there.

664
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,470
Listen.

665
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:23,710
His sister

666
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,430
is quite cute.

667
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,270
She's very joyful.

668
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,710
Not bad.

669
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,350
I don't think it's his sister.

670
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,150
I think it's that female doctor.

671
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:31,710
A female doctor?

672
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,190
That female doctor?

673
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,550
What are you packing? Let's go.

674
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,510
Let's go.

675
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,710
None of your business. Go on with your training.

676
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,670
I'll go with you.
