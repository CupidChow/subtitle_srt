391
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,100
I did not interfere,

392
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,860
did not ask, did not advocate,

393
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,760
or even

394
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,260
pretended not to know,

395
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,620
because

396
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,120
some things

397
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,020
might bring me benefits.

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,320
I was wrong.

401
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,560
It's not just your fault.

402
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,620
So,

403
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,050
don't get caught up

404
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,270
in resentment all by yourself.

405
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,780
OK?

406
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,570
You've heard

407
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,540
what I said

408
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,460
that night?

409
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,450
You won't go home again, right?

410
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,490
Even though they're wrong,

411
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,690
you shouldn't hurt them

412
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,960
in this way.

413
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,430
Have you ever thought that

414
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,210
if there hadn't been an eyewitness

415
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,270
who left the evidence,

416
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,780
your life would have been ruined?

417
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,900
Why did you torture yourself?

418
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,360
At that time,

419
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,130
I just didn't want to do anything.

420
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,100
Maybe they have

421
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,340
disappointed you in some ways.

422
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,170
But no one is perfect.

423
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,390
You keep them from making mistakes all their lives.

424
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,350
This is also very harsh.

425
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,780
Can you

426
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,750
persuade yourself with these words?

Don't you hate our family?

429
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,840
I have no right to hate you.

430
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,700
I just feel sorry for Song Yan.

431

435
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,230
Because he's determined

436
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,650

so many hardships,

you and him

was really interesting.

But I still want to tell you that

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,780
whether it's me

But if I'm in pain,

511
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,160
will Mom feel sorry for me?

If she does,

00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,980
is it the same as my brother?

Mom asked me

how I could hurt my parents

519
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,250
didn't she ever think that

00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
she was hurting me?

521
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,270
If she thought

522
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,530
I would be in pain,

523
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,220
would she feel sorry for me?

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,500

Song Yan

544
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,740
can't stand the slightest humiliation,

545
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,250
and he will resist

even if

547
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,260
high-powered people bully him.

548
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,340

549
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,860
exposing this matter.

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,010
Excuse me.

584
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,370
She was discharged from the hospital

585
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,600
at noon today.

586
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,890
Okay.

587
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,140
[Yuan's]

588
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,140
[I have memories in this city because of you]

589
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,650
[Yuan's]

590
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,650
[I have memories in this city because of you]

591
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,700
Yan.

592
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,650
Help your uncle keep an eye on it.

593
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,110
He is too old to see clearly.

594
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,500
Okay.

595
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,400
Actually, a man

596
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,660
is just like this house.

597
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,660
As time goes by,

598
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,710
it's broken and old with many problems.

599
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,430
It's easy to be disliked.

600
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,900
How dare you say that?

601
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,690
What part of you

602
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,990
do I dislike?

603
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,040
Four leaks.

604
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,870
Look carefully.

605
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,700
Repair them all.

606
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,060
Otherwise,

607
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,500
our house would become a sea-view room.

608
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,650
The view here

609
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,020
is as good as the sea-view room.

610
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,980
Right, Xu Qin?

611
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,180
Yes.

612
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,740
What a pity.

613
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,530
It's going to be demolished.

614
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,850
I've lived here for decades.

615
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,180
I really don't want to move out.

616
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,810
Why are you here?

617
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,790
I'm here to help.

618
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,720
Take a break.

619
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,580
Yan.

620
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,740
Is

621
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,370
your house

622
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,410
ready yet?

623
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,060
Uncle.

624
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,080
It's almost done.

625
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,390
It still takes some time.

626
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,780
That’s good.

627
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,250
Zhai,

628
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,450
come and help me.

629
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,170
Coming.

630
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,080
I'll wash the dirty clothes.

631
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,350
You rest.

632
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,340
Let me do it.

633
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,170
[Rescue]

634
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,220
Li Meng.

635
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,650
[China Fire and Rescue]

636
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,280
This is for you.

637
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,540
What is

638
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,710
this?

639
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,060
Water it once every seven days.

640
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,500
[China Fire and Rescue]

641
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:25,850
[China Fire and Rescue]

642
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,540
Slow down.

643
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,820
Hold on tight, Dr. Xu.

644
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,020
Am I heavy?

645
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,430
Put me down.

646
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,800
Dad.

647
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,830
Why are you here?

648
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,180
I...

649
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,760
Mom, why haven't they

650
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,950
come back yet?

651
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,260
Don't worry.

652
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,420
Your brother and sister-in-law

653
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,780
promised to come back for dinner.

654
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,020
You're back.

655
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,900
Brother, Sister-in-law.

656
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,520
Uncle, Aunt, Zhai Miao.

657
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,770
This is my Dad.

658
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,950
Hello.

659
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,900
I came uninvited.

660
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,420
Sorry to bother you.

661
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,030
Don't say that.

662
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,140
It's okay.

663
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,050
Thank you.

664
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,840
Mr. Meng, please have a seat.

665
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,490
Yes.

666
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,920
We've made some home-cooked dishes.

667
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,270
If you don't mind,

668
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,530
have dinner with us.

669
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,210
Okay.

670
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,420
Thank you.
