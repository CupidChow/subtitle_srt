00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,820
wouldn't have been able to do anything to you.

197
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,130
You can't

198
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,700
do anything to me now either.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Really?

200
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,460
If I wanted to,

201
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,110
it'd be easy.

202
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,030
I beg of you.

203
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,220
Please let my child go.

204
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,210
You can't ruin him like this.

205
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Take him away.

206
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,310
I beg of you.

207
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,460
Please let my child go.

208
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,100
You can't ruin his future.

209
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Get him out of here.

210
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,180
I beg of you.

211
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,220
I beg of you.

212
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,980
Please let my child go.

213
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,820
I beg of you.

214
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,740
You can't ruin

215
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,020
his future like this.

216
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,500
I beg of you.

217
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,940
I beg of you.

218
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,340
Please let my child go.

219
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,130
You can't

220
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,380
ruin his future.

221
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,020
I beg of you!

222
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,420
I beg of you!

223
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,180
You can't

224
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,980
ruin

225
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,850
our child's future!

226
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,260
Excuse me, your coffee.

227
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,880
Leave my family alone.

228
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,550
It's no longer what it was like ten years ago.

229
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm no longer that kid.

230
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,420
If we really clashed head-on,

231
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,340
it's not a problem

232
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,030
for me to do some damage.

233
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,580
My father

234
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,540
was rather difficult, right?

235
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,020
I'm tougher than him.

236
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,990
Fine.

237
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,750
Don't

238
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,980
see Qin again.

239
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,410
Are you that afraid of me?

240
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,400
No.

241
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,580
You‘re just not worthy.

242
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,860
Song Yan.

243
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,620
Actually,

244
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,140
I used to admire

245
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,020
your father.

246
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,190
He was an upright person.

247
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,350
But

248
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,990
he wasn't flexible.

249
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,360
He was careless in making friends.

250
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,070
What about you?

251
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,740
Don't you have any pride?

252
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,990
There is so much enmity

253
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,950
between our families,

254
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,510
but you still like Qin?

255
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,170
I don't even know

256
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,380
if you have other intentions.

257
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,910
Or

258
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,570
are you and your mother

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,770
the same?

260
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,240
We have different values.

261
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,020
There's nothing to talk about.

262
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,100
In your eyes,

263
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,870
people are divided into a hierarchy of statuses.

264
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,710
In my eyes,

265
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,160
everyone is equal.

266
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,930
I've never

267
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,070
sucked up to anyone in my life,

268
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,710
nor looked down on anyone.

269
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,640
But I look down on you.

270
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,700
What a pity.

271
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,460
Standing position!

272
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,550
Forward!

273
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,190
Further away!

274
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,520
Hold it.

275
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,810
Stop!

276
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Deputy Chief Yang,

277
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,220
we still haven't gotten to

278
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,040
try out the deluge guns.

279
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,200
Can we have a try?

280
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,900
I don't think so.

281
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,150
You girls don't have much strength.

282
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,620
This thing is quite powerful.

283
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,240
No.

284
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,580
We're powerful too.

285
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,110
Let us try.

286
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,550
We're leaving soon.

287
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,500
Then...

288
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,660
Fine.

289
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,680
You can have a try.

290
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,670
Have a rest.

291
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,260
Okay.

292
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,500
Take off two sets of clothes and helmets.

293
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,980
Come with me.

294
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,460
Okay.

295
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,180
Sister Nan.

296
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,130
Team Leader, record a video for me.

297
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,010
Okay.

298
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,940
Hold it.

299
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,490
One leg in front and one leg behind.

300
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,350
One leg in front and one leg behind.

301
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:52,930
Okay?

302
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,410
Okay.

303
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,190
Bend your waist.

304
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,860
Hold it tight.

305
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,740
It's really powerful.

306
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,250
Okay.

307
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,160
Turn on the tap.

308
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,790
Okay.

309
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,940
Don't put it on high pressure.

310
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,710
Wait. Hold it.

311
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,790
Just pull it back.

312
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,210
Okay.

313
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,790
Are you ready?

314
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,500
Yes.

315
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,210
Turn on the tap.

316
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,980
I-

317
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,020
I'll turn it on, Dongdong.

318
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,220
Three, two, one.

319
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,580
Are you okay?

320
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,900
Are you okay?

321
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,180
Are you okay?

322
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,800
You two, be careful.

323
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,590
Take a look.

324
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,990
Get dressed before you come out.

325
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,710
Hair dryer.

326
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,170
Dry your hair. Don't catch a cold.

327
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,390
[Be careful not to slip]

328
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,060
[Be careful not to slip]

329
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,420
The hands Dr. Xu uses to hold the scalpel

330
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,660
are very clumsy.

331
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,600
How strange.

332
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,820
Your sleeves

333
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,700
are too long and wide.

334
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,620
They held me back.

335
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,110
[Be careful not to slip]

336
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,660
Sit down.

337
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,910
[Be careful not to slip]

338
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,520
[Be careful not to slip]

339
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,099
My hair is going to be tangled.

340
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,240
Do you still want my help?

341
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,320
Why are you laughing?

342
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,410
You look like a female ghost.

343
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,530
[Be careful not to slip]

344
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,980
You turned me into a ghost.

345
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,250
Here.

346
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Don't catch a cold.

347
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,190
Take a hot water bath.

348
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,900
Aren't your uncle and aunt-in-law here?

349
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,860
If they come in

350
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,640
while I'm showering,

351
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,830
I'd get found out.

352
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
All right, go ahead.

353
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,640
I'll wait for you outside.

354
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,780
Song Yan.

355
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,290
Where's the hair dryer?

356
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,490

How long have you been a firefighter?

369
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,860
A long time.

370
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,930
So

371
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,940
you used to be a soldier?

372
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,030
Right.

373
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,620
You said

374
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,580
you wanted to go to a military school.

375
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,540
I messed up the college entrance exam the second time too.

376
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,260
I did badly.

377
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,030
[Be careful not to slip]

378
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,660
Don't think too much.

379
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,260
It had nothing to do with you leaving.

380
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,470
I'm just not cut out for studying

381
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,930
[Be careful not to slip]

382
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,410
But I remember you were making good progress

383
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,890
the second year.

384
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,690
You remembered wrong.

385
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,380
That's enough.

386
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,120
Why do I feel

387
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
you aren't telling me the truth?

388
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,710
Song Yan.

389
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,070
What truth?

390
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,730
I want to know everything about you

391
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,330
from after we broke up.

392
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,930
You can't tell me?

393
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,440
Yes, I can't.

394
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:37,190
[Be careful not to slip]

395
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,770
Why?

396
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,780
It's my own business.

397
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,400
It has nothing to do with you.

398
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,110
It has nothing to do with me?

399
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,190
Are you serious?

400
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,420
Then why did I come

401
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,260
to the fire station?

402
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,500
If that's the case,

403
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,030
you shouldn't have come.

404
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,120
You don't want me here?

405
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,670
It has nothing to do with this.

406
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,110
What does it have to do with?

407
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,660
We've missed ten years of each other's lives.

408
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,060
I want to fill the gap

409
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,260
left by the past ten years.

410
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,450
Why bother, Xu Qin?

411
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,160
If you've missed it, you've missed it.

412
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,210
You can't make up for it

413
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,610
by trying one-sidedly to patch it up.

414
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,940
Why must you hold on to the past?

415
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Why can't you let go?

416
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
You said

417
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,600
we need time

418
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,590
to get to know each other.

419
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,020
We can

420
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,380
understand each other again.

421
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,590
We can see if the person in front of us

422
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,160
will make our hearts flutter,

423
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,470
make us fall in love,

424
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,100
and make us want to

425
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
be together again.

426
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,100
But this version of you

427
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,180
came to me

428
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,500
after experiencing the past.

429
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,190
I want to know

430
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,900
what you've been through

431
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,140
over the past ten years.

432
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,640
I want to know your past.

433
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,130
Is...

434
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,860
Is there anything wrong with that?

435
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,270
You can know.

436
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,740
Dr. Xu.

437
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,590
But now,

438
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,850
what's our relationship?

439
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,330
Are we friends

440
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,760
or lovers?

441
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,660
In what capacity

442
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,900
are you understanding my past?

443
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,660
Song Yan,

444
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,900
are you drawing a boundary between us?

445
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,580
Are you trying to say

446
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,090
I've crossed a line

447
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,180
as a friend?

448
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,600
I don't know.

449
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,090
I don't know what happened

450
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,500
between us

451
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,140
for us to have gotten

452
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,740
to this dead end today.

453
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,950
Dead end?

454
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,690
Maybe seeing each other less often,

455
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,080
or not seeing each other at all,

456
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,020
and keeping our distance

457
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,510
will be better.

458
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,420
You're right.

459
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,990
We should keep our distance from each other.

460
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,240
It was my wishful thinking.

461
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,570
It's all my fault.

462
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm sorry.

463
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,540
It'll be over after today.

464
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,050
In the future,

465
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,230
we'll have fewer and fewer chances to meet.

466
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,020
It'll all be well then.

467
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,710
You mean to say...

468
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,600
You mean to say

469
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,940
we'll never meet again after today?

470
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,820
I get it.

471
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,570
So this is

472
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
what that gift meant.

473
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,910
Thank you.

474
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,470
All the best,

475
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,630
Chief Song.

476
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,760
Team Leader.

477
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,890
You got drenched just now.

478
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,700
Drink some.

479
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,200
What if it gets worse tomorrow?

480
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,020
It's hot.

481
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:23,820
Be careful.

482
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,540
You made it?

483
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,380
Have some.

484
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,500
I must help everyone

485
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,480
take care of you.

486
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,620
Thanks.

487
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,790
Can I go back to the hospital first?

488
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,020
No way.

489
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,140
You're the team leader.

490
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,960
It's too much if you don't go.

491
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,220
Drink it.

492
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,620
We'll rush there soon.

493
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,700
Where did you go?

494
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,060
Let's go for the farewell dinner.

495
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,110
What farewell dinner?

496
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,100
Dr. Xu and the others are all there.

497
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,800
They're having a farewell dinner with us.

498
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,680
My stomach is unwell.

499
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,020
Don't have an unwell stomach.

500
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,860
Everyone's waiting for the Chief.

501
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Can it be complete if you don't go?

502
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,580
Hurry up.

503
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,490
Come on.

504
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
Let's go.

505
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,650
Comrades, let me propose a toast.

506
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,610
Shouldn't we toast

507
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,900
to these medical staff?

508
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,160
Thank you for your hard work.

509
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,080
Cheers.

510
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,980
Thank you for your hard work.

511
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,970
Well,

512
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,860
as the medical team,

513
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,380
we should thank you

514
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,570
for taking care of us.

515
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,600
Thank you.

516
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,700
Don't say that.

517
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,860
We are a team.

518
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,340
We'll be a family from now on.

519
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,790
Come here often.

520
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,340
Sister Nan.

521
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,900
You too.

522
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,970
Okay, I'll come often.

523
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,340
Of course I will come often.

524
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,760
I'll bring my son here in the future.

525
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,750
What?

526
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,580
Sister Bei, you already have a son?

527
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,790
No.

528
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,750
You look so young.

529
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,410
You look like you just graduated from nursing school.

530
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,240
No, I meant my godson.

531
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,670
You still look too young.

532
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,970
Sister Nan, do you have a son?

533
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,770
Pipi.

534
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,680
You don't have to

535
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,560
worry about this.

536
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,530
Dr. Li is so fair.

537
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,400
There must be many people chasing her.

538
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,470
I think so too.

539
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,380
Stop gossiping.

540
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,760
There really aren't.

541
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,940
My mom arranges blind dates for me everyday

542
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,150
when I'm on leave.

543
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,110
Don't talk about me.

544
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,590
You guys

545
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,060
probably have no worries, right?

546
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,070
Don't people always say

547
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,830
the most handsome guys belong to the country?

548
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,670
It's strange.

549
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,920
In our station,

550
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
those who are attached are the least talkative.

551
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,940
Look at Yi,

552
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,980
Ge,

553
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,190
Yuan Hai,

554
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,100
and Liu Kai.

555
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,060
They don't talk much.

556
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,020
Right, Ge?

557
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,300
Why are you so talkative?

558
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,910
By that logic,

559
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,460
Chief talks the least.

560
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,800
Does he have a partner too?

561
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,210
Dongdong, you don't know, do you?

562
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,000
Our station leader is very devoted.

563
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,510
It's been ten years.

564
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,330
He's still waiting for his first love.

565
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,570
Really?

566
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,290
I heard it from Jiang Yi.

567
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,550
Just say it.

568
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,620
You even sold me out.

569
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,090
Chief,

570
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,590
you are too romantic.

571
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,090
I didn't know there really were

572
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,510
people like that in the world.

573
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,360
Tell us, Chief.

574
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,190
Tell us.

575
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,020
Jiang Yi was talking nonsense.

576
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,050
It's not true.

577
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,700
Let's eat.

578
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,560
Chief.

579
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,890
Don’t be shy.

580
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,950
We old members all know that.

581
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,780
That's right.

582
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,740
I'll vouch for Jiang.

583
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,180
What Jiang Yi said

584
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,320
is true.

585
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,790
Enough, stop gossiping.

586
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,530
Where is the girl?

587
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,320
I don't know.

588
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,710
She's abroad.

589
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,320
Does she know you still like her

590
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,510
and are still waiting for her?

591
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,140
It's pointless for her to know.

592
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,180
We can't be together anyway.

593
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,490
So many years have passed.

594
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,540
People have changed.

595
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,340
There are some relationships

596
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,620
that shouldn't be forced.

597
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,190
Having memories

598
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,480
while living our own lives

599
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,300
is the best ending.

600
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,350
What a pity.

601
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,590
Right.

602
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,700
Don't you regret it?

603
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,730
How can there

604
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,760
be no regrets in life?

605
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,400
Yes.

606
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,040
I have regrets.

607
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,180
For example, this joint rescue team

608
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,010
didn't attain

609
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,560
the goal I expected.

610
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,990
I'm a bit regretful.

611
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,550
Of course not.

612
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,260
We learned a lot

613
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,360
here.

614
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,020
Yes.

615
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,980
I've indeed gained a lot of knowledge.

616
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,870
If I hadn't come,

617
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,590
I wouldn't have known

618
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,200
firefighters have to do so many things.

619
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,590
That's because of the restructuring.

620
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,820
You see

621
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,110
fires,

622
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,310
emergency rescues,

623
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,440
social rescues,

624
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,280
and all major emergencies

625
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,240
are under our purview now.

626
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,240
All I know is

627
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,150
after restructuring,

628
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,040
our management has followed a paramilitary model.

629
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,310
We have more time to go out.

630
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,020
Yes.

631
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,670
And the welfare

632
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,650
is much better than before.

633
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,320
It would be even better

634
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,990
if it improved more.

635
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,100
What welfare?

636
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,520
We are serving the people.

637
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,700
Yes, serving the people.

638
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,170
Yes.

639
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,040
Indeed.

640
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,520
What you do

641
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,180
is worth any amount of compensation.

642
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,290
Restructuring is good.

643
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,190
Yes.

644
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,010
We've become more professional and detail-oriented.

645
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,970
All of us affected by it

646
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,620
think it's a good thing.

647
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,620
I hope

648
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,890
our working environment and system

649
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,670
can also be changed.

650
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,240
Actually, I think

651
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,860
your work is hard too.

652
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,640
Yes.

653
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,680
Yours is harder

654
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,050
if we must compare.

655
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,890
Actually,

656
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,670
I don't like words like "heroism,"

657
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,550
"emotionality,"

658
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,170
"service,"

659
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,380
"sacrifice," and other words like that.

660
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,540
These words

661
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,990
shouldn't be associated

662
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,880
with certain professions.

663
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,790
A profession should be the profession itself.

664
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,080
What do you mean?

665
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,510
In society,

666
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,090
no job should be

667
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,190
a passion project.

668
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,740
The public also shouldn't expect

669
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,300
any group's service.

670
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,640
Professions are professions.

671
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,990
There can be responsibility

672
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,890
and a mission.

673
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,500
But at the core of it,

674
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,780
it's just a job.

675
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,420
You don't have to

676
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,340
force on it a godly

677
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,480
or heroic halo.

678
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,910
We are all ordinary people.

679
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,910
You deserve to be renumerated

680
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,540
the amount of value you create.

681
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,620
Other than that,

682
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,680
don't project onto a profession

683
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,310
things outside of itself,

684
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
especially not great morals

685
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,470
or great halos.

686
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,830
Are you denying

687
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,460
the halo

688
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,440
of our profession?

689
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,070
I just don't think it ought to be like this.

690
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,860
Like what?

691
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,690
Forget it.

692
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,690
You won't understand.

693
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,420
Let's eat.

694
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,720
Do you think

695
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,160
we all live

696
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,180
in a vain heroic dream?

697
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,020
Actually,

698
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,160
I think...

699
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,790
this...

700
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,880
Dr. Xu.

701
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,390
Come out.

702
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,180
Chief.

703
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,060
Team Leader.

704
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,000
She...

705
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,580
Chi, should I go out and take a look?

706
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,270
Have a seat.

707
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,320
There are so many dishes.

708
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,200
Don't waste them.

709
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,740
Don't be so nosy.

710
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,270
[Utensil return]

711
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,060
Eat up.

712
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,190
Do you think

713
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,139
those people inside,

714
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,630
your colleagues

715
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,860
and my brothers,

716
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,380
are like fools?

717
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,780
We can only rely on

718
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,699
our vain dreams of heroism

719
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,980
to hypnotize ourselves?

720
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,360
That's why we chose our jobs

721
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,440
and persevered until now?

722
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,429
You know

723
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,340
that's not what I meant.

724
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,719
I know what you meant.

725
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,120
You've always been smart.

726
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,300
You're so smart that

727
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,659
everyone else is a fool in your eyes.

728
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,440
Including me.

729
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,280
Why are you mad at me?

730
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,090
I wasn't wrong.

731
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,710
Right?

732
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,540
Indeed.

733
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,690
Your words

734
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,909
suit your character.

735
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,580
Really.

736
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,340
Xu Qin.

737
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,080
You're still the same.

738
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,780
You won't owe anyone anything

739
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,420
and you won't allow

740
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,850
anyone to owe you anything.

741
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,880
I can't just be judging the case as it stands,

742
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,540
right?

743
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,790
How does it stand?

744
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,100
There are many types of work in this society.

745
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,780
Every occupation

746
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,100
has its own hardships.

747
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,390
Everyone

748
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,540
has their own difficulties.

749
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,000
Do sanitation workers not work hard?

750
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,750
Do teachers not work hard?

751
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,050
Do the police not work hard?

752
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,400
Do construction workers and border defense soldiers

753
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,140
not work hard?

754
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,070
But some special occupations

755
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
are involved in public affairs

756
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,070
and social care.

757
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,500
They cannot be defined

758
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,350
by money alone.

759
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,510
Every occupation

760
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,680
is slowly getting better

761
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,050
and slowly changing.

762
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,570
It is built on

763
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,770
everyone's efforts

764
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,350
and actions,

765
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,060
not empty words.

766
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,420
There are so many things

767
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,500
we face everyday.

768
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,920
Things.

769
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,790
Xu Qin.

770
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,810
You only care about things,

771
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,700
not feelings.

772
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,190
Do you love your occupation?

773
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,220
Do you love your occupation?

774
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,470
I do.

775
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,000
Not just me.

776
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,380
Jiang Yu,

777
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,510
Yang Chi, and Jiang Yi love it too.

778
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,380
I think Li Nan and Xu Xi

779
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,460
are also passionate.

780
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,890
In your opinion,

781
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,320
I'm stupid, right?

782
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,350
Do you know

783
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,130
there are three words

784
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
called "Yes, I'm willing"?

785
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,450
These three words

786
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,680
are priceless.

787
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,070
But some people

788
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,770
[Dare to traverse mountains of blades and oceans of fire]

789
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,280
are like fools.

790
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,910
They look at things

791
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,060
[We'll come when we're summoned and we'll win when we battle]

792
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,060
[Dare to traverse mountains of blades and oceans of fire]

793
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,620
and see feelings.

794
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,920
They are willing to be angels

795
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,010
and heroes.

796
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,140
They're willing to serve selflessly for no other reason.

797
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,600
You have no right to look down on them.

798
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,940
I'm not looking down on anyone.

799
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,260
I just want to tell you rationally—

800
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,480
Your rationality

801
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,010
is very cruel.

802
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,820
It is also extremely inappropriate

803
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,000
today.

804
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,810
Goodbye.

805
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,280
Dr. Xu.

806
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,380
Song Yan.

807
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,320
You've misunderstood me.

808
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,620
I just don't want

809
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,340
to see you all

810
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,620
risk yourselves for your faith.

811
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,870
I don't want your career

812
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,600
to be your burden.

813
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,110
♫If parting is to meet again♫

814
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,180
♫Love is the parabola after missing you♫

815
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,480
♫When we part, distance widens between us, but we always bump into each other♫

816
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,280
[Song Yan]

817
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:33,920
♫The heavy rain I just missed, a summer I can't hold on to♫

818
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,270
♫Were you the cloud that passed by, again and again♫

819
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:48,550
♫I wish I were the wind passing by you, can't help falling into your eyes♫

820
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:56,180
♫Why can't I avoid the midsummer♫

821
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,130
♫Let the wind reach the faraway places for us♫

822
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:10,720
♫I hope someone hears the words I didn't dare to say♫

823
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,060
Yang.

824
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,140
Where is the gift

825
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,090
you got for Xu Xi?

826
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,980
I know.

827
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,030
Shut up!

828
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,400
Nurse Xi,

829
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
this is for you.

830
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,350
I know you like drinking this,

831
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,180
so I bought it for you.

832
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,990
Tell me when you finish it.

833
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,500
I'll buy you more, as much as you want.

834
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,080
I don't have a gift for you.

835
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,570
I wish you good luck with your work.

836
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,250
Okay.

837
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,310
Remember to wash your clothes.

838
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,380
Wash them well.

839
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,770
Okay, I'm leaving.

840
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,390
Okay.

841
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,910
Supervisor.

842
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,100
Please do me a favor.

843
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,480
What is it, Dr. Xu?

844
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,970
About what happened just now,

845
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,880
please

846
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,180
apologize to everyone for me.

847
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,600
It didn't come out like I intended.

848
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,900
I didn't mean it like that.

849
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,190
I know.

850
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,000
You two

851
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,300
just misconstrued each other's words.

852
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,410
It was really badly construed.

853
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,550
Don't take it to heart.

854
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,560
Dr. Xu.

855
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,780
Don't think too much.

856
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,490
We all know

857
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,390
that's not what you meant.

858
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,630
I know you care about us.

859
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,450
We've been together for so long.

860
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,150
How could we not know

861
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,130
the kind of person you are?

862
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,520
Chief was probably

863
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,620
in a bad mood today.

864
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,990
Don't take it to heart.

865
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,200
I'll be off.

866
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,260
Have a safe trip.

867
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,900
You don't want to leave?

868
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,090
Why don't you want to leave?

869
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,260
Bye.
