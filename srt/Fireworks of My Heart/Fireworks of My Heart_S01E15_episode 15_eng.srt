1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:13,540


2
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,921
   

3
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,128
   

4
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:39,994
   

5
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,340
Yan, have a date cake. Okay?

6
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,185
What are you looking at?

7
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,120
About last time, is there no follow-up?

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,439
What "last time"?

9
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,719
I told you.

10
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,100
The girl was extremely drunk, so it wasn't for real.

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,280
- Miao, have a bun, okay? 
 - Yes, eat the bun.

12
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,765
I warned you long ago, but you wouldn't listen and went looking for her.

13
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,034
Now look. You got dumped again.

14
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,319
Girl.

15
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,574
That's in the past. Why bring it up?

16
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm obliged to because that woman is crazy.

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Why can't I mention it?

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,444
Brother, I'm begging you to stop looking for her.

19
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,280
What's so great about her?

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,080
She's the most obnoxious and cold-hearted person I've ever met.

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,479
Heartless.

22
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,800
Be quiet.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,439
Miao Miao.

24
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,939
That's enough.

25
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,440
Why are you so against her?

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,439
She isn't like what you said.

27
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,039
Yeah, right.

28
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,860
She's the most fragile and timid person I know.

29
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,520
That woman?

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,939
She wishes to go wild, let loose, and be free.

31
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,960
She doesn't want to submit.

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,381
She pretends to be strong, but in fact, her innermost being is weak.

33
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,286
A character like hers is the most useless.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,879
Seems like it's most useful to you.

35
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,779
She has you wrapped around her little finger.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,759
I don't know if there's any use.

37
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,035
Either way, I just don't think she's right for you.

38
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,759
Oh right, I remember that Li Meng from the detachment.

39
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,840
I think that lady is really good.

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,100
I think Sister Li Meng is great too!

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,879
Uncle, Auntie. I'm off.

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,520
- Brother! 
 - Take care.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,199
Not even food can stop your mouth.

44
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,799
Sit down.

45
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,280
Seriously. Watch what you say.

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,080
Why do you keep saying stuff that hurts your cousin?

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,219
That's right. You need to learn to grasp the mood.

48
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,680
Eat the fritter you like. I bought it just for you.

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,718
Eat your food.

50
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,571
 Yan! 

51
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,140
 Yan. 

52
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,520
Auntie.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Here. You didn't have any soy milk just now.

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,879
Take this.

55
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
It's okay. You didn't have to come running with it.

56
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,099
I hope you didn't take what Zhai Miao just said to heart.

57
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,699
It's okay.

58
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,623
But with some things,

59
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,959
I think it's better to accept reality and move on.

60
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,199
Be more open-minded.

61
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,399
After all, there's too much bad blood between our families.

62
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,839
But our family history is unrelated to her.

63
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,759
It relates to you, though.

64
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,480
Did you forget all the things you went through?

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,099
You can't expect us to pretend it never happened.

66
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:35,960
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,060
You aren't determined to reconcile with her, are you?

68
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
A lot of things aren't always under our control.

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,600
It's complicated, for her and for me.

70
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll just go with the flow.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,820
All right, hurry back.

72
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,360
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

73
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,000
Remember to drink the soy milk!

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,660
- I will. 
 - It has a short shelf life.

75
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,879
Captain Song, are you heading to the station?

76
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,579
Get in.

77
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,240
I seem to remember you don't live around here. Are you passing by?

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,099
I heard there's a nice cake shop in the area, so I came to buy some.

79
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,240
Later, I'd take some to the station.

80
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,499
It's okay. I don't really like sweet stuff.

81
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,039
It's not only for you. It's for the whole team.

82
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
Okay.

83
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you still like her?

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
What a surprise.

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,720
You're actually the masochistic type.

86
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,520
I mean, you're too low for her taste. Why bother?

87
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,279
Who gave her the right to belittle you and be dismissive of a good person like you?

88
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,399
You should show her.

89
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,279
There are many equally great ladies who like you.

90
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,480
Li Meng.

91
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,279
If you keep going,

92
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,401
you're treading a thin line.

93
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,060
You really annoy me.

94
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,763
I mean, you have good character, good looks and everything. But?

95
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,959
You have to hang yourself on one tree.

96
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,260
That's enough. Stop.

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,960
I thank you for your concern.

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,940
Anyway,

99
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,319
my relationship with my ex-girlfriend, whether it's good or bad,

100
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,460
isn't for others to meddle in.

101
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,160
Understood?

102
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Fine, I'm sorry.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,439
I know I shouldn't say these things.

104
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,939
It's rude.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,524
I couldn't help myself.

106
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,500
I've told you before, right? You and I are impossible.

107
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,459
So what if you have?

108
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,380
Are you dictating what I should do?

109
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:33,179
You ask why I do this to myself. Then why are you doing this?

110
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,599
It's easy for you to criticize others.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,286
You like her, but you don't like me.

112
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,360
I can't do anything about it.

113
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,200
But can't you at least find someone who treats you better?

114
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,819
At least, let me feel convinced.

115
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,399
I'm still trying to convince myself.

116
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,904
Who can give me a reasonable answer?

117
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:07,405
   

118
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:13,080
Auntie Jia, why can't I continue to stay here?

119
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,879
Because the hospital is a place for sick people.

120
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,140
Then I want to be sick a long time.

121
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,879
Don't be silly. You can't always be sick.

122
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,639
Later, a lady from the Women's Association will take you to the orphanage.

123
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,720
There will be lots of other children there.

124
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,140
And the teachers will teach you to read and write.

125
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,720
I don't have any money.

126
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
They're going to kick me out.

127
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,559
You don't need money there.

128
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,320
Is that true, Auntie Qin Qin?

129
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,679
Yes, that's right.

130
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,960
Then will you come play with me?

131
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,360
I will.

132
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Pinky promise.

133
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,599
♪ You make a pinky promise, you keep it all your life ♪

134
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,559
Doctor, my mom is having trouble breathing.

135
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,380
Come, hurry, sit down.

136
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,785
- How long has this gone on? 
 - About 40 minutes.

137
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,080
I'll give you a prescription for oxygen therapy first.

138
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,679
Oxygen therapy doesn't work.

139
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,240
It actually exacerbates the condition.

140
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,193
- Does she have any underlying illnesses? 
 - No.

141
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,360
She's been to your hospital many times.

142
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,939
She was given a clean bill of health.

143
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,860
Is this the usual symptom?

144
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,919
Yes. Every time, she says she can't breathe,

145
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,080
that it's hard to breathe.

146
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,656
But when we come to the hospital, we can't find anything wrong with her.

147
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,960
Don't panic.

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,920
Turn around.

149
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,059
Breathe in.

150
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,459
Breathe out.

151
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,919
Has she done a lung CT scan before?

152
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,419
Yes.

153
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,000
From this scan, everything looks fine.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,360
I also didn't find anything unusual when I listened to her lungs.

155
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,360
I think your mother could have psychological hysteria.

156
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,399
That means, physically, she's okay, but she believes otherwise.

157
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,759
When you keep giving yourself these psychological hints over a long period,

158
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,279
the body starts to overreact.

159
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,159
It's fine. It's nothing to worry about.

160
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,399
Doctor, at least give her some medication.

161
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,639
She doesn't need medication because she's not sick.

162
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,960
Aside from the breathing difficulty, do you have any other symptoms?

163
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,299
Director.

164
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,889
This symptom of yours, does it happen often?

165
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,240
- Yes. 
 - It comes and goes.

166
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,919
Get me a clean plastic bag.

167
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,319
Okay.

168
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,700
Relax. Let's try this.

169
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,909
It could work.

170
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:01,880
Now, now, relax. Hold this.

171
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,559
I think your mother is suffering from hyperventilation.

172
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,360
Due to the hyperventilation, her carbon dioxide level becomes low.

173
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,600
With the bag over her head, her carbon dioxide level can increase.

174
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Monitor it for a bit.

175
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,500
Here.

176
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,419
How do you feel now?

177
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,399
Much better.

178
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,661
I can catch my breath now.

179
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,159
It's not anything serious.

180
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:46,480
But I suggest that you go and see a psychiatrist.

181
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,440
"A psychiatrist"?

182
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,120
- Okay? 
 - Okay. Thank you.

183
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,520
Careful.

184
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,000
Take it easy.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
Xu Qin.

186
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,939
For a patient like her,

187
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:05,399
my first diagnosis is that she's reached menopause.

188
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,039
It's very likely that due to various circumstances in her life or family,

189
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,779
she's feeling a lot of stress and emotional distress.

190
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,313
Do you know what you did wrong?

191
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:21,419
As doctors, we're not only treating the illness.

192
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,639
We must also know to read a person.

193
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,559
Instructor, Instructor. What's the situation?

194
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,879
Eight hikers went up Phoenix Mountain and got trapped.

195
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,279
- How long has it been? 
 - They went in yesterday at noon.

196
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,879
The alert was sent this morning.

197
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,039
 Their GPS device isn't working. They only have a contour map. 

198
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,600
 They entered at the back of the mountain. 

199
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,039
They snuck in without getting an official permit.

200
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,320
The weather is bad. It rained the whole night on the mountain.

201
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,279
One of the victims' fathers called the local rescue team for help.

202
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,200
 In the end, the rescue team also got trapped. 

203
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,720
Do we have the exact location?

204
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,840
 Only a rough description. 

205
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,540
Okay, roger that.

206
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,600
When will that be?

207
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
How much longer?

208
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,679
You guys are finally here.

209
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,000
We just got here ourselves. The family members are very anxious.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,159
They want us to head up the mountain right away.

211
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,480
First, we have to be briefed.

212
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
We need to know where the victims are, at least.

213
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
I know that, but look...

214
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,240
We shouldn't rush in before getting to know the area.

215
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,320
Mr. Firefighter, our children have been out of reach for a day already.

216
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,904
Lives are at stake. Why aren't you guys going to save them yet?

217
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,200
How about this?

218
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,620
I'll pay. Is ¥100,000  (~$14,000)  enough?

219
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,240
No? I can add ¥50,000 more.

220
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,799
Or you name a price.

221
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,279
I'm willing to pay however much, so long as you rescue them right now.

222
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,960
This has nothing to do with money.

223
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,639
This isn't... this isn't about money!

224
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,440
Without first understanding the surrounding area,

225
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,840
we'll be acting irresponsibly toward the trapped.

226
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,440
Mr. Firefighter, my son is a senior-year student.

227
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,159
They all go to famous universities.

228
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,689
They're all future talents.

229
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:39,169
My sister is a freshman!

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Your kids are children.

231
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,240
Us firefighters are also someone else's children.

232
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,440
No matter whose child, they shouldn't be put at risk randomly.

233
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,559
Everyone, which one of you knows the back mountain terrain?

234
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,840
Yes, me.

235
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,679
I'm a local resident. I know this area.

236
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm going to set up the drone.

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,200
Actually, after listening to them talking,

238
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,559
my guess is that those kids aren't on the back mountain.

239
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,960
The terrain there is complicated. They probably found a stream and followed it.

240
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,399
They could have reached the main mountain.

241
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,519
- "Main mountain"? 
 - Yes.

242
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,859
- There's a boulder on the main mountain, too? 
 - Yes.

243
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,799
Where's the main mountain?

244
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,600
Right here. Take a look. At this spot.

245
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,399
Tell me if I marked it correctly.

246
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,120
- Is it here? 
 - Yes. There's also a boulder here.

247
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,759
The boulder is named Ji Ming Rock.

248
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,679
We often went there to pick medicinal herbs.

249
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,960
But the herbs became scarce, so we stopped going.

250
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,759
There are lots of snakes too. Not many go there now.

251
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,399
The terrain is even trickier there.

252
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,079
It'd be a problem if they were there.

253
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,040
Got it.

254
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,583
Everyone, please calm down.

255
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,000
- Captain. 
 - Gather around.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
I'll brief you on the situation.

257
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,600
Here's the thing.

258
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Look here. There are two similar boulders in this area.

259
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,039
The description given by the hikers previously could be wrong.

260
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:03,619
That led the civilian rescue team to Ying Zui Rock on the back mountain.

261
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:07,394
According to the local resident, there's a Ji Ming Rock on the main mountain.

262
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,497
This area is more remote and steeper.

263
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,336
It's much more attractive for adventurous hikers.

264
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,400
Take a look.

265
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,000
I flew the drone around the zone but didn't find anything.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,040
I think the previous rescue team failed to find them

267
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,476
because they took the wrong route from the start.

268
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:27,039
Thank goodness we didn't rush up the mountain just now.

269
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,219
Otherwise, we would've been trapped.

270
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,839
Everyone, prepare your gear. Get ready to go.

271
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,539
Yes, Sir.

272
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:47,559
If we locate the civilian rescue team first,

273
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,264
we'll meet up with you later.

274
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,839
Stay safe. Keep in contact.

275
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,960
Got it.

276
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,279
- Let's go. 
 - Head out!

277
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,779
Head out!

278
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,289
   

279
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,960
Have you eaten?

280
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,460
Yes.

281
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm going to the dry cleaners.

282
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,759
I'll go with you.

283
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,699
Are you still angry with me?

284
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,155
No.

285
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,639
I should apologize to you as well.

286
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:42,989
For what?

287
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,440
It was your birthday, but I still argued with you.

288
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,000
It ruined your birthday.

289
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,860
We weren't arguing.

290
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,260
We were... discussing.

291
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,039
Do you want to continue the discussion?

292
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,272
No, thanks.

293
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,129
After every discussion, there's a week-long silent treatment.

294
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,729
I've almost gone crazy.

295
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,400
Let's go.

296
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
I'll go with you.

297
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,219
This way. Watch your footing.

298
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,480
- Anyone there? 
 - Are you there?

299
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,732
Respond if you hear us!

300
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,000
We're firefighters!

301
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,920
- Anyone? 
 - Anyone there?

302
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,000
- Anyone there? 
 - Are you there?

303
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,680
Anyone there?

304
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,160
Song Yan, it's still a long way from here.

305
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,079
We've been trekking for three-plus hours. Let's take a break.

306
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,680
Anyone there?

307
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,119
Take a 2-minute break where you are!

308
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,680
Hand me the GPS.

309
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
- Do these two roads lead to the main mountain? 
 - Yes, both do.

310
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,000
- Which one is faster? 
 - This route is easier, but it's winding.

311
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,359
This route is more difficult, but shorter.

312
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,680
Getting to them is our priority. Take the shorter route.

313
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,519
Okay. This way then.

314
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,839
- Let's go! 
 - Yes, Sir.

315
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,439
Let's go!

316
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,140
Go.

317
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,359
Anyone there?

318
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,200
Anyone there?

319
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,839
We're firefighters!

320
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,920
Anyone there?

321
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,200
Everyone, watch where you're going.

322
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,359
Anyone there?

323
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,079
We're firefighters!

324
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,920
Respond if you hear us!

325
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,119
- Careful. 
 - Anyone?

326
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,920
We're firefighters!

327
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,759
Anyone there?

328
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,760
We're firefighters!

329
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,119
Anyone there?

330
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,400
- Anyone there? 
 - Give me a hand.

331
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,279
- Watch your step. 
 - Be careful.

332
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,419
- Anyone? 
 - Anyone there?

333
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,919
Quiet!

334
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,240
I hear people.

335
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,839
- Help! 
 - Help!

336
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,080
We're over here!

337
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,559
Over here!

338
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,599
We're here!

339
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,920
That way!

340
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,720
- Let's go. 
 - Careful, it's slippery!

341
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,759
Watch your step.

342
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,839
- Tread carefully. 
 - Watch your step.

343
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,519
How are things lately?

344
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,160
Same as always.

345
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,200
Mom wants me to join Guo Kun.

346
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,640
What's your plan then?

347
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,960
No plans.

348
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
I'll just delay as long as I can.

349
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,290
That's what you get for being brilliant. Your investment company is doing so well.

350
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,319
Are you being sarcastic?

351
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:35,227
Not at all.

352
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,079
But honestly,

353
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:42,759
I really admire you for being able to excel at something you don't like.

354
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,580
If it were me, I'd probably wreck it on purpose.

355
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,920
I guess I'm a perfectionist in some ways.

356
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,814
Whatever projects I get, I always want them to be perfect.

357
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,657
I don't like bad outcomes.

358
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,079
I think you're just too soft-hearted.

359
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,640
You don't like seeing our parents disappointed.

360
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,340
You're the same.

361
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,579
Brother.

362
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,100
If there was a time machine,

363
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,459
would you want to go back to the past or to the future?

364
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:16,319
Which stage of your life do you want to visit the most?

365
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,839
The past, perhaps.

366
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,299
Back to when you first came to our family.

367
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,259
What about you?

368
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,820
I'd go to the future, then.

369
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,981
I'd like to see what we've become in ten years.

370
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,039
Careful. It's all right.

371
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,640
Hang in there. We'll get you out.

372
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,279
It hurts. I can't take it.

373
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,599
It hurts.

374
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,199
It really hurts.

375
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,559
Come in, Command Center. Come in.

376
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,680
This is Shili Tai Fire and Rescue. This is Shili Tai Fire and Rescue.

377
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,519
We've found all the missing hikers.

378
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,200
All the missing hikers have been found.

379
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,240
Over.

380
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
 Roger that. 

381
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,759
 Come in, Command Center. I'm Li Bin of Wufang Fire Station. 

382
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,559
 We've found the missing civilian rescue team. We're preparing to come down the mountain. 

383
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,259
 Command Center copy. 

384
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,619
Hello?

385
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,640
 Dr. Xu, this is Song Yan. 

386
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm listening.

387
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
I have a lady here with a broken leg. The slightest touch induces pain.

388
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,680
Here's the thing. The temperature is dropping.

389
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,839
 We have to get her down the mountain. How should we do it? 

390
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,680
Is it an open or closed fracture?

391
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,400
- Open fracture. 
 - Do you have bandages and splints?

392
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,640
We do.

393
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,839
Junping, the first aid kit.

394
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,200
Here.

395
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,839
 First, apply compression to the wound to stop the bleeding. 

396
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:48,000
 Then secure it with a splint after bandaging to transport her. 

397
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,039
The spot where the splint touches the body should be well padded.

398
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,920
The two joints above and below the fracture have to be secured.

399
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,200
This is to limit movement.

400
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,920
Fix the proximal end of the fracture first, then the distal end.

401
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Keep her two legs together, with a thick padding in between.

402
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,480
Bandage it using the figure-of-eight method.

403
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,440
Make sure the toes are exposed.

404
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Pay attention to blood circulation at all times.

405
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,160
If the toes become numb, turn purplish, or become cold to the touch,

406
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,359
you'll have to readjust.

407
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,519
Got it. Thanks, Dr Xu.

408
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,619
Stay safe, Captain Song.

409
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:20,599
It's okay. Bear with it.

410
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,119
- Don't touch me! It's hurts too much. 
 - Bear with it.

411
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,280
It's all right. Don't worry.

412
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,380
Bear with it. It's okay.

413
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,720
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

414
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,240
It's getting colder.

415
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,440
We have to finish bandaging and get you down the mountain.

416
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,399
If hypothermia sets in, everyone here will be in danger.

417
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,340
Here, cover with this.

418
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,720
Try and keep warm.

419
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,620
Gentler.

420
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,199
Song Yan?

421
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,295
Is he really that great?

422
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,760
You two haven't seen each other in ten years.

423
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,300
Did it not occur to you that people could change?

424
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,440
Time could only change things that weren't firm enough to begin with.

425
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,720
- Qin Qin. 
 - Brother,

426
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,459
I know you want to say that there's no future for us.

427
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,652
But liking someone and being together are two different things.

428
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,655
I was wrong.

429
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:23,920
I shouldn't have said that the other day.

430
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,160
But did you stop to think?

431
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,640
Everything I said is stuff you must face one day.

432
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,259
When the time comes, then what?

433
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm scared of contradictions and confrontations.

434
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,719
I'm also afraid of picking up the pieces.

435
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,359
It's easiest for me to walk away.

436
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,680
But I no longer want to be a runaway soldier.

437
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,979
I won't be able to face myself then.

438
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,480
I know. With my current abilities,

439
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,160
I'm unable to resolve a lot of things.

440
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,160
But I have to face these inevitable consequences head-on.

441
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Be careful. It's slippery!

442
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
It's slippery!

443
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Everyone, watch your footing.

444
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,480
Slowly.

445
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,760
Careful. Here, give that to me.

446
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,759
It hurts!

447
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,559
- Don't worry. Hold on to the safety rope. 
 - Careful.

448
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,359
You will be fine.

449
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,699
Hang in there. We're almost there.

450
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,240
- Hang in there. Almost there. 
 - Hang in there.

451
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,279
- Just a little more. 
 - Slowly.

452
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,159
We're almost at the bottom.

453
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,289
Junping!

454
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:52,920
Watch it, careful.

455
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,900
 Junping! 

456
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,759
Captain!

457
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,119
Instructor!

458
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,900
I'm okay!

459
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,880
Junping, are you all right? What's the situation?

460
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,720
My foot is stuck.

461
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
I can't get it out.

462
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,299
Safety rope!

463
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,880
Get the safety rope!

464
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,280
Here.

465
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,999
Keep still. Let me take a look.

466
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,879
Song Yan, what's the situation?

467
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,220
Don't move.

468
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,720
He's stuck!

469
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,039
Can you guys hurry up?

470
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,480
I'm in so much pain.

471
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,440
I can't take it.

472
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,880
Hurry up!

473
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,302
It hurts.

474
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,119
Hey. It's too cold.

475
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,599
And we have injured members.

476
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,342
Can't we get the injured members out first?

477
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,219
Jiang Yu!

478
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,440
Get them out first!

479
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,000
Come back with a crowbar!

480
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,279
Okay, got it.

481
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,839
What else do you need down there?

482
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,839
Is there water?

483
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,759
Water, who has water?

484
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,119
- Water, anyone? 
 - We don't have any.

485
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,580
We drank it all. There's no more.

486
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,920
Everyone's out of water.

487
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,319
We'll split up.

488
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,039
I'll lead them down the mountain and bring back what you need.

489
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,359
Hang in there!

490
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,480
Okay!

491
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,180
Stay safe!

492
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,779
Can you hang on?

493
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:53,530

518
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,480
Yes, why are the firefighters taking so long?

519
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,960
Everyone, please remain calm!

520
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,640
The firefighters have gone in already. We'll hear from them soon.

521
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,240
- Keep calm, everyone. Keep calm. 
 - We've waited a day already.

522
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,640
Have something warm to eat.

523
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,160
- Have some water. 
 - No, I'll pass.

524
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,960
It's cold at night. Take an extra with you.

525
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,360
Okay.

526
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,219
Have some water.

527
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,640
I think I see someone.

528
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,619
- Is it them? 
 - There are lights.

529
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:28,640
Is it them?

530
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,260
They're back!

531
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,480
Hey, come quick!

532
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,960
They're out! Come quick!

533
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,380
- Hurry up! 
 - Watch your step.

534
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,640
Everyone, remain calm. Please make way.

535
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
Excuse us. Please make way.

536
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
Make way.

537
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,919
Quickly, to the hospital.

538
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,919
Careful.

539
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,240
Dad!

540
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,799
Dad, I was so scared!

541
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,240
Wait a minute. Instructor, that's...

542
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,619
Thank goodness you're okay.

543
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,759
Where's Song Yan?

544
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,440
One of our team members got stuck in a ravine. He's still up there with him.

545
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,359
Then what are we waiting for? Xiao Bin, grab the crowbar.

546
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,440
You two, follow me to rescue them.

547
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,396
Pi Pi, Ge Zheng, Dapeng, Jiang Yi!

548
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,440
 Here! 

549
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,200
Go up and bring Captain Song back!

550
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,359
 - Captain! 
 - Captain! 

551
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,159
 Junping! 

552
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,360
 Captain! 

553
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,859
Junping!

554
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:59,359
- Captain! 
 - Captain!

555
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,529
Junping!

556
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:02,570
Junping!

557
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,920
- Captain! 
 - Captain!

558
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Captain!

559
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Captain?

560
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,900
Captain!

561
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,079
- Captain! 
 - Captain!

562
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,779
Junping!

563
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,719
Ambulance! Quickly!

564
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,705
Get him to the hospital.

565
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,360
Old Jiang.

566
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,320
Here you go.

567
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,820
Cover yourself up.

568
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,979
Here, quick. Drink some water.

569
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:53,559
- Instructor Jiang. 
 - Jiang Yi.

570
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,199
Give me a minute.

571
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,899
Eat something.

572
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,419
Eat this.

573
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm fine.

574
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,320
Save the food for the hikers and their families.

575
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,839
What hikers and families? They're long gone.

576
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,720
They already left?

577
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,960
They used the excuse of taking the hikers to the hospital.

578
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,500
It's probably so they could avoid the press and possible punishment.

579
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,579
Who would punish them?

580
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,840
You're not sleeping?

581
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,240
Aren't you tired?

582
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,519
I'm fine.

583
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,132
Do you...

584
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,339
come across these incidents often?

585
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,459
If we're looking at the frequency, it's been decreasing year by year

586
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,980
because the environment is improving.

587
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,019
It really sucks having to deal with these things.

588
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,528
Are you already complaining over such a small matter?

589
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,280
Objectively, such difficulties aren't that bad.

590
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,332
It's the mental pressure...

591
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,101
that bothers me.

592
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,610
I told you a long time ago.

593
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,507
You're too idealistic.

594
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,734
You've been under a glass cover too long. 
  (T/N: protected) 

595
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,340
Are you attacking me again?

596
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,740
I'm not.

597
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,120
Your performance today was quite good.

598
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:08,099
Since we're on the topic, be frank with me.

599
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,300
Do you really think I'm idealistic?

600
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,132
Did you think...

601
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:18,805
I chose this career because I wanted glory?

602
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:21,239
Or perhaps a short-lived passion?

603
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,380
When the passion is gone,

604
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,960
so is the halo,

605
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,580
and then my ideals are shattered?

606
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,619
Your critique is really accurate.

607
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,160
Let me tell you the truth.

608
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,559
I thought long and hard before I made the decision.

609
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,659
Like you said, I did have a lot of options.

610
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:50,308
But that doesn't mean my choice...

611
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,400
isn't as serious or worthy as yours.

612
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,059
I never thought about glory or wanting to be a hero.

613
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:03,059
I just purely like this job.

614
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,609
I wish to contribute to it.

615
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:08,417
You could even say

616
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,899
I wish to become better day by day.

617
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,760
You know something?

618
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,059
Every time I'm in the shower, and the water splashes on my head,

619
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,702
three things pop into my mind.

620
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,407
I hope to integrate into the team quickly.

621
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,677
I hope to become stronger.

622
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,747
And I hope I can do more

623
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,417
for the fire station.

624
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,000
I said so much. Why don't you respond?

625
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,600
Say something.

626
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
I guess we share...

627
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,380
some similar thoughts.

628
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,211
I'll take that as a compliment.

629
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:36,708
   

630
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,508
   

631
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:50,393
   

632
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,999
 The gifts arrived long ago. 
   

633
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,480
 What took you guys so long? 

634
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,280
- The traffic was terrible. 
 - Come, let's get the stuff.

635
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,320
Here, you take this one.

636
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,599
- Okay. 
 - I'll take that.

637
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,391
The flowers are so lovely.

638
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,426
- Thanks. 
 - Let's go.

639
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:50,246
Thank you, Sir.

640
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:52,960
- Hello. Hello. 
 - Hello.

641
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,440
We're here to visit Brother Liu Junping.

642
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,859
Okay, please hold on.

643
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Hey, we're here to see you.

644
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,174
- Brother Ping. 
 - Hello, Squad Leader.

645
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:16,079
- Squad Leader. 
 - All of you came?

646
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,280
Hi, Squad Leader!

647
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,440
You didn't have to buy gifts.

648
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,320
Buy? You're thinking too much.

649
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,840
These are gifts from enthusiastic citizens.

650
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,360
Junping, you'd better recover quickly.

651
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,619
Just now, a few young ladies were outside hoping to see you.

652
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,699
- Seriously? 
 - Really!

653
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,139
Then shouldn't I look more presentable?

654
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:34,880
No need for that.

655
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,119
Captain said that your main job right now is to rest and recuperate.

656
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,280
Too big of a crowd gets in the way of your recovery.

657
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,599
So they were turned away.

658
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,199
They left?

659
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,599
Th-The girls left, but the fruit and flowers were left behind.

660
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,439
Here you go, Squad Leader.

661
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,280
Are we leaving the fruit?

662
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,800
Too much fruit brings heat.

663
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,559
Wait, you're not giving me the fruit?

664
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,159
Take them away.

665
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,039
- You're really taking them? 
 - Yes.

666
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,199
You should

667
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,599
at least leave some that doesn't cause heat.

668
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:05,039
"Doesn't cause heat"?

669
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:07,599
- Have an apple, Squad Leader. 
 - Apples don't cause heat.

670
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,840
- An orange for good luck. 
 - A bit of orange is okay.

671
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,480
Squad Leader, the rest all cause heat.

672
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,239
Indeed. Lychees are the worst.

673
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,159
Enough, you all. Scram.

674
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,280
- Thanks, Squad Leader! 
 - Thank you, Squad Leader!

675
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,639
Keep the flowers. They're beautiful.

676
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,739
Thanks, Brother Yang.

677
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,379
Get well soon.

678
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,599
Eat it slowly. Take it easy.

679
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
They're gone.

680
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,679
So is the fruit.

681
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:49,300


682
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,640
 "Fireworks of My Heart" - Na Ying

♫  Invited to the passion of never-ending summer  ♫

697
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,070
♫  The brave one can venture alone, crossing the abysses and cliffs  ♫

698
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:38,000
♫  Doesn't matter if it's painful stepping on flames   ♫

699
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,890
♫  The ones who are lost in the story, have they found their home yet?  ♫

700
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,840
♫  Whispering sweet words under the light, yearning for you  ♫

701
00:44:49,840 --> 00:45:01,560
♫  Without you under the firework, this home is incomplete  ♫
