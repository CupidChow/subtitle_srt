00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,545
   

3
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:37,085
   

4
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:40,112
   

5
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:04,706
   

6
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,999
- Fall in line! 
 - Yes, Madam!

7
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,199
Half turn to the left. Turn!

8
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,020
Recite!

9
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,940
Yancheng Firefighting Oath!

10
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,019
Together with fellow firefighters,

11
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,520
we will safeguard the peace of our homeland!

12
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,239
Ready to brave fire and water,

13
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,400
 putting people above all, never deterring! 

14
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,199
 This is our duty! 

15
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,719
 We will keep our watch through the night! 

16
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,439
 The years will be eventful! 

17
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,919
 Engraved with illustrious feats, our footsteps shall be light! 

18
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,439
 We will be stoic and proud, 

19
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,259
 never forgetting our roots, answering the needs of the people! 

20
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,039
 Our responsibility is to protect our land! 

21
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,879
 We fear no hardship! 

22
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,719
 We are always at the ready! 

23
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,520
 We will do everything we can! 

24
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,920
 The water dragon will subdue the fire and stop buildings from collapsing! 

25
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
 We will go into the fire to save lives from burning! 

26
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,620
Salute!

27
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,500
Instructor.

28
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,799
Come visit us often.

29
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,799
Instructor.

30
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,920
I haven't become your best soldier yet.

31
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,639
Please don't go.

32
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,959
I'll definitely train hard.

33
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,759
I believe in you.

34
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,900
You'll surely become an outstanding firefighter.

35
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
- Instructor. 
 - That's enough.

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Da Peng, don't be like that.

37
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,140
You're making it harder for the instructor.

38
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,999
Take care.

39
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,363
Instructor.

40
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:33,055
When you're free, come back and visit.

41
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,812
My job there will be hectic.

42
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,279
And it's far from here.

43
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,560
Even if I said I'd return, I can't be sure to fulfill it.

44
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,399
So I'll just say one thing.

45
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,560
Be safe.

46
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,639
I really wish I could go on another mission with the instructor.

47
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,779
Just shut up.

48
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:54,859
 Hengfan Road, an office building in Xi Shi Center, is on fire. 

49
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,399
You jinxed it!

50
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,199
 Two water trucks, two foam trucks. 

51
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,489
 Hengfan Road, an office building in Xi Shi Center, is on fire. 

52
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,391
 Two water trucks, two foam trucks.

54

80
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,979
Suo Jun.

81
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,480
The chief sent a car to get me.

82
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,259
The traffic was bad, so it took longer.

83
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,539
Thank goodness I made it.

84
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,234
Why did you come?

85
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,203
I came to take you home.

86
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm sorry.

87
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,359
Fool.

88
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,577
It's fine as long as you're back.

89
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,007
This time, you can finally keep your promise to me.

90
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Let's go home.

91
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,500
What do you think of those men from last time?

92
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,879
Let me think some more.

93
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,799
Just give me a name.

94
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,039
Qin Qin.

95
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,480
Right now, you're at the perfect age to be dating.

96
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,317
I left the photos at the condo. I'll go back and take a look.

97
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,399
I have extra copies here.

98
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
Pour yourself some tea.

99
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,759
First impression.

100
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,038
Let's go with your intuition.

101
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,519
Let me see.

102
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,520
Jiang Yu.

103
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,248
You and I share the same taste.

104
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,808
I also think this young man is really good.

105
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,088
Okay.

106
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,399
I'll send your WeChat contact to his mother.

107
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,519
Remember to reply to him.

108
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,499
I'll go upstairs first.

109
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,759
Wait.

110
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,320
Take the photo.

111
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,759
It's such nice tea.

112
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,939
You should keep this for yourself, Sir.

113
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
I'm gifting it to you!

114
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,960
You don't want it?

115
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,879
Did the sun rise from the west today?

116
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,083
I understand. You're not happy.

117
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,720
Suo Jun was reassigned.

118
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,559
W-Well, there was nothing we could do.

119
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,040
He's injured.

120
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,421
You know his condition.

121
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,360
I'll follow the arrangements.

122
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:58,279
You and Suo Jun lived, ate and worked together for almost eight years, right?

123
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,679
This kind of friendship and camaraderie can't be replaced.

124
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,919
However, this is the nature of the job.

125
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,199
In iron-clad barracks with ever-moving soldiers,

126
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:15,320
there's no position that allows good friends to work together forever.

127
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,205
Am I right?

128
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:20,294
I hope you'll get over this incident.

129
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:23,100
Don't let it affect your work in the future.

130
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,679
Understood.

131
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,120
Rest assured, Sir.

132
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,000
I won't let it affect my work.

133
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,260
Then show me your teeth.

134
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,800
Such a handsome young man.

135
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,860
You have to go with the flow!

136
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,140
Finished.

137
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,519
All right, what's your critique?

138
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,319
Any critique?

139
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,480
Lead them back.

140
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
Okay.

141
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,279
All present, listen to my command.

142
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,419
All, look to the right!

143
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,879
Look forward!

144
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,919
Not bad. You guys did well.

145
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,899
All present, turn right!

146
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,134
Squad leaders, take your squads back.

147
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,120
Go on, keep up.

148
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,899
Dr. Xu.

149
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,480
Dr. Xu, something happened.

150
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,079
Chen Min is awake, but she's very distraught.

151
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,240
She won't cooperate with the treatment and says it's too painful.

152
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,319
- What does she want then? 
 - To kill herself!

153
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,919
What?

154
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,079
 - Get out! 
 - Please calm down. 

155
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,000
 - Listen to— 
 - Get out! 

156
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,519
 - Please stop. 
 - Leave, all of you! 

157
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,780
Calm down.

158
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,279
 Calm down! 

159
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,459
Min Min, my dear Min Min.

160
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,920
Doctor.

161
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,100
- We're so sorry. We'll talk to her. 
 - Calm down, okay?

162
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,342
Sorry for the trouble.

163
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,279
- It's okay. 
 - Sorry for the trouble. 
 - She can't—

164
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,180
I'm sorry. So sorry.

165
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,279
Xiao Min,

166
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,179
it's all right.

167
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,200
Officer, is there anyone trapped upstairs?

168
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,123
We've already evacuated the upstairs residents.

169
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,623
Noted.

170
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,279
Jun Ping, what's the reading?

171
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,480
It's currently within safe limits.

172
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,799
Old Jiang, break down the door.

173
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,399
Got it.

174
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,039
Captain, we're heading in.

175
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,502
Disperse the crowd. Get the fire under control.

176
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,419
Quickly.

177
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,559
Mister. Mister? Can you hear me?

178
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,920
Wake up, Mister.

179
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,850
Come, give me a hand.

180
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,780
Here. Onto my back.

181
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Okay.

182
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,079
Stretcher!

183
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,919
- Get the stretcher! 
 - Quick, the stretcher!

184
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,200
Here.

185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,900
Help me out.

186
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,835
Here.

187
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,479
Wake up.

188
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,179
Wake up.

189
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,040
You're okay, Mister.

190
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,160
You're safe now. Don't worry.

191
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,129
What...

192
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,839
Did you save me?

193
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,160
Yes.

194
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,195
Let's take you to the hospital.

195
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,619
Here.

196
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:32,559
Sit up.

197
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,259
Slowly.

198
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,424
Why did you save me?

199
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,719
Why did you stop me from dying?

200
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,239
Why did you keep me from dying?

201
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,599
- It's okay. 
 - Old Yang.

202
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,140
It's okay. It's fine.

203
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,740
Why did you stop me from dying?

204
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,499
Why did you keep me from dying?

205
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,039
Doctor.

206
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,400
Sorry about that. We caused trouble for you.

207
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,680
So sorry.

208
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,920
Sir, Ma'am, let me talk to Chen Min alone.

209
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,640
Chen Min, I hope you can get your emotions under control.

210
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,800
You can save your breath.

211
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,279
It's better for me to just die.

212
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,416
I don't want to burden my parents.

213
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,036
And I won't have to suffer anymore.

214
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,599
I know where you're coming from.

215
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,200
But if you feel bad about burdening your parents,

216
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,079
I can assure you.

217
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,920
Parents are the last people on Earth who'd think their child is a burden.

218
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,597
But if it's the pain you're worried about,

219
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:08,920
I can give you my word as a doctor that we'll do our best to minimize the pain.

220
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,119
Please have more courage.

221
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,079
"Courage"? How am I supposed to be brave?

222
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,719
I'm the one whose face got ruined. Not you.

223
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,359
I'd rather die than live like this!

224
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,200
There's no option for me!

225
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,039
Who would want to see my face on broadcasts?

226
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:26,519
I'll never be able to find love again!

227
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,000
So don't tell me what I should do!

228
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,279
- Get out! 
 - Calm down.

229
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,240
I said, "Get out!" Get out!

230
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
- Don't touch me. Get out! 
 - Okay.

231
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,187
I won't touch you, okay?

232
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:37,164
Dr. Yang, let's leave first.

233
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,584
Give her some time to calm down.

234
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,481
Okay, calm down. We'll leave.

235
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,046
I said those things out of concern.

236
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:48,310
We all know. She's just not in the right frame of mind. Don't let it bother you.

237
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,359
Go away! Leave me alone!

238
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,567
You're not the ones with a scarred face.

239
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,471
You'd never understand what I'm feeling.

240
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:22,000
Do you think you're the only one who was unlucky?

241
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,720
You know what?

242
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,279
The firefighter who saved you suffered burns on his face.

243
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,480
His arm sustained permanent damage.

244
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,659
He's no longer fit to be dispatched and was forced to retire.

245
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,519
The person he risked his life to rescue

246
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,680
now wishes to die?

247
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,759
Then the sacrifice he made is all a joke .

248
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,319
Yang Chi.

249
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,919
Captain.

250
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,319
Don't keep any misgivings to yourself.

251
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,319
I'm fine.

252
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,039
We often got rebuked before too.

253
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,119
When the Curtain City caught fire, the roof caved in.

254
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,201
But people still criticized us, saying that we were cowards for not rushing in.

255
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,559
You say this all the time.

256
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,518
In life, misunderstandings outnumber understanding.

257
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,319
It's normal for people to misunderstand.

258
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,599
Well, I'll continue my work.

259
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,639
How is that firefighter now?

260
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,000
He remains his beloved's fiancé

261
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,480
and his parents' son.

262
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,240
Those who truly love him won't mind how he looks.

263
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,119
Dr. Xu.

264
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm really scared.

265
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,759
So scared.

266
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,694
You were successfully rescued.

267
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,929
So do your best to live on.

268
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,500
Put your bet on a good outcome.

269
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,367
What if it's a bad one?

270
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,137
How bad can it be?

271
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,720
Nothing's worse than death.

272
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,660
Because to die,

273
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,820
means there is no longer any possibility.

274
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,960
I know what you're saying.

275
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,640
I also know that I should be strong.

276
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,400
I should be brave. I should face it.

277
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,720
But...

278
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,039
But I really can't take it.

279
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,659
I can't accept it.

280
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,960
You don't have to accept it.

281
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,559
We don't have to face hardship with a smile,

282
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,234
let alone calmly accept it.

283
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,905
It doesn't stop you from moving forward.

284
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:06,820
One day,

285
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,680
while you tread forward, you'll realize

286
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,419
that some hardships still remain in the corner.

287
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:15,552
But they're no longer important.

288
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,040
Because you...

289
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,620
have already started a new life.

290
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,400
Chen Min agreed to have surgery?

291
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,240
That's right.

292
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,279
Dr. Xu managed to persuade her?

293
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,880
What did she say?

294
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,559
Who knows?

295
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,499
Dr. Xu is truly a curiosity of the hospital.

296
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
I'm off.

297
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,980
You all chat.

298
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,319
- Let's go. 
 - We're off work.

299
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,880
Whatever. Let's just go.

300
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,420
- We're off work. 
 - Hurry up.

301
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:18,460
   

302
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,990
   

303
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:13,979
Chief Xu.

304
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,599
Please enter.

305
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,880
Mom.

306
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,599
Mom, we're back.

307
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,960
Yan Chen,

308
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,259
I have something to ask you.

309
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,179
What's this about?

310
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:27,990
   

311
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,640
Mom.

312
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm a grown adult.

313
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,864
Why are you still checking my balance?

314
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,580
If I hadn't checked,

315
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,858
I wouldn't have known about the ¥100,000 fine.

316
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,060
What worries your dad and I most is that you two might go astray.

317
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:55,759
We don't ever want to see you two doing anything immoral.

318
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,119
Explain it to me.

319
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,979
I-I have a friend.

320
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,260
He got arrested for selling fake goods.

321
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,531
I helped him pay the fine.

322
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,399
I believe you.

323
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,180
Sit down.

324
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,640
Come.

325
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,739
Qin Qin, sit over here.

326
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,880
Have you met up with Jiang Yu?

327
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,700
Mom, I've been quite busy at work lately.

328
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,400
You always say you're busy.

329
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,480
If I didn't ask, you'd never come back.

330
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I can talk to the associate dean about giving you a less taxing job.

331
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,839
How about that?

332
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,960
He's tried to ask you out a couple times already,

333
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,440
but you always say you're busy.

334
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,279
What if he stops asking?

335
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,320
This time, be proactive. You ask him out.

336
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,904
Do it right now.

337
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:05,704
Text him.

338
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,426
I sent it.

339
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,279
It's okay to be restrained.

340
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,460
But Jiang Yu's family and ours are of a similar status.

341
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,559
So... there's no need to be so formal.

342
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,079
All right, you may go.

343
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,300
I'll be upstairs then.

344
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,580
Out with it.

345
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,559
What was the money really for?

346
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,979
Does it have anything to do with that Song guy?

347
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,720
You two dared to do such a thing under my nose.

348
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,219
Are you trying to be their Cupid?

349
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,419
Mom.

350
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,799
I wasn't trying to help them.

351
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,259
Regardless, you shouldn't have helped her.

352
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,180
You've learned to lie now.

353
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,319
Welcome.

354
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,379
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thanks.

355
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,379
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

356
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,000
Take a seat.

357
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,600
 I'm sorry. I hope I'm not late. 

358
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,440
 No, I just got here myself. 

359
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
 What would you like to drink? 

360
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,000
 Iced Americano. 

361
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,240
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

362
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,680
- One iced Americano. 
 - Okay.

363
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,339
- And a glass of water, thanks. 
 - Sure.

364
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,659
So, you're a surgeon?

365
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:53,119
Yes.

366
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,500
You must be quite busy then.

367
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,480
- Water for you. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

368
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,380
It's not too bad.

369
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,839
I would guess it's quite tiring being a doctor.

370
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,010
   

371
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,160
Do you get two consecutive days off?

372
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,219
We do.

373
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:33,839
Then h-how come you couldn't make it to the date we set last week?

374
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:37,582
I'm in the Emergency Department.

375
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,552
We go by shifts.

376
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,100
 - Your iced Americano. Enjoy. 
 - Thanks. 

377
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,320
Do you like this music?

378
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,800
- Yes. 
 - So do I.

379
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,880
I've seen many versions of the "Swan Lake" world tour.

380
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
Really?

381
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,119
Which casts did you see?

382
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,299
Because they alternate between Team A and Team B,

383
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,939
- I watched the one I— 
 - Excuse me.

384
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,060
What's the matter?

385
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,239
Something came up at the hospital.

386
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,559
I have to go.

387
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm really sorry.

388
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,700
Take care.

389
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:58,559
   

390
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:13,731
   

391
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:26,699
   

392
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,713
   

393
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:52,955
   

394
00:36:09,194 --> 00:36:15,045
   

395
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,880
That boy, Suo Jun, left just like that.

396
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,480
I really feel bad for him.

397
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,760
He's tough. He'll get through it.

398
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,199
But I do agree with what he said before he left.

399
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,539
You really should have a life outside of work.

400
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,280
But I understand.

401
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,120
You're... still thinking of Xu Qin, aren't you?

402
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,840
- Mrs. He! 
 - Mrs. He!

403
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,000
Slow down!

404
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,959
Miao.

405
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,280
- Yan is back? 
 - Mrs. He.

406
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,039
You brought so much good food.

407
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,159
You must try this cured meat from my hometown.

408
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,519
Great! Let me serve some on a platter.

409
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,540
There's no rush. I'll leave it all with you.

410
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,579
That won't do.

411
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,559
Yan.

412
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,840
How is it going? Do you have a girlfriend yet?

413
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,440
Not yet.

414
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,639
No wonder your aunt is anxious.

415
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,880
You have great qualifications.

416
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,079
Tell me. What type of girl are you looking for?

417
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,599
Do you like someone outgoing or someone more reserved?

418
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,440
 Dong Mei. 

419
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,414
This is freshly made chili sauce from Zhai's family home.

420
00:37:54,414 --> 00:37:56,760
You have to try it. It's really fragrant.

421
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,159
I can already smell it.

422
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,819
It must be good mixed with rice.

423
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:02,760
Look how nice the boy is.

424
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,199
He even helps with menial work.

425
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,800
Not like my Kang Kang, who only knows to play games.

426
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,860
Oh, hush. Kang Kang is good, too.

427
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,360
I better go back. I have stew cooking.

428
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,580
Yan, come visit when you're free.

429
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,380
What was I talking about just now?

430
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,800
Right, I was saying

431
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,559
that nowadays, society thinks differently.

432
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,149
It's not like before when you should marry within your own class.

433
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,853
Aunt.

434
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,660
Just speak your mind.

435
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,039
What I mean is,

436
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:54,199
although it's no longer encouraged, old sayings still hold true in some ways.

437
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,840
When the family status is too different, it's hard to be happy together.

438
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,679
Here's the thing. Right now, it's not about your compatibility with her

439
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,840
or whether you two should date or not.

440
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,719
This is about two families.

441
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,759
- Say, if— 
 - I get it.

442
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,379
You don't have to worry. I know what to do.

443
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,900
Where's Uncle?

444
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,239
Your uncle found a recipe for stinky mandarin fish online.

445
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,594
He wanted to make it for you.

446
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:22,000
So he went out to buy fish.

447
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,459
What time is it? Why is he not back yet?

448
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:29,859
Anyway, about what I said, take it to heart.

449
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,339
Don't make things hard for yourself.

450
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,920
I'm sure the hospital food isn't very good.

451
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,620
Eat more.

452
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:46,000
Actually, the food there is rather good.

453
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,994
That's enough, Mom. You eat.

454
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,840
Your dark eye circles are showing.

455
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,519
Did you meet with Jiang Yu?

456
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,480
We exchanged texts and met for coffee.

457
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,000
But something came up at the hospital, so I left early.

458
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,019
That busy?

459
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:12,039
I think you're more suited to do research work at a university.

460
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,920
I'll get you a new job.

461
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,760
I'm quite happy where I am now.

462
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,079
What's there to be happy about?

463
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,239
You're getting skinnier and skinnier.

464
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,920
It's the same with your brother.

465
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,139
I introduced so many nice ladies to him, but he wasn't interested in any.

466
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:29,999
I don't know what you two are thinking. Getting married early is a good thing.

467
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,579
Mom,

468
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:38,259
there's a guy I'm interested in.

469
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,880
I suppose you could say I like him.

470
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,719
Jiang Yu?

471
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,639
No.

472
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,646
Then from which family?

473
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,939
Previously, when I was studying abroad,

474
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,180
did you receive any letters addressed to me?

475
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,040
What?

476
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,620
It's nothing.

477
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:29,880
I'm full.

478
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,979
I'll be going now. I have work tomorrow.

479
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,180
Qin Qin.

480
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,139
Don't make me...

481
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,200
become the bad guy again.

482
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,040
   

483
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,240

♫  Even if it's like dust, drifting in the wind  ♫

497
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:16,470
♫  I'm searching for the answer to happiness  ♫

498
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:20,930
♫  For those who are young and single  ♫

499
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,950
♫  Have you found the one for you?  ♫

500
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:29,680
♫  Invited to the passion of never-ending summer  ♫

501
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,860
♫  The brave one can venture alone  ♫

502
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,830
♫  Crossing the abysses and cliffs  ♫

503
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:41,780
♫  Doesn't matter if it's painful stepping on flames   ♫

504
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,590
♫  The ones who are lost in the story, have they found their home yet?  ♫

505
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:53,490
♫  Whispering sweet words under the light, yearning for you  ♫

506
00:44:53,490 --> 00:45:06,820
♫  Without you under the firework, this home is incomplete  ♫
