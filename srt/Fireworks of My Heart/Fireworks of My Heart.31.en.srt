They don't take patients' lives seriously.

5
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,340
Guys.

6
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
Guys.

7
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,140
Please come down first.

8
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,930
We can talk about it

9
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
in the meeting room.

10
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,539
Okay?

11
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,300
Madam.

12
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,820
It's cold out here.

13
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,729
Let's talk inside.

14
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,570
No!

15
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,300
What's there to talk about with you?

16
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,700
My daughter-in-law

17
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,020
was such a good person.

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,580
She was filial

19
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,340
and capable.

20
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,620
She died because of you.

21
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,850
If you don't compensate us,

22
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,490
we will...

23
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,419
There's nothing to talk about.

24
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,699
Compensate us.

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,730
If you want to talk, do it here.

26
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,820
Just tell us.

27
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,930
Will you compensate us or not?

28
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,070
Young man.

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,770
We live in a society ruled by law.

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,280
We need to be reasonable, right?

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,500
If you really can't make peace with it,

32
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,820
get a lawyer and file a lawsuit.

33
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,570
Right?

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,500
Get a lawyer?

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,540
File a lawsuit?

36
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,300
It's easy for you to say.

37
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,340
We have no money or power.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,980
Follow me.

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,620
Be ready to act anytime.

40
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,170
Listen,

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,500
you have to compensate us.

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,460
Compensate us!

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,020
Young man, come down first.

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,180
If you can't make peace with it,

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,890

46

47
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,460
Look. This is...

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,460
You two, come down first.

49

We can talk.

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,579
Okay?

51
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,860
No.

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,230
Listen up.

53
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,820
I'm telling you today.

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,540
Even if I have to die.

55
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,190
How your hospital has been harming people.

56
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,700
Come on.

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,320
Let's find someone down there to judge.

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,070
Officer.

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,780
Don't come over!

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,050
Calm down!

61
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,980
Young man, don't go with your impulses.

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm warning you one last time.

63
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,380
If you don't solve the problem,

64
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,410
I'll jump.

65
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,740
Don't jump!

66
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,780
Please don't jump!

67
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,620
You won't jump.

68
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,540
Sister-in-law.

69
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,460
What did you say?

70
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm telling you.

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,690
If I die,

72
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,450
your hospital will suffer too.

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,579
It's none of your business.

74
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,470
Xu, go back now.

75
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,190
Don't come over!

76

Xu.

77
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,820
Don't come over!

78
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,450
Don't come over!

79
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,100
Son.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,750
Stop looking.

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,700
The floor is not high.

82
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,320
You won't die if you fall.

83
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,200
You may break your arms or legs

84
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,430
at most.

85
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,490
If worse, you may have paraplegia

86
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,590
and have to lie in bed forever.

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,050
Are you even a human?

88
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,770
Your hospital

89
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,800
killed my daughter-in-law.

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,450
You have to compensate us.

91
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,600
-Compensate!/N-Compensate us!

92
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,780
Compensate us!

93
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,420
Come down first.

94
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,530
Do you know why the hospital

95
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,740
can't give you money?

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,090
I don't care!

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,840
Compensate us!

98
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
If the hospital compensates you,

99
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,570
it'll become a stain for Dr. Yang.

100
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,660
Dr. Yang has been studying medicine for ten years.

101
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,070
She traveled everywhere to study.

102
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,620
She reached this level

103
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,580
step by step.

104
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,350
Indeed,

105
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,670
doctors also work to provide for their family.

106
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,339
But some doctors

107
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,860
have faith

108
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,970
in this profession.

109
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,800
Their purpose is to save lives,

110
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,520
to break through academic boundaries,

111
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,260
and to create miracles for the whole industry,

112
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,150
or even the entire human species.

113
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,410
It's not to be defiled

114
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,860
by vexatious people like you.

115
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,980
Do you know how much

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,300
schools, hospitals, and our country

117
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,680
need to invest

118
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,430
to cultivate

119
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,700
such an excellent doctor?

120
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,900
Why should her future

121
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,560
be ruined

122
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,780
by people like you?

123
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,080
You said we are vexatious.

124
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,300
You were just making that up.

125
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,620
Whether you're vexatious or not

126
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,960
is up to justice.

127
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,500
Justice will also give you an answer

128
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,590
for your daughter-in-law's death.

129
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,830
You don't have to be noble

130
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,330
in life.

131
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,730
You only need to be independent

132
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,680
and not be a burden on the society.

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,710
But take a look.

134
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,150
How many public resources are occupied by you?

135
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,070
Take a look at the firefighters and policemen

136
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,360
waiting to save you.

137
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,300
They didn't choose their career

138
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,570
to risk their lives

139
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,410
for you.

140
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
As a man,

141
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,720
you're irresponsible and incompetent.

142
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,260
Your wife already passed away,

143
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,500
and you are still using her to extort money.

144
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,590
What did you say?

145
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,320
What kind of man

146
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,960
are you?

147
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,950
I'll kill you!

148
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,200
Son!

149
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,650
Stop him!

150
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,630
Check how bad they are injured.

151
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm okay.

152
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,440
Chi.

153
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:37,930
I'm okay.

154
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,780
Help her up.

155
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,420
Come with me.

156
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,070
Are you alright, Chi?

157
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,170
I'm okay.

158
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,210
What were you doing just now?

159
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,560
How risky it was!

160
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,590
Sorry.

161
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,020
I didn't think that much.

162
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,700
I know you meant well,

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,670
but you're a medical worker.

164
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,950
There were firefighters there.

165
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,940
Why did you step up?

166
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,500
Nothing happened, right?

167
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,450
Indeed, nothing happened.

168
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,740
But what if something happened?

169
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,430
Also,

170
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
if someone

171
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,420
with ulterior motives

172
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,720
recorded what you said and posts it online,

173
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,200
you won't be able to defend yourself.

174
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,020
Young people do lack social experience.

175
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,280
You are usually calm.

176
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,040
How could you be so impulsive

177
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,310
in this matter?

178
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,900
If you want to punish me,

179
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,020
go ahead.

180
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,500
If I want to punish you,

181
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,460
I would have done it by now.

182
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,320
I also hope

183
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,940
we can minimize the influence

of this matter.

185
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,780
Take it as a lesson.

186

You.

187
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,350
Go back, drink some warm water,

188

189
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,410

[China Fire and Rescue]

192
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,900
My family found out about what happened that day.

193
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,650
They asked me to request a job transfer.

194

Do you want to?

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,230
No, I don't.

196
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,780
It doesn't matter if I don't want to.

197
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,750
You said it yourself.

198
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,300
I'm already like this.

199
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,650
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

200
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,820
It's not a pity for

201
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,860
a person with no value to the company

202
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,060
to leave.

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,310
Who said that?

205
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,270
You did.

206
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,420
You said I couldn't do any work

207
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,250
in the front line or on the basic level.

208
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,220
That was in the past.

209
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,450
What about now?

210
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,930
If you want to leave,

211
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,750
you can.

212
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,310
But if you don't want to leave,

213
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,940
then don't.

214
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,600
But if I don't leave,

215
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,320
I have to give my family an explanation.

216
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,000
That's easy.

217

This doesn't count as a reason.

220
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,540
Maybe you can get another supervisor.

221
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,860
They might be more valuable

222
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,820
and better at work than me.

223
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,010
I need you too.

224
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,940
Alright?

225
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,800
You've only been dilly-dallying

226
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,180
for me to say this, right?

227
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,410
You know that?

228
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,300
Say it again.

229
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,590
What did you just say?

230
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,010
Come on.

231
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,160
Let's go.

232
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,559

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,870

Song Yan.

239
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,400
Qin.

240
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,260
Is that her?

241
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,980
It's her.

242
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,990
Qin.

243
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,220
You're back.

244
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,630
Uncle. Aunt.

245
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,740
What are you doing here?

246
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,740
We know you were working the night shift.

247
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,660
Look.

248
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,540
All the shops in the alley are closed.

249

It's so dark.

We were worried that

you'd be afraid walking alone.

252

Yan is in the team.

253
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,860
So I asked your uncle

254
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,580
to come pick you up with me.

255
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,950
Oh, right.

256
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,940
I bought you

257
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,340
your favorite shrimp dumplings.

258
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
Is this the right one?

259
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,380
Yes.

260

Thank you, Uncle and Aunt.

275
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,220
Okay.

276
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,460
You are so thin.

277
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,420
You need to eat more

278

so that you can be healthy

279
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,860
and work well.

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,500
Okay.

So is Song Yan.

282
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,780
There's no regular time

283
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,460
for him

284
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,380
to get off work.

285
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,320
He's also thin.

286
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,660
Qin.

287
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,330
Did something happen to you

288
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,090
today?

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,930
I saw Song Yan today.

290
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,420
They were on a mission yesterday,

291
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,540
and there was an explosion.

292
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,470
What happened next?

293
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,460
Is he okay?

294
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,260
Luckily, he's fine.

295
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,410
Well...

296
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,020
What about the others?

297
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,780
Is everyone okay?

298
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,580
Yes.

299
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,820
You scared me.

300
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,070
I'm still scared when I think about it.

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,950
What if...

302
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,230
Qin.

303
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,400
Don't be afraid.

304
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,850
It's okay.

305
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,890
Song Yan always

306
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
knows what to do.

307
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,680
He knows how to protect himself

308
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,800
and how to protect

309
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,260
his people.

310
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,730
Actually, over the years,

311
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,020
your uncle and I

312
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,170
have been trying to persuade him

313
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
to request a job transfer.

314
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,540
But he

315
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,250
isn't willing to leave

316
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,580
his team members.

317
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,900
Let me tell you.

318
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,010
Their team

319
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,780
has the highest comprehensive quality

320
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
and the best discipline

321
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,860
in our area.

322
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,740
They never had any major accident.

323
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,550
It's all because he trains them well.

324
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,260
Why did he choose

325
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,340
this occupation?

326
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,700
Well...

327
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,580
This kid

328
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,220
once joined the army.

329
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,520
He also did a good job there.

330
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,650
But due to various reasons,

331
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,520
he hadn't been promoted.

332
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,400
Later, he took the initiative

333
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,820
to become a firefighter.

334
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,880
Besides, Qin,

335
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,440
you know that Song Yan

336
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,220
was abandoned in his childhood.

337
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,980
He really wants a home.

338
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,610
He wants to be able to

339
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,780
spoil his family

340
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,900
and his loved one.

341
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,300
He's just like this.

342
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,060
Yes.

343
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,490
And...

344
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,260
Don't.

345
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,140
Look.

346
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,180
Qin must be tired

347
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,370
after

348
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,190
having a long day at work.

349
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,520
If you don't feel like eating,

350
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,620
go back and rest early.

351
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,170
OK?

352
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,980
Well,

353
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,930
I'll leave now, Uncle and Aunt.

354
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,340
Okay.

355
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,180
This kid

356
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,620
has something on her mind.

357
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,860
It's between them.

358
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,140
They should work it out themselves.

359
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,290
Why do you worry?

360
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,300
How can I not worry?

361
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,220
What if they

362
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,860
break up again?

363
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,530
What if

364
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,460
she abandons him

365
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,620
like his own mother?

366
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,550
What kind of comparison is that?

367
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,530
I told you not to mention that woman.

368
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,770
You were mentioning that woman again.

369
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll punish you

370
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,870
to make breakfast tomorrow morning.

371
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll sleep in.

372
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,820
Eat up.

373
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,300
Don't waste it.

374
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,260
You made it sound like

375
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,740
you ever made breakfast.

376
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,420
Mum!

377
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,250
Mum!

378
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,140
Mum!

379
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,020
Mum!

380
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,580
Qin.

381
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,220
Mum!

382
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,180
Qin.

383
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,100
Dad!

384
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,580
Qin.

385
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,970
Qin.

386
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,770
Mum!

387
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,250
What are you doing?

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,020
Go.

775
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,910
I'll grant your leave now.

776
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,420
It's okay.

777
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,180
Maybe she's not off work yet.

778
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,900
Go.

779
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,200
Go.

780
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,790
Still so cowardly. He won't go.

781
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,700
I want to stretch more.

782
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,790
OK. Stretch as you want.

783
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,320
Go after you warm yourself up.

784
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,090
I was almost scared to death.

785
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,250
Feel my heartbeat.

786
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,010
It's still so fast.

787
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,870
[Demonstrate the Morality of the Hospital and Create Life Miracles]

788
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,420
Stop crying.

789
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,970
You're a Emergency Department nurse.

790
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,840
Why do you break down so easily?

791
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,780
If something like this

792
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,790
happened to your boyfriend,

793
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,310
what would you do?

794
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,010
I just happened to see

795
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,290
what happened last night.

796
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,690
If I didn't see it,

797
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,980
I wouldn't know

798
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,040
what kind of scarier thing could have happened.

799
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,500
How can I not be fussy about it?

800
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,730
Alright.

801
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,710
They have trained

802
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,890
for a long time.

803
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,800
They have strong qualities.

804
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,430
It's inevitable

805
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,230
for their profession to face danger.

806
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,150
Yes.

807
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,460
I've always known

808
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,890
his work is dangerous.

809
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,220
But I didn't know

810
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,620
it's so dangerous.

811
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,310
Alright, stop crying.

812
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,830
Let's get back to work.

813
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,900
Alright, let's go.

814
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,880
How can I not be scared?

815
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,420
Every time we meet

816
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,250
can be

817
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
the last time.

818
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,210
I know.

819
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,680
Stop crying.

820
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,420
You saw

821
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,040
Qin today?

822
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,370
She must be heartbroken.

823
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,440
Did anything happen

824
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,450
between you two?

825
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,220
Here comes the soup.

826
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,820
Kid.

827
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,960
Why do you look

828
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,680
so troubled?

829
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,730
Yan.

830
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,870
I know

831
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,910
you like Qin.

832
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,980
I can tell

833
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,680
Qin really likes you, too.

834
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,600
We're just worried that

835
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,640
you two

836
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,980
may not be suitable

837
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,930
after being together for long.

838
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,400
Think about it.

839
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,790
Your mother

840
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,980
used to be doing well.

841
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,940
But after that thing happened to your dad,

842
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,440
she divorced him.

843
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,210
She still refused to come back

844
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,180
and live a normal life

845
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,400
even though she ended up like that.

846
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,220
Moreover,

847
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,970
Xu Qin is different from her.

848
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,940
Don't bring her up.

849
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,990
She's getting off work.

850
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll go pick her up.

851
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,870
Go.

852
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,080
How many times have I told you?

853
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,150
Don't mention that person

854
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,140
in front of the kid.

855
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,820
I think

856
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,240
he has grown up.

857
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,220
Even if he's grown old,

858
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,770
that wound is still here.

859
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,780
Look at him.

860
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,260
Does he look like he's over it?

861
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,110
Also,

862
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,660
why did you compare Qin

863
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,400
with

864
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,100
that woman?

865
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,500
Do you think the trouble they are facing

866
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,120
is not messy enough?

867
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,680
Alright.

868
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,250
I know.

869
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,480
I misspoke.

870
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,470
I was just worried.

871
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,300
Alright. Stop talking about it

872
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,000
from now on.

873
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,600
Let's wait for him to pick her up

874
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,820
and see what they'll say.

875
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,270
Let's eat.

876
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,660
I specially made these shrimps for you.

877
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,290
