00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,450
Why is it still a blank sheet of paper?

5
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,290
I can't think of anything to write.

6
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,220
Just write about

7
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,660
what's on your mind.

8
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,979
There must be someone you miss the most.

9
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,860
This is a tough battle.

10
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,140
If we go,

11
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,660
we may not come back alive.

12
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,490

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,860
If you could receive this letter,

16
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,040
I

17
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,380
might already

18
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,570
be gone.

19
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,220
After being apart for so long,

20
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,900
I've grown a lot,

21
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,820
but I still haven't learnt

22
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,620
to say goodbye to you.

23
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,190
I have no worries about myself.

24
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,540
I don't have many regrets.

25
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,930
You're the only one

26
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,490
who always makes me feel at ease and warm.

27
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,250
Thinking of you

28
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
makes my tomorrow

29
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,200
worthwhile.

30
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,620
Cold and heat are no torture.

31
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,350
I have no fear of gunfire.

32
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,140
I want to be someone

33
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,940
who can stand beside you

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,860
and make you happy.

If that day didn't come,

42
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,230
I'd want you to know that

43
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,590
there was a man

44
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,790
in this world

45
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,480
who did his best

46

to be with you.

47
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,100
Don't move.

48
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
Be careful of your wound.

49
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,360
You're lucky.

50
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,860
If it hadn't been for this thing,

51
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,580
the bullet would have gone straight

52
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,860
through your artery.

53
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,380
You wouldn't be lying here now.

54
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,980
She is pretty.

55
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,930
Your girlfriend?

56
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,420
I haven't heard you mention her before.

57
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,750
Who is she?

58
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,830
The one I want to marry.

59
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,860
When I achieve something,

60
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,220
I'll go back and marry her.

61
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,090
You did well this time.

62
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,670
You've been awarded the second-class merit by the team.

63
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,510
When you recover,

64
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,310
you'll get promoted.

65
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,020
You can marry her in a grand manner.

66
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,730
If that day came,

67
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,340
I would run towards you in the light,

68
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,120
take you by the hand,

69
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,210
and share all my glory and pride

70
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,720
with you.

71
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,220
I would stand upright

72
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,170
in front of your family

73
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
and tell them

74
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,539
I want to be with you.

75
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,860
After today,

76
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,380
we won't be able to see each other very often.

77
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,610
Xu Qin

78
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,660
is not what you think she is.

79
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,750
She's doing this for your sake.

80
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,220
You've misunderstood her.

81
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
She cares about you.

82
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,940
Don't sleep when you're angry.

83
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,510
If you sleep with anger,

84
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,860
you'll be silly the next day.

85
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,970
If you have anything to say, say it.

86
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,770
Just tell me.

87
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,450
You'll be fine when you say it out.

88
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,590
Okay.

Is Qin back?

94
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,610
She has an appointment today.

95
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,710
I'm going out.

96
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,910
Don't wait for me for dinner.

98
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,360
Here.

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Do you remember her?

100
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,820
She's Uncle Gu's daughter.

101

Hello.

Last time,

105
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,830
I asked you to meet her,

106
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,170
but you didn't show up.

107
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,660
Shouldn't you

108
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,700
apologize to her?

109
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,670
I’m really sorry, Miss Gu.

110
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,530
I didn't show up last time

111
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,510
because of an impromptu meeting.

112
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,260
It's okay.

114
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,250
I know you are busy

115
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,060
at work.

116
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,780
Where are you going?

117
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,530
I'm going to an art exhibition.

118
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,300
Why don't you

119
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,060
take Man with you?

120
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,050
Thank you.

121
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,070
Just a moment, please.

122
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,100
I heard you play golf well.

123
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
Not really.

124
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
You're too modest.

125
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,540
There are not many people

126
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,370
who can be praised by my mom.

127
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,370
Thank you.

128
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,800
I can't say that I like it very much.

129
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,850
By the way,

130
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,180
are you a doctor?

131
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,860
Yes.

132
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,190
I'm an ER doctor.

133
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm usually busy with work.

134
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,950
I don't have much free time.

135
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,180
It's good.

136
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,280
It's fulfilling.

137
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,700
Most of us in this circle

138
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,460
follow in our fathers' footsteps.

139
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,590
You're on a completely different track.

140
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,700
It means you are very brave

141
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,710
and you have a strong personality.

142
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm not as good as you think I am.

143
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,340
I assume

144
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,300
your mother told you about me.

145
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,020
But I'd like to

146
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,330
make a formal introduction.

147
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,910
My name is Dong Jianan.

148
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,840
I am 28 years old.

149
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,150
I graduated from Business School.

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm running

151

152
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,900
I like sports,

153
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,660
skiing and diving.

154
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,960
I don't have any bad hobbies.

155
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,220
My mom likes you.

156
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,460
She wants you to marry me

157
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,980
and enjoy a happy life.

158
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,430
It's best to have a son.

159
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,220
I think

160
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,220
you're a perfect match for me.

161
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,520
Most importantly,

162
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,330
we're perfect

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,050
for each other

164
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,660
in every way.

165
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,540
It's a good match,

166
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,600
but not the right person.

167
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,220
Not the right person?

168
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm really sorry.

169
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,230
I have a boyfriend.

170
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,100
Thank you.

171
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:16,970
Enjoy.

172
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,260
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,210
I'll take my leave.

174
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,060
But I...

175
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,440
Take your time.

176
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm going to the bathroom.

177
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,590
How much is this painting?

178
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm not a staff member now.

179
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,810
I'm off duty.

180
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,530
Sorry.

181
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,110
It's okay.

182
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,960
Mr. Meng, do you want to buy this painting?

183
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,450
You don't think it's a good idea?

184
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,830
The memory should be kept in the heart,

185
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,560
not on the wall.

186
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,820
This painting

187
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,420
looks beautiful on the surface,

188
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,380
but it's actually a pity in the heart.

189
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,470
You see, the green plum fruit on this tree

190
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,680
tastes sour.

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,850
missed each other.

195
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,100
The joy of childhood

196
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,580
has been interpreted by you

197
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,950
as a sad story.

198
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,380
Maybe I'm

199
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,700
a little pessimistic.

200
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,370
People who are nostalgic

201
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,850
tend to be

202
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,060
unhappy.

203
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,340
What do you mean?

204
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,980
Maybe his memories

205
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,140
are too sweet,

206
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,060
so he's just wishing

207
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,180
he could

208
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,140
have them back.

209
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,940
But he also knows

210
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,700
if he missed something good,

211
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,180
he couldn't get it back.

212
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,180
He knows that things aren't the way they were before.

213
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,820
And he knows that even if he could get them back,

214
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,700
there would be only regrets

215
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,660
and vague memories left.

216
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,290
Now that you interpreted it like this,

217
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,660
how can I buy this painting?

218
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,490
It's up to you.

219
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,150
I wouldn't buy it if it were me.

220
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,640
After all, this painting costs 80,000 yuan.

221
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,240
It's too expensive.

222
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,530
Really?

223
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,740
When I was a kid

224
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,530
watching TV shows,

225
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,300
I wondered

226
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,980
what kind of person

227
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,760
would buy paintings in the gallery?

228
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,420
Now I see.

229
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,890
I got it.

230
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,750
You mean

231
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,280
this painting is not worth it.

232
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,890
Not really.

233
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,350
For ordinary people,

234
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,580
it's not worth it.

235
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,840
But for you,

236
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,980
money is just a tool.

237
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,650
Whatever you do or buy,

238
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,420
it's only because of pleasure, not money.

239
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,540
Like you said,

240
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,790
money is just a tool.

241
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,820
I also have

242
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,060
unfulfilled wishes

243
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,460
and regrets hidden in my heart.

244
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,690
There you are!

245
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,200
I've been looking for you.

246
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,730
You're looking at this painting?

247
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,540
What do you think?

248
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,260
Not bad.

249
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,150
I've never been a fan of arts since I was a kid.

250
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,290
I feel bored.

251
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,550
Let's go shopping.

252
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,410
I want to finish this exhibition.

253
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,780
Okay.

254
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,220
You can enjoy yourself here.

255
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,490
I'll go shopping.

256
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,680
Bye.

257
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,960
Bye.

258
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:52,930
Get in.

259
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,360
Thank you.

260
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,600
I'll take you to the nearest subway station.

261
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,050
Okay.

262
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,890
Fasten your seat belt.

263
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,430
Okay.

264
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,420
Look.

265
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,090
I feel a little disappointed

266
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:33,280
[Mind table manners
Don't waste food]

267
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,970
that they're not at the station.

268
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,300
What did I

269
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,340
tell you before?

270
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,780
It's not realistic.

271
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,070
They have their own jobs.

272
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,870
How can they cooperate with you

273
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,110
in the station all the year round?

274
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,540
No.

275
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,860
I just want to promote

276
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,340
the medical development

277
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,370
in our fire station.

278
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,140
I will examine

279
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,740
and study again

280
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,930
to see

281
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,590
if there is the possibility of adding medical personnel.

282
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,610
[Mind table manners
Don't waste food]

283
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,260
You are really

284
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,860
persistent.

285
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,420
Don't say that.

286
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,590
The fact that

287
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,220
we've set up this mechanism

288
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,970
is

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,350
a small achievement.

290
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,580
Jiang Yu,

291
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,080
you're very optimistic.

292
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,350
You have my respect.

293
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,510
I admire your optimism.

294
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,140
You won't be able to see Dr. Xu

295
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,460
for a while.

296
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,740
By then,

297
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,660
I'll see

298
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,780
if you can still be optimistic.

299
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,870
You’re so talkative.

300
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,980
Instructor.

301
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,130
Are you OK?

302
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,390
I'm fine.

303
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,140
I've got something in my teeth.

304
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,980
Dr. Xu is over there.

305
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,100
Let's go.

306
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,970
Dr. Xu, let's sit together.

307
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,780
Sit.

308
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,070
Dr. Yang.

309
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,970
We have the same food.

310
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,940
You like trotters too?

311
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,960
Delicious.

312
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,070
Do you want the hospital to reform?

313
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,780
We rarely

314
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,900
eat and chat together.

315
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,020
Do you have to talk about

316
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,900
such a grand topic?

317
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,670
Do you like being a doctor

318
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,340
because you feel that

319
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,240
the effort and reward match,

320
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,710
or

321
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,660
is it largely due to

322
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,220
a sense of professional honor?

323
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,740
I was just trying

324
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
to figure out a way

325
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,700
to answer your last question.

326
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,380
Why are you changing the question again?

327
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,700
Sorry.

328
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,920
Which one do you want to answer?

329
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,530
I don't want to answer either.

330
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,360
Dr. Yang.

331
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,760
I know what you want to ask.

332
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,050
You want to say

333
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,400
a job is just a job.

334
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,770
Right?

335
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,830
Of course.

336
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,470
Look at us.

337
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,500
We work so hard every day.

338
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,700
But we don't

339
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,200
make much money.

340
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,770
I have a doctoral degree,

341
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,730
but do you know

342
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,730
how much I earned in the first year

343
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,830
when I first came here?

344
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,610
I don't care about the salary.

345
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,340
But it's tiring.

346
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,890
The workload is too heavy.

347
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,550
I'll get anxious when I'm tired.

348
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,590
Tell me.

349
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,290
How many times

350
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,410
have I been criticized this month?

351
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,930
There is nothing we can do.

352
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,570
There are too many patients.

353
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,060
But we have very limited medical resources.

354
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,840
We can't just let them die.

355
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,840
So,

356
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,410
I'm quick-tempered

357
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,350
but I forget about it very quickly.

358
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,510
There is nothing we can do.

359
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,080
In our line of work,

360
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,710
life, death and care

361
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,930
are not meant to be

362
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,040
equated with ordinary professions.

363
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,180
By the way, Dr. Xu,

364
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,640
I can answer

365
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,580
your second question.

366
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,550
Do I have a sense of honor?

367
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,220
Of course I do.

368
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,900
I save lives.

369
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,470
Why can't I have a sense of honor?

370
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,750
When I go out,

371
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,850
people know I'm a doctor.

372
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,590
You know what?

373
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,890
They look enviously at me.

374
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,050
Really.

375
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,050
I'm very proud.

376
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,990
So proud.

377
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,500
Don't you think

378
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,250
honor is also a burden?

379
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,270
It requires selflessness

380
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,270
and sacrifice.

381
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,260
I'm willing to do so.

382
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,060
Nothing can match

383
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,590
the honor

384
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,580
of bringing a patient back

385
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,930
from the brink of death.

386
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,980

People's value

395
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,660
