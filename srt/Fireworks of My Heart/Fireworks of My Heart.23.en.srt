Excuse me.

583
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,360
Are there any casualties?

584
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,970
Where is Song Yan?

585
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,910
Where is Song Yan?

586
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,580
He's here.

587
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,190
Song Yan!

588
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,660
Song Yan!

589
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,480
Song Yan!

590
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,740
Let me go down.

591
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,720
I can't.

592
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,250
It's very complicated

593
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,550
down there,

594
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,160
and very unsafe.

595
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,610
He needs me.

596
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,910
Let me go down.

597
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,500
I can't risk your life.

598
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,820
He is my life!

599
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,170
Let me down.

600
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,500
The supervisor has checked the situation.

601
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,490
We can send someone down.

602
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,020
Let Dr. Xu check

603
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,890
the chief's condition first

604
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,650
before we decide on a rescue plan.

605
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,550
Rope.

606
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,590
Rope.

607
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,770
Rope. Rope.

608
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,890
Slow down.

609
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,740
Slowly.

610
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,920
Slowly.

611
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,660
Hold on at the back.

612
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,420
Release the line.

613
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Hold on at the back.

614
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,260
Come on.

615
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,340
Release.

616
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,240
Release!

617
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,000
Release!

618
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,780
Release!

619
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,870
Release!

620
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,230
Release!

621
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,010
Song Yan!

622
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,340
Dr. Xu.

623
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,430
How is Song Yan now?

624
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,260
His abdomen was pierced by a rebar.

625
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,190
Chief!

626
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,040
Chief!

627
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,030
Chief!

628
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,830
Chief!

629
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:04,880
Don’t cry.

630
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,290
Chief.

631
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,120
Don’t cry.

632
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,690
Stop crying.

633
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,290
He's not dead yet, why are you crying?

634
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,590
His pulse is very weak now.

635
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,370
He needs an IV drip.

636
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,930
Medical kit.

637
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,260
Here.

638
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,830
Be careful.

639
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,600
Dr. Xu.

640
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,820
Hang in there.

641
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,660
Song Yan.

642
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,610
Hang in there.

643
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,840
Song Yan.

644
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,800
Don't leave me alone.

645
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,830
Don’t leave me.

646
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,400
Supervisor,

647
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:28,990
how about this?

648
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,090
I will go down with Jiang

649
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,750
to cut the rebar.

650
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,850
Let Dr. Xu come up first.

651
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,030
Yes, we'll go down.

652
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,050
Okay.

653
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,420
Go get the tripod.

654
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,140
Hurry.

655
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,660
Hurry up. Take the tripod.

656
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,240
Okay.

657
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,380
Here.

658
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,450
Dr. Xu.

659
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,490
Why don't I pull you up first?

660
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,500
The space below is too small.

661
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,230
They...

662
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,510
They will go down first

663
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,920
and cut the rebar.

664
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,130
Okay?

665
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,970
Doctor! Doctor!

666
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,780
Hurry!

667
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,060
There's someone injured here. Hurry.

668
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,250
Slow down.

669
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,750
Don't jolt.

670
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,380
Slow down.

671
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:06,730
Don't jolt.

672
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,040
Be gentle.

673
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,239
Put her in a little bit.

674
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,870
Be gentle.

675
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,670
Be gentle.

676
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:11,560
Thank you.

677
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,199
Leave it to us.

678
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:12,940
We'll leave it to you.

679
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,340
Relax.

680
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,300
Go on.

681
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,889
Come on.

682
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,040
Move her in here.

683
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,980
Where does it hurt?

684
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,620
Tell me.

685
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,280
My stomach hurts.

686
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,409
Your stomach?

687
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,850
Does it hurt here?

688
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,770
Does it hurt here?

689
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,010
It's a spleen rupture.

690
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,810
She needs surgery.

691
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,699
Relax. Relax.

692
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,620
Doctor, it hurts.

693
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,820
Right away.

694
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,179
Dr. Xu.

695
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,480
I'm here.

696
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,429
We have a critical patient here.

697
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,570
She needs surgery now.

698
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,100
Please save me.

699
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,580
We'll save you. Relax.

700
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,610
Okay, I'll be right there.

701
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,150
Give me the first aid kit.

702
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,400
Take it.

703
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:23,910
Li Nan.

704
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,160
Inform Xu Xi immediately to

705
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,380
send another ambulance

706
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:26,940
for standby.

707
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,610
Okay.

708
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,740
[Emergency]

709
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,210
[Emergency]

710
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,170
Yes, send two nurses

711
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,230
and an ambulance over right now.

712
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,820
Watch your step.

713
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,870
I remember where I've seen

714
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
this female doctor.

715
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,820
Commander,

716
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:24,970
a firefighter

717
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,680
is buried over there.

718
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,200
Fall in!

719
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,920
Fall in!

720
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,390
Hurry!

721
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,050
Get ready to save them.

722
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,540
Hurry!

723
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,470
Let's go.

724
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,150
Let me hold it.

725
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,620
Hold tight.

726
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,270
Chief.

727
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,230
There is just the three of us now.

728
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,500
No outsiders.

729
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,380
Let me tell you a secret.

730
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,040
Yang has been eyeing for your position

731
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,980
for a long time.

732
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,410
You can't let anything happen to you.

733
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,020
Don’t let him succeed in getting your position so easily.

734
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,880
Chief,

735
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,580
Don’t listen to Jiang Yi.

736
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,830
Even if you gave me his position,

737
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,630
I can't control these bastards.

738
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,450
It's you.

739
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,640
You have to discipline us.

740
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,020
Come on.

741
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,580
One more time.

742
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,040
Chief.

743
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,650
The team members are watching you

744
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,510
up there.

745
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,830
You have to be strong.

746
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,260
Just like Yang said,

747
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,660
I'm a jinx.

748
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,180
You're sure to lead a charmed life.

749
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,520
My mouth is blessed.

750
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,550
You will be fine.

751
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,120
Yes, you'll be fine.

752
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,950
You'll come out of this fine.

753
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,780
He can hear us.

754
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,790
Look.

755
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,960
He's laughing at us.

756
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,170
He borrowed five yuan

757
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,890
from me last time to buy drinks,

758
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,980
and doesn't want to pay me back.

759
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,100
Here.

760
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,270
Slowly.

761
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,610
Be careful.

762
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,330
Okay.

763
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,430
This angle.

764
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,530
There are rebars on his body.

765
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,670
You can't use stretchers.

766
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,800
Rope.

767
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,990
The safety rope. Hurry.

768
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,480
Hang it up.

769
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,350
Pull up the winch.

770
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,100
Take your time.

771
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:10,890
Pull it up.

772
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,570
Slowly.

773
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,070
Here.

774
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,700
Raise it up.

775
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,950
Slow down.

776
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,970
Slow down.

777
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,540
Slow down.

778
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,470
