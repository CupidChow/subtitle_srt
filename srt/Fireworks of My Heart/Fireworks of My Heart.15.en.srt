[Episode 15]

4
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,340
Yan.

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,620
Have a date cake.

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,310
What are you looking at?

7
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,289
After last time,

8
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,470
there's no follow-up?

9
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,620
What last time?

10
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,280
I told you.

11
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,780
That woman went crazy after drinking.

12
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,820
She was just being irrational.

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,169
Miao, have a bun, OK?

14
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:08,900
Yes, eat buns.

15
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,259
I told you

16
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:10,940
but you didn't listen.

17
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,660
You had to go find her.

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,210
See?

19
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,300
You got dumped again.

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
Look at you.

21
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,010
How long has it been?

22
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,140
Why do you have to mention it?

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,340
I want to mention it.

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,370
That woman is crazy.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Why can't I mention it?

26
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,440
Brother,

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,540
I beg you.

28
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:22,940
Can you

29
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,100
stop looking for her?

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,660
What's so good about her?

31
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,140
She is the most arrogant and ruthless person

32
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,770
I have ever met.

33
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,180
She's quite hard-hearted.

34
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,110
Shut up.

35
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,380
Miao.

36
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,800
Enough.

37
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,690
You don't have to be

38
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,480
so critical of her.

39
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,310
She's not what you think.

40
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,530
She is.

41
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,220
She's the most vulnerable and timid person

42
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,820
I've ever met.

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,710
Really?

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,230
She wants to go crazy

45
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,950
and make a scene.

46
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,910
She wants freedom.

47
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,940
She doesn't want to obey.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,710
She pretends to be strong.

49
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,660
But in reality,

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,470
she's very fragile inside.

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,910
Her personality

52
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,220
is the most useless.

53
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,550
I think it's the most useful for you.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,200
You are just struck by her.

55
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,920
I don't know

56
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,220
if it's useless.

57
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,660
Anyway,

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,890
I just think

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
she is not suitable for you.

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,500
Yes.

61
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,620
As for Li Meng from your detachment,

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,270
I think that girl is nice.

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,790
I also think she is nice.

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,360
Uncle, Aunt.

65
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,140
I'll go.

66
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,829
Brother.

67
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,620
Take care.

68
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,070
You can't even shut up while eating.

69
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,829
Sit down.

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
Look at you.

71
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,070
Watch your mouth.

72
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,060
Why do you have to mention these things

73
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,940
that he doesn't want to bring up?

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,890
Yes. Watch your mouth.

75
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,300
Eat the deep-fried dough stick.

76
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,460
I bought it for you.

77
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,579
Eat.

78
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,520
Yan!

79
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,100
Yan!

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,800
Aunt.

81
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,060
Come on.

82
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,420
You didn't drink the soy milk just now.

83
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,990
Take it.

84
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,070
It's okay not to drink this.

85
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,190
You don't have to take it to me.

86
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,580
Don't mind

87
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,090
what Zhai Miao said just now.

88
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,750
It's okay.

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,940
But I think

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,600
it would be great

91
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,500
to figure something out earlier.

92
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,829
Let it go.

93
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,140
After all, there's bad blood between our families.

94
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,250
But it has nothing

95
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,680
to do with her.

96
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,460
But it has something to do with you.

97
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,420
Think about how much

98
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,300
you suffered back then.

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
We can't just pretend

100
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,870
it never happened.

101
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't worry.

102
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,980
I can handle it.

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,870
Are you determined

104
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,980
to get back together with her?

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,990
Many things

106
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,070
can't be done just by thinking.

107
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,570
It's not that easy.

108
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,659
We feel the same.

109
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
Let it be.

110
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,150
All right.

111
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,330
Go back.

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
Don't force yourself.

113
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,830
Remember to drink the soy milk.

114
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,310
I will.

115
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,480
You can't keep it for too long.

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,180
Chief Song.

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,130
You're back.

118
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,680
Get in.

119
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:47,850
I remember you don't live here.

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,800
Are you just passing by?

121
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,290
I heard that

122
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,830
there's a really good cake shop around here.

123
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,300
So I took a detour to buy some.

124
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,900
Later,

125
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,810
take one to the team.

126
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,760
No need.

127
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,510
I don't like sweets.

128
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,980
It's not for you to eat alone.

129
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
It's for the people in the station.

130
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,830
Fine.

131
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,980
Do you still like her?

132
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,820
I didn't know that.

133
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,180
You...

134
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,930
You like being tortured.

135
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,440
She doesn't even like you.

136
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,540
Why bother?

137
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,390
You're such a good person.

138
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,140
You were dismissed as worthless by her.

139
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,820
Why?

140
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,990
You should let her know

141
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,150
many good girls

142
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,260
like you.

143
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,100
Li Meng.

144
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,660
If you keep saying this,

145
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,320
you'll cross the line.

146
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,210
I'm so mad at you.

147
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,170
Look at you.

148
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,320
You have a very good personality

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,159
and you're good-looking.

150
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,280
Why do you only like her?

151
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,150
That's enough.

152
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,190
You care about me.

153
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,870
Thank you.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
But

155
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,580
about my relationship with my ex-girlfriend,

156
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,400
whether it's good or not,

157
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,100
it's not up to others

158
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,380
to judge.

159
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,280
Understand?

160
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,890
Sorry, okay?

161
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,650
I know

162
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,070
I was wrong.

163
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,970
I didn't know my place.

164
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,610
I couldn't help it.

165
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
Did I ever tell you that

166
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,460
it's impossible for us two?

167
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,600
So what?

168
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,470
I like you.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,250
You just persuaded me.

170
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,920
Look at you.

171
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,650
Your words are not consistent with your actions.

172
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,860
You like others but not me.

173
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,299
I can't help it.

174
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,480
But at least find someone

175
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,980
who treats you better.

176
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,810
You should at least convince me, right?

177
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,390
I also want to convince myself.

178
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,460
Who should I talk to?

179
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,400
[Emergency]

180
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,530
Aunt Jia.

181
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,630
Why can't I

182
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,670
stay here forever?

183
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,660
Because

184
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,420
hospitals

185
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,660
are for sick people.

186
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,280
Then I'll be sick all the time.

187
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,820
Nonsense.

188
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,500
How can you be sick all the time?

189
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,950
An aunt from the Women's Federation

190
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,190
will pick you up and take you to the welfare home.

191
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,980
There are

192
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,650
many children.

193
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,600
And there are teachers

194
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,380
who can teach you to read and write.

195
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,610

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,850
I'm probably a little obsessive-compulsive

585
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,110
in some ways.

586
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,740
When I get a project,

587
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,050
I always want it to be perfect

588
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,750
and I don't want it to end badly.

589
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,470
I think you are too soft-hearted.

590
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,940
You don't want to

591
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,980
make our parents disappointed.

592
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm sure you feel the same way.

593
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,880
Brother.

594
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,900
If there is a time machine,

595
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,470
do you want to go back to the past

596
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,660
or to the future?

597
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,260
Which stage of your life

598
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,580
do you want to go to?

599
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,850
Go back to the past,

600
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,520
when

601
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,390
you first came to the family.

602
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,390
What about you?

603
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,910
Go to the future.

604
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,770
I want to see

605
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,890
what we'll be like in ten years.

606
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,900
Be careful. It's okay.

607
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,200
Hang in there.

608
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,620
We'll get you out of here.

609
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,060
It hurts!

610
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,980
It hurts.

611
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,330
It hurts.

612
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,180
Report to headquarters.

613
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,260
Report to headquarters.

614
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,510
This is Shilitai Fire and Rescue Station.

615
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,380
All the missing tour pals have been found.

616
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,090
All the missing tour pals have been found.

617
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,840
Over.

618
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,170
Roger.

619
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,150
Report to headquarters.

620
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,370
This is Li Bin, firefighter from Wufang Street Fire Station.

621
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,430
All the missing

622
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,420
civilian rescue team members

623
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,490
have been found.

624
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,870
We're going down the mountain.

625
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,180
Roger that.

626
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,600
Hello?

627
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,020
Dr Xu, this is Song Yan.

628
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,070
Go ahead.

629
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,070
The wounded female has fractured her lower leg.

630
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,780
She said we can't touch it and it hurts badly.

631
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,970
Here's the thing.

632
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,450
The temperature is getting lower.

633
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,680
We have to send her down the mountain as soon as possible.

634
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,670
What should we do?

635
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,890
Is it a compound

636
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,090
or simple fracture?

637
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,980
It's a compound fracture.

638
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,110
Do you have bandages and splints?

639
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,780
Yes.

640
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,490
Junping. The medical kit.

641
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,220
Here.

642
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,790
Start with a pressure bandage

643
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,580
to reduce the bleeding.

644
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,500
Then splint it

645
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,840
or she won't make it down the mountain.

646
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,710
The area where the splints touch the leg

647
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,930
should be padded with something soft.

648
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
Then the upper and lower joints of the fracture

649
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,630
should be fixed at the same time

650
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,990
to limit the movement of the fracture.

651
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,570
First fix the proximal end of the fracture

652
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,710
and then fix the distal end.

653
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,980
Put her feet together

654
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,320
and fix them

655
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,280
with a thick cushion in the middle.

656
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,790
Make sure to show the tips of her toes.

657
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,070
Keep an eye on

658
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,180
the peripheral blood circulation.

659
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,670
If the tiptoes ever get numb,

660
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,850
purple or cold,

661
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,230
you need to readjust it.

662
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,860
Got it.

663
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,040
Thank you, Dr Xu.

664
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Be careful.

665
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,280
Chief Song.

666
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,580
It's okay. Hang in there.

667
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:20,980
Don't touch me.

668
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,890
Hang in there.

669
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,510
It's okay. Don't worry.

670
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,530
Hang in there.

671
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,480
It's okay.

672
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,230
It's okay.

673
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:32,930
Don't be afraid.

674
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,960
The temperature is getting lower.

675
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,980
We need to bandage it

676
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,910
and send you down the mountain as soon as possible.

677
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,350
In the event of hypothermia,

678
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,420
everyone at the scene

679
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,260
will be in danger.

680
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,380
Here, cover it.

681
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,120
Keep yourself warm.

682
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,420
Be gentle.

683
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,210
Song Yan?

684
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,350
Is he that good?

685
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,860
You two haven't seen each other

686
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
for ten years.

687
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,780
Have you ever thought that

688
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,360
people can change?

689
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,560
Only those

690
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,840
who are not determined enough

691
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,950
will change.

692
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,960
Qin.

693
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,910
Brother.

694
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,800
I know you want to say

695
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,800
it's impossible between us.

696
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,200
But love and possibility

697
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,860
are two different things.

698
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,790
It was my fault that day.

699
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
I shouldn't have said that.

700
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,860
But have you ever thought

701
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,720
what I said

702
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,700
is the reality

703
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,820
you have to face in the future?

704
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,540
What will you do

705
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,420
when that happens?

706
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,550
I'm afraid of contradictions

707
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,890
and conflicts.

708
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,940
I'm also afraid to clean up the mess.

709
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,160
It's perfect for me to just walk away.

710
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,980
But I don't want to be

711
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,380
a deserter anymore.

712
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,260
I will look down on

713
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
myself.

714
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,900
I know that

715
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,170
with my current ability,

716
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,160
I can't solve many problems.

717
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,640
But I have to face

718
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,880
the consequences

719
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,060
that I have to bear.

720
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,480
Watch out for the slippery road.

721
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,450
The road is slippery.

722
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,750
Watch your steps.

723
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,590
Slow down.

724
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,100
Be careful.

725
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,780
Give it to me.

726
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,560
It hurts.

727
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,260
Don't worry.

728
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,440
Hold the safety rope.

729
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,390
You will be fine.

730
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,700
Hang in there.

731
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,400
We're almost there.

732
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,340
Hang in there.

733
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:44,780
We're almost there.

734
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,220
Hang in there.

735
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,900
Hang in there.

736
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,260
Slow down.

737
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,180
We're almost at the foot of the mountain.

738
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,200
Junping.

739
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,270
Slow down.

740
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,890
Junping.

741
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,940
Chief.

742
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,660
Instructor.

743
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,010
I'm fine.

744
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,300
Junping, are you okay?

745
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,140
What's going on?

746
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,220
My feet are stuck.

747
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,560
I can't get out.

748
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,600
Safety rope.

749
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,340
Safety rope.

750
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,380
Here.

751
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,870
Don't move. Let me see.

752
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,140
Song Yan, what's going on down there?

753
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,280
Don't move.

754
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,760
He can't move.

755
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,760
Can you hurry up?

756
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,520
It hurts!

757
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,540
I can't take it anymore.

758
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,740
Hurry up.

759
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,070
It really hurts.

760
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:23,960
Look.

761
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,410
It's too cold.

762
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,260
We have injured people here.

763
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,160
Can you

764
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,210
send us and the injured down first?

765
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,270
Jiang Yu.

766
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,830
Send them down first.

767
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,600
Bring a crowbar back.

768
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,420
Okay.

769
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,460
No problem.

770
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,970
What else do you need?

771
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,460
Do you have water?

772
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,250
Water.

773
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,020
Who has water?

774
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,200
Do you have water?

775
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,030

00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,280
[Don't worry. I'm back.]

967
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,310
[Don't worry. I'm back.]

968
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,900
[Be loyal to the Party; strict in discipline; go through fire and water and serve the people wholeheartedly]

969
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,670
The stuff's already here.

970
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,980
What took you so long?

971
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,060
There was a traffic jam.

972
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,580
Let's move the stuff first.

973
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,100
Here, this is for you.

974
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,600
Okay.

975
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,250
Give it to me.

976
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,470
The flowers are so beautiful.

977
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,290
Thank you.

978
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,250
Let's go. Thank you, sir.

979
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,480
Hello.

980
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:52,940
Hello.

981
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,540
We're here to visit

982
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,780
Liu Junping.

983
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,140
Okay, wait a moment.

984
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,660
We're here to see you.

985
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,440
Brother Ping.

986
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,310
Hello, Monitor.

987
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,460
Monitor.

988
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,310
You're all here.

989
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,570
Hello, Monitor.

990
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,270
You don't have to spend so much.

991
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,940
What are you thinking?

992
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,780
These

993
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,460
are gifts

994
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,260
for you.

995
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,160
Junping, get well soon.

996
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,470
There were several girls

997
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,620
waiting to see you just now.

998
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:27,970
Really?

999
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,830
Yes.

1000
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,110
Should I

1001
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:31,770
get cleaned up?

1002
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,320
No need.

1003
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,430
The Chief said

1004
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,620
your priority now

1005
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,920
is to rest.

1006
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,550
Too many people

1007
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:38,980
will

1008
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,900
affect your recovery.

1009
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,120
So we've sent them away.

1010
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,130
They left?

1011
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,100
Although they left,

1012
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,780
they sent you

1013
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,570
fruit and flowers.

1014
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,260
Here, Monitor.

1015
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,780
Should we keep the fruit?

1016
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,340
The fruit is heaty.

1017
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,320
Should we keep the fruit?

1018
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,290
Take it.

1019
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,730
Really?

1020
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,640
Really.

1021
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,620
Well, you...

1022
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,340
At least leave me something not heaty.

1023
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,040
Something not heaty...

1024
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,980
Monitor, apple.

1025
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,380
Apples are not heaty.

1026
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,640
Orange. Your wish will come true.

1027
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,670
Oranges are not heaty, either.

1028
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,130
Monitor.

1029
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,120
The rest is heaty.

1030
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:11,830
Yes.

1031
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,050
Lychees are heaty.

1032
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,670
You...

1033
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,310
Go.

1034
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,560
Thank you, Monitor.

1035
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,010
The flowers are beautiful.

1036
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,800
Thank you, Yang.

1037
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,530
Thank you.

1038
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,450
Eat slowly.

1039
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,560
They're gone,

1040
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,870
and the fruit is gone.
