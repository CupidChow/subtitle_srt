197
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,370
Can you issue an accident confirmation letter

198
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,660
as soon as possible?

199
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,620
It's hard to run a business.

200
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,020
Help me.

201
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
There's no hurry.

202
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,860
We have to take them back for a test.

203
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,660
Who are you?

204
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,820
How did you get in here?

205
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,780
Is it hard to issue

206
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,660
an accident confirmation letter?

207
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,980
If you hadn't come late,

208
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,460
the goods in my warehouse

209
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,620
wouldn't have been destroyed by fire in such a short time.

210
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,540
Are you trying to

211
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,380
shirk your responsibility?

212
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,620
Our fire station

213
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,780
has records of the speed of action.

214
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
They're making excuses.

215
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,580
Fine.

216
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,700
I won't count on you

217
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,660
to issuse an accident confirmation letter.

218
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,820
I'll find a third party.

219
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,580
A third party is more objective and fair.

220
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,340
Go back.

221
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,820
You can leave.

222
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,410
But the things

223
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,650
have to be left here.

224
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,380
This place

225
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,820
has been sealed by the fire brigade.

226
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,740
Please cooperate

227
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,900
with us.

228
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,620
It's hard to ask a favor

229
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,340
of you.

230
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,500
Yeah.

231
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,820
Stop it.

232
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Don't go too far.

233
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,300
What can you do

234
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,580
if I punch you here?

235
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,380
Don't fight.

236
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,130
Don't fight back, Dapeng.

237
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,610
Don't fight back.

238
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,380
Protect the evidence.

239
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,220
Go.

240
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,300
According to Article 277 of the Criminal Law,

241

Chief.

246
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,300
Protect Ms. Li.

247
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,940
Go!

248
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,300
Go!

250
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:17,780
Chase him.

251
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,700
Don't let him escape.

252
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,580
Wait.

253
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:23,980
Don't move.

254
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,500
Don't move!

255
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,700
Get up!

256
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,220
Don't move.

257
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,850
Don't move. Get up.

258
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,580
Officer.

259
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,620
Let's go.

260
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:35,940
Let's go.

261
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,540
Thank you.

262
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,620
Are you all right, Chi?

263
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:41,700
I...

264
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,660
I'm fine.

265
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,860
I'm fine.

266
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,820
It's just a minor injury.

267
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,620
Are you hurt?

268
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,540
I'm fine.

269
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,860
Tell me.

270
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,740
There was flowing fire.

271
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,140
There was a fuel.

272
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,660
Yes.

273
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,660
Is it gasoline or diesel?

274
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,500
Gasoline.

275
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,890
And there are several areas where the fire started.

276
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,300
The fire was set by people.

I'm sorry.

280
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,740
It's a misunderstanding.

281
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,780
It's just a misunderstanding.

282
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,540
Please forgive me.

What are you going to test?

287
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
It's an accident.

288
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,860
A test?

289
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,740
If you want to explain,

290
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,290
explain it to the police.

Less than ten years.

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,100
Did you do it on purpose?

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,890

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,460
It's just a superficial injury. It happens often.

Why didn't you feel pain when you fought?

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,060
I didn't fight back.

You took two punches for me.

368

I'm sorry to make you suffer.

369
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,730
It's okay, Supervisor.

370
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,700
I didn't let you fight back.

371
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,780
Do you blame me?

372
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,860
No.

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,700
This is our principle.

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,420
I feel much better.

Rinse your mouth. Hurry up.

383
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,820
I know.

I'm fine.

386

It's normal for us firemen

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,980
There's no need to cry.

389
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,530
I'm really fine.

390
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,620
I...

391
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,660
That's who I am.

392
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,100
Did I scare you just now?

393
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,700
No.

394
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,220
Don't do that again.

395
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,420
What?

396
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,060
Don't provoke them.

397
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,540
Don't act tough

398
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,620
and introduce yourself to them.

399
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,820
Doctor Xu.

400
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,060
Are you packing up and going back?

401
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,420
I've finished dressing wounds.

402
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,660
Thank you, Chief.

403
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,260
You need time to recover.

404
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,180
It’s OK.

405
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,530
Chief.

406
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,700
It hurts.

407
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,850
How do you feel

408
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,140
these days?

409
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,980
What do you mean?

410
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,020
How do you feel about the work?

411
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
Do you think I'm asking you

412
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,780
how you think about him?

413
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,900
To be honest,

414
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,300
it's a waste of talent.

415
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,860
Whose talent do you mean?

416
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,620
Mine.

417
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,980
I heard from Li Nan

418
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,700
that you're quite different from others

419
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,940
at the hospital.

420
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,180
Is this the personality you have?

421
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,780
You're quite confident.

422
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,460
To be honest,

423
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,170
this team won't last long.

424
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,780
After this period of cooperation,

425
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,540
I think

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,380
asking doctors from hospitals

427
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,540
to participate in fire rescue

428
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,060
is not a long-term solution.

429
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,020
We can

430
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,340
play a bigger role at the hospital.

431
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,860
Fortunately,

432
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
the experimental team

433
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,860
is about to disband.

434
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,530
I think we made it.

435
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,410
Look.

436
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,740
We cooperated well

437
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,180
and responded quickly.

438
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,860
Also, the rescue was efficient.

439
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,980
It's just that the permanence of the system

440
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,540
has some problems.

441
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,340
But I think those problems

442
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,260
can be solved.

443
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,220
Listen to me.

444
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,700
If you want to be equipped with doctors,

445
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,740
you can recruit doctors in the society.

446
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,740
Give them a secure job or sign a contract with them.

447
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,580
But you know it's unrealistic

448
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,020
to ask the staff from the hospital

449
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,660
to work here for a long time.

450
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,900
You didn't see

451
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,420
the way Dapeng looked at Doctor Li Nan.

452
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,220
Let me tell you...

453
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,940
If a nurse's eyes

454
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,780
fill with tears

455
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,100
when she bandages your wound,

456
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,420
do you think she feels sorry for you?

457
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,370
Something happened to you too?

458
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,180
Who is it?

459
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,860
Let me see.

460
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,380
Who is it?

461
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,660
Enough.

462
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,500
You must be mistaken.

463
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,260
That's impossible.

464
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,780
My eyesight is good.

465
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,100
It's just a minor injury.

466
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,940
Why did she feel sorry for you?

467
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,050
You must be mistaken.

468
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,220
How is that possible?

469
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,220
If she hadn't felt sorry for me,

470
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,220
could it be that she likes me?

471
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,780
The one who bandaged

472
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,740
your wound

473
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,620
is Xu Xi?

474
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,300
Xu Xi.

475
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,340
Don't...

476
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,730
Xu Xi.

477
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,940
You're so annoying.

478
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,420
I'll tell you when we're in a relationship.

479
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,180
Seriously.

480
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,220
Good.

481
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,060
Then why do you

482
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,530
cooperate with us conscientiously?

483
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,340
It's my professional habit, okay?

484
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,180
I'm dedicated to my work.

485
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,380
Fine.

486
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,540
You're dedicated to your work.

487
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,980
I heard from my mom

488
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,730
that your mom

489
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,060
is going to introduce you

490
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,180
to a young man from the Dong family, right?

491
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,180
A blind date?

492
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,300
You even know that?

493
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,470
Look.

494
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,820
But I don't think

495
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
you two are matched.

496
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,700
Yan.

497
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,780
Did you notice

498
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,810
Supervisor and Doctor Xu

499
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,900
are well acquainted with each other?

500
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,850
No, I didn't.

501
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,990
My mom could still get us together.

502
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,130
But in her eyes now,

503
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,500
you're the person who fiddles around.

504
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,560
Don't say that.

505
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,910
I'll resign now.

506
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,810
If I got a big job,

507
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,960
would you be my girlfriend?

508
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,700
OK.

509
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,560
Thank you

510
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,760
for saving me.

511
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,970
Don't say that.

512
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,740
This is the first time I think...

513
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,700
What are Supervisor and Doctor Xu talking about?

514
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,420
They're so deep in conversation.

515
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,110
They're talking and laughing.

516
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,020
Understood.

517
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,020
Yan.

518
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,180
I'll deal with it for you.

519
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,330
You and...

520
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,340
Supervisor.

521
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,380
It's time to go back.

522
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,660
He's calling you.

523
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,180
I'll take the truck behind.

524
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,380
Consider it.

525
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,740
How is it, Yan?

526
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,020
If you face this kind of situation in the future,

527
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
just look at us.

528
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,180
We'll get it.

530
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,500

they're from the Shilitai Fire Brigade.

Sit still.

535
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,000
They have a very bad attitude.

536
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,580
They enforced the law by violence.

537
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,180
Yes.

All of them was handled by me.

It has nothing to do with the supervisor.

547
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,920
I arrived at the scene first.

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,060

Because we found

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,570
someone set the fire on purpose.

578
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,220
He must be punished severely.

he can't escape

581
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,340
punishment.

582
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,540
So

583
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,420
you two

584
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,220
did a good job.

585
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,900
My son-in-law

586
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,980
gave me this can of tea

587
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,560
to perform his filial duties during Chinese New Year.

588
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,280
There's only one can left.

589
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,050
You two can share it.

590
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,090
Keep it, Mr. Gao.

591
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,830
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

592
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,340
You acted quickly.

593
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,350
It's you who hit those people, right?

594
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,660
It's not right.

595
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,960
It's not right to hit people. Did you know?

596
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:37,980
But

597
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,580
when you meet bad people,

598
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,100
you must stick to your duties

599
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,300
and defend yourselves.

600
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,350
Write a report

601
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,620
to explain the situation.

602
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,590
As usual,

603
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,780
you have to write 3,000 words.

604
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,020
No word can be omitted.

605
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,090
I'll do as usual.

606
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,350
Wait.

607
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,270
Write it yourself.

608
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,980
Yes.

609
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,740
Attention!

610
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,100
Turn left.

611
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,500
Quick march!

612
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,460
What I said

613
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,490
is wrong?

614
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,900
No.

615
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,620
Then why did you smile?

616
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,700
Who smiled?

617
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,500
Also,

618
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,260
when I was educating them,

619
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,900
why

620
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,740
did you interrupt?

621
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,460
Who interrupted?

622
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,300
Chief Song.

624
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,660
Thank you.

625
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,250
You thanked me?

626
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,860
Why did you thank me?

627
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,620
If you hadn't come,

628
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,980
I would have been in hospital.

629
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,860
You're not embarrassed to say that?

630
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,860
You're the supervisor of Shilitai Fire Station.

631
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,260
Your shoes dropped when you were running.

632
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
You are not embarrassed?

633
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,580
I'm embarrassed.

634
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,860
It's okay for me to beat one person at a time.

635
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,940
But I can't beat five persons at a time.

636
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Besides,

637
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,810
my training has been effective lately.

638
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,050
You have to believe me.

639
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,460
You want to thank me?

640
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,580
The report...

642
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,020
Leave it to me.

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,850

Good.

647
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,620
You have consciousness.

648
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,580
I talked to Xu Qin.

649
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,380
You two hit it off.

650
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,420
People who are slightly smart

651
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,620
can see that.

652
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,220
No.

653
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,940
She had complaints before.

654
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,060
But she's been

655
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,340
working with us every day these days

656
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,420
without any complaints.

657
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,340
Do you think

658
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,860
she

659
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,780
has feelings for someone

660
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,180
in our fire station?

661
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,340
You have sharp eyes.

662
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,700
Do you think

663
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,700
she likes me?

664
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,940
You?

665
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,900
Yes.

666
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,810
Didn't I tell you before?

667
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,490
Our families are very close.

668
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,060
Besides,

669
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,420
when we had meals together before,

670
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,620
she wasn't enthusiastic about me.

671
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,420
But she treats me differently these days.

672
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,780
Was she charmed

673
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,620
by my attitudes

to work?

675
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,020
It's said on the Internet

676
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,340
that men who work hard

677
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,460
are most charming.

679
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,540
Don't vomit yet.

680
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,340
Don't you two know each other well?

681
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,860
I want to ask you something.

682
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,620
We don't know each other well.

683
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,660
Why do you ask about her?

684
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,940
I'm a man.

685
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,220
She's a girl.

686
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,900
If she likes me,

687
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,450
I have to chase her.

688
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,540
You don't know

689
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,100
what kind of girls

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,020

691
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,460
I like calm and quiet girls.

692
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,380
The girls she introduced to me

693
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,980
are cute,

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,740
passionate,

695
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,460
and generous.

696
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,300
If she really likes me,

697
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,620
I'll chase her.

698
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,980
She doesn't like you.

699
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,580
She doesn't like me?

700
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Did she tell you this?

701
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,740
Even if she didn't tell me, I know it.

702
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,330
Besides,

703
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,500
why do you think she's quiet and calm?

704
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,420
Why do you think she's not cute

705
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
and can't act cute?

706
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,700
Do you know her well?

707
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,740
Stop talking nonsense.

708
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,900
Do you know her well?

709
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,300
How do you know whether or not she's cute?

710
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:01,940
I...

711
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,260
I know her better than you.

712
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,740
You like her?

713
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,330
Don't have designs on her.

714
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,220
Do you like her?

715
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,420
You like her, don't you?

716
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,220
Do you like her?

717
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:10,690
Tell me.

718
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,220
Yes.

719
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,300
I like her.

720
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,540
I like her

721
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,060
more than what you can think

722
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,020
and understand.

723
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,340
You like her?

724
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,580
It's the first time.

725
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,940
It's the first time

726
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,330
I've successfully forced you to tell the truth.

727
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,890
I won for the first time.

728
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,420
Today,

729
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,980
don't let me see you again.

730
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,050
Tonight,

731
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,530
don't go back to the dormitory.

732
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,140
I'll go back.

733
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,380
Do you like her?

734
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,260
I won this time.

735
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,220
I won this time.

736
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,780
The very thought of it makes me feel angry.

737
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,380
When we wear the suits,

738
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,860
we serve people.

739
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,780
Why couldn't we fight back

740
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,900
when we were being beaten?

741
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,580
So pathetic.

742
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,620
Supervisor protected us

743
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,650
and got hit several times.

744
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,100
There's no place for us to make a complaint.

745
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,580
Supervisor is so nice.

746
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,620
Although he nags a little,

747
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,660
when something happens,

748
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,380
he comes forward.

749
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,250
Stop talking about it.

750
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,580
I feel more uncomfortable

751
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,140
at the thought of the supervisor's suffering.

752
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,060
Why should we be wronged like this?

753
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,940
Exactly.

754
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,940
It's okay.

755
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,060
When I had a video chat with my mom two days ago,

756
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,820
I said

757
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,180
firemen were highly respected.

758
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,760
I was given a slap in the face.

759
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,900
Since we came to the fire station half a year ago,

760
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,490
we haven't been home yet.

761
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,020
Look at us.

762
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,740
Do you dare to go home?

763
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,810
Right.

764
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,140
Go home.

765
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,420
You are all here.

766
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,380
Supervisor came.

767
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,460
Hello, Supervisor.

768
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,420
Sit.

769
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,740
Supervisor.

770
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,420
Have a seat.

771
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,910

you didn't go and change dressings.

776

Yes. We did it ourselves.

If you are not treated for the wounds,

You answered yourself.

There's no need for me to interupt.

825

Not only did you not help me,

826

00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,420
don't compare those gangsters

966
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,380
with our chief again.

967
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,090
He's not a ruthless person.

968
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,620
You need to see

969
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,100
his other qualities.

970
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,700
He's responsible.

971
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,740
He cherishes his teammates.

972
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,540
He's a model and an all-rounder.

973
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,610
Learn from him.

974
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,900
Okay.

975
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,540
Monitor.

976
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,580
When can I

977
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,260
become like our chief?

978
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,580
I think there's a chance.

979
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,020
I think

980
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,420
you have to be reincarnated.

981
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,040
You...

982
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,460
What?

983
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,700
You're not convinced?

984
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,620
You just ran 5,000 meters.

985
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,780
Run one more round.

986
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
I'm not afraid.

987
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,090
Monitor, let us have extra training.

988
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,020
Good.

989
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,860
Are you confident?

990
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:24,700
Yes.

991
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,340
Get ready.

992
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,930
Come on.
