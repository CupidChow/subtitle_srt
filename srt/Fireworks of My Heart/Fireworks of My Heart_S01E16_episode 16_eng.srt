2
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:35,262
   

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,164
   

4
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,967
   

5
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,404
Recently, we've shown many shortcomings during rescue operations,

6
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,439
especially in terms of medical assistance.

7
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,702
How do you all feel about it? Let's talk about this.

8
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:51,866
Instructor.

9
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:54,014
Here's the thing.

10
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,216
Simple first aid and bandaging, we can handle that without any issues, right?

11
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,001
Yes.

12
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,988
But when it comes to more complex injuries, we don't have the skills for it.

13
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:05,459
Besides, treating injuries isn't our primary duty as firefighters.

14
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,427
The main thing is we're not very knowledgeable in that area.

15
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,601
- Instructor, Captain, I have an idea. 
 - Go on.

16
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,265
Can't we coordinate with medical units

17
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,835
so that when the fire truck arrives, an ambulance can also be dispatched?

18
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,572
Having professional doctors and nurses present

19
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:18,939
would ensure the injured receive immediate assistance.

20
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,632
Instructor, Dapeng's idea is something we have considered before.

21
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:25,578
For example, when we encounter injured individuals at the scene,

22
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,948
we can call for an ambulance. That's not a problem.

23
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,917
But having a medical vehicle on standby with us every day during missions,

24
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,138
that's not very realistic.

25
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:34,005
After all, we're of different systems.

26
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,989
Isn't that the same as saying nothing at all?

27
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,670
You are both right.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,039
What do you think?

29
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,197
Rescue scenes are filled with complexities.

30
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,967
Finding solutions is not difficult,

31
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,820
but implementing them is challenging.

32
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,846
Nothing worth having comes easy.

33
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,847
I want to give it a try.

34
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,999
- Training time! 
 - Let's go.

35
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,900
Let's go.

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,600
- Oh, it's too hot. 
 - Yes.

37
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,835
   

38
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:17,735
Establishing a Fire and Paramedic Joint Rescue Team,

39
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,438
is it a sudden inspiration or a long-standing contemplation?

40
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,674
Commissar, in the previous fire incident in the old neigborhood,

41
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:31,678
we received a call stating that it was an uninhabited area slated for demolition.

42
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:36,149
However, upon arriving at the scene, we discovered a child who was severely injured.

43
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,480
We carried out emergency treatment and took her to the hospital.

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,325
Also, a few days ago,

45
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:45,092
we found a seriously injured hiker deep in the mountains.

46
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:49,140
We sought assistance from a doctor via satellite phone.

47
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,460
These two incidents made me deeply reflect.

48
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,442
If we had a paramedic on hand,

49
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,373
we could have responded more quickly and efficiently,

50
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:01,040
significantly reducing the casualty rate.

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,593
This has been my recent contemplation and a long-held idea.

52
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,783
It'd indeed be ideal if doctors could be present at the scene for immediate treatment.

53
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,759
However, our medical and fire departments currently operate under different organizations,

54
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,827
so there may be some coordination delays.

55
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,700
But it's still within our control.

56
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,500
It would be beneficial if we could provide rescue training for doctors

57
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,659
and enhance the collaboration between the two departments.

58
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,978
While your suggestion is good,

59
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:40,414
having doctors and firefighters enter the first scene together

60
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,112
is not something to be taken lightly.

61
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:48,121
Have you thought about how to improve their response capabilities

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,505
while ensuring their safety?

63
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:52,979
Have firefighters provide targeted training for medical personnel

64
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,979
and establish safety protocols.

65
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,401
Looks like you already have some ideas about the training aspect.

66
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,801
By the way...

67
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,310
Commissar, I have a proposal here.

68
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,251
You've come well-prepared.

69
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:23,097
You've always wanted to work at the grassroots level.

70
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,826
I was worried you might have some difficulty adjusting.

71
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,945
How is it working with Song Yan?

72
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:31,602
He has been of great help to me and has shown great support.

73
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,002
I know his temper well.

74
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,242
It's not easy for you two to work together.

75
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,709
All right.

76
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,260
I will submit your proposal to the higher authorities.

77
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,883
Let's strive to make Shili Tai a pilot unit and collaborate with the city hospital.

78
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,483
Thank you, Commissar.

79
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,388
Thank you for taking the trip here.

80
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,310
I wish for a successful collaboration between our units.

81
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,791
Also, please consider the media coverage aspect.

82
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,671
After all, it's a form of publicity.

83
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,832
Thank you, Assistant Director Liu. You don’t need to walk us out.

84
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,637
See you next time.

85
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:14,174
He only wants the superficial stuff.

86
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,543
As long as we can get real work done, it doesn't matter.

87
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,550
What real work?

88
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,671
I've always disagreed with the establishment of a joint rescue team.

89
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:23,216
And I still hold that stance.

90
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,585
Doctors and nurses have insufficient knowledge of fire scenes

91
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,351
and can't carry out practical operations.

92
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,031
I didn't say they have to enter the fire scene.

93
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:33,950
I'll train them properly and prioritize safety, all right?

94
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,557
You're oversimplifying things.

95
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:39,550
Are the doctors and nurses part of the hospital or the fire station?

96
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,890
When their work at the hospital conflicts with firefighting,

97
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,011
which side will they prioritize?

98
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:47,617
That's why I say you're just full of impractical ideas.

99
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,476
These aren't impractical ideas.

100
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,704
We'll start with a pilot project.

101
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,312
Wouldn't it be great to have

102
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,681
professional medical personnel cooperating with firefighters?

103
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,791
- We're getting off track. 
 - Let's bring it back then.

104
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,190
Once the joint rescue team is established, you will need to do the training...

105
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,790
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,130
What a coincidence.

107
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,290
What are you doing here?

108
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,631
We're here to talk about the joint rescue team.

109
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:16,811
Allow me to introduce. This is Song Yan, our captain.

110
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,371
You know each other?

111
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,171
- No. 
 - Yes.

112
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,550
- Sort of. 
 - No.

113
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,110
You guys go ahead. I'll leave now.

114
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,101
What's with you two?

115
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,707
None of your business.

116
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,251
Aren't you going to ask how I met her?

117
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,069
None of my business.

118
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,731
- All right. 
 - Please.

119
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,731
It'll take five business days for the report to come out.

120
00:07:57,731 --> 00:08:00,611
- Thank you. 
 - It's my job. Goodbye, President Meng.

121
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,862
   

122
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:33,131
Brother.

123
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,716
Did you finish your check-up?

124
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,331
What do you want to eat for lunch?

125
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:39,231
Why haven't you get changed?

126
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:42,131
I was thinking we could just eat at the cafeteria.

127
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,530
I thought I could take you out for a nice lunch.

128
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,650
Bro, I'm really busy, okay?

129
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,256
Do you think our cafeteria is not good enough?

130
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:55,402
No. I don't mind trying it.

131
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,177
Do you remember when we were little and you couldn't get enough to eat,

132
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:00,674
and I'd sneak you out to grab something?

133
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,670
I don't remember.

134
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,441
Do you really not remember?

135
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,351
You have to support it.

136
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,242
We run into each other again.

137
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,836
What brings you to the hospital?

138
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,591
Medical check-up.

139
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:25,190
- And you? 
 - Work.

140
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,231
Allow me to introduce.

141
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:29,750
This is Song Yan, the captain of our fire station.

142
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,991
This is Meng Yan Chen. Xu Qin's brother.

143
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,150
You know each other?

144
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,850
- No. 
 - No.

145
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,710
Say hi to each other then.

146
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,971
Hi.

147
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,730
Hi.

148
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,910
Let's go, Brother.

149
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,840
We should get going.

150
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,890
Assistant Director Liu.

151
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,371
Madam Fu, Song Yan is now the captain of a fire station.

152
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,170
I don't know him.

153
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,170
Yes. You don't know him.

154
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,551
I misspoke. It's nothing.

155
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,500
   

156
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,810
Take your time. Read it well.

157
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,650
This concerns the hospital's reputation.

158
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,906
It's also an opportunity for your emergency department to showcase their abilities.

159
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,770
I know you don't care,

160
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,691
but it's also a good opportunity for the young people in your department.

161
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,689
If you have any suggestions, feel free to speak up.

162
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:58,471
I think it's inappropriate for doctors to stay at the fire station for training.

163
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:00,754
Moreover, they are required to go to the frontline.

164
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,431
The situation at the frontline is filled with uncertainties.

165
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,890
Who will guarantee the safety of the doctors?

166
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:13,800
You just hit the nail on the head with these two points.

167
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,336
How can we ensure the safety of doctors at the frontline?

168
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,404
Don't they need appropriate knowledge to deal with such situations?

169
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,904
And where does this knowledge come from?

170
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,242
Isn't it derived from regular training?

171
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,235
If you don't train well, how can you treat and save lives?

172
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,650
You shouldn't be concerned about that right now.

173
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,410
You should just about who should be chosen for this task.

174
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,183
No need to think about it.

175
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,531
Send me.

176
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,393
I'm not joking.

177
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,424
I'm telling you this is a task assigned by Director Wang.

178
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:45,263
If you have a problem with it, take it up with him.

179
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,290
   

180
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,000
   

181
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,210
Department Chief, I want to go.

182
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,510
What's your reason?

183
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,410
Someone in our department has to go anyway.

184
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,864
Whether it's at the hospital or at the frontline, it's all about saving lives.

185
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,530
The responsibilities of doctors haven't changed.

186
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,629
Do you really think so?

187
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,431
All right. I got it.

188
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,990
Then, I shall get back to work.

189
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,390
Okay.

190
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,791
- Li Nan. 
 - Team Leader.

191
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,971
I thought you didn't want to join the rescue team.

192
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,383
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,649
I made a decision on my own without consulting you.

194
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,036
It's okay. The higher up has decidedto send our group anyway.

195
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,451
Okay. I'll let you pack up. I'm leaving.

196
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,351
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

197
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,970
What's the purpose of your visit today?

198
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,451
I came to say goodbye.

199
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:29,030
I'm leaving in a couple days.

200
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,750
I'm planning to go on a six-month trip first.

201
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,191
If I enjoy it, I'll visit West Africa too.

202
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,204
You're leaving, huh?

203
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:38,870
You really live in the moment.

204
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,051
This is what I call enjoying life.

205
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,270
I envy you sometimes.

206
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,231
You can do it too, you know.

207
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,131
How are things going between you and him?

208
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:59,271
In the past, I didn't want to hurt him,

209
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,535
but now I keep hesitating.

210
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,476
It's not only hurting him, but also hurting myself.

211
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,340
I used to believe that as long as I was willing, he wouldn't leave, but now...

212
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,018
Well, you brought it upon yourself.

213
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,383
Perhaps.

214
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:22,437
Maybe, instinctively, I want to test his limits repeatedly.

215
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:28,323
Or maybe it's as he said,

216
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:33,030
you're only considering going back to him because you haven't found someone new to like.

217
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,535
I don't know either.

218
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:40,206
Sometimes I wonder if I've lost the ability to love,

219
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,975
that's why I keep getting stuck in the past.

220
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,912
But no matter how much I say it,

221
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,996
when it really comes down to it,

222
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,782
I still don't want to give up.

223
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,589
That's Song Yan we're talking about. Who wants to give up on him?

224
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:55,109
So, what's your plan?

225
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:58,591
If he takes a step towards me, I'll take a step towards him.

226
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,390
Just like he said,

227
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,295
he doesn't know the present me

228
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,211
and doesn't know if the present me is worth his liking.

229
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:09,491
And as for me, I also don't know the present him.

230
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:13,807
I don't know if the present him is the one I truly like.

231
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,407
So...

232
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,569
We're getting to know each other again.

233
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,770
   

234
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,111
They are doctors and nurses from the city hospital.

235
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:58,658
They are here in our Shili Tai Fire Station to form a joint rescue team with us.

236
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,139
Let's give them a round of applause.

237
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,870
Let me introduce myself.

238
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,171
My name is Jiang Yu. I'm the instructor.

239
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,411
This is Song Yan, Captain Song.

240
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,911
Hi.

241
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:18,983
Let's introduce ourselves to each other and get to know each other.

242
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:23,551
I'm Xu Xi, a nurse from the emergency department.

243
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:26,511
Please take care of me.

244
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:29,931
I'm Chen Dongdong, a nurse from the emergency department.

245
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:34,430
I'm Xu Qin, a doctor from the emergency department.

246
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,591
I'm Li Nan, a doctor from the emergency department.

247
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,130
I'm Feng Bei, a nurse from the emergency department.

248
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,491
Let's once again welcome Dr. Xu Qin and her medical team.

249
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,691
Hi, Captain Song. 
    

250
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,230
Hi, Dr. Xu.

251
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,470
This way, please.

252
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,831
Welcome, everyone.

253
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,397
- Give them a warm welcome. 
  - Warmer, warmer.

254
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,311
- Warmer, warmer. 
 - Please come in.

255
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,751
Welcome!

256
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,111
Here is our dormitory.

257
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:26,190
Feel free to take a look around.

258
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,290
You boys' dormitory is so tidy.

259
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,470
It's like a completely different world compared to our duty room.

260
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,996
You're the one to talk. It's all because of you.

261
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:41,081
I heard that you guys never take off your socks when you sleep. Is that true?

262
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,651
That's exaggerated.

263
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:44,838
But when the alarm goes off, no matter what we're doing,

264
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,911
we have to put on shoes and leave.

265
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,431
That sounds quite tough.

266
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:53,411
By the way, you guys don't even have any clutter here.

267
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,750
We do. We keep everything organized in the cabinets.

268
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:08,191
So, the Pan Pan sticker on your cabinet is pretty cute.

269
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,910
- Dapeng, why are your ears turning red? 
 - Why are you feeling shy?

270
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,031
No, I'm not.

271
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,950
We are just visiting your dormitory.

272
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,026
There's nothing to be shy about.

273
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,791
You're quite innocent.

274
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,371
How about this?

275
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,670
Let's continue the tour.

276
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,351
Let's see them off.

277
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,251
This way, please.

278
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,743
Let's visit the rooms in front. This way, please.

279
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,911
What is this?

280
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,430
Oh, this.

281
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,815
This was used for easy access to downstairs in case of emergencies.

282
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,490
It's a result of the historical evolution of firefighting

283
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,670
and a legacy from the period of firefighting forces.

284
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,190
However, for safety reasons, it's no longer in use.

285
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,670
But it's still fine to demonstrate it to you.

286
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,227
Xiao Jiang, you don't need to demonstrate.

287
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,676
Have you forgotten about your leg injury? Let me do it.

288
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:58,870
- My legs are fine. 
 - Say no more. I'll do it.

289
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,111
It has to be me.

290
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:01,970
This...

291
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,271
You lead everyone down the stairs. Let's meet downstairs.

292
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,870
Safety first.

293
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,270
Bye bye.

294
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,511
That's so cool.

295
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,950
That's cool? We used to do this every day.

296
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,111
Jiang Yi, what's wrong with someone complimenting me?

297
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,670
- Fine, fine. You're the coolest. 
 - Of course.

298
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,950
Can we try this out?

299
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,991
No, no.

300
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:27,060
This is only used by experienced firefighters who have received professional training.

301
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,670
We haven't been trained much.

302
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,210
Let's take the stairs. It's safe. This way, please.

303
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,590
This way.

304
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:51,217
Dr. Xu, the stairs are that way.

305
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,589
Dr. Xu, it's an open day today.

306
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,370
If you're interested, come in and have a look around.

307
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,090
Anywhere is free to visit, except for my room.

308
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,870
This is also my room.

309
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,950
I have half of the rights.

310
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,036
Come in.

311
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,190
- You just have to go against me, don't you? 
 - I don't.

312
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,750
Come. Take a look around.

313
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,124
What do you think?

314
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:25,391
Guess which of these bed is Song Yan's?

315
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,550
This one.

316
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,337
Impressive! They look exactly the same. How did you figure it out?

317
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,617
There's a photo on top.

318
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:36,051
Well done.

319
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,230
So, he's the one you like, huh?

320
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,770
Yet he pretended you were strangers.

321
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,190
- About us... 
 - What about us?

322
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,090
Isn't it just that my parents know your parents?

323
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:15,670
One, two, three, four.

324
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,670
One, two, three, four.

325
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,771
One, two, one. Halt!

326
00:22:22,831 --> 00:22:24,831
All of you, right face!

327
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:26,750
Right-dress!

328
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,470
Eyes front!

329
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,051
Report! The medical team is here. 
    

330
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:38,977
They have to get new training clothes.

331
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,950
- Dapeng. 
 - Yes, sir.

332
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,244
Write down their sizes.

333
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:45,944
Yes, Instructor.

334
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,504
First of all,

335
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,751
once again, welcome to all the medical staff.

336
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,943
Thank you for joining us at the fire station

337
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,081
and collaborating with us to explore new rescue methods.

338
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:06,123
Secondly, we will conduct a basic physical training session for all of you.

339
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:11,557
The main goal is to enhance the efficiency of our rescue operations.

340
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:17,472
We aim to respond to emergencies more swiftly, with better on-site emergency reactions.

341
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:18,864
Additionally,

342
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,783
this training will help us develop better teamwork

343
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:24,131
and improve overall effectiveness in our rescue missions.

344
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:32,111
I only have three points.

345
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,815
Firstly, team members must obey orders.

346
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,424
The situation at the scene can be complex.

347
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:38,596
Upon arrival,

348
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:41,111
it is crucial to follow the instructions and arrangements of the on-site commander.

349
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,877
Obeying orders and following commands

350
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:45,791
are prerequisites for completing all rescue missions.

351
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,011
Secondly, team members must develop a sense of safety awareness

352
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,765
before entering the scene.

353
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,265
Lastly,

354
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,083
due to your limited physical condition,

355
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,871
you must not take risk with your life.

356
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,575
Do you understand?

357
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:03,334
 Yes. 

358
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,046
- Let's start training. 
 - All medical staff.

359
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,384
On my command. Left face!

360
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:12,710
Double time, march!

361
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,551
All of you,

362
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,623
right face!

363
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,663
Double time, march!

364
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,731
One, two, one.

365
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:25,570
One, two, one.

366
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,830
   

367
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,511
- Dr. Xu, I need to write down your sizes. 
 - Okay.

368
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,230
- What's your shoe size? 
 - 37.

369
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,614
37.

370
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,383
- What size shirt and pants do you wear? 
 - M.

371
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,811
- Okay. Thank you. 
 - No problem.

372
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,151
Thank you.

373
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,690
Thank you.

374
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:03,757
These training exercises might be a bit challenging for you.

375
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,556
Are you looking down on me?

376
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,878
In the past, you would catch a cold from a gust of wind after breaking a sweat.

377
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:13,592
With such a weak physique, why did you come here

378
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,530
instead of staying at the hospital?

379
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,770
I am no longer the fragile Xu Qin from the past.

380
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,111
Are you worried about me?

381
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:32,998
I'm just thinking that there will be many sudden situations

382
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,251
and complex circumstances on the scene.

383
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:38,084
During rescue operations, I won't be able to take care of all of you.

384
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,851
You are the leader of the medical team. Haven't you considered these things?

385
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:42,975
I have.

386
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,670
But plans can't always keep up with changes.

387
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,114
There are many things that may not have a 100% fit in the beginning.

388
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,784
Only by identifying and resolving problems during the process

389
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,787
can we ultimately achieve the desired results.

390
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:58,706
Then why not avoid potential risks before problems arise?

391
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,810
Doctors face risks when going to the scene,

392
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,830
but do firefighters not face any risks when going to the scene?

393
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:09,301
You are responsible for the rescue, and we are responsible for the treatment.

394
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,004
We all have our own mission and responsibility.

395
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:16,150
As long as we cooperate well, we are comrades fighting side by side,

396
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,070
not burdens or hindrances.

397
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:26,650
Dr. Xu, you seem to have become braver.

398
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:30,270
Remove the word "seem."

399
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:43,311
See you later.

400
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,451
I'm finished. See you later.

401
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:53,791
Captain, see you later.

402
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:16,570
After all these years, your eating speed hasn't changed at all.

403
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,750
I taught you, but you haven't learned anything.

404
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,210
Don't waste it.

405
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,810
I can't finish it.

406
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,025
You haven't eaten much. The portion is small too.

407
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,910
Being a doctor requires physical strength.

408
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,850
You can't perform well if you don't eat enough.

409
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,670
I'll let you get a head start today.

410
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,097
- I don't need you to... 
 - Stop right there.

411
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,500
Squad Leader, what can I do for you?

412
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,703
Where are you three going?

413
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:58,270
We're going to play ball in the activity room.

414
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,174
Play ball...

415
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:01,775
- Xiao Ge. 
 - Yes, Sir.

416
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,175
Come here.

417
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,510
Stand here.

418
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,883
Stand here?

419
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:12,928
Stand here and guard the door.

420
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:15,804
Wait until the medical personnel finish washing up.

421
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:18,325
Then, you can let everyone else in.

422
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:19,923
Are you sure this is appropriate?

423
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,929
What's inappropriate about this?

424
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,561
Captain said our station has limited facilities.

425
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,076
By guarding here,

426
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:29,029
you're letting everyone know that there are people inside.

427
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:31,303
Yes, Sir.

428
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,592
Complete the mission.

429
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,450
Let's go play ball.

430
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,050
Let's go.

431
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,256
- He scared me. 
 - Who is he?

432
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,535
Why...

433
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,624
Why are you standing here?

434
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:08,742
Squad... Squad Leader told me to stand here.

435
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:11,078
He's probably guarding the door.

436
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:12,513
You're guarding the door.

437
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:15,570
That's right.

438
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,751
But there is no one else inside.

439
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,037
Thanks for the hard work.

440
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:20,521
You're worked hard too.

441
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:21,787
We didn't work hard.

442
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,490
- You worked hard. 
 - What are you two talking about?

443
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,430
Finish washing up and go back to rest early.

444
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,098
Okay.

445
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,956
You've worked hard.

446
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,597
Why is everyone here so shy?

447
00:30:36,597 --> 00:30:38,931
Let's shower faster from now on.

448
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:40,771
I feel bad.

449
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:52,617
Captain Song,

450
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:57,117
do you have any opinions regarding today's training?

451
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,825
Opinions?

452
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:03,870
I wouldn't say they're opinions, but rather some ideas.

453
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,470
What ideas?

454
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:08,402
I was thinking,

455
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,804
you said earlier that the fire station should provide targeted training

456
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:16,078
for accompanying doctors and establish on-site safety guidelines.

457
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:20,912
But since we are a joint rescue team, the doctors are not just there as extras.

458
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:26,520
In fact, we need their professional assistance and support.

459
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,323
They can also provide us with training on medical knowledge.

460
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,761
I fully agree with what you said.

461
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:36,767
Mutual learning can lead to a win-win situation.

462
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:41,976
You truly are the face of Shili Tai Fire Station.

463
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,540
Are you insulting me?

464
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,443
How come you can't understand a simple compliment?

465
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:51,810
Doesn't "face" mean just a decoration?

466
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,311
You are really strange.

467
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,791
Why do you always get hung up on these small details?

468
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:01,851
Okay, you're the brainy one, and I just show my face, all right?

469
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,510
Thank you. I love hearing that.

470
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,206
Is there someone inside?

471
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,016
Pan Pan?

472
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,505
These are the new training uniforms.

473
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:37,512
If the size doesn't fit, you can tell me.

474
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:39,370
Okay, thank you.

475
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,563
Also, my name is Zhan Dapeng.

476
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:44,682
Hi, I'm Li Nan.

477
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:49,101
- I should go. 
 - Okay.

478
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,650
It's so embarrassing.

479
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,810
Do I have anything else planned for today?

480
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,060
We had to leave for work during your last medical checkup.

481
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,137
You still have two tests left.

482
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,366
- Got it. 
 - Oh, by the way.

483
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:26,349
These are the tickets for the art exhibition you asked me to buy.

484
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,800
   

485
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,077
By the way, I recently met someone

486
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:39,217
who wants to find a part-time job at the Qinghe Art Museum.

487
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,385
Please help refer her.

488
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,024
I'll send you her contact details later.

489
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,271
Got it.

490
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,011
If there's nothing else, I'll head out.

491
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,370
   

492
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:05,211
It seems like there's no hope for campus recruitment.

493
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,691
Why did I choose this niche major back then?

494
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:09,783
I'll be unemployed right after graduation.

495
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:13,919
I'll have to live on air. I can only live on air for sure.

496
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,551
Back when we were choosing our majors, no one in our family could guide us.

497
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:21,727
We wasted our efforts to achieve high scores.

498
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,363
What's the use of getting into such a good university?

499
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,702
Choosing the wrong major can ruin your entire life.

500
00:34:29,174 --> 00:34:31,133
Ye Zi, I have a high school classmate

501
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:34,105
who is working as a salesperson at a cosmetics counter.

502
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,775
She has some makeup skills. Now she's doing live streaming sales.

503
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,972
Although she doesn't have a large number of followers,

504
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:42,149
she can still earn a small five-figure income every month.

505
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,770
Unlike us, our salary starts from ¥4,000  (~$548) .

506
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:48,230
What can we do?

507
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,423
At the end of the universe, it's all about sales.

508
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,991
But doing sales isn't that easy either.

509
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,094
Last time, I brought in a batch of products and couldn't sell a single one.

510
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,696
It's all because the traffic is too low.

511
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,932
I would have earned more by personally promoting them door-to-door.

512
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:10,411
- Yezi. 
 - Yes?

513
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:14,408
What are you doing?

514
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,370
You're quite photogenic.

515
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,289
Yezi, how about I help you open a live-stream account?

516
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,571
You can focus on beauty and fashion styling.

517
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:25,070
It might not be as easy as you think.

518
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,650
Give it a try. It doesn't require much investment.

519
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,270
Explore different paths, and who knows, maybe one of them will lead to success.

520
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,771
But I've found a few part-time jobs.

521
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,090
You can't hinder my part-time work.

522
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,862
Don't worry, it won't affect your part-time jobs at all.

523
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,451
Captain Song and I have talked about it.

524
00:35:44,451 --> 00:35:48,283
We both agree that the establishment of the joint rescue team

525
00:35:48,283 --> 00:35:51,221
is not only for the medical crew to familiarize themselves with us

526
00:35:51,221 --> 00:35:52,854
and cooperate with our operations.

527
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:58,874
It's also crucial for us firefighters to have some knowledge of medical practices.

528
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:03,278
In situations that are too dangerous and difficult for medical crews to reach,

529
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:08,537
we can make more efficient and accurate judgments and provide assistance.

530
00:36:08,537 --> 00:36:11,940
Therefore, moving forward, we will allocate half a day

531
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,612
for medical personnel to teach us some medical knowledge.

532
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:19,411
Today, we have invited Dr. Xu to teach us some medical knowledge

533
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:24,151
that will be useful during emergency rescue operations.

534
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:26,030
Yes!

535
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,327
Does everyone know how to perform

536
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:33,087
bleeding control, dressing wounds, CPR, and artificial respiration?

537
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:37,332
Our new team members may not be familiar,

538
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:40,135
the experienced ones can refresh their knowledge.

539
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:41,690
Let's learn one by one.

540
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,531
Okay. Today, let's start by learning bleeding control and dressing wounds.

541
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,610
However,

542
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:50,481
I need a human model for demonstration.

543
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:53,011
- Jiang Yi, you're up. 
 - Yes, sir.

544
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,416
Hang on. Don't rush into it.

545
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,118
Captain, Old Jiang isn't good at bandaging.

546
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:58,987
You should be the model and demonstrate.

547
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:01,058
That's true, Captain. My bandaging skills are really not good.

548
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:03,329
I need to watch and learn more.

549
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,491
Captain, I'm bad at bandaging too.

550
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,793
Put your hands together for Captain!

551
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:12,811
 Go, Captain! 

552
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:26,047
Arterial bleeding is the most dangerous type of open bleeding.

553
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,016
It has a fast and forceful blood flow with a large volume.

554
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:30,619
If not stopped in time, it can be life-threatening.

555
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,690
Therefore, learning how to quickly stop arterial bleeding

556
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,492
can buy more time for the injured.

557
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:37,092
Xu Xi.

558
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,969
During the process of assisting the injured,

559
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:50,841
a bandage or tourniquet can be used to stop arterial bleeding at the proximal end,

560
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:53,894
for lower limbs, it can be tied around the middle of the thigh,

561
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,805
and for upper limbs, it can be tied below the deltoid muscle.

562
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:02,337
Look at this, everyone.

563
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:04,642
It's this spot.

564
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:09,804
Captain Song, focus.

565
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:14,996
Pay attention, everyone.

566
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,944
Bandages or tourniquets should be loosened every 15 minutes

567
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:20,570
to prevent tissue ischemia and necrosis.

568
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:26,116
Captain Song,

569
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:29,796
take off your shirt.

570
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,271
Pardon me?

571
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,411
Take off your shirt.

572
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:53,570
I bet you 5 km  (~3.1 miles) .

573
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,371
Captain Song has a chance with Dr. Xu.

574
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:56,539
I bet you 10 km  (6.2 miles) .

575
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,642
Before he has a shot with her, you'll be in trouble.

576
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,371
In traumatic injuries caused by car accidents, earthquakes, and fires,

577
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:10,985
tension pneumothorax often occurs in the injured.

578
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:13,070
If we don't immediately perform needle decompression,

579
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,090
it can quickly lead to death.

580
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:18,793
Now, I will talk about the symptoms of tension pneumothorax.

581
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:21,137
First, the injured person experiences extreme difficulty in breathing,

582
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,765
and severe hypoxia may even lead to asphyxiation.

583
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:25,066
Second,

584
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,870
there is significant distension of the injured side of the chest,

585
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,737
noticeably higher than the other side.

586
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:30,017
If these two criteria are met,

587
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:32,076
immediate needle decompression should be performed.

588
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:35,679
In emergency situations, a large-gauge needle can be inserted at

589
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,179
the intersection of the second intercostal space

590
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:40,148
and the mid clavicular line of the injured person for decompression.

591
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:41,750
You may come and try to find the spot.

592
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,087
I'd like to...

593
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,051
Not you guys.

594
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,496
Instructor, please take the lead.

595
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:47,996
Okay.

596
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:57,167
Hurry up.

597
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,730
This is the first intercostal space.

598
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,164
This is the second intercostal space.

599
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,383
The intersection is right here.

600
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:05,796
Okay. Next.

601
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:06,823
I'll try.

602
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,344
Captain, forgive me.

603
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,591
The midclavicular...

604
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:13,984
This spot? This spot, right?

605
00:40:13,984 --> 00:40:15,130
This is the first.

606
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,730
This is the second.

607
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:19,488
Got it.

608
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:23,950
Okay. That's it for the demonstration.

609
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,290
Captain, I haven't...

610
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,971
- Why did Captain leave? 
 - The teaching tool is gone.

611
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:29,371
Captain Song has a great physique.

612
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:30,634
You're so spoony.

613
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:32,200
Keep it together.

614
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,369
Why did he run away?

615
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,531
Come on, Pi Pi. You'll be the model now. Take off your shirt.

616
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:38,011
- That's not a good idea. 
 - Hurry up and do it.

617
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:39,937
Put your hands together for him!

618
