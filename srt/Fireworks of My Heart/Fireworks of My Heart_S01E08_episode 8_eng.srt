00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:35,262
   

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,164
   

4
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,067
   

5
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:43,560
 We got a suicide jumper at No.13 Shuiyang Street. 

6
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,379
 We got a suicide jumper at No.13 Shuiyang Street. 

7
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,090
I'll brief you on the situation.

8
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,974
A young girl lost her job and had an argument with her parents.

9
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,054
She's attempting suicide now. She's in a very tense emotional state.

10
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:27,156
Our officer is trying to get her to come down.

11
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,840
There she is.

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,250
Will you please come down first?

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,786
Stay away! If you come closer, I'll jump!

14
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,693
Yang Chi, take care of the ground. I'll go up.

15
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,690
Instructor, let me go up instead. You stay here.

16
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,360
This is an order.

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
Jiang Yi, Jun Ping, come with me.

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Yes, Sir.

19
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,322
Lay the air cushion, set up the cordon. Now!

20
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,439
Girl, will you please come down first?

21
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,400
Go away. Don't come any closer, or I'll jump!

22
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,982
Don't move.

23
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,251
Listen to me.

24
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,421
You're still young. You have a whole life ahead of you.

25
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,222
- Back off! Or else I'll jump! 
 - Okay! Okay!

26
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,367
Okay. Okay.

27
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,225
I'll stay here, I promise.

28
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:18,879
You stay there, too.

29
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,379
Girl...

30
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,570
where you're standing is too dangerous.

31
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,639
Let's talk over on this side.

32
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,975
Even if I die, no one cares.

33
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,280
Why would you think that?

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,045
You're still so young.

35
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,093
If you have any problems,

36
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,985
I'll solve them with you, okay?

37
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,724
Here, have some water first.

38
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,324
No.

39
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:50,012
You can't solve my problem.

40
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,998
You can always find another job.

41
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,479
You don't understand, none of you understand!

42
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,337
I've worked really hard already.

43
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,758
Really, really hard.

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,678
My boss is a rascal, a scumbag!

45
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,279
He ruined everything for me.

46
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,919
That's even more reason for you to keep going.

47
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,522
Girl,

48
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,533
if you were bullied, I'll go to the police with you.

49
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:21,353
I'll make sure you get justice! Okay?

50
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:25,659
I can't get justice anymore. I lost the evidence.

51
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,319
My parents even scolded me.

52
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,205
They said I can't do anything right,

53
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,074
that I lost my job, and I'm useless.

54
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,110
All they do is yell at me.

55
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,346
Ever since I was little, no matter what happens,

56
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,316
it was always my fault. My fault!

57
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,475
I'm a mistake!

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,987
Since they want me dead, I'll do as they wish!

59
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,947
No! No!

60
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,079
No. Don't jump.

61
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,495
Don't jump.

62
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,195
Don't jump.

63
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,737
Don't jump.

64
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,573
Don't jump.

65
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
Girl,

66
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,979
trust me.

67
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,852
I'm sure things aren't how you think they are.

68
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,752
They aren't.

69
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,033
Actually, I'm just like you.

70
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:32,623
I've never received approval from my parents since I was little.

71
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,572
My dad not only scolded me, but he also hit me.

72
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,758
I used to hate them so much.

73
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,905
But later, I eventually realized

74
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,120
that our parents do love us.

75
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,717
It's just that they have their limitations too.

76
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:55,790
It's very likely that they themselves weren't treated well by their own parents.

77
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:59,781
They do what they do out of concern and care for us.

78
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,300
But they don't know how to express love.

79
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,852
That's why their words come out so harsh.

80
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:10,035
It becomes verbal abuse to your ears, right?

81
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:16,058
There are no parents who don't love their children, right?

82
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,044
Here.

83
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,200
Have some water first. Here.

84
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,257
You should have it.

85
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,412
You should have it.

86
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,042
Girl,

87
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,745
you can distance yourself from people and jobs you don't like,

88
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,781
including your parents.

89
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,879
You can move out.

90
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,025
You can move to another city.

91
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,720
If you don't want to see certain people, you don't have to. It's okay.

92
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,322
You're still so young.

93
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,958
Your future holds endless possibilities, right?

94
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,002
You've been standing there for a long time.

95
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,639
Aren't you tired?

96
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,039
Let's come up for a moment, okay?

97
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
Come, come.

98
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,139
Come.

99
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,053
Do you think she'll jump?

100
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,955
Who knows?

101
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,899
Maybe she's just putting an act.

102
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:39,639
Stop saying such insensitive things.

103
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,829
She wants to kill herself just because she had a fight with her family?

104
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,439
Someone like her is a waste of existence.

105
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,998
How could you say that?

106
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,366
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,759
How could you say that?

108
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,369
Kids like her are the worst.

109
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,972
She's going against her family on purpose.

110
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,952
She shouldn't have been born in the first place.

111
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,824
Sir,

112
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,026
thank you.

113
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,280
No!

115
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,099
Instructor!

116
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,435
Yang Chi, I'll lower the rope.

117
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:31,439
 Catch the instructor. 

118
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,300
Okay. Lower the instructor down slowly. Aim for the air cushion.

119
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Catch him!

120
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,320
- He has landed. 
 - Safe.

121
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,374
- Take her to the hospital. 
 - Got it.

122
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,720
Are you okay? Are you okay?

123
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,160
Who said that just now? Are you even human?

124
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,697
That's a life.

125
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,679
A life!

126
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,735
Who among you has never felt lost?

127
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,395
Who among you has never faced difficulties?

128
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:40,514
If the person standing up there was your family member, loved one, or child,

129
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:45,293
would you still be able to look at it as a joke?

130
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,993
Could you?

131
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:01,235
Instructor, are you okay?

132
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,035
Brother Jun, Brother Jun.

133
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:18,050
   

134
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,157
Zhai Miao!

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,397
How are you now? Are you okay?

136
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,640
If it wasn't for my brother, I'd probably still be at the police station.

137
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,220
You've suffered.

138
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,172
- Then... 
 - Don't worry.

139
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,432
No matter what happened to me, I would never give you away.

140
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,715
I really didn't know that they gave me counterfeit goods.

142
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,241
It's okay. It's not your fault anyway.

143
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:54,555
Although I bought the goods from you, you're also a victim.

144
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:55,755
Speaking of which,

145
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,114
take a look at this.

146
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,197
   

147
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:04,664
That's so much!

148
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,099
It's the money used for buying the goods and the fines.

149
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,843
Don't worry. I won't ask you to pay for it.

150
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,360
However, we need to find a quick way to make money.

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,013
My cousin paid the fines for me.

152
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,053
That's his hard-earned money. I have to pay him back as soon as possible.

153
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,306
Okay, we'll repay him together.

154
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,570
Let's talk.

155
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,021
I spoke without thinking that day.

156
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,469
I was a little harsh.

157
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:42,446
I didn't give you a chance to express your thoughts properly.

158
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,513
I'm the one who should apologize.

160
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,780
I should have discussed this with you in the first place.

161
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,994
With our relationship, I shouldn't have kept it from you.

162
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:06,320
I should be the one apologizing.

163
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,172
I wasn't thinking straight that day. I thought you were only after money.

164
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,026
But deep down, I didn't actually think that.

165
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,320
Somehow, it just led there.

166
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,529
And I just blurted it out.

167
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,069
Of course, I knew you didn't think that way

168
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,466
Do you know what the ¥1,200 means to me?

169
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,779
It means...

170
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:29,080
I can better support my parents.

171
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,600
It means I can stop being in a long-distance relationship.

172
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,814
For the past five or six years,

173
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,027
I've been away from home most of the time.

174
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:39,352
My father just had surgery and his health isn't good.

175
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,355
He has difficulty moving around.

176
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,456
My fiancée has been taking care of him.

177
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,307
For so many years, we've been in a relationship without an official status.

178
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,630
She has been worrying about me too much.

179
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,732
I can't keep holding her back either.

180
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,752
So this is the reality I have to face.

181
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,180
What about you?

182
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,906
What are your plans for the future?

183
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,828
Since joining this team,

184
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,240
I haven't had the energy to think about anything else.

185
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:13,043
But recently...

186
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:17,311
I don't know why, I keep thinking about the past.

187
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,419
Back then...

188
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:29,236
Well, it seems to have nothing to do with the present.

189
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,038
Honestly,

190
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:36,019
I don't know if the future me will have any connection with the present.

191
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:40,380
But I hope there will be.

192
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,151
Otherwise, I'll be like a kite, flying high,

193
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,338
but not knowing where the thread is.

194
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,399
There will be a connection.

195
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,360
After all, we're not machines.

196
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,072
Who doesn't have moments of confusion and uncertainty?

197
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,163
Listen to me,

198
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,839
my friend,

199
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,720
do your job well,

200
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,765
but it's also time to settle down.

201
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,100
I've been wondering...

202
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,700
if my future family

203
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,918
would only have me in it.

204
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,880
Coming back to an empty house...

205
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:39,706
without anyone waiting for me.

206
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,744
There will be someone.

207
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,439
There will definitely be someone.

208
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,885
Hold on, why did the subject of our conversation suddenly shift to me?

209
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,265
Suo Jun,

210
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:13,360
no matter where you go or what decisions you make,

211
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,706
you'll always be my closest comrade,

212
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,296
my closest buddy.

213
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,233
Don't worry.

214
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,009
No matter where I am,

215
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,878
no matter what place I'm in,

216
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,166
I will always be a soldier of Shili Tai.

217
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,560
   

218
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,605
Song Yan,

219
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,079
when it comes to work, I'm not worried about you at all.

220
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,962
You always know what you are doing.

221
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,266
But when it comes to your personal life,

222
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,200
don't keep suppressing yourself.

223
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,470
Do what you truly desire.

224
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,182
Cherish the present.

225
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,642
I'm fine.

226
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,752
Actually, I can't wait for you to leave.

227
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,025
Then I won't have to listen to your nagging anymore.

228
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,854
I know you don't mean that.

229
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,586
So was all that talk about wanting me to stay just lies?

230
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,389
I was just being polite.

231
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,559
Don't take it seriously.

232
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,325
Don't worry.

233
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:43,419
There will be a new guy coming soon. The next guy will be more obedient than you.

234
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:46,385
You should improve your grumpy temperament soon.

235
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:49,201
Don't get into an argument with the new instructor.

236
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,871
Don't worry.

237
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:54,400
I always favor new friends.

238
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,777
What?

239
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,747
Am I supposed to wish you a pleasant cooperation with him?

240
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,541
Someone sounds jealous.

241
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,120
   

242
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,550
   

243
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,434
 Hi, Mr. Firefighter. 

244
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:59,039
 I'm the girl that you saved from jumping off the upper floor of a building. 

245
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,164
 Thank you for saving my life. 

246
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,276
 Before today, 

247
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,960
 I felt that this world was utterly awful. 

248
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,481
 I couldn't find the courage to go on living, 

249
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,073
 but when you selflessly jumped down and grabbed onto me, 

250
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:16,192
 I realized that there is light in this world. 

251
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,246
 There are people who care about me, who will protect me. 

252
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:22,795
 From now on, 

253
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,599
 when I encounter difficulties, I won't resort to extreme measures anymore. 

254
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,838
 I will cherish the second chance at life you've given me. 

255
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,944
 I will live well. 

256
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,059
   

257
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,398
- Hello? 
 - Can you

258
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,762
give me another year?

259
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:33,767
 I promise that I'll definitely go back after a year. 

260
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,839
To you, to my parents.

261
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,559
 Suo Jun, we're done. 

262
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,153
You still love your career more.

263
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,433
You love your job more.

264
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,459
 I don't want to wait for you year after year anymore. 

265
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:54,885
 Don't ever call me again. 

266
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,710
   

267
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,627
Captain Song, long time no see.

268
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,716
What's the matter?

269
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,726
I lodged a complaint against you openly last time.

270
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:01,633
Are you still holding a grudge after all this time?

271
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:05,559
I'm not thinking about you. Don't be so dramatic.

272
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,959
Rise!

273
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,919
Sit!

274
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,937
   

275
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,799
Comrades,

276
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,340
it's not easy to gather all of you frontline commanders here today.

277
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:29,640
Normally, at the scene of firefights and rescues,

278
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,986
people praise each and every one of you as little tigers.

279
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,839
But I believe

280
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,686
being just tigers isn't enough.

281
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:41,327
I need you to become tigers with wings!

282
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:45,079
So, today, I'm going to give you a pair of wings.

283
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,979
What wings?

284
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,736
Theory and technology.

285
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:53,799
Today, I have invited a talented individual from our system,

286
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,177
a high-achieving student from the University of Science and Technology, Jiang Yu.

287
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,986
He will talk to us about technology and theory.

288
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:03,872
Let's give him a round of applause!

289
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,800
Hi, everyone. I'm Jiang Yu.

290
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,406
This guy has got an impressive background.

291
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,940
What you're seeing here is something called a Super Combat Helmet.

292
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,711
It has a built-in computer module and a high-temperature capture camera.

293
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,282
It presents information to firefighters through a specially designed augmented reality screen.

294
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:39,820
This is a video that was released recently.

295
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,657
It's called the Bipedal Robot.

296
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:46,544
It can walk just like a human.

297
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:51,430
It's equipped with a laser radar that can detect dense smoke and flames.

298
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,132
In recent years, there has been

299
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,446
significant investment in technology within the firefighting system.

300
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:57,666
So I believe that in the near future,

301
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,999
it can replace firefighters and enter the fire scene,

302
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,160
reducing our casualties.

303
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:08,186
That's impractical.

304
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,453
What frontline firefighting units need now aren't robots,

305
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,989
but to retain experienced personnel.

306
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,573
I don't think there's a conflict

307
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:21,720
between training experienced people and improving technology.

308
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,899
Advancing technology can help solve problems more quickly and efficiently.

309
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:30,318
Advanced technology is great, and I agree with that.

310
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:33,339
The foreign advanced technologies you mentioned aren't wrong,

311
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,976
but you should also understand the practical situation at the grassroots level.

312
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,612
I know that reform isn't an overnight process,

313
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,882
but as long as it starts, there will be hope.

314
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:47,052
I believe technology can solve many disputes unrelated to technology.

315
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,654
Say in a fire scene,

316
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:53,258
there's a little girl in the room on the left, and her mother is in the room on the right.

317
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,295
Can your technology tell me which one to save?

318
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,996
This depends on the situation at the scene and requires prediction and analysis.

319
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,316
I don't need prediction and analysis.

320
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,769
I'll save both.

321
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,806
As long as I strengthen my training and enhance my personal skills,

322
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:11,078
maybe I can save them both.

323
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:13,433
Improving the technological level is certainly important,

324
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,566
but we can't overlook people's abilities.

325
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:21,022
Machines only follow commands and complete expected tasks,

326
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:25,592
but humans can create miracles.

327
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:27,095
Well said!

328
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,839
Captain Song.

329
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,543
I'd like to add you on WeChat. There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

330
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,346
I'm stationed in Shili Tai Station.

331
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:49,526
If you really want to ask me something, you can find me there.

332
00:25:52,653 --> 00:25:54,253
Captain Song...

333
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:58,319
Here's a piece of advice.

334
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,289
- Steer clear of him. 
 - Why?

335
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:03,829
He's notorious for being argumentative. He's not a guy to mess with.

336
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,865
But I find him interesting.

337
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,334
Good luck.

338
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,209
Come in.

339
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,480
Catching you is like catching a monkey most of the time.

340
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,426
Everyone has already left, why are you still here?

341
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,095
Division Chief Gao, I'd like to talk to you about Suo Jun.

342
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,328
What about him?

343
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,365
It's about his transfer application.

344
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:40,335
Just approve it.

345
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:43,003
You don't have to worry about me.

346
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,670
I have no objections here.

347
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,757
Look, why do we work so hard?

348
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:50,744
Isn't it just to ensure the safety of thousands of households?

349
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:54,565
You see, we firefighters have to protect our own families too.

350
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:58,519
Suo Jun's fiancée and parents

351
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,018
are relying on him.

352
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,698
About this application, don't let it get stuck here.

353
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:04,689
Just approve it.

354
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,937
What transfer application are you talking about?

355
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:08,999
Suo Jun's application.

356
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,573
- Didn't he give it to you? 
 - He never gave it to me at all.

357
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,240
Please stop taking photos.

358
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,459
Hurry up, please stand back. Stand back.

359
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,319
It's so dangerous!

360
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,780
The firefighters rescued another one!

361
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,399
Doctor!

362
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,160
 Requesting backup! 

363
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,279
 Requesting backup! 

364
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,100
Instructor... The instructor is still inside!

365
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,582
Doctor!

366
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:51,482
Doctor!

367
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,279
Instructor!

368
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,259
Instructor!

369
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,200
- Thanks. 
 - Drive slowly.

370
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,750
   

371
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:55,307
Don't worry. He has been saved.

372
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,129
But...

373
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,698
But... his arm can't be used anymore.

374
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:17,302
You're awake.

375
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:22,312
Why are you wearing a sad face?

376
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,480
Did Division Chief Gao scold you again?

377
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,000
Are you worried about me?

378
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:47,731
I'm fine,

379
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:50,753
really.

380
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:56,286
I didn't break any arms or legs.

381
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,686
I'll recuperate and recover.

382
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,459
You'll be fine.

383
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,579
Stop making a sad face.

384
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,258
Smile a little.

385
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:22,527
I'll go get you the doctor.

386
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,213
 You know, 

387
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:08,440
 after I transfer, that position pays an extra ¥1,200. 

388
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,299
 - I can... 
 - So it's for money? 

389
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,612
 Do you still remember the vow we made when we formed our team? 

390
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:16,480
 You forgot all of it, 

391
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,820
 abandoning your responsibilities and duties. 

392
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:24,119
 Right now, you're a deserter! 

393
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,211
 We made a vow before. 

394
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,971
 Do you remember? 

395
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,159
 That we would turn Shili Tai Fire Station into the best fire station in the nation. 

396
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,424
 What transfer application are you talking about? 

397
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,924
 He never gave it to me at all. 

398
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:14,615
   

399
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,715
   

400
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,272
The patient is in a state of mild coma, showing signs of awakening.

401
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:44,226
Please observe closely.

402
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,298
This is Chen Min?

403
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:08,199
Look, Chen Min was so beautiful before the accident.

404
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,537
She was really beautiful.

405
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:13,712
What is she going to do after this?

406
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:15,540
Who knows?

407
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,544
She's so severely injured.

408
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:19,811
The burn area covers 16% of her body.

409
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,679
All her fingers are stuck together.

410
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,820
She'll need another surgery.

411
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:27,260
She was such a beautiful girl.

412
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,392
It's such a pity.

413
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,437
Did we get the girl out?

414
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:06,420
Yes.

415
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,120
That's good then.

416
00:38:08,612 --> 00:38:10,412
That's good.

417
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,875
I went to the detachment.

418
00:38:19,112 --> 00:38:21,418
You didn't submit the application.

419
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:25,207
It's all my fault.

420
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,820
How is this your fault?

421
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,539
It was my own decision.

422
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,690
I was thinking

423
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,880
I could stay with you for another year.

424
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:51,752
But now it looks like...

425
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,916
I have no other choice.

426
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,606
It's all my fault.

427
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:01,806
I shouldn't have gone to the meeting.

428
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,609
I should have gone on the mission myself. I shouldn't have let you go.

429
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,873
And this wouldn't have happened to you.

430
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:08,373
It's all my fault.

431
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,093
Song Yan.

432
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:16,550
Song Yan, it has nothing to do with you.

433
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,459
It was my own decision.

434
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:26,572
Actually...

435
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,770
I had a selfish reason.

436
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,326
I was thinking that when I had children,

437
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,989
I could tell them proudly

438
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,480
that I was the instructor of the best fire station,

439
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,700
and I led the best firefighters.

440
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,810
Salute!

441
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:03,073
Down!

442
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:04,873
Present the flag!

443
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:10,486
Forward march!

444
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,705
Halt!

445
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:25,045
Mark!

446
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,854
Halt!

447
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:38,932
I hereby announce

448
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:43,334
that Suo Jun, the instructor of Shili Tai Fire and Rescue Station,

449
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:49,376
will proudly retire from the national comprehensive fire and rescue team

450
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:52,746
and transfer to the local housing and construction department.

451
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:57,915
Thank you for your eight years of dedication to the construction of our fire brigade,

452
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,587
safeguarding the lives and property of the people in Yanbei,

453
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:04,873
and contributing actively to the fire safety in our jurisdiction.

454
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:06,924
Today,

455
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,030
even though you are leaving this team,

456
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,833
this will always be your home!

457
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:17,560
I hope you will visit often in the future.

458
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,453
May you always stay true to your original aspiration

459
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:24,679
and never forget your mission on your future path.

460
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,447
- Suo Jun! 
 - Yes, Ma'am!

461
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,839
- Step forward! 
 - Yes, ma'am!
