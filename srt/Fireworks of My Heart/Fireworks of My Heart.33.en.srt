I've sent my men in.

577
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,320
What exactly happened?

578
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,150
The foreman said eight workers are trapped.

579
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,820
The specific location

580
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,950
is from the 8th floor to the 12th floor.

581
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,380
I'll take my men to be in charge of the 8th floor to the 10th floor.

582
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,720
You and your men

583
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,000
be in charge of the 11th floor and the 12th floor.

584
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,720

589
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:37,890
Copy that.

590
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,450

591
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,880

592
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,390

Discard the hoses.

598
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,150

608
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,390
I'm fine.

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,500
Is anyone inside?

614
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,760
There's someone inside.

615
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,270

616
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,370
Over there?

617
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,760

650
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,700
Go up and look for him.

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,560

Go to the hospital with him.

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,640
the fire scene

709
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,940

So far,

713
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,160
the fire has caused minor injuries to eight people

714
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,090
and serious injuries to five people,

715
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,480
including one firefighter.

716
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,360

718
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,660
The fire is still burning.

719
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
I hope the firemen

720
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,420
can ensure their own safety

721
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,560

00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,010
You mean the firefighter who was sent here just now?

725
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,710

732
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,280
Dr. Yang Sijia.

733
