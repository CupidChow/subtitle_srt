00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,860
I have a lot of work to do in the company.

390
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,520
I have to go.

391
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,230
When are you going back?

392
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,370
I don't know.

393
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:46,980
The wounded

394
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,750
have been taken to the medical station here one after another during this period.

395
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,880
Don't work too hard.

396
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,900
Okay.

397
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,100
I'll get back to work.

398
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,020
If you want to turn around and go back to see Qin,

399
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,190
I'm fine with it.

400
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,190
She's busy.

401
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,670
Let's go back.

402
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,400
Look at you.

403
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,340
You traveled dozens of kilometers

404
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,460
to see her.

405
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,980
And now you're leaving.

406
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,300
Why are you

407
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,020
so awkward?

408
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,510
Can't you just follow your heart?

409
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,570
Fine.

410
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,860
I'll shut up.

411
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,570
Thank you, Sister Nan.

412
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,850
Thank you.

413
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,560
Dr. Xu.

414
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,070
Your brother is so handsome.

415
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,100
Is he married?

416
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,330
No.

417
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,200
Does he have a girlfriend?

418
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,320
No.

419
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,800
He's very handsome, yet he's still single.

420
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,240
That's absurd.

421
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
What kind of girl does he like?

422
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,400
Chen Dongdong.

423
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,330
Aren't you making up

424
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,530
with your boyfriend?

425
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,490
No.

426
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,280
I...

427
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
I'm just concerned about

428
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,360
Dr. Xu's brother.

429
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,850
Share these

430
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,860
with everyone.

431
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,200
Dr. Xu, keep them for yourself.

432
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,330
They're expensive.

433
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,620
I just need this.

434
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,870
Okay.

435
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,360
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

436
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,440
You've also come to see me.

437
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,460
Why are you all standing there?

438
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,240
Paying your last respects?

439
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,080
Sorry.

440
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,650
We were wrong.

441
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,350
The headquarters has given us

442
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,540
a half-day break.

443
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,990
If I hadn't stopped them,

444
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,050
they'd all be here.

445
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,020
That's right.

446
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,120
Yan.

447
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,090
You know what?

448
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,830
After the surgery,

449
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,390
you look more handsome.

450
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,470
Get lost.

451
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,920
It's true. Ask Junping if you don't believe me.

452
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,800
He never lies.

453
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,660
You look great.

454
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,460
They said you're a handsome boy.

455
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,640
Keep your voice down.

456
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,560
There're other patients.

457
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
By the way, Chief,

458
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,820
the baby

459
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,620
we saved the other day is famous.

460
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,910
Dr. Xu is famous too.

461
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,520
You've found the baby's father?

462
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,170
His father is a soldier.

463
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,360
He was on a mission

464
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,040
when the earthquake struck.

465
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,650
Look.

466
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,310
There's a video here.

467
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,100
Come on.

468
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,230
Raise it up here.

469
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,720
Slowly.

470
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,600
Be careful.

471
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,190
I'm sorry.

472
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,580
It's a silver lining that

473
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,100
the baby was saved.

474
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,070
Thank you for your hard work.

475
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,940
I didn't expect

476
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,890
you've become gentle after the surgery.

477
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,550
By the way,

478
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,790
when you got hurt,

479
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,980
Dr. Xu went down too.

480
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,000
She went down?

481
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,690
Why?

482
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,630
To accompany you.

483
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,570
But

484
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,430
she went to save others

485
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,500
before you got into the ambulance.

486
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,060
Chief.

487
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,110
It seems that Dr. Xu

488
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,660
doesn't really love you.

489
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,390
Pipi.

490
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,680
Do you know what true love is?

491
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,880
If Dr. Xu stays,

492
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,150
he won't like her.

493
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,090
But Chief, let me tell you.

494
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,820
Although Dr. Xu

495
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,930
didn't accompany you all the way,

496
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,130
she shed

497
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,010
more tears

498
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,820
than all of us.

499
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,110
She cried?

500
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,180
She kept crying.

501
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,000
Really.

502
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,790
I could see her tears.

503
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,490
Yes, Chief.

504
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,180
I can see that

505
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,510
she likes you very much.

506
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,250
A doctor and a firefighter.

507
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,380
A perfect match.

508
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,130
Nurses and firefighters are also good together.

509
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,310
You know what to do.

510
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,980
All right.

511
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,980
It's almost time.

512
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,450
Otherwise, the nurses will kick us out.

513
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,860
Junping, Yang Chi and I

514
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,290
will be standing by.

515
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,380
If he tries to get up,

516
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,580
you'll hold him down.

517
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,880
Don't let him get up.

518
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,020
Be careful.

519
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,660
He's usually so strict.

520
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,990
You can even beat him up.

521
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,610
Are you hungry?

522
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,620
Put me down.

523
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,310
Let me lie down.

524
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,220
Dr. Xu

525
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,640
really cares about you.

526
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,490
She shed tears...

527
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,230
Enough.

528
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,520
Stop bothering me.

529
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,760
Go away.

530
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,440
Alright.

531
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,270
Let Chief rest early.

532
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,100
Let’s go out.

533
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,680
OK.

534
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,230
I’m leaving, Chief.

535
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,490
Shall we hold him down?

536
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,370
We'll be watching nearby.

537
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,540
Meng.

538
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,030
You don't stay with Chief.

539
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,990
You even walk faster than anyone else.

540
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,320
Chief, have a good rest.

541
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,200
Sister Nan.

542
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,320
Your phone.

543
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,010
Okay.

544
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,070
It took some data.

545
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,219
I'll treat you to dinner when I get back.

546
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,820
It's fine. Don't mention it.

547
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,179
I'll leave you to it.

548
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,920
Okay.

549
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,090
Wait.

550
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,630
This is for you.

551
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,320
You've lost weight.

552
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,449
You haven't been resting well lately?

553
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,280
You care about me?

554
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,909
I don't want you to trouble me.

555
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,260
Just go.

556
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,320
Thank you, Sister Nan.

557
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,060
Take care.

558
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,480
Okay.

559
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,600
Bye.

560
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,620
Why are you here?

561
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,150
You don't welcome me?

562
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,150
I'm leaving then.

563
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,880
No. Wait.

564
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,440
Come sit down.

565
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

566
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,260
-Don't move.
-It's OK.

567
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,940
Be careful.

568
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,210
Are you tired?

569
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,920
No.

570
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,280
OK?

571
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,880
This is the last bottle today.

572
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,830
The director said

573
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,500
after you finish,

574
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,660
you can come down and walk around.

575
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,330
But don't exceed

576
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,340
half an hour each time.

577
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:43,980
Thank you.

578
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,530
Let me tell you one more thing.

579
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,150
There's a reason

580
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,560
why everyone made fun of

581
