[Episode 32]

4
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,130
Let's go home.

5
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,660
Are you hungry?

6
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,500
Do you want to eat something?

7
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,660
Has Aunt made supper for us?

8
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,820
We won't eat with them.

9
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,570
It's just you and me.

10
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,980
I want more.

11
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,860
What?

12
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,850
You need more beer to lubricate your tongue?

13
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,530
I just want to drink.

14
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,850
You'll get me home anyway.

15
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,570
Don't drink like this with anyone else.

16
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,700
Okay.

17
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,970
I'll only drink with you.

18
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,540
You like your job very much.

19
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,180
Is it because it's noble?

20
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,600
To be honest,

21
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,670
I just want

22
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,980
to save people.

23
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,060
I never thought about being noble

24
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,130
and making sacrifices.

25
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,740
That's not the case.

26
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,740
Sometimes I feel tired.

27
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,900
But it's my job.

28
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,780
I got to be worth my salt.

29
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,750
I have duties

30
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,140
and will fulfill them.

31
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,900
Here.

32
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,460
When I got off work the other day,

33
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,380
Uncle and Aunt came to pick me up.

34
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,329
Do you know it?

35
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,870
Yes.

36
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
But you definitely don't know

37
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,520
that Aunt held my hands.

38
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,010
She said

39
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,750
my hands were cold

40
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,600
and she'd warm them for me.

41
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,159
Your family

42
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,659
treats me very well.

43
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,580
Song Yan.

44
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,460
I said this to you before.

45
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,580
I said it was nice to live with your family.

46
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,860
Do you remember?

47
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,440
I was too young back then

48
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,620
and just said what I felt.

49
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,620
Now I'm a grown woman.

50
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,090
I still think

51
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,140
it's good to live with your family.

52
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,940
Uncle.

53
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,690
Aunt.

54
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,690
Zhai Miao.

55
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,010
They're all nice people.

56
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,110
I like them all.

57
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,980
I mean it.

58
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,510
I like them

59
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,990
very much.

60
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,740
I like them.

61
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,700
They're nice to me

62
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,420
because of you.

63
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,230
If one day

64
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,660
you're gone,

65
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
they will

66
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,580
have nothing to do

67
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,820
with me.

68
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,730
I'll be alone again.

69
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,420
Do you understand?

70
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,030
Xu Qin.

71
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,190
Hear me out.

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,760
If I don't say it now,

73
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,980
I won't say it anymore.

74
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,090
I've made up my mind.

75
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,970
If one day

76
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,120
something happens to you,

77
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,909
I'll…

78
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,260
Call me melodramatic.

79
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,330
Call me weak.

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,360
You can take it

81
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,770
as a threat.

82
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,570
Be angry if you want.

83
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,250
You know what?

84
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,340
That day,

85
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,430
when I tried to save you

86
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,840
in the emergency room,

87
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,990
it hurt so much.

88
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,550
I couldn't stand it

89
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,460
and will never get over it.

90
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,900
Xu Qin.

91
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,540
I may

92
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,970
get transferred.

93
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,560
I may be transferred to another position.

94
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,700
I don't know when,

95
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,140
so I didn't mention it to you.

96
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,240
Since last year,

97
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,500
I've been trying

98
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
to make adjustments and changes.

99
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,059
Firstly,

100
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,970
after years of work, I've found that

101
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,740
the chance of getting injured

102
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,640
can be reduced by professional training.

103
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,190
Most rescue casualties

104
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,660
can be avoided.

105
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,560
Improvements in the training system

106
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,150
and rescue concepts

107
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,370
and methods

108
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,020
need to be done by someone

109
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,620
with first-hand work experience.

110
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,770
Secondly,

111
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,550
it's because of you.

112
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:52,060
[Zhai's]

113
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,660
Aunt.

114
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,860
What happened?

115
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,180
She's fine.

116
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,600
We had a drink

117
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,430
and she got drunk.

118
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,640
She'll be fine after some rest.

119
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,740
Are you sure she's fine?

120
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,700
Yes.

121
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,850
Be careful.

122
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,770
Good night.

123
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,830
You woke up.

124
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,950
I wasn't drunk.

125
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,990
You said

126
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,810
it's because of me?

127
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,900
Xu Qin.

128
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
I've thought about

129
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,950
our future.

130
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,480
In the future,

131
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,040
we'll have a place of our own

132
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,070
and buy a new car.

133
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,610
I'll work 9:00 to 5:00,

134
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,210
have breakfast with you in the morning,

135
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,070
drive you to work,

136
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,630
and pick you up from work.

137
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,550
We'll cook together,

138
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,110
watch movies,

139
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,070
go shopping,

140
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,390
plant flowers,

141
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,390
and have pets.

142
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,590
On weekends, we'll visit cities nearby.

143
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,030
During vacation,

144
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,580
we'll travel to faraway places.

145
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,630
If we feel tired

146
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,420
and don't want to go anywhere,

147
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,990
we'll stay at home

148
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,630
and enjoy the sunshine on the bed.

149
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,790
We won't go anywhere.

150
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,150
Just the two of us.

151
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,510
Do you want a future with me?

152
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Yes.

153
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,110
Yes.

154
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,190
Yes.

155
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,940
Yes.

156
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,150
The snow is so heavy.

157
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,320
You said

158
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,830
Qin got drunk last night.

159
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,310
Did they have a quarrel?

160
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,470
No.

161
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,130
I peeped into their window just now.

162
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,090
They're not up yet.

163
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,150
They're not up?

164
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,430
No.

165
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,150
They're very much in love.

166
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,100
I think

167
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,970
they quarreled before

168
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,550
because

169
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,690
they missed each other too badly

170
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,720
after being separated for so long.

171
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,710
They've decided to get married.

172
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,570
That's good.

173
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,270
It's time for them to start a family.

174
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,150
I can't wait to have a grandchild.

175
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,140
This cabinet looks great.

176
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,030
Of course.

177
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,940
Your husband is such a great carpenter

178
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
that the furniture I make

179
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,310
sells much better than those in furniture stores.

180
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,290
Of course.

181
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,550
The Zhai family

182
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,980
has been doing carpentry for so many years.

183
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,690
I think Qin will definitely like

184
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,380
your cabinet.

185
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,420
You bet.

186
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,330
Yan'er

187
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,350
This time,

188
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,350
all the things

189
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,510
this time.

190
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,190
Song Yan, it's snowing!

191
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,730
They're up.

192
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,940
So beautiful.

193
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,560
This is not heavy snow.

194
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,940
In two or three weeks,

195
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,200
the snow will be thicker.

196
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,600
By then,

197
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,360
I'll make a snowman for you.

198
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,960
Song Yan.

199
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,150
I saw you bending over.

200
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,070
I didn't need to face you

201
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,370
to know what you were up to.

202
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,670
Let me put out the fire for you.

203
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,120
It's so cold!

204
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,870
See?

205
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
They're good.

206
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,420
They're very happy.

207
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,089
All right, let's go back.

208
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,980
How dare you.

209
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,370
Wait.

210
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,980
Let's get some friends

211
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,140
for the fishes at home.

212
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,300
Hey, girl.

213
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,760
Take a look.

214
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,900
They're all lively.

215
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,180
Look.

216
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,260
This type

217
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,340
has the head of a lion.

218
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,860
This type has the head of a tiger.

219
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,920
We want one of either type.

220
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,330
One of either type?

221
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,200
Sure.

222
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,940
I like the smell of Wufang Street.

223
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,180
What does it smell like?

224
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,220
It smells like you.

225
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,390
What do I smell like?

226
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,380
You smell like the warm moments in life.

227
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,590
Unfortunately,

228
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,540
Wufang Street is about to be demolished.

229
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,700
I don't want to leave here.

230
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,980
Neither do I.

231
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,850
Xu Qin.

232
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,460
It's time for us

233
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,420
to have a place of our own.

234
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,400
What do you think

235
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,420
when we have

236
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,460
our own house,

237
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,700
will be like?

238
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,360
I prefer old-fashioned buildings.

239
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,460
It doesn't need to be big but has to be cozy.

240
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,000
It should be close

241
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,750
to your workplace.

242
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,220
A house like

243
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,900
your uncle's

244
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,770
can only be found

245
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,660
on Yanhuo Street now, right?

246
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,180
That district

247
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,570
has been made a protected area for its long history.

248
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,780
We can't afford a house there.

249
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,940
We can't.

250
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,280
So let's find a condo.

251
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,470
I'm going to get a raise.

252
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,650
If this street is to be demolished very soon,

253
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,280
we can

254
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,400
rent a place first.

255
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,830
Don't worry.

256
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,100
Hold on tight, baby.

257
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,980
We're going home.

258
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,070
Look at its mouth.

259
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,340
It looks like your mouth.

260
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,540
Dad.

261
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,020
Put more eggs in the stuffing.

262
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,100
No problem.

263
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,420
Go help your sister-in-law.

264
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,980
Sister-in-law.

265
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,900
Can I help you with anything?

266
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,780
No.

267
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,060
Only one is left.

268
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,140
Zhai Miao.

269
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,100
What's it?

270
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's paste up the portraits of the Door Gods.

271
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,460
So early?

272
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,100
Didn't my brother say

273
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,140
he'd do it after coming back?

274
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,140
You count on your brother to do it?

275
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,290
It's been over a decade

276
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,090
since the last time he was home

277
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,800
for the New Year's Eve dinner.

278
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,540
So forget about him.

279
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,440
But my sister-in-law is here.

280
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,180
He'll come back for her.

281
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,590
Yes, I'm here this year.

282
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,220
I'll do it.

283
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,100
Okay. Here you are.

284
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,510
You take this one, Miaomiao.

285
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,460
OK.

286
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,180
Paste them on the door.

287
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,740
Okay.

288
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:47,900
Here.

289
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,330
Done.

290
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,740
Good.

291
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,300
Let's go.

292
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,380
The stuffing is ready.

293
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,620
Come in to make dumplings.

294
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,010
Okay.

295
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,900
Let's make dumplings!

296
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,660
Coming.

297
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,700
Come on.

298
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,230
[Happiness]

299
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,720
[Happiness]

300
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,900
[Well-disciplined]

301
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
There are definitely great dishes today.

302
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,900
Dapeng.

303
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,460
Happy Chinese New Year.

304
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,380
Happy Chinese New Year.

305
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,900
Happy Chinese New Year.

306
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,140
Let's eat dumplings.

307
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,820
Dumplings!

308
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,460
Hurry.

309
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,420
Chi.

310
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,420
I'm not used to

311
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,740
eating in the combat suit.

312
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,460
Let me tell you.

313
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,220
We'll be in the field early tonight.

314
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,740
The sooner we finish eating, the sooner we set off.

315
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,370
Understand?

316
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,350
Besides, having the New Year's Eve dinner

317
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,140
in the combat suit

318
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,380
is how we firefighters

319
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,180
celebrate this special night.

320
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,500
For the people,

321
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,620
the Chinese New Year is a festival,

322
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,820
but for firefighters,

323
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,220
it's a challenge.

324
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,380
Okay. Let's eat dumplings.

325
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,860
Okay.

326
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,130
Here.

327
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,500
Here.

328
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,300
You know what?

329
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,180
I wish

330
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,290
that Yi were here with us.

331
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,130
Forget about him.

332
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,900
He's eating dumplings too.

333
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,700
Just eat.

334
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,160
How's it?

335
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,060
Great.

336
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,180
Stand up.

337
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,860
Supervisor, Chief.

338
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,660
Supervisor, Chief.

339
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,140
Happy Chinese New Year!

340
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,820
Happy Chinese New Year!

341
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,100
Supervisor, you're so nice.

342
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,340
You even prepared red packets for us.

343
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,540
You're so observant.

344
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,740
Red packets. Red packets.

345
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,980
Wait.

346
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,460
It's Chinese New Year's Eve.

347
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,500
Let's invite Chief Song to give us a speech.

348
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,980
OK.

349
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,740
Sit.

350
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,700
This year,

351
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,620
we all did a great job

352
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,860
and kept the honor of our station.

353
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,560
As the Chief,

354
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,650
I saw the growth of new recruits

355
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,900
and the persistence of experienced firefighters.

356
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,580
I'm very glad.

357
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,620
Tonight is Chinese New Year's Eve.

358
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,660
Whether you'll be in the field

359
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,100
or stay on call,

360
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,740
buck up

361
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,460
and man your stations!

362
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,900
Yes!

363
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,900
You've been working very hard, boys.

364
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,940

Happy New Year!

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,060
Red packets. Red packets.

367
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,660
It's time to put you to the test.

368
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,620
Do you want the red packets?

369
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,940
Yes!

370
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,540
OK.

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,780
Every one of you

372
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
has to recite a poem about the spring.

373
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,810
I knew it wouldn't be easy

374
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,500
to get the Supervisor's red packets.

375
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,300
Yeah.

376
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,660
I'll go first.

377
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,220
This morning of spring in bed I'm lying.

378
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,700
Not wake up till I hear birds crying.

379
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,340
As spring cannot be kept in a house yard,

380
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,740
a red apricot bloom creeps over the wall.

381
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,090
Next spring when the grass turns green,

382
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,380
friend, will you be back here?

383
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,660
I don't know where she's gone,

384
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,380
but the peach blooms are smiling still in the spring breeze.

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,220
Don't burn yourself.

582
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,820
It's hot.

583
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,900
So delicious.

584
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,420
Slow down.

585
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,580
I missed this taste.

586
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,460
Have one.

587
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,260
Don't just look at me.

588
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,700
I've eaten a lot.

589
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,420
Just one bite.

590
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:22,820
One bite.

591
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,660
One bite.

592
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,940
Bite it. Good.

593
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,740
Kowtow to your grandparents.

594
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,020
Great.

595
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,740
Happy New Year, Grandpa and Grandma.

596
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,700
Wish you good health and good luck.

597
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,540
Great.

598
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,700
Come on.

599
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,300
[Happiness]

600
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,699
Why are you sleeping here?

601
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,900
I stayed up late,

602
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,540
waiting for you to come back.

603
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:52,110
[Happiness]

604
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,020
You're off duty?

605
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,699
Go get some sleep.

606
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,889
I'm fine.

607
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,860
You must miss your home.

608
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,660
The Spring Festival is a big event.

609
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,020
You should go home and see your parents.

610
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,180
Don't be afraid.

611
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,850
I'll go with you.

612
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,520
You know my mom's temper.

613
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,410
It's okay.

614
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,820
I just want to send you there

615
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,940
and take you back.

616
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,500
I don't want you

617
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,540
to go there alone.

618
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,340
I'll wait for you outside.

619
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,220
It's so cold.

620
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,100
Don't worry.

621
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,970
I'll find a warm place.

622
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,100
I'll be fine.

623
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,190
Happy New Year.

624
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,100
Okay, thank you.

625
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,210
I'll go to the museum across the street.

626
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,610
Call me when you're done.

627
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,460
I'll go in.

628
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,810
Wait for me.

629
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,500
Cheer up.

630
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,220
Dad, Mom.

631
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,620
Qin, you're back.

632
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,930
Meng.

633
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,290
Have you done

634
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,180
what I asked you to do?

635
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,120
What's it?

636
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,380
You never listen to me.

637
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,780
What are you doing here?

638
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
When did you come back?

639
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,070
Just now.

640
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,250
Xiao Yixiao asked me to play tennis with him.

641
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,180
Let's go.

642
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,320
Yanchen.

643
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,980
Dinner will soon be served.

644
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,410
We'll be back in a moment.

645
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,500
Let's go.

646
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,220
Dad, Mom, I'm going out.

647
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,780
Okay.

648
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,270
Is his family nice to you?

649
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,140
Yes.

650
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,170
Did they mess with you?

651
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,710
If he

652
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,030
or anyone messes with you,

653
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,020
tell me.

654
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,940
If you don't want to tell me,

655
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,250
tell Yixiao.

656
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,980
Got it?

657
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,660
Yes.

658
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,380
Nice shot!

659
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,290
[Fire Hydrant]

660
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,580
I'll take a water break.

661
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:38,970
Come on.

662
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,820
Thank you.

663
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,140
Is that guy nice to you?

664
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Are you going to

665
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,060
ask all the questions my brother just asked?

666
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,260
Does he care about you

667
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,820
and treats you well?

668
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,020
Of course.

669
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,140
Your happiness is the most important.

670
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,900
I always knew

671
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,330
that sooner or later,

672
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,100
you and that guy

673
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,900
would be together.

674
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,980
That is hindsight.

675
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,940
I told him

676
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,660
but he didn't believe me.

677
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,060
Xiao Yixiao, stop talking.

678
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,900
Let's play tennis.

679
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,110
Coming.

680
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,810
Bring it on.

681
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,740
Go.

682
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,420
Nice shot!

683
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,030
[What are you doing?]

684
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,530
[What are you doing?]

685
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,530
[I'm in the museum. Take your time. Have dinner with your parents.]

686
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,330
[What about you?]

687
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,140
[What about you?]

688
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,140
[Don't worry. I'll look around in the museum.]
