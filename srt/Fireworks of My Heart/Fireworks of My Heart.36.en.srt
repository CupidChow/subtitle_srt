What happened to your hand?

387
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,500
I was scratched by the glass.

388
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,640
It's nothing serious.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,800
It's nothing.

390
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,150
Are you really okay?

391
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
Yes.

392
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,780
I can take a few days' leave because of this.

393
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,080
If something happened to me,

394
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,600
I wouldn't be in this state now.

395
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,280
I don't think

396
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
you're in a good state.

397
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
What's wrong?

398
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,240
I have nowhere to go.

399
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,020
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

400
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,380
Come on.

401
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,890
Tell me.

402
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,680
Brother.

403
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,000
Can you drive first?

404
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,030
[Emergency]

405
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,810
Don't go.

406
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,840
What happened?

407
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,920
Tell me.

408
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,370
Let me ask you.

409
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,680
If someone you want to

410
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
spend the rest of your life with

411
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,330
is hiding something from you,

412
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,300
is that okay with you?

413
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,800
About this kind of question,

414
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,280
you should ask the person I'm married to.

415
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
If I get married,

416
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,800
there must be a lot of things

417
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,910
I'll have to hide from her.

418
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,110
If she knows,

419
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,130
we won't be able to get married.

420
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,330
That's going to be a big deal.

421
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
I knew

422
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,260
you'd have nothing serious to say.

423
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,240
I'm telling you the truth,

424
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,680
from the bottom of my heart.

425
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,680
You just said

426
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,340
he's hiding something from you.

427
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,560
What? Did he cheat on you?

428
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,950
No.

429
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,520
What are you talking about?

430
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,920
Right.

431
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,490
He's not like that.

432
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,050
Then why?

433
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,400
He didn't mention anything

434
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
about his past.

435
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,520
He couldn't answer clearly

436
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,080
what I asked him.

437
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,920
In this case,

438
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,780
either there is something

439
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,200
particularly dishonorable

440
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,680
about his past,

441
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,120
or it makes him particularly miserable

442
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
when it is mentioned.

443
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,120
People all have

444
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,240
their own secrets.

445
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,100
Why do you have to know?

446
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,650
It's not that I have to know.

447
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,520
I just think

448
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
his attitude is wrong.

449
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,440
What does he

450
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,400
have to hide from me?

451
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,360
Isn't our relationship

452
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,000
worthy of his honesty with me?

453
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,350
Now that he's like this,

454
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,620
what should we do in the future?

455
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,470
You're actually worried, aren't you?

456
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,080
Why would I be worried?

457
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,980
Because from your perspective,

458
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,870
you gave up a lot of things

459
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,330
and chose to be with him

460
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,340
in spite of

461
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,900
your parents' opposition and obstruction.

462
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,240
But his attitude towards you now

463
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,930
makes you worried.

464
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,330
Coming.

465
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,760
You're back.

466
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,070
Let me introduce you two.

467
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,170
This is my colleague, Yang Sijia.

468
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,900
This is my friend, Xiao Yixiao.

469
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,110
He insisted on sending me back to take a look.

470
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,360
Dr. Yang, we met before.

471
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,580
It's you.

472
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,260
What's wrong?

473
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,290
Xu Qin stays here with me.

474
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,300
Are you worried?

475
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,200
No.

476
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
I feel relieved

477
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,090
knowing that she stays here with you.

478
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,630
I'm not worried.

479
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,520
Well,

480
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,820
you can go back later.

481
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,100
I'll leave you alone.

482
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm tired.

483
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,570
I'll go inside and take a rest.

484
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,920
Have a good rest.

485
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,780
What's wrong? Is she okay?

486
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,760
She's fine.

487
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,520
She's been here with you lately.

488
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,710
Thank you.

489
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,240
Dr. Yang.

490
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,790
Could I have your WeChat?

491
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,340
If anything happens to Xu Qin,

492
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,490
feel free to contact me.

493
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,920
Okay.

494
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll scan your QR code.

495
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,240
Okay.

496
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,480
She's here with me.

497
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,510
Don't worry.

498
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,360
Okay.

499
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
-I'm leaving. -Okay.

501
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,400
[Shilitai, Yanbei Fire and Rescue Team of Yancheng]

502
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,760
Yan.

503
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,770
Do you want to take the day off

504
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,680
to see Dr. Xu?

505
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
Take the day off? It's not necessary.

506
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
It's not serious?

507
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,720
It's serious.

508
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,440
Yan, look at you.

509
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,900
No wonder Dr. Xu is angry.

510
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,560
If it were me, I'd be angry, too.

511
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,780
When a girl is injured,

512
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,310
you know,

513
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,250
she's much in need of

514
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,080
love and care.

515
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,870
But you don't even care as her boyfriend.

516
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
That won't do.

517
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:55,990
What did you say?

518
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,320
She's injured?

519
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,370
Didn't Dr. Xu tell you?

520
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,650
Xi called me and said

521
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,760
she hurt her wrist.

522
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,950
What happened?

523
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,190
Someone went to the emergency room in the afternoon

524
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,010
to make trouble.

525
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,570
The man took a knife

526
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,760
and cut her wrist.

527
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,580
She even had surgery.

528
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,880
Send me Xu Xi's phone number.

529
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,160
Okay.

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:39,930

My phone is muted.

533
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,750
How is your hand?

534
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,710
It's broken.

535
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,300
It's fine.

536
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,080
That man's hands were unstable.

537
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,100
It's not deep. It's just a scratch.

538
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,480
I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

539
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,880

Okay.

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,930
I won't touch it.

555
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,490
Does it still hurt?

556
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,130
No. Why are you here?

557
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm here to see my girlfriend.

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,670
Look.

559
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,940
I bought you cake, milk tea

560
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,200
and fried chicken.

561
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,800

to deliver food for me?

Like you said,

573
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm indeed self-righteous.

574
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,740
I've made many decisions

575
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,040
without talking to you.

576
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,160

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,810
to go home.

768
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,520
How about this?

769
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,570
I'll make some soup

770
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
and you send it to her.

771
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,640
Brother, you don't make

772
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,210
Sister-in-law angry, do you?

773
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,570
Don't talk nonsense.

774
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,290
It must be. Tell me.

775
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,280
What did you do?

776
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,550
Let me tell you.

777
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,770
If you make her angry

778
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,680
and she runs away, you'll regret it.

779
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,740
I'm done.

780
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,610
Enjoy your meal.

781
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,310
Did they really have a fight?

782
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,260
It's normal for young people

783
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,360
to have a fight.

784
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,620
Let them solve it themselves.

785
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,620
We won't get involved.

786
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,800
Strange.

787
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,350
Brother treats Sister-in-law

788
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,680
like the apple of his eye.

789
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,540
He must be very careful.

790
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
Just eat.

791
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,210
What's wrong?

792
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,930
Why are you here?

793
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,890
You should have recovered long ago.

794
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,770
Sister-in-law, it wasn't easy for me

795
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,880
to find you.

796
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,270
You didn't answer my calls.

797
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,880
I saw you're on duty today,

798
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,030
so I made an appointment.

799
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,570
You're wasting medical resources.

800
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,590
Sister-in-law, I know I'm wrong.

801
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,830
But just let me say a few words.

802
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,810
Just a few words.

803
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,500
Did your brother ask you to come?

804
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,160
No, I came here on my own.

805
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,270
Did you have a fight?

806
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,850
I'm working now.

807
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,570
Since I'm here,

808
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,750
you should treat me.

809
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,930
What's wrong?

810
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,880
I can't sleep. I have lovesickness.

811
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,860
My brother hasn't slept for two days.

812
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,570
His eyes

813
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,640
have become swollen.

814
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,300
If he really

815
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,190
did something wrong,

816
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,450
please forget about it

817
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,410
and forgive him, okay?

818
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,770
Next patient.

819
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,780
Sister-in-law, don't.

820
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,920
I'll wait for you in the garden.

821
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,920
You must come.

822
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,170
You must come.

823
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,920
Sister-in-law, here.

824
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,160
Zhai Miao.

825
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,400
Sister-in-law.

826
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,030
Come and sit down.

827
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,960
Sister-in-law.

828
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,770
I heard from my parents that

829
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,280
you haven't been home for a long time.

830
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,770
Did my brother make you angry?

831
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,200
You can tell me.

832
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,390
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

833
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,130
It's not that I don't want to talk to him

834
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,150
and become unreasonable.

835
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:56,970
I always feel

836
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,160
he's hiding a lot from me.

837
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,250
He bears everything by himself.

838
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,920
For example,

839
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,000
why did he have a gunshot wound

840
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,840
on his body?

841
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,630
Your whole family know about it,

842
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,740
but he just keeps it from me.

843
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,830
My brother must have his reasons

844
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,930
if he doesn't tell you.

845
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,610
He's doing it for your own good.

846
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,180
Zhai Miao, if it were you,

847
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,800
can you accept this explanation?

848
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,210
It's nothing.

849
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,730
My brother was a soldier in the special forces before

850
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,390
and made some contributions.

851
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,310
Then

852
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,050
why did he go to the fire station?

853
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,260
Did you have a fight with my brother

854
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,560
because of this?

855
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,260
Forget it.

856
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,960
Anyway,

857
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,630
I'm tired.

858
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,570
I'm too tired

859
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,580
to be with him anymore.

860
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,400
Sister-in-law. Is it that serious?

861
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,050
My brother really did nothing wrong.

862
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
You know what?

863
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,990
I think your brother is unreliable.

864
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,210
How could my brother

865
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
be unreliable?

866
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,220
My brother...

867
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,840
My brother

868
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
did a lot of things for you.

869
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,860
He just doesn't want to talk about it.

870
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,880
He really

871
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,850
loves you very much.

872
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,620
You are his sister.

873
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,640
Of course you would say that.

874
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,570
But all I see is that

875
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,020
he doesn't cherish me anymore

876
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,020
after chasing me.

877
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,530
For him,

878
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,110
I almost broke up with my family.

879
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,840
But what did he do?

880
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,450
Forget it.

881
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,810
You don't have to say anything.

882
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,190
I’m leaving.

883
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,160
Sister-in-law.

884
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,800
Sister-in-law.

885
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,110
I'll tell you.

886
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,290
I'll tell you.

887
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,360
I'll tell you.

888
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,360
You broke up

889
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,850
when he retook the college entrance exam.

890
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,210
He studied hard

891
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,950
and exercised,

892
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,920
hoping to be admitted to the military academy.

893
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,080
He thought that being a military officer

894
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,390
would make him good enough

895
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,730
for you.

896
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,340
But for some reason,

897
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,760
he failed

898
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,540
in the physical examination

899
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,750
and was rejected.

900
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,880
My dad suspected that

901
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,040
there was something wrong with the physical examination report,

902
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,220
so he took him to the hospital

903
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,400
to check again,

904
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,590
and it turned out that

905
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,690
all his indicators were qualified.

906
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,480
My dad appealed against the result everywhere,

907
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,140
trying to get my brother

908
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,250
a chance.

909
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,990
Then,

910
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,970
he begged your mother.

911
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,510
What did you say?

912
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,950
My dad said

913
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,210
your mother

914
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,120
bribed the doctor

915
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,170
to play a trick.

916
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,360
My brother didn't get a chance to re-check

917
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,370
until the end of the military academy

918
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,570
recruiting examination.

919
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,170
Sister-in-law, are you alright?

920
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,610
My brother didn't let me tell you

921
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,280
because he didn't want you to feel bad.

922
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,360
And then?

923
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,330
What about his gunshot wound?

924
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,750
He wanted to be a soldier,

925
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,500
because of his strong physical fitness

926
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,370
and hard work,

927
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,350
he was admitted to

928
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,210
the border special forces.

929
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,190
He was injured

930
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,520
when he was

931
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,950
on a mission.

932
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,450
His chance to get a promotion

933
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,030
at the cost of his life

934
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,300
was ruined

935
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,100
because of a tip-off call.

936
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,410
Later, he went to the fire station

937
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,390
from the army.

938
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,210
And you know

939
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,920
the rest of it.

940
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,480
As for the person

941
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,900
who made the tip-off call,

942
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,480
I'm sure

943
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,620
you should know who it was.

944
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,300
Sister-in-law.

945
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,730
Now you know

946
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,840
why my brother doesn't want to

947
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,900
talk to you about it.

948
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,950
In my brother's most difficult

949
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,970
and desperate time,

950
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,210
the belief that supported him to live

951
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,570
is you.

952
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,370
Dr. Xu, are you off work?
