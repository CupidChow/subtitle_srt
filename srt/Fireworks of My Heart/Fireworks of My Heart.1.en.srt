Stop thinking about it.

384
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,860
We can only

385
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,940
do some basic tasks now.

386
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,580
Start working.

387
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:53,900
Let's go.

388
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,260
Disperse.

389
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,380
Please cooperate. Thank you.

390
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,420
I am...

391
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm a doctor.

392
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,580
Follow me.

393
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,030
Pipi, Ge, Dapeng.

394
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,450
Evacuate the crowd. Hurry up!

395
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:02,900
Hurry up!

396
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,780
Chief.

397
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,730
What's the situation inside?

398
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,140
The fire has started

399
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
to spread inside.

400
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,300
Big vehicles can't get in.

401
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,740
I can only use two water guns

402
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
to stop the fire.

403
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,620
Besides,

404
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,020
I sent one person from the rescue team to the building.

405
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,980
Okay.

406
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,620
Li Bin.

407
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,140
Contain the fire.

408
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,060
Let our team rescue people.

409
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,660
No.

410
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,220
This building

411
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,380
is unsafe.

412
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,410
In this situation,

413
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,820
if many team members go in to rescue people,

414
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,780
it'll be too dangerous.

415
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,250
The building which is being burnt

416
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,700
is made of bricks and concrete.

417
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,900
The fire is not under control yet.

418
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,450
Look that place

419
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,460
and there.

420
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,660
These two

421
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,060
are both old wooden buildings.

422
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,460
The humidity is low now.

423
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,020
Once the fire spreads to those buildings,

424
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,940
it will be too late.

425
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,180
By then, the affected area

426
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,700
will be doubled or even larger.

427
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,660
It's quite possible that the fire will be completely out of control.

428
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,370
I agree your team can go in and rescue people.

429
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,900
Okay.

430
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,180
Be careful.

431
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,740
Shilitai, come with me.

432
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,850
The stairs are blocked.

433
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,640
We checked the flat roof.

434
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,270
We can go up.

435
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,560
Climb the wall.

436
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,060
Step back. Step back.

437
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,780
Don't gather here.

438
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,060
Step back a little.

439
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,300
Step back a little.

440
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,460
Calm down. Calm down.

441
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,730
Ask your leader to come here.

442
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,420
Sir. Madam.

443
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
You can't go in.

444
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,100
Madam.

445
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,700
It's really dangerous.

446
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,700
Sir. Madam.

447
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,540
We're doing this

448
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,500
for your safety.

449
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,420
Your current position

450
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,140
is too close to the scene. It's dangerous.

451
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,260
Please understand us.

452
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,900
Thank you. Step back.

453
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,460
Why are you so slow?

454
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,140
We had been waiting for a long time

455
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,220
since we dialed 119.

456
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,860
Sir. Madam.

457
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,780
We came to the scene

458
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,020
as soon as possible.

459
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,970
You came here after a long time.

460
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,940
My house

461
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,540
is burnt badly.

462
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,140
Here's the thing.

463
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
We have strict regulations

464
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
on the speed of action.

465
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,580
If there is a problem,

466
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,100
we have to take responsibility.

467
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Please step back.

468
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,260
Please cooperate.

469
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,860
Please cooperate.

470
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,460
Disperse.

471
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,260
Ge, pull the cordon back.

472
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,740
Please cooperate with the firefighters' work.

473
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,460
Step back.

474
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,460
Step back.

475
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,340
Step back.

476
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,380
Song Yan. Song Yan. Song Yan.

477
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,180
What's the situation inside?

478
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,450
A gas tank exploded.

479
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,540
What?

480
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,580
Are you worried about my life?

481
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,900
Don't worry.

482
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,860
I don't want to

483
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,660
leave you alone.

484
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,740
Can you be serious?

485
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,420
Supervisor Suo.

486
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,300
There are 50 or 60 households inside.

487
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,660
Each family has a gas tank.

488
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,220
Song Yan, lead the team down the stairs immediately.

489
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,620
Song Yan, lead the team down the stairs immediately.

490
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,860
Answer if you received the order.

491
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,860
It's the last floor. We'll leave after searching.

492
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,740
Song Yan.

493
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,770
Listen.

494
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,780
The rooms in this building

495
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,140
are separate.

496
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,380
If each household has a gas tank,

497
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,620
your life will be in danger.

498
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,540
As the commander on the scene,

499
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,090
I order you

500
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,120
to retreat immediately.

501
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,260
Roger that.

502
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,120
I'll retreat now.

503
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,500
Song Yan. Song Yan.

504
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,700
What's the situation inside?

505
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,770
Use water guns.

506
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,450
Third floor.

507
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,010
I found a trapped person.

508
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,100
Jiang Yi. Jiang Yi.

509
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,140
Go to the third floor to help Song Yan.

510
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,860
Roger that.

511
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,350
Pliers.

512
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,130
Go to the doctor.

513
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,220
Song Yan. Song Yan. Song Yan.

514
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,260
Are you okay?

515
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,380
I've rescued the trapped person.

516
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,380
Be careful.

517
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,940
Have you finished searching up there?

518
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,460
Two rooms in the west of the building haven't been searched yet.

519
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,180
I'll go.

520
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,780
Hurry up!

521
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,340
Okay.

522
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,460
Doctor.

523
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,860
Doctor.

524
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,100
Doctor.

525
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,060
How is she?

526
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,370
She was stifled.

527
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,340
Song Yan.

528
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,430
Retreat!

529
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,740
Retreat!

530
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,140
Mom.

531
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,790
Don't be afraid.

532
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,980
I'll take you out.

533
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,740
Song Yan. Song Yan.

534
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
What's the situation inside?

535
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,500
Song Yan. Song Yan.

536
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,380
Answer me.

537
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,260
Song Yan.

538
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,200
Were you injured?

539
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,420
Song Yan.

540
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,890
I was wrong.

541
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,420
I'm sorry for making you worry.

542
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,500
I'll be careful next time.

543
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,250
I'll be careful.

544
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,790
You disobeyed my order

545
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,150
and violated the rescue discipline.

546
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,630
Don't imitate him.

547
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,220
We dare to go over the cliff

548
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,450
and go into the fire.

549
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,440
But the premise is that we need to protect ourselves.

550
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:43,980
Understood?

551
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,950
Understood.

552
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,620
Understood.

553
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,650
Yang Chi.

554
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,220
I'm here.

555
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,410
Jiang Yi.

556
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:52,900
I'm here.

557
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,030
Liu Junping.

558
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,570
I'm here.

559
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,420
Tong Ming.

560
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,880
I'm here.

561
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,710
Gao Yu.

562
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,180
I'm here.

563
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,940
Supervisor.

564
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,100
Everyone is here.

565
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,020
Who overturned my car?

566
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,489
I did it.

567
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,170
Your car was parked illegally

568
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,199
and blocked the fire exit.

569
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,219
It's my new car.

570
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,320
How could you overturn it?

571
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,320
Why did you hit him?

572
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,630
I'm their supervisor.

573
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,199
You can talk to me.

574
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,110
According to relevant regulations,

575
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,719
we cleared the fire exit.

You overturned it without my permission.

580
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,420
Because your car

581
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,659

583
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,949

If I were you,

587
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,090
I would hide away.

588
