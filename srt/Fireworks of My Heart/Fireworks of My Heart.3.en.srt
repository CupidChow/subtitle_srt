You've seen her.

177

He's a nice guy.

196

He's reliable.

197
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,220
Much better

198
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,170

199
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,610
What?

200
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm not allowed to ask.

201
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,700
And now I can't even talk?

202
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,540
I'm not afraid you'll get angry.

203
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,510
He is not suitable for you,

204
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,500

206

207

244

246

She is new here.

252

I'm sorry.

253

Apologize.

254
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,490
I'm sorry.

255

It's okay.

256

She works part-time.

257
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,620
I'll talk to her later.

258
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,060

I think so.

Have you checked the fire-fighting equipment

282
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,060

283
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,700
Yes.
