2
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,004
   

3
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,239
   

4
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,040
   

5
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:00,206
Captain, there's one more floor upstairs.

6
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,641
Let's go up!

7
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,692
Okay.

8
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,507
Da Peng!

9
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,442
Don’t rush!

10
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:19,541
Follow my lead!

11
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,172
Yes, Brother Yi.

12
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,802
Are you okay?

13
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:39,241
Over there!

14
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,487
Yes, Sir!

15
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,322
Instructor, we found someone!

16
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,861
You go first!

17
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,681
 Instructor, I'm coming out now. 

18
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,227
Mind your own safety!

19
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,042
Firefighter,

20
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,402
I had no idea that someone was still inside.

21
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:51,707
This place was marked as a demolition zone long ago.

22
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:54,002
No one was supposed to be inside.

23
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:57,402
Even so, there might be homeless people or scavengers inside.

24
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:00,077
It’s you guys who didn't check carefully.

25
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:36,514
Instructor, they've been inside for too long.

26
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:39,136
Their oxygen tank will run out of pressure soon.

27
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,441
Song Yan, what's the situation inside?

28
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,458
Please reply to me if you hear this.

29
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:45,881
The building is collapsing!

30
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,921
- Instructor! 
 - Instructor!

31
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,522
The building is collapsing!

32
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,842
Song Yan!

33
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:51,001
The building is collapsing!

34
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,162
The building is collapsing!

35
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:53,642
On-site damage has occurred!

36
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,082
On-site damage has occurred!

37
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:57,482
Evacuate from the scene immediately!

38
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:05,422
Jiang Yi,

39
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,381
 have you found him? 

40
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,881
Not yet, Instructor.

41
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,801
Remember, you must ensure our team members’ safety!

42
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:15,162
Yes, Instructor! Don't worry.

43
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:17,407
- Be careful. 
 - Yes, Sir.

44
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,282
Captain!

45
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:40,881
Our captain is out! Captain!

46
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,846
Instructor, our captain is out!

47
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:08,121
Captain!

48
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,407
Come back!

49
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:12,009
Captain is out!

50
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,987
Hold your hose!

51
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,121
Yes, Sir!

52
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,241
Old Jiang, the captain is out.

53
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,302
 Evacuate immediately. 

54
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,561
We can leave now.

55
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:20,850
Da Peng, tell the instructor.

56
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,881
Yes, Sir.

57
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,642
Put out the fire. Let's evacuate.

58
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,158
Yes, Sir.

59
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:50,642
How is it?

60
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,479
What's the situation?

61
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,001
For how long has she been unconscious?

62
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,642
She was unconscious when I found her.

63
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,001
Did you take any emergency measures?

64
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:12,842
She was injured but I didn’t address it. I only provided her with some oxygen.

65
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:15,462
- Have you contacted her family? 
 - She has no family members.

66
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:26,595
Dr Xu, the old lady who was sent here earlier was pronounced dead.

67
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:30,755
Try your best to save her.

68
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,679
Investigate the area thoroughly for sparks.

69
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,095
Okay.

70
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,702
Good job, you guys.

71
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:57,982
Instructor,

72
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:00,521
I saved your baby for you.

73
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,442
This sucks.

74
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,121
Don't blame it on the item.

75
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,842
It's because I sucked.

76
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,373
I can rest at ease then.

77
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,842
Do a proper job!

78
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:14,162
Okay.

79
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,782
Da Peng,

80
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:27,881
how was it?

81
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,202
It was your first time joining a fire rescue mission.

82
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,876
How do you feel?

83
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,381
The real deal is different indeed.

84
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:37,128
I have to train harder.

85
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,572
What's on your mind?

86
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:43,165
Team Leader,

87
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:44,900
you're so strong.

88
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,849
You picked me up like I was a chick.

89
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,062
Did you remember that then?

90
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,585
I did.

91
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:56,022
I want to take a hot water shower right now.

92
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,361
Forget about the hot water shower.

93
00:08:58,361 --> 00:08:59,961
Just give me somewhere to lie down.

94
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,882
Let me sleep for three days and nights.

95
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:03,201
You must be dreaming!

96
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:06,282
When we head back, we still have physical training to do.

97
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,721
We'll do it.

98
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,481
We'll do our best in the training!

99
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:37,801
How is the victim?

100
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,521
They are in the middle of rescuing her.

101
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:41,141
But the old lady…

102
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,469
You're right.

103
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:06,221
Experience is vital when it comes to the front line of a fire rescue mission.

104
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:08,621
As an instructor, I...

105
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,870
should gain more experience.

106
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,052
Our instructor is striving to improve himself.

107
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,919
I have no objection to it.

108
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,942
What do you hope for the most after every mission?

109
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,361
We have everyone on the roster.

110
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:40,173
You brats did well today.

111
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,642
- Are you guys exhausted? 
  -  No! 

112
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,050
- You guys must be hungry. 
  - Yeah! 

113
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,601
Let's go to a restaurant and fill our stomachs!

114
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,641
 Nice! 

115
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:52,282
Has the quartermaster prepared everything?

116
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,441
He and I have set up everything.

117
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,685
Let's go.

118
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,574
Instructor, join us.

119
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,642
I...

120
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,501
Let me train first.

121
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,182
Just forget about it. Your tool is all burnt up.

122
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:09,102
Get yourself another drone if you have the chance.

123
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:23,662
We suspect she's suffering from closed abdominal visceral injury.

124
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:26,853
She should be transferred to the Department of General Surgery for a laparotomy.

125
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,162
Laparotomy causes huge trauma to both physical and mental state of the body.

126
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:31,721
I suggest a conservative treatment.

127
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:33,542
Let me give her IV drips and observe her condition.

128
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,902
This child was already unconscious when she was sent here.

129
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:38,221
The ultrasound scan shows that she's experiencing abdominal effusion.

130
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:41,522
Conservative treatment might lead to further complications.

131
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:43,042
We performed a paracentesis on her just now.

132
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,346
There was no blood coagulation.

133
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:46,482
The ultrasound scan also shows that it was a mild abdominal effusion.

134
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:47,522
Her splenic capsule is complete.

135
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,811
That means her spleen is functioning normally.

136
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,162
However, according to the ultrasound scan,

137
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,762
there is a subcapsular hematoma in the liver.

138
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,162
It's a sign of a ruptured liver.

139
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:56,601
However, she's experiencing toxic encephalopathy

140
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,441
due to inhaling excess toxic gas.

141
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,642
The subcapsular hematoma in the liver isn't the main issue here.

142
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,242
You're taking a risk here.

143
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,762
Under such circumstances,

144
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:06,362
I think performing a laparotomy is the safest action.

145
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,561
Performing a laparotomy is indeed the safest,

146
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,122
however, the subcapsular hematoma in the liver is very stable.

147
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:14,042
It's very likely that it might be absorbed after conservative treatment.

148
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,700
The fire rescue yesterday was on the news.

149
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,561
Firefighters risked their lives to save this child.

150
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,801
If something happens to her while she's in our hospital,

151
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,642
can you bear the responsibility?

152
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:26,762
Thank you for the reminder.

153
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:27,957
I'm her attending physician.

154
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,090
I will be responsible for her.

155
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,162
All right then.

156
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:32,192
Call me anytime if you need anything.

157
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,565
Okay. Good job.

158
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,981
Dr. Xu, are you sure about this?

159
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:43,042
Didn't you confirm the validity of my statement too?

160
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:47,022
Your career will be ruined if the reporters cover this.

161
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,382
As a doctor,

162
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,681
my diagnosis has nothing to do with the reporters.

163
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:53,241
Are they the professional here? Or am I the professional?

164
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:57,362
Sometimes, I'm pretty envious of you.

165
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:58,845
A person like you with a strong family background

166
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,190
has more resources to hold their ground.

167
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,441
Sorry about that.

168
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:05,326
I'm holding my ground due to my professionalism.

169
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,106
Provide her with the highest level of care.

170
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,948
Okay, Doctor.

171
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:26,002
Here are your fried chickens.

172
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:27,642
- Eat up. 
 - Shop Owner,

173
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,721
can you give them to those brats first?

174
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,162
Okay. You guys share this.

175
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:32,163
 - Thank you. 
 - Thank you, Shop Owner. 

176
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,441
 - Thank you.  
 - Come.

177
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,046
I'll be back soon.

178
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,321
Tear it for me.

179
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:38,682
Look at them.

180
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,721
He fell asleep.

181
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,882
Here you go.

182
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:44,242
- Have them while they're hot. 
 - Thank you, Shop Owner.

183
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:45,946
- Good job, Kids. 
 - Thank you.

184
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:47,193
Thank you, Shop Owner.

185
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,762
Don't mention it.

186
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,242
- This is delicious. 
 - Just use your hands.

187
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:52,661
- Won't you mind? 
 - Mind what?

188
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,229
I'll use my hands then.

189
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,681
Shop Owner, we placed an order earlier on!

190
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,981
Your order is ready.

191
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,081
Thank you.

192
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,321
Don't mention it. See you next time.

193
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,882
What's with all the firefighters?

194
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,074
I don't know.

195
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,002
I have something to report! Da Peng was checking out the hot girls.

196
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:20,081
You already look at them.

197
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:21,801
Just admit it.

198
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,321
Who said I didn't want to admit it?

199
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,762
I-I just want to be a relationship.

200
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,601
Captain and Brother Chi are still here, you know?

201
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,061
Aren't you embarrassed?

202
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,561
I heard nothing.

203
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,081
- I didn't hear anything, either. 
 - Me neither.

204
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,581
If so, I want to be in a relationship, too.

205
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,318
With what?

206
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:39,445
You don't have a car, house, nor time.

207
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,182
And, you're not that handsome. Who wants to date you?

208
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,821
I don't agree with the last point.

209
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,679
Thank you.

210
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,402
The hospital's administration office called us.

211
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,915
They said reporters were outside the hospital. The media wanted to interview us.

212
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,434
Let’s not tell them anything yet.

213
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,882
Dr. Xu, why don't you take a break?

214
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:23,482
You didn't sleep a wink since last night.

215
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:25,823
Got it. I'll be done in a second.

216
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:29,721
Dr. Xu is back. Our superiors told him to come right after he got off the plane.

217
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,425
He wants us to see him.

218
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,510
Let's go.

219
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,561
The victim was injured by heavy objects.

220
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:44,043
Through the ultrasound scan, we can tell it’s hepatic subcapsular rupture and formed a hematoma.

221
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,321
We established intravenous access

222
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,961
and provided her with anti-inflammation fluids

223
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,801
to maintain water and electrolyte balance

224
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,328
to rectify her state of shock.

225
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:00,803
Were you the one who decided not to operate on her?

226
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,196
Yes, Sir.

227
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:05,042
I think there are no obvious symptoms that require surgery.

228
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:09,257
Conservative treatment can reduce unnecessary surgical trauma and complications from anesthesia.

229
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,262
You made

230
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:16,863
the correct decision.

231
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,362
Don't worry.

232
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,296
She'll regain consciousness soon.

233
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:29,642
Keep an eye on her condition. You can transfer her to the

234
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:31,002
observation ward once she regains consciousness.

235
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,181
Okay.

236
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,554
   

237
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:01,953
Hello, Captain.

238
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,270
Captain.

239
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,638
   

240
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,361
What are you doing?

241
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,361
Have you encountered something nice lately?

242
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,621
No.

243
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,342
Something feels off about you.

244
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,242
Speak for yourself.

245
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,522
- Mind your own business. 
 - I'm your instructor.

246
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,442
Your psychological state and emotional changes are my business.

247
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,682
I have to be responsible for them.

248
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,161
If you have too much time,

249
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,137
you can chat with Xiao Meng.

250
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,601
Let's drop that topic.

251
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,281
Let's talk about something else.

252
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,797
You were part of the Special Forces when you were in the Border Defense Forces.

253
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,242
Why did you come to the fire station?

254
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:48,841
I couldn't stand it anymore.

255
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:50,361
Not everyone is like you, you know?

256
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,522
Your father has a strong background.

257
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:53,281
You can do whatever you want.

258
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:57,641
You're good at everything

259
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,332
except for lying.

260
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,715
I read your profile before.

261
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,722
You rendered second-class merit when you were in the Border Defense Forces.

262
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:06,561
You rendered second-class merit as a member of a frontline unit

263
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:08,501
in a peaceful era like ours.

264
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:11,001
That means you must have risked your life.

265
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:25,722
The doctor said

266
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:27,361
the child is safe.

267
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,768
I know that.

268
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:33,801
Did you know this?

269
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:37,579
Her mother ran off with a rich man.

270
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,231
Her father abandoned her.

271
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:42,301
How could parents like them even exist?

272
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,641
 - Zi Hao. 
 - Go away. 

273
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,242
 Slow down. 

274
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,062
 Wait for me. 

275
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,881
 - Don't do that. 
 - Go away. 

276
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,242
 Your face is full of sweat. 

277
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:57,862
 Don't do that! Go away. 

278
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:59,161
 Mind your own business. 

279
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,042
 Let's have some fruits, okay? 

280
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,701
 Give it a try. 

281
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:06,042
 Go away! Mind your own business. 

282
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,802
What's the matter?

283
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,161
You were the one

284
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:23,401
who got me off the boat.

285
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,121
What are you saying?

286
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:27,522
There was a boat.

287
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:31,163
On the boat were people I didn't know.

288
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,321
They were in black clothing.

289
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,522
My grandmother was there, too.

290
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,601
I wanted to cling to my grandmother.

291
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,321
But she kept pushing me away.

292
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,561
She told me to leave with the lady in white.

293
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,881
It was you.

294
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,121
When the boat was departing,

295
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,682
you were the one

296
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,972
who got me off the boat.

297
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:08,282
Dr. Xu prescribed her two more medications.

298
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,161
The netizens dug out her background information.

299
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,202
This child is called Little Tangerine.

300
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:13,682
She was abandoned by her parents when she was young.

301
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:15,081
She was living together

302
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:17,161
with her grandmother, but they weren’t blood-related.

303
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:18,988
During this fire,

304
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:21,342
the old lady sacrificed herself to save this child.

305
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:23,601
The media is searching for her parents.

306
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,482
However, they couldn't find them.

307
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,121
As people who abandoned their child deliberately,

308
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,501
how would they show up again?

309
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,801
Yeah.

310
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,701
Poor child.

311
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,742
She's so young. What should she do in the future?

312
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:36,962
Enough. Stop being sentimental.

313
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,566
Prescribe the medicine and give her the drip.

314
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:51,762
Dr. Xu, sorry to interrupt you.

315
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,682
The public is very concerned about Little Tangerine's condition.

316
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:54,847
Everyone is worried about her.

317
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,582
May we know about her condition?

318
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,862
Little Tangerine has regained consciousness.

319
00:21:57,862 --> 00:21:59,353
She needs to rest and recuperate for two weeks.

320
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,801
Thank you for the concern.

321
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,641
The public has been trying to help her search for her mother.

322
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:04,242
Dr. Xu, as her savior,

323
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:07,042
do you have anything you want to tell her family members?

324
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,796
Can you convince her mother to visit her as soon as possible?

325
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:10,801
Her mother?

326
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,865
Yes. This is one of the hottest topics nowadays.

327
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,443
People are donating money and items to her. They are also searching for her mother.

328
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,772
Her mother abandoned her child in the first place.

329
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,841
What is the point of searching for her mother?

330
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,361
A person like her doesn't deserve to be a mother.

331
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:26,002
Little Tangerine

332
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:28,910
might lead a better life without her.

333
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:53,962
Thank you.

334
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,641
What are you doing here?

335
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,321
The girl was holding this in her arms when I found her.

336
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:01,434
Yang Chi washed it for her.

337
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,081
I'll send it to the ward.

338
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,881
According to the news,

339
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:10,901
you were the one who decided not to perform surgery on her.

340
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:15,341
Weren't you afraid that the child might not wake up?

341
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,002
Were you afraid that you might die in a fire

342
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:20,127
during a fire rescue mission?

343
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,662
Do you want me to be honest?

344
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,601
Of course.

345
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,361
I didn't think of it that much.

346
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:29,698
I just did my best.

347
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:33,002
But actually,

348
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:35,322
I do feel fear after that.

349
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:38,265
Me, too.

350
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:44,562
Dr. Xu, you can do it.

351
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,445
You've become gentler, Captain Song.

352
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,206
It's because you didn't realize it in the past.

353
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,006
Little Tangerine,

354
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:12,582
look at what I've brought.

355
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:22,002
 Are you happy? 

356
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,841
You must be happy, right?

357
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:25,662
Look, its tail fell off.

358
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:27,543
The tail.

359
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,081
 Be careful. 

360
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,282
 I can walk by myself. 

361
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:55,502
 - Go away. 
 - Mind the steps! 

362
00:25:20,522 --> 00:25:22,488
 She doesn't resemble my mother. 

363
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,579
 This isn't her. 

364
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:26,762
 It's not her. 

365
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,901
 Don't be sad. 

366
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:40,382
 Why should I be sad? 

367
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:52,081
 Look. 

368
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:53,782
 I have plenty of money. 

369
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,242
 Why did you bring so much cash with you? 

370
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:57,561
 Do you want some? 

371
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:58,916
 No. 

372
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,561
 My mom said we could buy happiness with money. 

373
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:06,922
 You look unhappy right now. 

374
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,881
 I want to buy some happiness for you. 

375
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,941
 My mother said the same thing, too. 

376
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:16,282
 It's plain nonsense. 

377
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,382
 How is this nonsense? 

378
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,612
 It's fine 

379
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,762
 as long as you have enough to spend. 

380
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:27,202
 Having too little or too much money will cause tragedies. 

381
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:29,761
 It will cause unhappiness to people. 

382
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,288
 I don't understand. 

383
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,862
She's pretty happy.

384
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:53,801
Have you contacted her family members?

385
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,682
She was an abandoned child.

386
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,062
Her parents were no longer reachable.

387
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,781
With parents like them,

388
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:05,262
it's not necessarily a bad thing to stay away from them.

389
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:08,561
Welfare organizations are pretty comprehensive nowadays.

390
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:10,361
We cannot decide where we will be born.

391
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,141
However, we can decide our own lives.

392
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,561
So...

393
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,623
are you free this Saturday?

394
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:21,031
Yes.

395
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,147
Sorry, I have to answer a call.

396
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:31,881
Hello, Mom?

397
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:33,409
Qin Qin,

398
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:37,601
Jiang Yu's mother wants to see you this Saturday.

399
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,025
 Mom, I told you already. 

400
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,081
He and I aren't meant for each other.

401
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:43,641
 I already made an appointment with her. 

402
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:45,178
It's fine even if you're busy.

403
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:48,961
I'll bring them to the hospital to visit you then.

404
00:27:51,614 --> 00:27:53,415
No need for that.

405
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:55,276
I will be there.

406
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:09,955
Sorry.

407
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,682
This Saturday, I...

408
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:12,934
That's fine.

409
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:29,261
Qin Qin, you're so refined and elegant.

410
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:31,101
Thank you, Auntie.

411
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:34,442
By the way, I heard that you're a doctor.

412
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:37,641
Are you busy with work usually?

413
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:39,261
That's right.

414
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,501
I don't want her to work as a doctor.

415
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:45,601
I want her to find a simple and relaxing job.

416
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,221
Isn't that better?

417
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:50,202
Children nowadays have their own opinions.

418
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,841
They won't listen to us.

419
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,161
My son is the same.

420
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:54,862
He's busy all day long.

421
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,801
It's so hard for me to see him around.

422
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:00,202
They can make time for us if they wish to see us.

423
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:01,458
Thank you.

424
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,641
Look.

425
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,922
My daughter

426
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,450
is already here, right?

427
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,682
Yeah.

428
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,002
You two are both super busy.

429
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:09,601
Now that you two have time to see each other,

430
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,961
I assume it must be fate that brought you two together.

431
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,762
Uncle,

432
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:19,424
I just joined the fire station not too long ago.

433
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,482
I barely have any knowledge about the fire station.

434
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:23,841
I apologize for the embarrassment.

435
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:25,442
You can only climb upward if you're willing to start from the bottom.

436
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,561
If you're willing to train yourself at the bottom,

437
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,202
you'll have a bright future ahead.

438
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:32,081
Thank you. You flatter me.

439
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,622
You see,

440
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:35,607
I don't have any lofty aspirations.

441
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,622
I'm satisfied if I can achieve something

442
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:39,845
in my position.

443
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:43,801
Youngsters nowadays are very ambitious.

444
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:45,561
It's rare to find someone

445
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,081
as down-to-earth as you.

446
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:49,065
You flatter me.

447
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,842
Have some tea.

448
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:01,302
You performed so well just now.

449
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:05,582
I rushed here

450
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:08,081
without any preparations.

451
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:10,482
We just talked about my work.

452
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,841
My father will think that you have a modest family tradition.

453
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:16,815
He'll think that you're ambitious and not concerned about trivial details.

454
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,919
You should stop complimenting me.

455
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,601
I have no achievements at all. It's a far cry from my true self.

456
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,042
In my father's eyes,

457
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,061
you're honest, hard-working, modest, and prudent.

458
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,210
Do you like me?

459
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,887
I think you're pretty nice.

460
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:34,866
But I don't think I like you.

461
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,881
Because we met each other

462
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,581
too hastily.

463
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,538
And also,

464
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,082
I already have someone I like.

465
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:50,221
So your parents object to it?

466
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:57,741
What do you wish to do then?

467
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:59,527
Do you need my help?

468
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,562
So your husband...

469
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:08,561
He works for the government.

470
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:09,762
It's difficult for him to take any time off.

471
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:11,482
He told me to send his regards.

472
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:13,701
Sorry about that.

473
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:15,002
Since fate has brought us together,

474
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,682
we should meet up more often in the future.

475
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,081
We should meet up more often.

476
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,922
- Yes.  
 - Our children

477
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,279
should meet up more often, too.

478
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,722
The nature of my work is pretty unique.

479
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:25,081
It's hard for me to take any time off too.

480
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:28,242
I don't think I can meet up with her often in reality.

481
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,682
My son is pretty frank.

482
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,823
You have day offs, right?

483
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,401
You guys can see each other during your day off.

484
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:35,881
Mom, I feel like sleeping during day offs.

485
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:38,761
Meeting you is tough enough, and you're expecting me to meet someone else?

486
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:41,482
That's good.

487
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,401
Youngsters should work on their skills

488
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:47,274
so that they can achieve something great in the future.

489
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,376
But I don't have any lofty aspirations.

490
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:51,962
I like working at the bottom level.

491
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:55,681
I'm satisfied as long as I can do my part.

492
00:31:59,881 --> 00:32:03,582
- We— 
 - Why don't we dig in?

493
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:04,881
Xiao Jiang, you're driving today.

494
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,741
Don't drink alcohol.

495
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,321
- Please. 
 - Thank you.

496
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,691
Here.

497
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,321
Please.

498
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:20,600
Okay.

499
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,461
What a shame.

500
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:31,282
You and Old Jiang are old friends.

501
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,881
If our children can date each other,

502
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:35,722
it'll be beneficial to their company too.

503
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:38,961
They do look good together.

504
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:42,921
Old Jiang's son is pretty good indeed.

505
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,962
He's down-to-earth.

506
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,461
However, I think there's no chemistry

507
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:50,242
between him and Qin Qin.

508
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:51,537
He won't do.

509
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,881
He has no dreams

510
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:54,401
nor a sense of responsibility.

511
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:56,422
He's unlike our children.

512
00:32:56,422 --> 00:32:58,995
Our children are down-to-earth and obedient.

513
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,042
What's wrong with you today?

514
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,074
You were so impolite.

515
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:48,222
I was stating facts.

516
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,061
Don't you like Xu Qin?

517
00:33:51,061 --> 00:33:52,601
She's a nice person.

518
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,561
But her mother doesn't take a liking to me.

519
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:57,042
She takes a liking to you and my father.

520
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:00,305
Her mother hopes that you can develop your career better.

521
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:03,601
What kind of development? Is there something wrong with my career?

522
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:06,912
I thought it was a blind date. What's with the career assessment?

523
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,201
Seems like you're truly angry about this.

524
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,322
It's rare to see you like this.

525
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:13,322
I'm not angry.

526
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:15,442
The person who will be with me in the future

527
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:18,142
must first be able to accept my career choice.

528
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,719
   

529
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,962
You and your brother always make me worried.

530
00:35:21,962 --> 00:35:24,189
Was he possessed during his birthday?

531
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,842
Did you know something? He had a drink here

532
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,199
and got into a fight.

533
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:32,839
I never knew that he was someone like that.

534
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:38,061
Don't tell me you argued with him again?

535
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:39,881
Was it because of Song Yan again?

536
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:44,522
What's with you and Song Yan now?

537
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:46,442
Are you two dating each other again?

538
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:48,077
No.

539
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,518
You're as indecisive as ever, huh?

540
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:54,396
Can't you be decisive for once?

541
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:58,061
We have plenty of chances to take and decisions to make in life.

542
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:01,581
Isn't it better to lead a carefree and joyful life?

543
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:03,362
Can you stop bringing that up?

544
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:05,881
Just when I've calmed myself down.

545
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:07,681
My dear sister,

546
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:11,850
since you're not satisfied with this result, you should give it a try.

547
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,121
Once you've done that,

548
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:15,251
even if you have to go through something unpleasant,

549
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:17,842
you'll feel much better when you come back

550
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,442
and follow your mother's arrangements.

551
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:22,816
It's just a relationship.

552
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,042
Relax.

553
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,959
You're giving yourself too much pressure.

554
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:31,802
He's not someone who will get into a relationship on a whim.

555
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:34,537
Wait, he's not willing to date you?

556
00:36:34,537 --> 00:36:36,501
That can't be.

557
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:38,625
I'm not willing to date him, either.

558
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:41,561
I can date anyone if I just want to get into a casual relationship.

559
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:43,009
But not him.

560
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:45,010
Why not?

561
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:47,681
If we break up again,

562
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:51,322
our past memories will be ruined too.

563
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,081
Those are just past memories.

564
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,641
It's not like you can relive them again.

565
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,602
Are they that important?

566
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,192
Yes.

567
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,330
They are very important.

568
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,430
♫  I still like it after all these years  ♫

569
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:14,460
♫  The feeling of being liked by you  ♫

570
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,060
♫  As I look at you, I see some differences  ♫

571
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:25,350
♫  We're no longer young like before  ♫

572
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:31,380
♫  There's anticipation between our brows and hearts  ♫

573
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,830
♫  Eagerly anticipating your anticipation  ♫

574
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:42,860
♫  I muster up the courage but you never appear  ♫

575
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,200
♫  Memories filled this empty room  ♫

576
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,570
♫  Your shadow is fading away on this lonely street  ♫

577
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:02,550
♫  This city is lingering with nostalgia  ♫

578
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:11,100
♫  Waiting in a city for that one person  ♫

579
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,480
♫  I've gone in circles before standing in front of you  ♫

580
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,260
♫  Love feels like our first encounter, waiting for us to return to the beginning  ♫

581
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,300
♫  Back to that very day  ♫
