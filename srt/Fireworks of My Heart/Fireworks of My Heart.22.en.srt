I already ate.

583
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:34,900
Leader.

584
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,420
Fine.

585
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,860
Serve the people as you wish.

586
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,060
At a time like this,

587
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,500
we can still have eggs.

588
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,300
It shows that

589
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,050
it's fortunate

590
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,260
to be alive.

591
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,580
Yes.

592
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,620
The earthquake only went on for 20 to 30 seconds yesterday,

593
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,740
but the whole town was destroyed,

594
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,610
and many people died just like that.

595
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,120
It shows how weak

596
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,140
and fragile humans are

597
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,380
in the face of nature.

598
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,060
Now that I think about it,

599
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,460
the trifles that we've been fussing about

600
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,900
don't seem that important.

601
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,740
I've made up my mind.

602
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,580
I'll make up

603
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,490
with my boyfriend as soon as I go back.

604
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,060
I'll forgive him generously.

605
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,820
What's there to fuss about

606
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,500
when I can be with someone I love?

607
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,190
You don't seem hungry to me.

608
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,980
-Showing affection in front of me./N-Really?

609
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,140
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.

610
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,740
It's not easy for us to have this.

611
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,110
Have a bite.

612
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,940
We haven't eaten anything

613
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,700
since last night.

614
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,950
Of course you are drained.

615
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,100
Yang.

616
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm not hungry.

617
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,250
Trust me.

618
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,700
We saved so many people.

619
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,940
God has been watching.

620
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,780
Your mother is definitely blessed.

621
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,620
Nothing will happen to her.

622
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,540
Have some.

623
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:08,900
Pull yourself together.

624
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,380
The higher-ups have

625
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,130
contacted the General Command Center

626
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,780
and sent a missing person message.

627
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,340
We'll find out soon.

628
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,890
Thank you, Chief.

629
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:36,570
Here.

630
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,420
Eat the noodles.

631
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,620
Many people

632
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,460
are waiting for us to save them.

633
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,440
Your noodles.

634
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,130
Okay.

635
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,120
I just got it ready.

636
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,820
[China Health]

637
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,480
[China Health]

638
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,290
Good night, Leader.

639
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,460
Leader.

640
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,900
Your feet are swollen.

641
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
I'll get you some medicine

642
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,980
to apply.

643
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,500
People's Hospital's medical team.

644
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,770
They need medical support on the spot.

645
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,180
Who can go there now?

646
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,730
Director, this is Xu Qin.

647
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,530
I can go.

648
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,060
Okay.

649
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,140
I'll arrange a car for you.

650
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,160
It'll be right there.

651
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,460
Bring medicine, equipment,

652
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,300
and a stretcher.

653
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,810
Bring two nurses with you as well.

654
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,460
Roger that.

655
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,710
Leader, I'll go with you.

656
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,580
Me too.

657
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,560
Get the medical kit ready.

658
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,180
Okay.

659
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,430
Are your feet okay?

660
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,590
It's okay.

661
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,300
Let's go.

662
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:31,630
[China Health]

663
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,410
Set the terminal up.

664
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
Vital signs detected.

665
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,580
Save people!

666
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,140
Hurry up!

667
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,730
Hurry!

668
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,340
Go!

669
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,580
Class 1, smash the walls!

670
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,870
Class 2, clear and transport!

671
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,360
Hurry!

672
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,530
Hurry up.

673
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,740
Comrades.

674
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,870
You should weigh the pros and cons.

675
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,630
You don't know how deep he's buried.

676
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,890
He can't be saved.

677
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,060
Let's hurry up

678
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,170
-and go to the next area./N-Hurry.

679
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,540
We can save more people.

680
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,380
Spending several hours

681
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,500
to save one person.

682
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,650
We don't know if he's dead or alive.

683
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,940
We may also encounter

684
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,820
a second collapse

685
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,410
and risk our lives.

686
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,060
Is it worth it?

687
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,350
Those from Shilitai.

688
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,320
Do you remember

689
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,580
the vow we made before we came?

690
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,010
We solemnly promise

691
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,330
every life that

692
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,310
we'll never give up.

693
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,770
Let's do it!

694
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,860
Yes!

695
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,830
Hurry!

696
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,780
Leader!

697
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,220
We'll go to the next area.

698
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,790
Hand me the ax.

699
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,070
Take it.

700
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,630
Sir.

701
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,160
Please go to the town

702
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,450
and bring those who can help us here.

703
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,010
OK.

704
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,780
Thank you.

705
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,610
Be careful.

706
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,630
Slowly.

707
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,500
Slowly.

708
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,460
Song Yan!

709
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,090
Chief!

710
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,070
One, two, three!

711
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,840
Yang, hold on!

712
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,180
Don't worry.

713
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,740
It will be cleared soon.

714
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,790
Don't worry.

715
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,110
Li Meng.

716
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,380
Why is it you?

717
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,340
I've been

718
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,840
settling

719
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,670
and evacuating people nearby.

720
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,170
The station got the information that you are here,

721
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,530
so they asked me to pick you up.

722
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,220
You...

723
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,640
Did you walk here like that?

724
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,280
There was an aftershock.

725
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
It had been cleared up before,

726
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,620
but it got blocked again.

727
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,960
We have to walk for a while.

728
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,640
No problem.

729
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,460
I'll take my bag.

730
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,620
Let me carry it.

731
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,300
I can do it myself.

732
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,450
Let me.

733
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,060
Here.

734
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,460
Thank you.

735
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,380
Let's go.

736
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:45,860
Let's go.

737
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,280
I came right after the meeting.

738
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,550
I didn't have time to get changed.

739
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,400
Be careful.

740
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,640
There are lots of rocks here.

741
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,310
Okay.

742
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,420
It's okay.

743
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,020
Be careful.

744
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,930
You majored in psychology?

745
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,260
I used to work as a therapist

746
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,650
during my internship in college.

747
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,300
That's why our leader sent me here

748
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,060
to help you

749
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,500
by providing emotional counseling

750
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,020
for the victims.

751
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,790
This is also a crucial part

752
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,030
of post-disaster reconstruction.

753
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,140
Besides,

754
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,210
the sooner the better.

755
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,980
Have you had time to rest

756
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,780
these days?

757
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,690
Yes.

758
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,410
We took turns to rest for half an hour each.

759
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,620
We're short-handed.

760
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,570
We are all fighting for

761
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,740
the golden window of 72 hours.

762
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,780
Come on. Give me your hand.

763
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,100
Thank you.

764
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,020
Be careful.

765
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,290
You're right.

766
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,470
Now,

767
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
time is the most precious.

768
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,540
Look ahead.

769
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,660
It will take a longer while

770
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,110
to walk to the Command Center.

771
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,730
Okay.

772
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,620
It's difficult to walk here.

773
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,020
Come on. Let me carry you.

774
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,020
It's okay. I can walk myself.

775
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,730
Let me carry you.

776
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,660
Seriously, I can manage.

777
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:44,940
I...

778
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,740
I can help you.

779
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,380
I can.

780
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,620
Let's go. It's okay.

781
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,120
We haven't been able to

782
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,930
reach Jiang Yi's mother and aunt.

783
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,390
This is their information.

784
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,920
Please.

785
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:12,860
Come on.

786
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,300
One, two, three.

787
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,540
Come on.

788
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,300
Are you okay?

789
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,380
I'm okay.

790
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,260
Go up and help.

791
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,889
Song Yan, let us help you.

792
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:27,580
Don't come up.

793
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,590
Wait down there.

794
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,400
It's dangerous up there.

795
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,030
Get down!

796
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,449
Don't come up. It's dangerous.

797
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,570
Don't worry.

798
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,280
Get down.

799
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:38,460
Come on.

800
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,060
Come on, move it.

801
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,699
Be careful.

802
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,500
Be careful.

803
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,250
Let's go.

804
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,660
Found him!

805
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,190
I found him!

806
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,150
Doctor!

807
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,420
Let's go.

808
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,610
Dr. Xu.

809
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,490
Go up.

810
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,520
Chief.

811
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,940
We've detected it.

812
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,830
It's safe for now.

813
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,150
We suggest rescuing as soon as possible.

814
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,390
Be careful.

815
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,940
Be careful.

816
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,820
Be careful, Chief.

817
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,010
Help me...

818
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,460
Help me...

819
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,660
Here.

820
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,540
Miss.

821
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,220
How are you?

822
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,900
Help me...

823
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,100
Three.

824
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,580
Her legs are fine. Carry her out first.

825
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,140
Jiang.

826
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,620
Be careful.

827
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,480
Miss, hang in there.

828
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,130
Chief, be careful.

829
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,330
It's okay.

830
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,300
We're out.

831
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,970
Come on.

832
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,360
Junping. Pipi.

833
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,100
Don't cry.

834
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,560
Pipi.

835
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,300
It's okay. Come on.

836
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,740
Here.

837
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,300
Hold her.

838
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:42,860
Come on.

839
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,900
Be careful.

840
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,380
OK.

841
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,730
Lower.

842
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,880
We have the best doctor.

843
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,300
We'll bandage your wounds.

844
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,220
All right.

845
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,740
Don't cry.

846
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,220
Here.

847
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,980
Be careful.

848
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,450
Slowly.

849
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,520
Pipi, over there.

850
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,300
Don't move.

851
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,840
Let me.

852
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,720
She's gone.

853
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,100
Go save the others.

854
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,520
Wait.

855
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,660
She's pregnant.

856
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,850
Turn her over.

857
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,580
Generally, when the mother dies,

858
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,380
in five to eight minutes,

859
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,820
the fetus will die too.

860
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,530
There's a heartbeat.

861
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,630
The baby is alive.

862
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,540
Can we still save the baby if we take them to the health unit now?

863
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,500
It'll be too late.

864
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,420
We need to do a C-section right away.

865
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,220
Are you confident?

866
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,370
No.

867
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,480
I'll try.

868
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,510
Lay her down.

869
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,260
Be careful.

870
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,450
Come on.

871
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,940
Dr. Xu.

872
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,780
Thank you.

873
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,230
Scissors.

874
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,930
Get the scalpel ready.

875
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,950
Press.

876
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,740
The baby was born!

877
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,110
Be careful.

878
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,150
Take care.
