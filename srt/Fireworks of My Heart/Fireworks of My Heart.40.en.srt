I'll take it away.

387
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,660
It's such a big tree.

388
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,620
You want to take it away?

389
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,020
Yes.

390
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,650
I've called a car.

391
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,380
I want to

392
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,500
take this tree

393
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,540
with me.

394
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:46,940
Because

395
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,820
this tree

396
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,100
was planted by my mother.

397
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,130
She passed away five years ago.

398
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,740
I just want to keep it as a memento.

399
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,770
Seven years ago,

400
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,250
my business failed

401
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,100
and I was heavily in debt.

402
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,510
At that time,

403
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,780
my mother

404
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,660
planted this tree.

405
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,780
As long as

406
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,900
this tree

407
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,300
grew a little taller,

408
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,230
my mother would send me a WeChat message.

409
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,630
She said,

410
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,140
"Son,

411
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,580
don't be discouraged.

412
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,230
You'll have good luck for sure."

413
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,890
Now my business is getting better,

414
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,990
but my mother is gone.

415
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,180
Okay.

416
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,800
Be steady.

417
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,020
Be steady.

418
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,660
Slow down.

419
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,930
Sir.

420
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,780
Help me load the car.

421
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,530
Don't worry.

422
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,760
Help carry it.

423
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,520
Okay.

424
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,200
Okay.

425
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:54,940
Let's go.

426
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,290
One, two, three.

427
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,460
Slow down. Don't knock on the door.

428
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,180
OK.

429
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,660
Thank you, Chief.

430
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,210
Thank you.

431
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:03,900
Thank you.

432
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,720
You're welcome. It's our duty.

433
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,530
Sorry for the trouble.

434
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,530
All parents go soft when it comes to their children.

435
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,780
Qin.

436
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,460
I heard from your brother that

437
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,050
you've been transferred from the ER.

438
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,160
I've been transferred to the outpatient department.

439
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,660
That's great.

440
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,130
Working in the outpatient department

441
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,540
is also tiring.

442
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,580
That's better than the ER.

443
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,490
Here.

444
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,610
Drink more.

445
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,600
Thank you, Mom.

446
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,060
Has the wedding been scheduled

447
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,170
yet?

448
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,220
Yes.

449
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,850
But it's still early.

450
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,910
So,

451
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,120
what are you going to do?

452
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,000
I've decided with Song Yan.

453
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,440
We'll make it simple.

454
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,030

a simple wedding.

456
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,030
No way.

457
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,510
Marriage is a big deal.

458
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,460
How can you just make it simple?

459
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,260
Mom,

460
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
it's her wedding, not...

461
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,820
Fine.

462
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,860
This is your family's business.

463
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,890
You have the final say.

464
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,750
That's not what I mean.

465
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,280
If it were up to me,

466
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,230
I'd say

467
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,010
we should

468
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,540
respect their wishes.

469
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,810
If Qin wants

470
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,260
a quiet and simple wedding,

471
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,780
well,

472
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,540

476
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,060
and receiving the blessing

477
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,370
of both parents,

478
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,060
all of these parts should be included, right?

479
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,300
Yes.

480
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,140

481

482
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,540
Eat.

483

Didn't you say

487
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,900
you'd pick up your stuff at night?

488
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,020

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,860
You're so sweet today.

581
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,340
You have a new friend.

582
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,540
What do you like to eat?

583
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,180
Order it.

584
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,300
Sister Hong, let me introduce him to you.

585
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,300
This is

586
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,660
Qin's husband.

587
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,700
Qin?

588
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,020
Really?

589
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,860
Great.

590
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,490
You know what?

591
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,280
You two

592
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,930
really look like a couple.

593
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,140
All right.

594
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,980
Today

595
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,430
I'll personally cook some dishes for you,

596
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:44,850
okay?

597
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,300
If you say so,

598
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
I'll bring

599
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,620
different brides here every day,

600
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,540
and you'll cook for us

601
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,500
every day, okay?

602
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,930
Stop bragging.

603
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,680
Order.

604
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,830
I'll serve the wine.

605
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,400
[Smell of cooking in daily life]

606
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,450
[The smell of cooking in daily life is always comforting]

607
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,260
[If you smile, the sun city]

608
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,340
Come on.

609
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,770
Song Yan.

610
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,380
You must have had a hard time

611
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,580
in the past ten years, right?

612
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,780
It's worth it.

613
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:46,220
Really?

614
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,060
Yes.

615
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,340
The training

616
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,260
is a little tough,

617
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,300
but that's what firefighters do.

618
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,140
What was it like when you were in the army?

619
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,900
It was almost the same.

620
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,740
I swore when I joined the army.

621
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,090
Work hard

622
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,300
and fight hard.

623
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,820
Then I could only bear it.

624
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,410
Hardships

625
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,340
and suffering

626
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,630
are nothing.

627
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,260
You swore?

628
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,860
What is a soldier's oath?

629
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,150
I want to hear it.

630
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,650
Let me think.

631
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,040
Serve the people.

632
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,710
Fear no sacrifice.

633
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,370
Devoted to my duty.

634
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,860
Work hard

635
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,580
and fight hard.

636
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,370
Under any circumstances,

637
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,530
never betray the country

638
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,020
or the army.

639
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,710
And I will never betray you.
