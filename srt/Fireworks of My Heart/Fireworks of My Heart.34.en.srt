Then again,

766
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,690
secretary Wang didn't handle this personally,

767
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,300
so we can't guarantee

768
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,220
that what he said is true.

769
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,290
So in the end,

770
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,910
this situation

771
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,760
is all because Gu's men had problems.

772
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,650
It should be secretary Wang

773
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,780
to clean up the mess.

774
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,300
It's his responsibility, he should bear the consequences.

for making this trip.

the thermal insulating materials we use

794
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,610
Such good materials are burned like this.

795
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,610
What a pity.

796
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,410
Are all the materials used

797
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,290
all here?

798
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,510
Why are the other floors

799
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,630
swept clean?

800
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,980
How would I know?

801
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,240
The firefighters cleaned it up.

We didn't touch anything.

Firefighters are sure to

804
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,020
protect the scene.

805
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,210
There's no way

806
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,330
they will clean up so well.

807
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,260
This is common sense.

Since the fire went out,

812
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,890
this place has been sealed.

813
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,570

There's CCTV downstairs, right?

All the wires are burnt.

It's about the Junguang Square fire.

It's very important.
