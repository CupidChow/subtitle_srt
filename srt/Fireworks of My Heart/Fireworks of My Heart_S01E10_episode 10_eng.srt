00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:35,262
   

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,164
   

4
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,967
   

5
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,107
I heard from your mom that she has been arranging blind dates for you lately.

6
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,988
How is it going? Are you making any progress?

7
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,699
Dad, can't I find someone I like?

8
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,900
So you're saying you already have someone you like?

9
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,895
I don't want to live a life that's arranged for me.

10
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,296
I don't want a life where I know exactly how it will end.

11
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,303
All parents are like this.

12
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,206
We don't want our children to go down the wrong path.

13
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,412
Our generation has gone through hardships,

14
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:25,212
so we have developed some bad habits.

15
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,283
We tend to calculate gains and losses in everything we do.

16
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,613
That's why we believe in matching family backgrounds.

17
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:34,973
We believe that love and marriage

18
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:38,158
should be based on equal conditions and economic compatibility.

19
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,893
Your mother wants the best for you, and she's not wrong.

20
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:44,465
I'm not going against Mom on purpose.

21
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:48,285
I just want to have freedom in deciding my life.

22
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:51,572
Qin Qin,

23
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:55,493
will you be honest with me?

24
00:02:55,493 --> 00:03:00,813
Do you still like that boy surnamed Song?

25
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,419
No wonder your mom is so angry.

26
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,199
She'll never approve of it.

27
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,452
Then... what about you?

28
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,601
Do you also disapprove of us?

29
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:21,932
To be honest, I'm a bit worried.

30
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,963
You know your mom's temper.

31
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:30,812
She will do whatever it takes to prevent you two from being together.

32
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,312
Qin Qin.

33
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,033
I really don't want our family

34
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:39,413
to fall apart because of this.

35
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,213
 I was wondering why you applied to the local university. 

36
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:59,785
 Turns out you stayed here for that little thug because he failed to get into college. 

37
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:02,274
 You want to stay and date him in secret! 

38
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,112
 You've really disappointed me. 

39
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:09,552
 For that punk, that thug, you lied to your parents. 

40
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:12,233
 You're even giving up your future for him! 

41
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,852
 Mom, he's not like what you said. 

42
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:17,817
 Someone who skipped classes, got into fights, and can't even get into college, 

43
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,871
 what can he amount to? 

44
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:26,812
 Qin Qin, listen here, I will never allow you two to be together. 

45
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,012
 If you don't listen to me, 

46
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:30,932
 if you think he's more important than your family, 

47
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:34,933
 then make a choice. 

48
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,212
 Either choose this family 

49
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:39,592
 or choose that little thug! 

50
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,092
 Mom... 

51
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,212
 When you eat, there is etiquette to follow. 

52
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:54,613
 First, sit up straight. 

53
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,663
 Hold the bowl properly. 

54
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,833
 Eat spoonful by spoonful without making any noise. 

55
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,452
 After finishing the soup, 

56
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:03,472
 place the rice here. 

57
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,132
 When taking food, 

58
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,041
 your chopsticks shouldn't go back and forth more than three times. 

59
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,613
 Only take the dish in front of you. 

60
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,212
 Don't stir the dish. 

61
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:13,046
 Did you get it? 

62
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,638
 Yes. 

63
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:16,878
 What did I tell you? 

64
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:23,019
 Girls should be demure and poised. 

65
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,666
 Always listen to your parents. 

66
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,062
 Be well-behaved. 

67
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:34,553
 Understood? 

68
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,490
It's so windy out here. Why didn't you wait inside?

69
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,112
It's okay. I just got here, too.

70
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:33,612
Let's go.

71
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,912
When you take leave,

72
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:15,253
you usually have to return to the team within two hours, right?

73
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,870
That's about right.

74
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,112
Every time I asked you out before,

75
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,779
you would make excuses to turn me down.

76
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,694
But this time, you agreed quickly.

77
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,662
Xu Qin,

78
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,253
just cut to the chase.

79
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,445
You...

80
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,136
You saved me

81
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,712
a few times before.

82
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,413
After this,

83
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:19,099
let's call it even.

84
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,280
"Call it even"?

85
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,673
All right.

86
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,231
We'll call it even then.

87
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,512
Enough talking.

88
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:58,693
- Let's dig in. 
 - Xu Qin.

89
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,361
You said

90
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:09,833
you were considering reconciling with me these past few days,

91
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,544
but now you're afraid and changing your mind.

92
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:17,033
Is it so difficult to just say that?

93
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:21,733
- I... 
 - There's no need to say it anymore.

94
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:23,973
I understand.

95
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,264
Whatever you say, I'll accept.

96
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,053
We're even.

97
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,233
All right.

98
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:56,206
It's all because I took a glance at you in the hallway back then,

99
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,652
I brought this upon myself.

100
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,110
What?

101
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,760
♫  My tears cannot let go and forget you  ♫

102
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,310
♫  Who is the one who drew a beautiful lasting scar in my heart  ♫

103
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:26,090
♫  I still remember the day we cried so hard when we parted  ♫

104
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:33,490
♫  I'm waiting for the answer from the time of journey  ♫

105
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:49,140
♫  That midsummer, I count on that promise you made?  ♫

106
00:10:50,300 --> 00:11:00,130
♫  That midsummer, the wish I made was you  ♫

107
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:03,933
 Is there a fire? 

108
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,866
 There's a fire! 

109
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,900
 Fire! Hurry! 

110
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,370
 Hurry! 

111
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:10,403
Fire!

112
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,012
People are already evacuating, hurry!

113
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,113
- Fire! 
 - Stand back!

114
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,175
Stand back! Stand back!

115
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,612
Stand back, everyone!

116
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:17,732
Careful. Stand back.

117
00:11:17,732 --> 00:11:19,732
I'm a firefighter. Are there still people inside?

118
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:21,413
- Are there still people inside? 
 - Our head chef is still in there.

119
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,113
Please save him.

120
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:27,052
Everyone, move back.

121
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,392
Move back, move back.

122
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,163
Get down first!

123
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,913
Get down!

124
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:51,872
Come on!

125
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:55,833
 Help! Is there anyone... 

126
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,732
- Go outside. 
  - Someone, help! 

127
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,175
- There's another one. 
 - He's out.

128
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,685
Take him to the hospital now!

129
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,397
Take him to the hospital now! Hurry!

130
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,513
Help!

131
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:14,213
Help!

132
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,073
Come on! Come with me!

133
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:19,073
Come with me!

134
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:22,992
Come on!

135
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:29,972
The fire brigade is on its way.

136
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:33,286
Please make way for firefighting access.

137
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,888
Is there anyone else inside?

138
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,701
Is there still someone inside?

139
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,741
Turn on the water!

140
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,180
Turn the valve!

141
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:31,953
Xu Qin, do you know him well or not? Tell me!

142
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:36,013
Please, Xu Qin. Please tell me.

143
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:38,360
I don't actually know him that well.

144
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:46,153
It's okay. I can approach him myself.

145
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,784
Give me his number. WeChat is fine too.

146
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:51,653
What are you trying to do?

147
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,173
He's such a hot firefighter.

148
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,967
And he saved my life. I have to court him, of course.

149
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,293
Hurry, give me his number now. Please.

150
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,993
Pretty please. Please.

151
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:12,112
The last number in my contacts.

152
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,893
You're the best. When he becomes my boyfriend, I'll treat you to a really nice meal.

153
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:17,092
- Which one is it? 
 - This one.

154
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,893
The last number in your contacts.

155
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,232
Hold on. Let me call him right now.

156
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,133
 Hello? 

157
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,492
Hello. Hi. I'm the girl you just saved

158
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:41,193
with long hair and wearing a black dress. Do you remember?

159
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:42,693
 No. 

160
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:46,492
It's okay. Next time we meet, you'll remember me.

161
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:49,833
You saved my life. I'd like to treat you to a meal.

162
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:52,852
 No need. 

163
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:55,024
How about we grab a drink, then?

164
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:02,293
This guy is pretty interesting.

165
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,992
- Are you still going to pursue him? 
 - Of course!

166
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:07,519
My gut feeling tells me that he must be a good man.

167
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,346
I was just young and foolish to be attracted to Xiao Yixiao that scumbag.

168
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,852
Just wait and see. He'll definitely become my boyfriend.

169
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,152
Let's go.

170
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:26,072
Get ready!

171
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,212
Spread out the hoses.

172
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,978
Pay attention to the connection points.

173
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,268
Don't make any mistakes.

174
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,373
Old Jiang.

175
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:36,673
Captain.

176
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,692
Where is Yang Chi?

177
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,420
Yang Chi is...

178
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,893
He's in the gym.

179
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:48,952
- All right. Carry on. 
 - Yes, Sir.

180
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,195
Come on, let's do it again!

181
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,187
Couldn't sleep?

182
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,821
I mean, this guy,

183
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,346
his son was

184
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,564
abducted by human traffickers when he was four years old.

185
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:19,772
His wife got sick two months ago and passed away.

186
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,412
This couple works tirelessly to save up.

187
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,392
They managed to save up some money by selling buns,

188
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,817
but got caught up in an online lending scam.

189
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,904
They lost everything they had invested.

190
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,532
Sometimes,

191
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,872
maybe for him,

192
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,770
death might seem easier than living.

193
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,668
I mean, did I...

194
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:55,941
I...

195
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,721
Everyone has a different definition of life.

196
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,681
They make different choices.

197
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:13,153
You fulfilled your duty.

198
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,565
So don't feel guilty.

199
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:28,791
Some people just get trapped in that moment.

200
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,192
And what we need to do

201
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:35,192
is to provide those trapped individuals with another choice.

202
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,276
The choice to live.

203
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,187
After all, some people,

204
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:45,066
once they get past that predicament, will choose to live.

205
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,193
Right?

206
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:00,507
I really envy you.

207
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,810
You never seem lost.

208
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:08,081
I've experienced it, too.

209
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,392
No one is made of steel.

210
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:14,992
How can one not feel lost or confused?

211
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:23,863
 Song Yan, 

212
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,932
 let's get back together. 

213
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,803
 After this, 

214
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,004
 let's call it even. 

215
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,373
Hello, Qin Qin. What's up?

216
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:31,973
Your brother isn't around.

217
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,992
Do you want to talk about life with me?

218
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:39,112
Come here then. Tonight, I'll be your companion.

219
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,333
- All right. 
 - Ye Zi.

220
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,143
Ye Zi.

221
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,516
Take these two bottles over there.

222
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,423
Reserve this room for me.

223
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,882
I've got a friend coming later. Just bring her here.

224
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,694
What are you doing here?

225
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:01,952
Ms. Zhan.

226
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:05,912
It's a bit inappropriate for you to occupy such a big room alone.

227
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,933
Let me get you another room.

228
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,392
I'll also arrange a few companions for you to heat things up.

229
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,531
Get lost.

230
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:15,107
You can't get me the hot guy I want.

231
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,813
Are you underestimating me?

232
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:19,979
Whatever type of hot guys you want, I can find them for you.

233
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,413
Are you getting involved in some shady business now, Mr. Xiao?

234
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:25,026
What's shady with introducing potential boyfriends for you?

235
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:31,364
Why didn't you tell me you were coming today?

236
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:37,473
Why did you also come without telling me?

237
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:39,766
I didn't know you were here.

238
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,274
Fine.

239
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:49,741
Such great gods, I can't just send you away.

240
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,245
Waitress, bring us some water!

241
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:57,751
Where's Qin Qin?

242
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:00,033
I saw her car downstairs.

243
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,402
She isn't here.

244
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,652
She probably hasn't arrived yet.

245
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,391
What a day.

246
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:26,853
Let me explain.

247
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:30,417
This is a coincidence. I didn't invite either of them.

248
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,317
Qin Qin, you're here.

249
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:34,312
Have a seat.

250
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,373
Xiao Rao, what are you doing?

251
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:44,797
I'm asking someone out.

252
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,613
She has been texting someone this whole time.

253
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,334
Who are you texting?

254
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,133
You're so attached to each other.

255
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,303
It's one-sided.

256
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,685
I invited him for supper, but he rejected me.

257
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:56,212
I sent him so many messages, but he doesn't reply at all.

258
00:22:56,212 --> 00:22:58,093
This guy is so heartless.

259
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:00,333
Do you know how difficult it was to find out when he has time off?

260
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,839
If I miss this chance, I'll have to wait again.

261
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:05,133
What kind of guy is he?

262
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,933
Making you chase after him like this.

263
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:09,452
I'm happy to. What's wrong with pursuing someone you like?

264
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,813
You guys do the same, why can't we women? Right?

265
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:14,353
All right, all right. No one says you can't.

266
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,200
He's agreed to see me!

267
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,037
You're being dramatic.

268
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,603
What are you doing now?

269
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,839
I have a date. No time to hang out with you guys anymore.

270
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,318
Who is this guy? You're so invested in him.

271
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:32,344
A firefighter. He saved my life.

272
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,791
And he's got a really nice name, Song Yan.

273
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:39,392
Bye.

274
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:49,513
I'm going to go wash my hands.

275
00:24:33,313 --> 00:24:35,165
Are you okay?

276
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,492
What on earth is that smell?

277
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,178
- Come here. 
 - What are you doing? It's so stinky.

278
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,526
Come. The Internet said to marinate it for a week.

279
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:19,446
It hasn't been a week yet. How did it become so smelly?

280
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:24,373
Did you put too little salt?

281
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:26,573
Put the lid back on first. Close it.

282
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:29,096
Maybe it was already stinky before I marinated it.

283
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:30,933
That's nonsense.

284
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:34,292
This mandarin fish is quite expensive. You just wasted it.

285
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:37,002
I definitely won't eat it. It's too smelly.

286
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:41,292
"Too smelly"? Who said durian was so stinky she'd never eat it?

287
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:44,492
Who later became addicted to it and enjoyed it more the stronger it smelled?

288
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:46,813
You're so annoying! So annoying!

289
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,573
All right now. Cut it out.

290
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:51,313
Tell me, what is Yan doing?

291
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:52,732
He's upstairs.

292
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:55,432
He went to see Qin Qin yesterday, didn't he?

293
00:25:56,653 --> 00:25:58,557
Why did he have to...

294
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,660
He can't keep doing this.

295
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,696
We must be stricter with him.

296
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,630
What does that mean?

297
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,531
We should reprimand him.

298
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,801
We need to set strict rules for him. He isn't allowed to see Qin Qin anymore.

299
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:12,805
Every time he sees her, he gets hurt. What's the point of it?

300
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,076
- You're right. 
 - Let's talk to him right now.

301
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,135
- Come on, I'll come with you. 
 - Okay.

302
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:27,713
Yan, you're going out?

303
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:31,093
- Did you want to talk to me? 
 - Your uncle wants to talk to you.

304
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:32,373
- Go on. 
 - Wait.

305
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,973
What's the matter?

306
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,597
What's stinking so bad?

307
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,099
Yes, I was just about to tell you this.

308
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,269
It's this stinky mandarin fish, it really reeks.

309
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,519
It's so stinky that it has a pungent odor.

310
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:48,013
Is that all?

311
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,292
Wh-Where are you going?

312
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,477
I'm going out for a walk.

313
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:55,492
Yes, go and get some fresh air. The night is beautiful. The air is fresh too.

314
00:26:58,093 --> 00:26:59,853
Uncle.

315
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,738
Did you drink?

316
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:03,538
A little bit.

317
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,034
Come home early.

318
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,212
Why didn't you tell him?

319
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,697
I'm a guy. I shouldn't be the one saying it.

320
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,732
Commander Miao, you should talk to him. I taught you.

321
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,853
You taught me? We agreed that you would talk to him!

322
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:17,613
- What's wrong with you? 
 - I concealed it quite well, didn't I?

323
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:19,052
- Come on. Let's go inside. 
 - You're useless.

324
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,933
- Let's go inside. 
 - No, it's stinky in there.

325
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,906
Let's get changed and go out for a stroll. Let the smell dissipate.

326
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,824
One more.

327
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:46,013
Give me the boss' Ardbeg Scorch.

328
00:27:58,252 --> 00:27:59,652
Another one.

329
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:48,048
Boss, here's your whiskey.

330
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:49,452
Okay.

331
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:52,292
I got this from an auction.

332
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,813
You should try it.

333
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:55,713
Drink it yourself.

334
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:02,915
Why isn't Qin Qin back yet?

335
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:05,912
She didn't leave again, did she?

336
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,412
Let's find out.

337
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:14,419
- Ye Zi. 
 - Yes, Boss?

338
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,972
Can you go to the women's restroom and see if our friend is in there?

339
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:20,772
She was just at the bar drinking alone. She has already left.

340
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:22,172
She just left.

341
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,438
Qin Qin.

342
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,052
Let me take you home.

343
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:37,273
No need. I can go by myself.

344
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:42,081
Sir, Lanxuan Apartment, please. Drive carefully.

345
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:48,152
Was Qin Qin drinking to drown her sorrows?

346
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,146
No, it was to boost her courage.

347
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:54,032
Come with me.

348
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,212
Sir, Wufang Street, please.

349
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:05,373
Didn't that gentleman say Lanxuan Apartment?

350
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,413
I want to go to Wufang Street. Thank you.

351
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:08,813
All right.

352
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:29,853
This isn't the direction to her house. You got it right.

353
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,690
Song Yan!

354
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,898
Song Yan!

355
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,365
Song Yan!

356
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,370
- Who is it? 
 - Song Yan!

357
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,149
Song Yan!

358
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,793
It's you.

359
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,309
What are you doing?

360
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,413
Do you know how late it is now?

361
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,113
Stop right there!

362
00:31:58,012 --> 00:32:00,653
Do you know how late it is now?

363
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:11,292
Song Yan?

364
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,993
Song Yan, are you asleep?

365
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:17,373
Song Yan?

366
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:19,073
It's me.

367
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:22,013
Stop knocking. My brother isn't home.

368
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:28,053
Where is he?

369
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:30,329
He's on a date with someone. He isn't coming home tonight.

370
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,829
You should leave.

371
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,753
I feel like I'm dying.

372
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:51,803
There is no point in living.

373
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,893
What's wrong with you?

374
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:55,693
Are you okay?

375
00:33:06,373 --> 00:33:08,273
Are you okay?

376
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,813
Why don't you sit down for a while?

377
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,719
These are my brother's shoes. He forgot to put them away.

378
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,733
What are you doing?

379
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,299
Have you lost your mind?

380
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:26,252
 You... 

381
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:29,532
You...

382
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:33,713
Brother, look at her!

383
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:35,906
She's drunk and acting crazy here.

384
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,339
What are you doing here?

385
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,242
Sorry about this.

386
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:03,933
She drank too much. She's wasted.

387
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,333
Let's go.

388
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,147
Let's go home.

389
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:13,872
Stop there.

390
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,953
Where were you?

391
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,172
I went out with a girl.

392
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:25,253
You know her.

393
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:27,376
What's her name again?

394
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:31,305
Her surname is Zhan,

395
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:33,608
her name is Xiao Rao.

396
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:39,578
Xu Qin, what are you doing?

397
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,844
What gives you the right to make a scene here?

398
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:47,206
Let's go.

399
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,706
There's nothing to say to someone like this.

400
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,885
He doesn't deserve you.

401
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,572
Let's go home. Come on.

402
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,872
You're right!

403
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:59,404
You don't deserve me! You do not deserve me!

404
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:14,693
Because I like you more than you like me.

405
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:27,653
I'm not good at socializing and I don't like making friends.

406
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:30,998
Professions like finance,

407
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,905
law,

408
00:35:32,905 --> 00:35:34,566
and management

409
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,270
aren't suitable for me.

410
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,679
Only being a doctor.

411
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:45,864
I just need to master the profession.

412
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,452
And I won't have to worry about being unemployed.

413
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,412
I can support myself.

414
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,576
When I returned to China,

415
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,733
I moved out from my parents' house.

416
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:02,830
I'm planning to gradually

417
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,499
stop relying on the money

418
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,899
and things my parents provide.

419
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,342
I keep thinking about...

420
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,373
what I can do

421
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:18,478
to make my parents not angry,

422
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:22,092
to not oppose us,

423
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:25,273
and not disown me as their daughter.

424
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:35,996
Maybe if I study my profession well and quickly become a top-notch

425
00:36:35,996 --> 00:36:38,433
and renowned surgeon,

426
00:36:41,052 --> 00:36:44,292
they'll accept me on other aspects.

427
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:46,651
If I can make them feel a little proud,

428
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,342
maybe they'll indulge me a little more.

429
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,849
But what about you?

430
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,631
What have you done, Song Yan?

431
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:01,272
What have you done for me?

432
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,494
Let me ask you,

433
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,639
have you made any efforts for me?

434
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:15,253
Yes.

435
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,432
I keep trying to get closer to you.

436
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:21,339
I keep hesitating.

437
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,277
I go back and forth.

438
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,237
I'm hesitant and weak.

439
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:31,613
I can't see any hope, and I'm afraid.

440
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:35,853
You have never made even the slightest effort

441
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,713
to make things work for us.

442
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:41,612
Never.

443
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:00,613
Am I right?

444
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,773
I'm right, aren't I?

445
00:38:04,773 --> 00:38:06,633
Song Yan,

446
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,772
I was right, wasn't I?

447
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:14,772
You don't like me that much, do you?

448
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:19,352
Do you not like me enough?

449
00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:24,938
Why else wouldn't you have made any effort at all?

450
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:27,957
You haven't even tried to get closer to me.

451
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,909
Someone like you,

452
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,480
why should I be the one who walks towards you?

453
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,052
You only stay where you are and wait for me to come to you.

454
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:41,789
Even when you see me fall, you won't come over to help me up.

455
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:45,425
Someone like you, why should I...

456
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,846
Why should I walk towards you?

457
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,793
Yes.

458
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm selfish.

459
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,045
I'm very selfish.

460
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:05,624
Even when it comes to the person I like, I'm selfish.

461
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:09,266
I just want to see you make an effort,

462
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:12,726
before I'm willing to walk towards you.

463
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,586
Otherwise, if I lose everything,

464
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,924
and you're still standing in the same place,

465
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:20,062
what am I supposed to do then?

466
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:29,532
My intentions aren't pure.

467
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:32,032
I'm being calculative.

468
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,119
I want you to make an effort, too.

469
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,221
I also want you to take a step towards me.

470
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:46,486
But why won't you walk over?

471
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:50,645
Song Yan, why won't you walk towards me?

472
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:56,792
Why?

473
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:05,673
I can't feel your affection at all.

474
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:13,552
You definitely don't like me that much.

475
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:19,283
You don't like me that much, do you?

476
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,622
You don't like me that much, do you?

477
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:25,239
You definitely don't like me that much.

478
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:28,572
If you don't, why did you say that to me?

479
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:32,463
Why did you say you liked me so much you'd give up your life?

480
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,568
I believed you!

481
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:37,993
I believed you, Song Yan!

482
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:39,693
I believed you!

483
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:42,193
- I believed you! 
 - Let's go home!

484
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:45,012
Get up.

485
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,755
Let me tell you,

486
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:02,118
I won't walk towards you anymore.

487
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:09,735
I won't.

488
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,433
It's not what you think!

489
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:21,773
- It's not what you think! 
 - Zhai Miao!

490
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,320
Brother...

491
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:43,180
♫  Watch the sun slowly descend  ♫

492
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:50,930
♫  Settling in the corner of your gaze, my heart finds its entrance  ♫

493
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:59,533
♫  Under the last ray of light, I'm desperately chasing after the stars  ♫

494
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:00,933
Brother...

495
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:10,490
♫  Thank you for navigating through the passage of time  ♫
