00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,490
How?

385
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,910
Tell me.

386
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,980
Who is your supplier?

387
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,690
I've asked.

388
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,710
Your sister

389
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,540
refused to

390
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,640
to tell us her supplier.

391
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,730
Let me ask you again.

392
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,900
Who is your supplier?

393
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,840
I don't know!

394
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,230
You still won't admit your mistake?

395
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,830
Inform the school.

396
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,370
Brother.

397
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,180
Okay.

398
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,140
Which school?

399
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,820
Song Yan.

400
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,220
Let me talk to her alone.

401
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,550
About what?

402
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,450
Look at her.

403
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,920
She's unrepentant.

404
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,120
She should learn her lesson!

405
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,580
What if we inform the school

406
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,890
and they expel her?

407
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,380
How will you explain this

408
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,290
to your uncle and aunt-in-law?

409
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,050
Sorry, Officer.

410
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,190
Can you give me some time

411
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,270
to talk to her alone?

412
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,220
Okay.

413
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,940
Hurry up.

414
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,820
Thank you.

415
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,580
Zhai Miao.

416
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,800
Out with it.

417
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,490
Did you hear

418
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,420
what your brother said?

419
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,530
You know

420
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,570
how upright your brother is.

421
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,160
He won't bend the law even when it comes to family.

422
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,100
If you don't confess

423
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,730
who your supplier is,

424
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,140
he will really inform your school.

425
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,000
This is my business.

426
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,360
It's got nothing to do with you.

427
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,850
Zhai Miao, don't be stubborn

428
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,750
when you're not in a position to.

429
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,180
You...

430
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
You think you're great,

431
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,830
right?

432
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,100
Your petty wits

433
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,090
are nothing.

434
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,200
It was a small infraction this time.

435
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,630
Maybe your brother can get you out

436
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,690
with just a fine.

437
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,670
What will you do if one day,

438
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,590
the victim gets disfigured or poisoned,

439
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,760
and wants to put you in jail?

440
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,740
Impossible.

441
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,350
I've tried all these myself.

442
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,420
What you said

443
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,240
will never happen.

444
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,990
That means

445
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,660
you don't want to confess who your supplier is

446
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,830
so that after the heat dies down,

447
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,630
you can continue doing this business?

448
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,580
That's not true!

449
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,500
You're lying!

450
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,210
To be honest,

451
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,690
I don't care about you at all.

452
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,430
If it weren't for Song Yan,

453
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,220
I wouldn't be standing here

454
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,170
talking to you.

455
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,180
You're an adult.

456
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,450
You must be responsible

457
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,310
for your own actions.

458
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,870
Don't make trouble for your brother anymore.

459
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,530
Xu Qin.

460
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,230
Why are you so good at pretending?

461
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,650
You are so hypocritical.

462
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,990
I know how I am.

463
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,590
But you

464
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,750
don't know your place.

465
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,740
Your brother said you were smart.

466
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,820
I think you're very stupid.

467
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,680
You're in a good school and you're smart.

468
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,110
You have a bright future after you graduate.

469
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,710
You'll earn a lot of money.

470
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,270
But what are you doing?

471
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,350
You should study,

472
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,220
but you don't.

473
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,430
You got blinded by

474
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,130
these trivial profits.

475
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,510
What are you if not stupid?

476
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,940
You can still make up for it

477
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,930
if you confess who your supplier is.

478
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,650
I don't think your brother

479
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,570
wants to push you into a corner.

480
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,090
But if you still won't admit your mistake,

481
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,250
he will do it.

482
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,790
Go admit your mistake.

483
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,450
[Fuming Police Station]

484
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,890
She is my supplier.

485
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,220
Wang.

486
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,100
Look up this person.

487
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,620
Okay.

488
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,460
Go on.

489
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,780
How do you know each other?

490
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,570
We met

491
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,100
in a part-timers' chat group.

492
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,780
At first, she got close to me

493
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,700
and introduced many part-time jobs to me.

494
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,160
They were quite reliable.

495
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,710
They paid me as promised.

496
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,790
A month ago,

497
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,010
she said her friend had a batch of lipsticks

498
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,660
that got seized by customs

499
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,720
and asked me if I had any way

500
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,640
of selling them.

501
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,780
She even showed me

502
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,230
all sorts of customs receipts.

503
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:14,860
Right,

504
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,580
she also sent me

505
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,700
a dozen samples.

506
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,280
I was afraid they were fake,

507
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,590
so I went to the counter to check.

508
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,340
After I confirmed they were authentic,

509
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,340
I started selling them

510
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,180
at the nearby schools.

511
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,420
Some students from out of town

512
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,100
came to me for stock.

513
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,070
I earn 30 yuan for each stick.

514
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,890
But I didn't expect her

515
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,510
to send me real samples

516
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,090
but fake goods.

517
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,730
This is a common trick used by scammers.

518
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,590
How could she get you hooked

519
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,650
without a little bait?

520
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,670
Why didn't you

521
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,540
confess just now?

522
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,730
I called them

523
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,190
when I realized there was a problem.

524
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,470
They said

525
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,300
the warehouse sent the wrong goods,

526
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,370
and if I dared to report them

527
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,470
to the police,

528
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,080
they won't give me a penny back.

529
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,490
How many did you sell?

500?

533
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,270
You're really something.

534
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,030
You earn over 30 yuan for each one.

535
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,450
Where did the money go?

536
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,950
I stocked up again.

You...

538
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,070
How was it?

539
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,260
The WeChat account has been cancelled.

540
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,890
It might be a bit troublesome

541
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,770
to find her now.

542
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,010
Officer,

543
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,780
what should we do now?

544
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,350
First,

545
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,020
your sister was selling counterfeit goods.

546
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,910
She must refund all the buyers

547
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,170
and be fined

548
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,390
three times the revenue.

549
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,750
Here's the fine ticket.

550
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,010
Remember to pay it at the bank.

551
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,610
Okay.

552
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,560
Second,

553
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,960

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,950
We can't be sure

556
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,150
if she was telling the truth.

557
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,500
We need to find the supplier

558
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,160
to prove that she was also a victim

559
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,350
and didn't know she was selling counterfeits.

560
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,490
Only then can we let her go.

561
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,410
Otherwise,

562
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,500
we will detain her

563
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,150
and inform the school.

00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,030
Brother.

565
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,300
You can't inform the school.

566
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,790
If the school finds out,

567
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,400
my graduation certificate will be gone.

568
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,410
Now you are anxious.

[Alarm Hall]

570
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,880

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,170
It's urgent.

572

I'll pay you back later.

573
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,460
Okay.

00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,400
and insists that you find someone from a suitable family,

961
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,710
what will you do?

962
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,150
Some things are usually invisible.

963
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,580
Once you talk about marriage,

964
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,070
they will become problems.

965
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,830
Don't blame your mother.

966
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,670
She sees more clearly than you do.

967
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,990
Love is fleeting.

968
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,400
Reality is the mountain

969
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,790
no one can move.

970
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,880
But only when I see him

971
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,610
do I feel alive.

972
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,580
You're going to be the death of me.

973
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,820
Speaking of which,

974
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,050
is Song Yan on the same page?

975
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,390
Does he think so too?

976
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,880
You saw what Song Yan was like

977
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,990
at the police station.

978
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,530
Your mother and brother don't like him.

979
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,490
He's known it all along.

980
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,460
Today, your brother humiliated him to his face.

981
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,220
He's so proud.

982
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,480
How can he not resent you?

983
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,300
If he can let go of his pride

984
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,500
and be with you,

985
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,370
I'll think he's more unreliable.

986
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,880
Listen to me.

987
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,870
You two are not suitable for each other.

988
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,830
Really.
