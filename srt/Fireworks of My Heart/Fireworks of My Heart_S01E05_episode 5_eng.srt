1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:10,100


2
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,797
   

3
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:37,217
   

4
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:40,043
   

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,939
What's going on?

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,640
How did you get that large wound?

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,239
Dr. Xu, did you give him a tetanus shot?

8
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,319
I did.

9
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,819
Remember to come and change your dressing as instructed.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,452
Here, put your clothes on first in case you get a cold.

11
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,159
I'll do it. Stand still.

12
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,659
Here.

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,239
Easy.

14
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,639
This hand.

15
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,560
Look at you.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Does it hurt? Do you need painkillers?

17
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,660
No.

18
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,839
Take it. This isn't the time to play the hero.

19
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,879
Isn't that right, Dr. Xu?

20
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,740
That depends on the patient.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Y-Your shoes are all wet.

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Let me get you some clean slippers from my car.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,259
It's cold today.

24
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:35,255
- It's fine. 
 - Wait here.

25
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,160
Is she your girlfriend?

26
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,819
Does this have anything to do with you?

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,471
If you have a girlfriend,

28
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,240
just say so when you reject my confession.

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,040
What's the use of beating around the bush.

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,956
It's our problem.

31
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,979
Keep it between us.

32
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,880
Why get others involved?

33
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,906
I was wrong for leaving you back then,

34
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:22,819
but don't you know how young we were?

35
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,500
We couldn't even make ends meet.

36
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,819
Under such circumstances, how could I betray my parents and choose you?

37
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,010
You're right.

38
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,945
I didn't make you choose.

39
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,569
But you didn't even make things clear.

40
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:38,580
You dumped me... like I was a dog.

41
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,839
Now tell me.

42
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,299
If you were in my shoes,

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,440
why should we get back together?

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,039
It's really pointless saying all this now.

45
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,611
All you care about is yourself.

46
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,739
Even if we could turn the clock back,

47
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,260
nothing would change.

48
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,559
That's right.

49
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,828
If we were to do this over again,

50
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,088
I'd still make that same choice.

51
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,276
You're telling me this

52
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,479
just to make me understand your difficulties.

53
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,685
Sure.

54
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,553
I understand.

55
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,424
But that doesn't lead to our reconciliation.

56
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,319
Even if we were to reconcile,

57
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,596
if something like this happened again,

58
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,233
you'd still make the same decision.

59
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,034
Right?

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,939
Getting back the candy you lost won't make it taste special.

61
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,500
There's no point wasting your love just to make up for regrets.

62
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,039
Xu Qin.

63
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:26,480
At this age, I may not be old,

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,500
but I'm not young either.

65
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:35,269
I might've been able to endure certain pain when I was young. It was fine.

66
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,109
It would heal.

67
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:43,420
But at this age...

68
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,439
I can't afford...

69
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,904
to suffer from it again.

70
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,339
Do you still hate me?

71
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,999
No.

72
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,180
I don't hate you.

73
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,420
But I want nothing to do with you.

74
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,183
Why did you come out here?

75
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,640
- Change into these. 
 - It's all right.

76
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,139
Is she your ex?

77
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,839
What?

78
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,680
She asked me about you.

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,578
I have great intuition.

80
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,700
Since it's over between you, why won't you give me a chance?

81
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,570
Naturally, if you have a chance to get back together,

82
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,270
I'll give up.

83
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,733
Whether it's her or you, none of it is possible.

84
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:41,099
She's obviously in your heart. You're just denying it.

85
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,560
Let's not start anything that won't end well.

86
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,160
It's all for the best.

87
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,985
- Dr. Xu, this is bad. 
 - What is it?

88
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,300
The driver's blood test results came back.

89
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,200
   

90
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,499
Did you get hurt in the river?

91
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,639
 You're injured. 

92
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,919
 Hold on to me. 

93
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,000
 One, two, three. 

94
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,399
I'm fine.

95
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,399
How about you? Do you have any wounds? Check thoroughly.

96
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,399
No.

97
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,519
Dr. Xu, I'm still single.

98
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,519
Everyone is.

99
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,679
Oh, right.

100
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,120
Dr. Xu, he was bleeding heavily when you entered the water.

101
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm fine.

102
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,799
Our skin is the best barrier.

103
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,561
As long as we don't have a wound or come in direct contact with the blood or fluid,

104
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,600
there's no risk of infection.

105
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,220
It's the firefighters who are in danger.

106
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,159
Tell the supply room to disinfect his surgical instruments separately.

107
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,159
The scrubs and medical waste must be packed separately.

108
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,039
Also, don't reopen the operating room till at least half an hour after disinfection.

109
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,180
- Got it. Let's go. 
 - All right.

110
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:49,000
Fall in!

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,559
- Captain. 
 - Quickly.

112
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,368
This afternoon's rescue team,

113
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,770
step out.

114
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,779
Those who came in contact with the sports car's driver, step out.

115
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,639
Captain, are we going to be rewarded?

116
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,720
What for, Captain? I'm not a money-grubber like Jiang Yi. No need for money.

117
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
M-More meat will do.

118
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Come with me... to the hospital.

119
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
It's okay.

120
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
I got some scratches, but there's no need to see a doctor.

121
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,939
Right. Forget about it.

122
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,780
You have to go to the hospital...

123
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,273
for a blood test.

124
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,502
   

125
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,559
 Wait! Wait! 

126
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,616
Why are you taking my son to the isolation ward?

127
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,559
He can't stay in that shabby place!

128
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,960
Listen to me!

129
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,320
I already talked to Division Chief Gao.

130
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Right now, at once, immediately, take my son to a private ward!

131
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,559
And send two nurses!

132
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll pay for all your overtime and bonuses!

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,639
That's right.

134
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,720
Do you know your son's condition?

135
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,760
These are his blood test results.

136
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,679
My son's been taking medication.

137
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,480
So you knew his health condition.

138
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,320
Why didn't you mention it before the surgery?

139
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,359
That's his privacy.

140
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,347
We're here to get his injuries treated,

141
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,916
not the disease!

142
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,039
It was an invasive surgery. What if he infects others?

143
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,320
You're exaggerating.

144
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,100
Don't you sterilize yourselves before surgery?

145
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,399
I get it now.

146
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,320
You're refusing to save him, aren't you?

147
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,120
Your son's life is precious,

148
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,679
but the medical staff's lives aren't?

149
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,520
Do the lives of the firefighters who rescued him not matter?

150
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Look at you.

151
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Is this how you talk to the patient's family?

152
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,339
What's going on? Who talks to a doctor like that?

153
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,601
I'm talking to the doctor. It's none of your business.

154
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:48,759
Mind your own business!

155
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,799
Get lost!

156
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,039
This is the ER.

157
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,600
Please leave.

158
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,679
Who is he? Who is he to speak here?

159
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,600
Get me the ward already.

160
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,390
They...

161
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,630
are the firefighters who risked their lives to save your son from the river!

162
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:28,320
   

163
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,360
- Thanks, Doctor. 
  - No problem. 

164
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,680
- Doctor. 
 - Song Yan.

165
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,360
 Why are they taking so much of our blood? 

166
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,440
Have we definitely been infected?

167
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,480
No, we're not sure. It's just protocol.

168
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,820
We need to know your physical condition when dealing with exposure risk.

169
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,519
If you're done with the blood draw, follow me to the observation room.

170
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,600
- Okay, sure. 
 - This way.

171
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
This is so scary.

172
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
 Done. Put pressure on it. 

173
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,019
Song Yan.

174
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,039
PEP to prevent the virus from spreading. 
  (T/N: post-exposure medication to prevent HIV) 

175
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,659
It's more effective if you take it sooner.

176
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,919
This is one dose each for three people.

177
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,440
We're not a designated hospital. The dispensary is out of stock.

178
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,559
We need to get the rest from the CDC. 
  (T/N: China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention) 

179
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,080
Three sets of medicine for four of us?

180
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,639
You're wounded and had close contact.

181
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,599
You're at the highest risk for infection. You should take it first.

182
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,099
You'll give it to them, won't you?

183
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,020
How's it going?

184
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,200
It's up to fate.

185
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,480
Did the doctor give you PEP?

186
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,527
This is all there is. We'll get the rest tomorrow.

187
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:24,159
You three take it first, Captain.

188
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,440
Given my size, I'm sure I'll be fine.

189
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,720
Captain, your injury is more serious.

190
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,919
You have to take it first.

191
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,960
Captain, I only helped carry him.

192
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm fit enough to skip the medicine.

193
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,759
Yang Chi.

194
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,919
Jiang Yi.

195
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,000
Liu Junping.

196
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,600
 Yes, Sir. 

197
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,759
Take it.

198
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,679
This is an order.

199
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,440
What about you, Captain?

200
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,966
I'll get mine tomorrow.

201
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,679
- There's enough time. 
 - It'll be pointless by then!

202
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,000
I've checked. The medicine is most effective if taken within two hours.

203
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,120
Twenty-four hours is less ideal.

204
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,220
The longer you wait, the less effective it is.

205
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,919
Let's listen to the doctors.

206
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,559
Enough.

207
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,440
Cheer up.

208
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
If anyone is infected,

209
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,640
you'll get treated at the best hospital...

210
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,539
with advanced medical technology.

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,499
As soon as we put on the uniform, we're prepared for it.

212
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,519
I believe even sacrificing your lives won't make you flinch.

213
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,104
If anything happens,

214
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,039
I'll be there for you.

215
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,809
All right! Take the medicine.

216
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,249
Go on.

217
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
Song Yan,

218
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,659
a reminder to those taking the medicine.

219
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,879
You might have an upset stomach, diarrhea, headaches, and insomnia.

220
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,570
Get enough rest. Don't exhaust yourselves.

221
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,996
Thank you.

222
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,840
You can go home after taking the medicine.

223
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,449
Song Yan, you should stay for observation since you didn't take the medicine.

224
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay.

225
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,089
Yes. Our hospital has run out of PEP.

226
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:26,888
If you could, please ask the CDC to send it to us as soon as possible.

227
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,639
All right. Thank you.

228
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,630
♫  I still miss your humor  ♫

229
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,750
   

230
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,120
♫  I still have many things left to say  ♫

231
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,110
♫  I missed too many meals and seasons without you  ♫

232
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,830
- Dr. Xu. 
 - Thank you!

233
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,120
♫  The leaves have fallen hopelessly from the branches  ♫

234
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,460
♫  I'll still be here waiting for you  ♫

235
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,720
♫  Who shed tears throughout the rainy night outside the window?  ♫

236
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,340
♫  I'm sorry I failed to protect our fragile relationship that year  ♫

237
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:23,060
♫  Oh, my tears, I'm not able to hold them back and can't let you go  ♫

238
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:29,670
♫  Who left a mark on my heart, a beautiful scar that won't fade away?  ♫

239
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,720
♫  I still remember the day we parted, we cried our hearts out  ♫

240
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,800
Here, take the medicine.

241
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Thanks.

242
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,159
That's my line.

243
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,900
You saved me first.

244
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,620
Don't feel burdened.

245
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:07,447
This is my work responsibility.

246
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm mature enough to understand when you say

247
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,899
you want nothing to do with me.

248
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,107
I'll respect your decision.

249
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,906
   

250
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,519
What's you plan for the future then?

251
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,880
Will you continue to stay at Shili Tai?

252
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
The future?

253
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,859
I haven't given it a thought.

254
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,699
I just want to focus on what I'm doing now.

255
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,199
And you?

256
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,839
Well, I can't only think of myself.

257
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,429
My parents are older, and they have health issues.

258
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,880
I haven't been able to spend time with them either.

259
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,200
My fiancée and I aren't officially married.

260
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,739
Yet she has to handle all sorts of things in the family...

261
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,820
for five straight years now.

262
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,559
I need think about how to give it back to them.

263
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,100
So you're going to quit?

264
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,000
I haven't decided yet.

265
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,880
Did it really cross your mind?

266
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,759
Listen. Don't even think about it.

267
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,680
Why? You can't bear to see me go?

268
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,580
It's annoying to find someone new.

269
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,319
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

270
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,539
Not admitting your true feelings.

271
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,685
People need to be honest about their feelings.

272
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,739
Isn't being stubborn tiring?

273
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,119
Admit that you're reluctant to let me go.

274
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,759
Fine, then.

275
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,119
I'm pleading with you.

276
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,619
Don't go.

277
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,519
The newbies aren't ready yet.

278
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,760
You can't just dump the responsibility on me.

279
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,000
I can let you take the credit, reward, and allowances

280
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,059
first from now on.

281
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,279
So generous?

282
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,039
Of course.

283
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,519
With our relationship?

284
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:25,560
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

285
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,079
Tomorrow's another full day of training.

286
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,579
How boring.

287
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,640
 I'm regretting this already. 

288
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,198
If I had the opportunity to quit now, I'd get a flight home immediately.

289
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,480
 Lower your voice. 

290
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,560
 Luckily, the squad leader isn't here. If he heard you... 

291
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,499
This is where you get to know what they're really thinking.

292
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,019
Listen.

293
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:56,240
 A close friend of mine passed the aviation test 

294
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,839
and is flying training aircraft at the aviation school every day.

295
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,000
But us?

296
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,920
All we do is water the plants

297
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,240
until we're dog-tired.

298
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,540
Exactly.

299
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,829
Xiao Ge.

300
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,599
Why did you join the brigade?

301
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,519
Me?

302
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,680
To save lives.

303
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,666
Bro, seriously?

304
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,107
I want to be like Captain Song.

305
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,000
Why are you laughing?

306
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,100
Annoying.

307
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,214
 Xiao Ge's girlfriend likes heroes. 

308
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,279
 She admires him a lot. 

309
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:33,240
 I've never even been into a burning building. What hero? 

310
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,200
 What's there to admire? 

311
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,839
Do you eavesdrop here often?

312
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,240
Trying to figure out what they're thinking is also part of the instructor's job.

313
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,399
You make eavesdropping sound so nice.

314
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,720
 I think the captain just went by. 

315
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,900
 The instructor too! 

316
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,319
Get your equipment and fall in. Squad leaders, take command!

317
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,319
Squad One.

318
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,319
Running march. March!

319
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,039
Squad Two. Running march. March!

320
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:09,239
One, two, one. One, two, one.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,700
Hi, Brother Chi.

322
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,599
Vice Captain.

323
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,499
Hi, Brother Chi.

324
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,519
Old Jiang.

325
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,400
The hospital called.

326
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,079
All tested negative. The follow-up appointment is in four weeks.

327
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,119
Really?

328
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,279
Thank goodness.

329
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,319
Let me tell you.

330
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,520
It's no longer about negative or not. I can't stand it anymore.

331
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,000
How many times did you throw up last night?

332
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Four.

333
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,799
- Junping. 
 - Brother Chi.

334
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,099
Big Liu.

335
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,200
- Where are you going? 
 - Sorry.

336
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,720
I just vomited, but you make me want to vomit again.

337
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,499
What? We make you want to vomit?

338
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,323
   

339
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,939
You're supposed to be resting.

340
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,739
Why aren't you in bed?

341
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,919
What is this for?

342
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,340
Is it to become a deserter?

343
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,440
You've applied for a transfer.

344
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,800
Why bother asking for my opinion the other day, then?

345
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,519
Who said, "No matter how heavy the burden, we must carry it together"?

346
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,739
Who was it that wanted to train the new people into great firefighters?

347
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:25,720
And who promised to make sure the Yancheng's Guardian Cup trophy

348
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,680
would remain at Shili Tai forever?

349
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,919
- Song Yan, Listen— 
 - Just tell me your plan!

350
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,704
Suo Jun,

351
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,384
you wrote the application behind my back.

352
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,940
What did I do that you wouldn't even consider me in this?

353
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,440
You didn't even discuss it with me!

354
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,960
Fine.

355
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,759
Even if you're not up for discussion, fine, but at least let me know about it!

356
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,580
We eat and sleep under one roof.

357
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,879
Why did you do this behind my back?

358
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,160
I wanted to talk to you about it,

359
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,920
but I thought you'd get too worked up so—

360
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,419
Yet you secretly wrote the application!

361
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:27,820
What? Did you plan to tell me only after you left?

362
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,339
Or were you just never going to tell me?

363
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,160
"Song Yan, see you later."

364
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,559
"Song Yan, bye-bye."

365
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,160
"Let's never see each other again!"

366
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,960
Was that it?

367
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,839
Remember the oath we took when we formed a team?

368
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,448
You forgot.

369
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,820
You forgot all of it,

370
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,559
abandoning your responsibilities and duties.

371
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,079
Right now, you're a deserter!

372
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,560
Song Yan,

373
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,900
I've never forgotten the oath we took,

374
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,059
and I'm not becoming a deserter.

375
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,240
But I have things to take care of.

376
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,340
You know,

377
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,739
after I transfer, that position pays an extra ¥1,200  (~$170). 

378
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:28,620
- I can... 
 - So it's for money?

379
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:32,999
Yes.

380
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,259
Take it that way, then.

381
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,320
Why push yourself to this extent, Song Yan?

382
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,979
Even if the Guardian Cup trophy isn't at our station, it can be kept by other fire stations.

383
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:50,119
We're all firefighters. We're all protecting the same city,

384
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,240
protecting the citizens together.

385
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:56,193
Why must it stay here?

386
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,559
Suo Jun,

387
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,620
fine, you can see the bigger picture.

388
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,200
You're right. Success doesn't have to depend on me.

389
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,300
The trophy is the whole station's honor.

390
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,019
But we're the warriors of Shili Tai, don't you know that?

391
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,615
You're leaving now.

392
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:38,495
Of course, this honor isn't important to you.

393
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,290
You can leave your teammates,

394
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,461
turn your back on the newbies...

395
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,840
and apply for a transfer

396
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,480
for ¥1,200 more in pay.

397
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,579
All right.

398
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,940
I won't stop you.

399
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,660
If you refuse...

400
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,560
to carry Shili Tai's flag...

401
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,800
I'll do it myself.

402
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,003
I'm getting days off after this week. What about you, Dr. Xu?

403
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:14,201
Me, too.

404
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,680
Do you want to hang out?

405
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,599
Sure!

406
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,849
I'd rather sleep.

407
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,938
We can do that together too.

408
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,200
Hello, this is the ER.

409
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,419
Got it.

410
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:33,440
Team Leader.

411
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
A patient is arriving: weak pulse,

412
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,960
unconscious and unstable vital signs.

413
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,240
- Get the resuscitation room ready. 
 - Okay.

414
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,599
Administer 1 mg epinephrine via IV.

415
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,899
Okay.

416
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,960
One milligram epinephrine via IV.

417
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:19,247
- Let me do it. 
 - Okay.

418
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,356
Defibrillator.

419
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,420
Check the IV access.

420
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:29,240
First shock, 200 joules.

421
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,740
Clear.

422
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,933
Three hundred joules.

423
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,750
Three hundred joules, confirmed.

424
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,576
Dr. Xu, the patient is resuscitated.

425
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,119
Don't relax yet. Stay focused.

426
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,619
Okay.

427
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:31,610
   

428
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,559
Is that it?

429
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,100
Isn't this too easy?

430
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,839
Pi Pi, while the seniors are busy putting out fires,

431
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,920
all we do is water plants.

432
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,359
What's the point? The difference is too big, isn't it?

433
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,100
Exactly.

434
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,319
We're repeating the same drill over and over.

435
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,739
How boring. It's not the real deal.

436
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,440
How long is this going to continue?

437
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,119
As if I know the answer.

438
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,919
Ask me!

439
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,039
- Captain. 
 - You can't even do the basics properly,

440
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,160
yet you're complaining?

441
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,240
Suit up!

442
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,129
Fall in!

443
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:24,729
 Yes, Sir! 

444
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,399
Let's go.

445
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,920
All of you,

446
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,880
suit up!

447
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,060
- Yes, Sir! 
 - Yes, Sir!

448
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,760
Let's do it then.

449
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,659
What's wrong with you?

450
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,159
Brother Chi.

451
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,499
You're eager to work on the front line and put out fires, aren't you?

452
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,840
Yet you can't even hold the fire hose steady!

453
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,240
Do you want to be a laughingstock or what?

454
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,719
You train every day.

455
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,099
And this is what you've got?

456
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,719
Look at every single one of you.

457
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,220
You want to be in the competition? You'll just embarrass Shili Tai!

458
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,519
Five detachments,

459
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,066
over a hundred participants,

460
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,679
nine events...

461
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,719
How are you going to compete?

462
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,619
What are you capable of?

463
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:28,080
Practice makes perfect.

464
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,394
You have to give them time to adapt.

465
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,880
You're giving them time?

466
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,280
Who is giving me time?

467
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,359
Who is giving us time?

468
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,400
Pack up everything and take a hot shower.

469
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,300
Don't catch a cold.

470
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,039
Squads, bring your stuff.

471
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,280
What's wrong with Captain?

472
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,139
He's never treated the instructor like that before.

473
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:14,099
He's scary.

474
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,000
The captain must be really disappointed.

475
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,080
Forget about it. Let's go.

476
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,480
   

477
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
Doctor, h-how did it go?

478
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,559
Don't worry. His heartbeat has already resumed.

479
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,599
It was a heart attack.

480
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,400
He's being taken for an angiogram right now. 
  (T/N: x-ray check of vessels' blood flow) 

481
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,679
He might need a stent.

482
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,559
You should discuss this among yourselves.

483
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,440
Great. This is great.

484
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,519
Thank you so much.

485
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,079
The patient is coming out soon.

486
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,079
- Please don't mind this. 
 - Thank you.

487
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,199
If you hadn't saved him, I don't know what I'd do.

488
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,480
Come and have a meal at our place.

489
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

490
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,760
Please wait here.

491
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,320
Thank you. Thank you.

492
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,079
Thank you for your hard work.

493
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,519
Thank you. Thank you.

494
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,019
Take care.

495
00:38:58,432 --> 00:39:00,380
He's coming out. Here he is.

496
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,480
- How are you feeling? 
 - Brother.

497
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,660
- Are you all right? 
 - How are you feeling?

498
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,819
Anything else?

499
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,667
No.

500
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,059
Dig in.

501
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,235
Are you three feeling better?

502
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,880
Much better.

503
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,119
All the vomiting was killing me. My stomach was going to dry out.

504
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,159
We're great but don't mention that word.

505
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,080
It weakens my legs.

506
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,880
Your legs were weak anyway.

507
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,159
Instructor,

508
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,320
I envy Captain Song for having that body.

509
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,239
He had the medicine and didn't experience any side effects.

510
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,019
That mean look of his can even scare the unlucky vibes away.

511
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
Looks like Captain is still angry.

512
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,800
That's for sure.

513
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,539
They won't be reconciling anytime soon.

514
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:23,080


515
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,590
