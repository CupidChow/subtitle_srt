2
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,663
   

3
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:37,431
   

4
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,307
   

5
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,120
 The door has been unlocked. Please come in. 

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,059
You go first. I'll go after you.

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,840
Mom.

8
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,959
We're back.

9
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,680
How did you two end up coming home together?

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,960
We ran into each other at the entrance. Where's Dad?

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,740
He's gone to Xiao Xiao's place. He'll probably stay there for dinner.

12
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,080
I was sweating in the car just now. I'll go upstairs and get changed.

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm going upstairs as well.

14
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,100
Hurry up.

15
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,619
Mom.

16
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,241
Where are my wood carvings?

17
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,360
I told the cleaner to get rid of them.

18
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,680
Why?

19
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,319
I told you before

20
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
that I dislike it when you mess with those things.

21
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
Wood shavings cover the floor. It's so filthy.

22
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,840
You're a girl. Can't you find a better hobby?

23
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,908
Mom, Qin Qin—

24
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,055
I don't like that you're a doctor either.

25
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,120
It's a hard and thankless job, plus you have to work overtime.

26
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
When you have a family,

27
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,480
how are you going to take care of them?

28
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Mom. I—

29
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:26,600
Auntie.

30
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,840
Xiao Xiao, you're here.

31
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,701
I'm here for a free dinner.

32
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,899
All right, you young ones chat.

33
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:45,119
What's wrong? Did someone get scolded again?

34
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:17,755
 - It's break time. Let's grab some food. 
 - Sure. 

35
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,519
Old Jiang!

36
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,019
Yes, Captain?

37
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,599
Who's in charge of trash disposal today?

38
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,959
Dapeng is on duty today.

39
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,199
I saw him go downstairs to take out the trash already.

40
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,201
Did you lose something important? I'll help you look for it.

41
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,839
I'm just asking.

42
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,760
Okay, it's fine. You may leave now.

43
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:48,720
If you decide to change cooks, inform me beforehand. I'll hire them for sure.

44
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,520
My mom is here.

45
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,519
You scared me!

46
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,759
Aren't you the one who's most afraid of her?

47
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,160
I recently opened a new bar.

48
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,220
Come to my place tomorrow. You two can relax a bit.

49
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,380
Mom.

50
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,079
Not again!

51
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,600
Are you in the habit of scaring me now?

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,639
Auntie is undeniably a big devil,

53
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,881
but she's also adorable. Am I right?

54
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:15,939
I was telling them that I hadn't seen you for days and missed you.

55
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,239
Here.

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,960
You two aren't observant at all.

57
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,160
Take a seat.

58
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,279
Yanchen,

59
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,000
you should learn from Xiao Xiao and get yourself a partner soon.

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,079
You all grew up together.

61
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,079
You should become a good influence on him.

62
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,000
What if he takes my advice but ends up finding someone you don't like?

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,439
If she's not good, of course, she's not acceptable.

64
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,841
If so, define what's good and what's not.

65
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,509
First and foremost,

66
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,279
never marry someone who's unequal in social status.

67
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,599
That's a big "no."

68
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,040
Here.

69
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,852
This is for you.

70
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,620
And this...

71
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,480
Oh, there are red envelopes. I want one, too. 
   (TN: usually filled with money) 

72
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,179
You don't need it.

73
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:08,995
Those are a few ladies I chose for you,

74
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,079
and those are a few men I chose for you.

75
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,720
Take a look and see if you set your eyes on any of them.

76
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,238
Then let me know.

77
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,939
Okay?

78
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,299
Got it.

79
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,099
Let's eat.

80
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:31,720
I don't want to bring this up,

81
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,787
but you two should come home more often.

82
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,160
It's a big house, yet it's so quiet.

83
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,760
Am I right?

84
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,759
Also, Qin'er,

85
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,759
you work at the hospital. It must be tiring.

86
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,720
Come to my bar when you're free. I'll open a bottle of good wine for you.

87
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,819
And you... You should come along, too.

88
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,720
Isn't Auntie trying to find you a partner?

89
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,000
My bar is full of pretty girls.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,580
- I can hook you up with them. 
 - Xiao Xiao.

91
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,179
Keep quiet when you're eating.

92
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,698
What are you looking for?

93
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,180
A lighter.

94
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,479
She gave it to you?

95
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,104
You carried it everywhere for the past ten years.

96
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,039
Since you care about her so much,

97
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,259
why did you two break up in the first place?

98
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,639
There's a huge gap between our families.

99
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,400
Her parents strongly emphasize social status and family background.

100
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,960
They think I'm not good enough for her.

101
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,279
I think I understand that.

102
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,720
You've been really hard on yourself all these years.

103
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,600
You always want to be first in everything.

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,120
You bear the honor and the mission on your shoulders.

105
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,719
I bet she's part of the reason.

106
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,292
I want to bring us closer together.

107
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:58,165
I've previously fantasized that one day,

108
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,467
if I meet her again,

109
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:06,094
I can stand proudly in front of her.

110
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,099
I'm fine.

111
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,126
For the past ten years,

112
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,928
I've always carried that lighter with me.

113
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,799
Don't you think it's weird?

114
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,475
She's here now,

115
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,199
but I've lost it.

116
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,140
For some reason, I feel empty inside.

117
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,979
I don't know exactly what happened between you two,

118
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,440
but I can tell...

119
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,739
you were badly hurt because of that relationship.

120
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,320
You've seen her anyway.

121
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,159
Since you don't want to bring up the past, you should let it go.

122
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,320
There's no need to search for some things once they're lost.

123
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,279
If you missed out on someone, there's no need to go back.

124
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,640
Don't live in the past.

125
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:15,480
Perhaps it's a sign from Heaven for you to let go of the past

126
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,550
and start a new life.

127
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,500
Help me out with this.

128
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
All of them look good.

129
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,540
Don't you think... they all look alike?

130
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,080
It seems their features have been refined.

131
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,220
They're not even close to you.

132
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,420
Jiang Yu?

133
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,400
He's a decent man. He's reliable.

134
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,320
Compared to Song...

135
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
he's way better.

136
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,434
What's wrong?

137
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,369
Can't I share my view without being asked?

138
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,519
I'm not afraid of your anger.

139
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,907
You two aren't compatible. It wouldn't work.

140
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,779
We always look at the past in a favorable way.

141
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,679
Actually, you're not in love with him.

142
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,919
You merely have regrets about the past.

143
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,940
It's human nature to feel like things we can't have are better.

144
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,993
- It's so late. Where are you going? 
 - The bar.

145
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,559
Welcome, pretty doctor. The bar owner is personally here to receive you.

146
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,600
Save your effort to coax your girlfriend instead.

147
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,599
- You're my one and only girlfriend. 
 - Get off.

148
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,720
You hit too hard!

149
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,559
She's rude. You should educate her.

150
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,720
Stop talking nonsense. Show us around.

151
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,292
All right. President Meng, this way, please.

152
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,427
Come on.

153
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,679
What do you think? Not bad, right?

154
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,019
Boss.

155
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,679
Bring me three glasses of Yamazaki 25.

156
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,960
- Okay, sure. 
 - Take a seat.

157
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,039
Here, Qin'er.

158
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,739
Take a seat.

159
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,839
I bought two floors in total. The upper floor is always crowded.

160
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,039
This floor is slightly quieter, though.

161
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,595
The view isn't bad, right?

162
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,840
It's not bad, indeed.

163
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,519
I didn't expect you to actually have good taste.

164
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,751
I learned it from you.

165
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,280
Qin'er, you should come whenever you're free.

166
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,960
What's wrong with you?

167
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,360
Are you new?

168
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,899
Haven't you received any training before?

169
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,080
Boss, she's newly hired. I'm really sorry.

170
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,720
Hurry, apologize.

171
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm sorry.

172
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,320
It's fine.

173
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,700
She's just a part-timer. I'll definitely talk to her later.

174
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:21,840
Thorough training and proper guidance are important, especially for part-timers.

175
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,564
This is a mistake in your work, got it?

176
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:26,066
I'm sorry. I'll pay more attention going forward.

177
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,579
The fire department will be here for an inspection later.

178
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,720
Please handle the reception. Be polite to them.

179
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,940
All right, I'll get back to it then.

180
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,919
You're really strict.

181
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,940
You're not just pretending for us, are you?

182
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,799
I'm serious and dedicated regarding work, okay?

183
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,934
I need to make a call.

184
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,299
It's not easy to hire employees these days.

185
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,060
Do you think she looks like Qin'er a bit?

187
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,459
Does she?

188
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,540
I think they look alike.

189
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,080
Do you regularly inspect the fire safety equipment here?

190
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,480
We do.

191
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,879
If there are any issues, remember to replace them promptly.

192
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,720
Don't worry. We'll certainly follow the regulations strictly.

193
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,260
Hello. Are you from the fire department?

194
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,019
Yes.

195
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,619
Fire inspections are typically conducted by firefighters, aren't they?

196
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,159
Fire inspections are under the fire brigade's jurisdiction.

197
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,660
Firefighters belong to Fire and Rescue and aren't in charge of inspections.

198
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,076
Show us the way to the emergency exit.

199
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:05,336
Sure. This way, please.

200
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,319
What are you thinking about?

201
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,519
Two days ago, I ran into Song Yan.

202
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,679
What does he do for a living?

203
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,066
Wait, let me guess.

204
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,519
Don't tell me he's self-employed, like me.

205
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,479
He's a firefighter.

206
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,759
Then what?

207
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,360
Did you chat and reminisce together?

208
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,380
How did the conversation go?

209
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,460
He ignored me.

210
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,640
So you feel a sense of regret?

211
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,720
Whether I did or didn't,

212
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,087
there's nothing I can do.

213
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,820
Life is full of regrets.

214
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,559
Even if people try hard and give their all

215
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,060
as if they've lost their minds, in the end...

216
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
no one can escape difficulties.

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,072
So many years have passed.

218
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,076
I can't believe you still like him.

219
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,919
I thought I didn't anymore.

220
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,386
But you couldn't control it once you saw him.

221
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,279
It seems your feelings for him flared up again.

222
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,880
It means you've never forgotten him.

223
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,995
Qin'er, the most tormenting thing in this world is to refuse to move on,

224
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,500
thinking that you can go back.

225
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,232
I've heard the story between you two.

226
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,319
I don't mean to be rude,

227
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,459
but if it was impossible in the past, it's even more impossible in the future.

228
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,640
Cheer up. Don't think about it.

229
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,279
Let's go. Let's grab some drinks.

230
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,220
Go ahead. I need to wash my hands.

231
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,819
 No peeping. 

232
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,759
Qin'er, where are you going?

233
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,499
Something came up at the hospital. I need to go now.

234
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,459
G-Go?

235
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,979
Not only did Qin'er leave, but she also lied.

236
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,319
- What's wrong? 
 - Do you know what Qin'er told me just now?

237
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,079
"Life is full of regrets."

238
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,279
"Even if people try hard and give their all..."

239
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,080
"no one can escape difficulties."

240
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,761
No one in their right mind would say that.

241
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,039
Life is short.

242
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,500
Being able to enjoy pleasures is already a great blessing.

243
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,720
Giving up what you already have to pursue something elusive and intangible

244
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,488
is not worth it.

245
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,599
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

246
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,620
May I ask if Song Yan works here?

247
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,200
May I ask who you are?

248
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,759
I'm... his former classmate.

249
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,359
Can you help me get in touch with him?

250
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,719
- Please wait a moment. 
 - Thank you.

251
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,359
Hello, Captain Song?

252
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,819
Someone's looking for you out front. She claims to be your former classmate.

253
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,319
May I know your name?

254
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,888
Xu Qin.

255
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,268
Her name is Xu Qin, Captain.

256
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,560
Sure.

257
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,240
I'm sorry. Captain Song isn't in today.

258
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,519
Where did he go?

259
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,780
He probably...

260
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,940
went out for training.

261
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,540
Thank you.

262
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,119
- Li Cheng. 
 - Yes, Staff Officer Li?

263
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,960
I have a meeting with the detachment captain in a little while.

264
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,426
Pass the dog food to Captain Song, okay?

265
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,252
Sure.

266
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:03,399
- Thanks. 
 - Don't mention it.

267
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,979
- All right, get back to work. 
 - Take care.

268
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:54,539
Just go ahead and see her if you want.

269
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,279
Xiao Meng.

270
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,779
Good boy.

271
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,939
You and Xiao Meng have a deep bond.

272
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,400
Obviously.

273
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,280
I raised him.

274
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,000
Dogs are loyal.

275
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
Like owner, like dog.

276
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,100
Why do I feel like you're implying something?

277
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,219
I'm implying that you're loyal.

278
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,276
Get lost.

279
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,180
   

280
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,399
Are you sure you don't want to see her?

281
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,200
Why should I see her? She's not someone important.

282
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,580
 - I'll feed you some delicious food. 
 - So good! 

283
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,079
 Brother Yan, you're off work. 

284
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,720
 Brother Yan! 

285
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,079
When will you take us for a ride on the fire truck?

286
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,640
 We want a ride on the fire truck! 

287
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,921
- I'll take you when you're older, okay? 
 - No way!

288
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,359
We're grown up now!

289
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,939
Hurry, come here. Stop pestering Uncle. 
  (TN: not biological, but respect for the generation above) 

290
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,599
Hurry.

291
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,679
- Hello, Uncle Zhao. 
 - You're back from work.

292
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,279
- Grandpa. 
 - Leave Uncle alone.

293
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,559
- Let's play chess together. 
 - One for each of you.

294
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,720
- Don't forget to thank Uncle. 
 - Thank you, Brother Yan.

295
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,039
Thank you, Brother Yan.

296
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,979
Brother Yan is unbeatable!

297
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:16,255
- Uncle Zhao. 
 - What?

298
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,216
Well... you're losing.

299
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,093
Exactly. That's why I need your help. Come on.

300
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:23,497
 - Brother Yan, keep your promise!  
 - Definitely!

301
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,380
 Auntie, I'm back. 

302
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,200
You're finally home!

303
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,568
You haven't eaten yet, right?

304
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,559
Do you have beef noodles?

305
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,960
Sure. Come here.

306
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
Why are you carrying so many things?

307
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,620
- I bought some fruit. 
 - Hurry.

308
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,840
It's ready.

309
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,960
Here. Have some pickled vegetables too.

310
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,060
They make it flavorful.

311
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,640
Here you go.

312
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,119
Is it delicious?

313
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,905
I've missed this a lot.

314
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,900
X-Xu Qin came here looking for you.

315
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,982
It seems you've met her.

316
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,340
Are you still in love with her?

317
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:24,839
I can't hate her enough.

318
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,140
Hatred doesn't arise without love.

319
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,240
I really don't like her.

320
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,481
I'm annoyed just seeing her.

321
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:33,260
You swear?

322
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,268
Then I can stop worrying.

323
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,759
Listen,

324
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,559
a wise man doesn't dwell on the past. 
  (TN: a good horse doesn't eat grass it's walked past) 

325
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,859
Don't forget how much hardship you went through because of her.

326
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,440
I'm still angry thinking about it now.

327
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,019
She was too much.

328
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,156
How does she have the audacity?

329
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,319
She even came looking for you.

330
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,199
How brazen.

331
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,751
Auntie, can I have some garlic?

332
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,880
Are the pickled vegetables not enough? You still want garlic?

333
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,903
My uncle used to tell me,

334
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,319
"Eating noodles without garlic is like missing half the taste."

335
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,860
All right, fine. I'll get some right away.

336
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,240
 Relax. Calm down. 

337
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,227
 Here, have some fruit. 

338
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,039
 Get some vitamins. 

339
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,765
 - Thank you, Auntie. 
 - Don't mention it. 

340
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,399
 This girl is so pretty. 

341
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,176
 Make sure you take good care of her. Eat more fruit. 

342
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,519
 Don't be shy. Eat more. 

343
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,695
 She's really beautiful. 

344
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,720
 Is it sweet? 

345
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,420
 Keep eating. 

346
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,619
 My uncle and aunt are really nice. 

347
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:24,580
 They won't eat you alive. 

348
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,754
 Are you following me to the washroom? 

349
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,620
 Let me show you something. 

350
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
 There you go! 

351
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,919
 One more! 

352
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:54,920
 Song Yan, I love spending time at your place! 

353
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,219
 Don't just say that for fun. 

354
00:27:57,219 --> 00:28:00,139
 Do you dare join my household register? 

355
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:01,500
 I, Song Yan, promise 

356
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,859
 that I'll only care about you for the rest of my life. 

357
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,440
 You! At this stage, you should focus on your studies only! 

358
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,240
 Qin Qin got into such a great university, but you're still retaking classes. 

359
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,860
 Be careful. She might not like you. 

360
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,517
 Do you not like me? 

361
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,472
 Do you not like me? 

362
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,738
 - Do you really not like me? 
 - She definitely doesn't! 

363
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,039
 - Your uncle and aunt are really nice. 
 - Right? 

364
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,519
 Your home and this small courtyard are also very beautiful. 

365
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,519
 If only I had a beautiful courtyard like yours at home. 

366
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,359
 I'd definitely stay at home every day and not go out. 

367
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,779
 Eat it now, or it'll melt soon. 

368
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,639
 I don't like eating Popsicles. 

369
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,620
 It's not clean at all. 

370
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,559
 A little dirt never hurt anyone. Eating it means you're less likely to get sick. 

371
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,660
 Take it. 

372
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,072
 Why is your family's car over there? 

373
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,207
 Come on, let's go. 

374
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:34,907
 Song Yan. 

375
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:42,699
 Don't look for me in the future. 

376
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:47,060
 I used to play with you... because I found it exciting. 

377
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,260
 But I've thought it through. 

378
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,119
 We were never meant to be together in the first place. 

379
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,680
 Our paths won't cross in the future either. 

380
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,279
 If you continue fooling around, 

381
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,140
 you won't succeed in life in the future. 

382
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,320
 Xu Qin, 

383
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,939
 is your family against our relationship? 

384
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:17,459
 No one is against it. 

385
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,185
 I just don't want to lie to you anymore. 

386
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,440
 Once the novelty wore off, 

387
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,039
 it became boring. 

388
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,400
 Tell me the truth! 

389
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,821
 Did your parents force you to say this? 

390
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:29,379
 No one forced me. 

391
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:31,639
 Your place is run-down and dilapidated. 

392
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:35,860
 I don't like your place at all. 

393
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,327
 Don't contact me anymore. 

394
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,590
♫  There are the words that were left unsaid  ♫

395
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,010
♫  I've missed so much about you,  ♫

396
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,400
♫  wasn't with you every day and through the seasons  ♫

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,270
♫  But I still wait for you here  ♫

399
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,219
 Xu Qin! 

400
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,359
 Xu Qin! 

401
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,459
 Stop! Xu Qin! 

402
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,830
♫  I'm sorry I failed to protect our fragile relationship that year  ♫

403
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:25,560

404
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:32,110
♫  Who left a mark on my heart, a beautiful scar that won't fade away?  ♫

405
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:38,780

406

♫  I still remember the nameless flower you placed in my hand  ♫

407
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,660
♫  Who was the one that made promises in the heat of that summer?  ♫

408
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,000
♫  Who was the one that made promises in the heat of that summer?  ♫

409
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,800
   

410
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,510

♫  That summer, you were the wish I was hoping would come true  ♫

415
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,179
Assistant Director Liu.

416
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,899
Xiao Xu, are you off work?

417
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:17,211
How is it? Are you adapting to the hospital lately?

418
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:18,419
I'm doing quite well.

419
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,160
Great. If you need any help, come to me. I'll sort it out for you.

420
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,880
Great. If you need any help, come to me. I'll sort it out for you.

421
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,319
Don't worry. Everything is going well.

422
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,619
All right, that's good.

423
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:27,000
I ran into your mother two days ago.

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,303
Please send her my regards.

425
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:31,160
- Sure. 
 - Okay, get off work, then.

426
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,880
- Old Xu... 
 - Department Chief Xu.

427
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,859
He looks unhappy every day, as if someone owes him money.

428
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:40,559
That guy...

429
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,647
Assistant Director Liu, I'll get going then.

430
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,886
- Okay, sure. Take care. 
 - Will do.

431
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,680
 A red alert for heavy rain has been issued. 

432
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
 From tonight until early tomorrow morning, 

433
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,039
 there will be extremely heavy rainfall throughout the city. 

434
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,359
 Citizens are advised to prioritize safety when traveling. 

435
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,960
 Production units are advised to take precautionary measures in advance 

436
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,000
 to prevent any loss of property or assets. 

437
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,380
Xiao Ge, come down!

438
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,159
It's raining too hard.

439
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,099
Today's training concludes here!

440
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,599
Tong Ming, put the ladder away!

441
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,659
Check the flood control equipment!

442
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,079
Thoroughly inspect all the equipment.

443
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,760
We can load the vehicles once clean-up is almost finished.

444
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,060
Okay.

445
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,280
Bring the kayak over here for inspection.

446
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,100
Instructor, rainy weather can help reduce the risk of fire, right?

447
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,119
Why are you so nervous?

448
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,199
Sometimes, rain can be more troublesome than a fire situation.

449
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,239
Hurry and change your clothes. Don't catch a cold.

450
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,300
- Okay. 
 - Got it, Instructor.

451
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,780
Hello?

452
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:06,519
I have a feeling that your day off might be—

453
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,319
 Got it. I've already returned to the team. 

454
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,360
I didn't see this coming.

455
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,320
Your holiday is over just as it started.

456
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,960
The night has just begun.

457
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,639
Hello, Dr. Xu.

458
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,320
The heavy rain has caused many emergency cases.

459
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,119
Department Chief Xu said all staff members should report for duty.

460
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,080
All right, got it.

461
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,928
   

462
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,199
Hello, is this 119?

463
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,719
 Hello, this is 119. Please go ahead. 

464
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,480
My car has been flooded. I'm unable to open the door.

465
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,027
 There is no window breaker in the car. I can't get out. 

466
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:10,619
 Don't panic. Could you please provide your exact location? 

467
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,663
I'm at the Songmen Bridge underpass.

468
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,920
 Okay, we have firefighters near your location. 

469
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,269
 Notification has been sent to them. Please keep your phone line open. 

470
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,920
Help me!

471
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,780
Help!

472
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,020
Help!

473
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,681
 Help! 

474
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,652
 Help me! 

475
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,919
Help!

476
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,560
Help!

477
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,200
I'm here!

478
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,199
I'm here!

479
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,920
 Help! 

480
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,440
I'm here!

481
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,330
Help!

482
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,480
I'm here!

483
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,119
Captain, the water here is too deep!

484
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,819
Slow down!

485
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,760
Captain, I'll go to the back and help lift the car.

486
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,119
Come out!

487
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,879
Let go of me.

488
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,480
Believe it or not, I'll throw you into the water.

489
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,952
Bring me the clothes!

490
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,519
Do you know how many accidents have occurred

491
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,860
within a 5-km radius in the past hour?

492
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,800
The Red Rainstorm Signal has been declared. Why didn't you stay at home? 
  (T/N: Highest alert level) 

493
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,336
What on earth are you doing here?

494
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,130
The hospital has called us back urgently.

495
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,519
Captain.

496
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,639
Find a place to take shelter from the rain!

497
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,819
Did you try so hard because you knew I was in the car? It was so dangerous.

498
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,900
I would've done the same to rescue a dog trapped in a car.
