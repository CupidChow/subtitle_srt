1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,880


2
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:35,262
   

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,164
   

4
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,067
   

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,860
You still can't forget her?

6
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,040
She's long forgotten.

7
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,079
I didn't even say who.

8
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,040
Why are you so eager to admit it?

9
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,059
Is it that female doctor?

10
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:54,559
No.

11
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:57,719
I don't believe you.

12
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,549
I saw you two chatting.

13
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,249
I don't know her.

14
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,979
You say one thing but mean another.

15
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,580
What are you laughing about?

16
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,795
I'm happy.

17
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,964
It's good that you're no longer single.

18
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,240
Now that you're taken, I can set my wedding date.

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
What are you thinking?

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
You go ahead and get married.

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,540
Why wait for me?

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,980
How come that sounded a bit heartbreaking?

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,580
An ex-girlfriend?

24
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,943
I guess that means yes.

25
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:44,446
She looks quite pretty and has a good presence.

26
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,746
So why did you two break up?

27
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,079
Time for night shift patrol.

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,140
Wait up. I'll go with you!

29
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,219
 Try it. 

30
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,619
 It's sour. 

31
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,609
 Yet sweet. 

32
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,944
 This taste... 

33
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,979
 It's amazing. 

34
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,699
 Try one. 

35
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,625
 If you don't like it, I'll pay with my life. 

36
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,739
 Amazing. 

37
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,339
 Isn't it? 

38
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,617
   

39
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:22,155
   

40
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,315
   

41
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,899
 - Reporting.  
 - Come in!

42
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,879
You put out the fire at Wufang Street.

43
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,779
You made a meritorious achievement.

44
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,720
These tea leaves look pretty good. How come I haven't seen it before?

45
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,220
Put it down!

46
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,986
Get over here!

47
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:58,325
Forget the tea leaves.

48
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,527
Forget all the commendations or recognitions, you can put them aside.

49
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,610
I just received three complaints.

50
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,889
Three!

51
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
The first one, the associated organizations complained that

52
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,879
you were uncooperative.

53
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,079
You were brusque and rough.

54
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,000
Second!

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
The general public complained about your bad attitude

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,020
and that you damaged his car.

57
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,040
Third.

58
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,079
Your peers complained that you disregarded the instructor's orders.

59
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,121
You were uncooperative, had a bad attitude, and you didn't obey your instructor.

60
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:31,439
You...

61
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,959
Aren't you...

62
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,040
Aren't you going to explain yourself?

63
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,360
The car should be removed. That person deserves to be beaten.

64
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,702
If I'm incompetent, I deserve a reprimand.

65
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:45,021
If you don't like me, just reassign me elsewhere.

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,519
Do you think I don't dare?

67
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,240
You keep making trouble for me every now and then.

68
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,079
Every month, there's something new.

69
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,000
Division Chief Gao.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,789
You tell me!

71
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,399
Division Chief Gao, don't get worked up.

72
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,959
I've looked into the situation.

73
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,240
The situation was dire.

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,319
Comrade Song Yan and the comrades from Wufang Fire Station

75
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,879
had a bit of a disagreement on the plan of action.

76
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,003
They went ahead with Song Yan's method and managed to prevent the fire from spreading.

77
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,938
Regarding the car removal,

78
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:22,179
they couldn't reach the owner of the car who parked his car on a fire exit.

79
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,969
Song Yan handled it that way to ensure they reached the fire as quickly as possible

80
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,749
and to minimize damages to the public's well-being and property, am I right?

81
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,600
You always come up with all sorts of reasons to cover him.

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,759
Division Chief Gao, you always say this.

83
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,639
"The scene of a fire is like a battlefield."

84
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,279
There are many variables working on the frontline.

85
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,439
It's hard to please everyone.

86
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,200
If Song Yan hadn't insisted on going ahead with his team,

87
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,539
the little boy and girl wouldn't have been saved.

88
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:58,619
Fine. I won't pursue the other two complaints.

89
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,900
As for the removal of the car, that's clearly a bad image for our firefighters.

90
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,079
It has to be resolved.

91
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes! Make him write a report!

92
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,720
I submitted one last time. You want me to write another?

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,600
That means it was not good enough.

94
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,419
Do it again.

95
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:12,392
Write it!

96
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,094
Three thousand words!

97
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,639
Not a word less.

98
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,780
For every word you miss

99
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,610
you will be fined ¥1,000  (~$140) .

100
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,679
Song Yan!

101
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:31,439
Song Yan!

102
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,120
I heard that a couple of gas tanks exploded at the scene.

103
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,252
It was precarious.

104
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,654
I'm not nagging at you,

105
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:44,220
but can you not be so reckless when something happens?

106
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,019
Saving lives is important, but don't neglect your own safety.

107
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,359
Now, I get anxious whenever your team goes on a mission.

108
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,080
Thanks for your concern, Boss.

109
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm leaving.

110
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
I...

111
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,300
That new doctor, Xu Qin, is pretty amazing.

112
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,039
I heard she will be getting the spot on the research team.

113
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,159
Based on what?

114
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,039
Just because she studied in the US?

115
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,119
She's still a rookie. Does she have the experience?

116
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,759
That's why she was assigned to the ER.

117
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,000
After some time, she'd be put on the research team.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,519
It may not seem justified, but you can't really name any problems.

119
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,733
I guess it's a special admission.

120
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,879
In my opinion, it's about time for you to get the spot.

121
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,240
You're older than her and more experienced.

122
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,476
But unfortunately, she has backing.

123
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,012
If you need backing for that spot, then everyone should go find one.

124
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,320
Who doesn't have connections and backgrounds?

125
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,360
Her background is special, though.

126
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,279
I heard her last name is Meng.

127
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,420
She changed it in order to keep a low profile.

128
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,480
Meng? And the name?

129
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,559
Guo Kun Group.

130
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,879
For real?

131
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,480
Her dad is Meng Huaijin?

132
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,919
That's what her profile said.

133
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,199
I saw it when I was processing her onboarding.

134
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,759
So the handsome and aristocratic guy who picks her up from work every day

135
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,879
is the young master of Guo Kun Group?

136
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,399
So she's untouchable, and has car services every day.

137
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,474
 The thought of having to work with a person who relies on connections frustrates me. 

138
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,958
If you don't want to work with me,

139
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,427
I can talk to the management for you.

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,800
Should I?

141
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,500
   

142
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,519
Brother!

143
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,120
You got a new car?

144
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,600
It's your car.

145
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,899
I got it for you.

146
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,220
What do you think? Do you like it?

147
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,300
Director Meng, your taste is getting better.

148
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,859
What can I do?

149
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:12,679
You won't go home and you don't allow the chauffeur to drive you.

150
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,399
Mom worries about your commute.

151
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,270
Give it a try. I'll change it if you don't like it.

152
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,019
Thanks.

153
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,039
The road ahead is closed due to an accident inside the tunnel.

154
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,619
Please take another route.

155
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,679
Okay. Is anyone injured?

156
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,039
The car got badly smashed.

157
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,960
I presume the driver is hurt pretty badly.

158
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,500
The ambulance will be here soon. Please don't block the road.

159
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,519
- Got it. 
 - Thanks for your cooperation.

160
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,868
You're off duty.

161
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,559
But I'm still a doctor.

162
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,819
The ambulance will be here soon.

163
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,000
The longer we wait, the more dangerous it is for the victim.

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,700
Brother.

165
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,059
Stay safe.

166
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,220
Hey there.

167
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,880
I'm a doctor. Do you need assistance?

168
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,279
I have a doctor here who can help. Should I let her in?

169
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,700
 Let her through. 

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,712
Got it.

171
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:51,412
Come with me.

172
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,240
The ambulance is finally here.

173
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,720
We won't trouble you then.

174
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,836
It's no trouble.

175
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,236
Thank you.

176
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,199
Move it away.

177
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,759
Lift him up.

178
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:17,383
Instructor, the vice captain is not here yet?

179
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,260
No, he's on duty at the station.

180
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,023
Good work, guys! Come grab some food.

181
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,519
Five minutes!

182
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,639
Take turns to eat.

183
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,671
You can't eat because of your toothache. Drink some soup instead.

184
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:47,007
How is it?

185
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,359
Are you feeling better?

186
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,159
You went back and came out again?

187
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,380
I just want you to eat up and go back to rest early.

188
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,437
   

189
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Hello?

190
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,679
I've eaten.

191
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,019
We had a mission to carry out today.

192
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,559
I know.

193
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,759
I'll hurry up.

194
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,619
The approval for the detachment has to follow procedures.

195
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:39,579
Give me a bit more time, okay?

196
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,539
Let's talk later.

197
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,559
Are you hiding something from me?

198
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,500
No, nothing.

199
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,079
We sleep and eat together every day.

200
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,951
Do you think I wouldn't notice something is wrong?

201
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,799
I think you're thinking too much.

202
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,080
Fine.

203
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,559
I won't ask.

204
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,019
You can tell me when you're ready.

205
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,000
   

206
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,744
 For the Emergency Department, 
   

207
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,000
there has to be at least one professional training a week. 
    

208
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,119
We will focus on the treatment of critically ill patients.

209
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,119
For example, basic rescue techniques in treating

210
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,519
acute heart attacks, strokes,

211
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,459
shocks, and others.

212
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:19,200
So while you are expected to carry out your responsibilities,

213
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,960
we have to establish strong teamwork.

214
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,839
In order to increase the success rate of emergency care

215
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,000
by administering precise treatment, the department has decided

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,279
to separate the Red Zone into A and B, two emergency response teams.

217
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,720
Based on the type of patients, we'll carry out the treatment according to the conditions.

218
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,851
Do you understand?

219
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,119
 Yes. 

220
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,359
Yellow Zone and Green Zone may go.

221
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,480
Conduct your rounds.

222
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,180
Red Zone, please stay back.

223
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,880
We have decided to separate Red Zone into two teams.

224
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,839
For Team A,

225
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,759
Yang Sijia will be in charge.

226
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,799
Okay.

227
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,000
For Team B, Xu Qin will be in charge.

228
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
You're free to choose your own team members.

229
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,480
I'll leave that to you.

230
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,500
It will benefit your operations.

231
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,680
Okay?

232
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,559
Department Chief, I'll go to Team A.

233
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
Department Chief, I'll join Team A, too.

234
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,319
Department Chief, I also want to join Team A.

235
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,259
Count me in, Department Chief.

236
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,759
Department Chief, that means my team is full.

237
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,739
Let's go with that, then.

238
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,160
- Dr. Xu. 
 - Dr. Xu.

239
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,039
- Let's do the best we can. 
  - Do our best! 

240
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,739
Get to work.

241
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,300
Get to work.

242
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,800
Get to work.

243
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,200
Gear up.

244
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Ready!

245
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,839
Report! I'm done!

246
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,840
Report! I'm done!

247
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,240
- Report! I'm done! 
 - Report! I'm done!

248
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,160
Zhan Dapeng!

249
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,279
Pi Shaojie!

250
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,319
Tang Jie!

251
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,359
You failed!

252
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,960
You three. Take everything off and start over.

253
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,741
Got it!

254
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,442
Yes, Sir.

255
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,259
Ready. Focus!

256
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,640
- Report! Done! 
 - Report! Done!

257
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,563
You failed!

258
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:06,582
Captain, I put everything on according to the squad leader's instructions.

259
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,060
Is it secured?

260
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,799
When you enter the fire scene, your breathing apparatus might get snatched. Do you know that?

261
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,720
Captain, somebody is going to steal my breathing apparatus?

262
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,440
Have you not heard of people trying to save someone from drowning

263
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,079
but ended up drowning themselves due to being dragged by the victims?

264
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,279
Firefighters have lost their lives because of that.

265
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,059
Make sure you wear your breathing apparatus securely.

266
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,340
There's something called instinct

267
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,179
in human nature.

268
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,080
Gather around.

269
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,279
If your dream is to become a firefighter, step forward.

270
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,879
Form a line.

271
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,160
I want to hear the truth.

272
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,759
Why do you want to be a firefighter?

273
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,240
Report, Captain! Because I want to save lives!

274
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,839
I want to save the common people!

275
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,359
Report, Captain! I think firefighters are the greatest!

276
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,700
Report, Captain! I think being a firefighter is an honorable occupation!

277
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,440
Is that what you really think?

278
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,079
A few days ago, in the Wufang Street fire,

279
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,640
I received complaints.

280
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,484
The fire station got complaints, too.

281
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,279
Some people said

282
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,955
that our attitude was bad while maintaining the crowd in order at the scene.

283
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:14,560
Last month, Yang Chi and his team saved a kid in the sewer.

284
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,160
They were covered in filth.

285
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,799
The stench lingered even after three days.

286
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,680
Jiang Yi.

287
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,880
He left his mom and is away from home.

288
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,799
Because of his duties, he hasn't gone home to see her in two years.

289
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,580
After hearing these stories,

290
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,739
do you still wish to be here?

291
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,879
Are you happy to put on this gear?

292
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,230
The firefighting gear is not as comfortable as you think!

293
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,699
Complaints.

294
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,100
Grievances.

295
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,659
No one understands the efforts you put in.

296
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:51,523
It's part and parcel of being a firefighter.

297
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,079
But why are there still hundreds of thousands of firefighters

298
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,680
who dashes out at the first sound of the alarm, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day?

299
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,900
Take a look.

300
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,089
Tell me.

301
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,000
What do you see?

302
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,328
I see the bustling streets of the city.

303
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:26,160
I see towering buildings and parks.

304
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,386
I see residential buildings filled with warmth.

305
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,300
I hope

306
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,480
you have a clear view

307
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,351
and a clear understanding.

308
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,060
Why do we train so hard every day?

309
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,280
It is to protect people's everyday lives.

310
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,119
 Hurry up, will you? 

311
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,979
 Wait up. 

312
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,780
 Song Yan, this is vandalism. 

313
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,599
 It's fine. 

314
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,972
 This wall is part of the cultural corner on Wufang Street. Graffiti is fine. 

315
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,839
 Well? How is it? 

316
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,259
 Look at what you wrote. 

317
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:58,280
 You don't get it? 

318
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,739
 If you smile, 

319
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:05,480
 the son city. 

320
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,979
 If you smile, the sun fills the city. 

321
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,330
♫  Deep down, I long to say "I'm sorry"  ♫

322
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,960
♫  I'm sorry I missed so many wonderful years  ♫

323
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,630
♫  I still like it after all these years  ♫

324
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,340
♫  The feeling of being liked by you  ♫

325
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:49,160
♫  As I look at you, I see some differences  ♫

326
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,880
 You must be dumb. 

327
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,759
 Look. 

328
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,140
 It's not "o," but "u." 

329
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,860
 You wrote "son" instead of "sun." 

330
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,599
 So how are you going to explain this? 

331
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,799
 If you smile, the son fills the city. 

332
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:17,390
♫  Memories filled this empty room  ♫

333
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:23,730
♫  Your shadow is fading away on this lonely street  ♫

334
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:31,960
♫  This city is lingering with nostalgia  ♫

335
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:40,160
♫  Waiting in a city for that one person  ♫

336
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,520
♫  I've gone in circles before standing in front of you  ♫

337
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,310
♫  Love feels like our first encounter, waiting for us to return to the beginning  ♫

338
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,380
♫  Back to that very day  ♫

339
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,488
   

340
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,840
 Who is it? 

341
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,340
 Who is it? 

342
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,620
What are you doing here?

343
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,907
Zhai Miao?

344
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,910
You've grown up so much.

345
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,743
Why are you here?

346
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,680
I’m here to find Song Yan.

347
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,440
Song Yan? What for?

348
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
You still have the audacity to come here?

349
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,319
Have you forgotten what you did?

350
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,920
Whatever. I don't want to talk to you.

351
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,449
- He's not here. 
 - Wait! Zhao Miao.

352
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,160
When will he be back?

353
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,720
That's none of your business.

354
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,279
Miss Xu, my cousin is living a good life right now. He might be getting married next year.

355
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,699
So leave him alone, will you?

356
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll thank you for that.

357
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,580
Zhai Miao!

358
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,239
Auntie.

359
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,660
Song Yan doesn't live here anymore.

360
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,680
Then where does he live?

361
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,455
Could you tell me?

362
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,400
He's usually at the station.

363
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,319
He doesn't come back often.

364
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,400
Mom, what's the matter?

365
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,599
She looked like a tortured soul.

366
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,839
Do you think I was too harsh on her?

367
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,440
You call that being harsh?

368
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,580
If it were me, I'd say worse things to her.

369
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,079
Why would I do that?

370
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,839
Why? Did you forget what she did to my cousin?

371
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,980
I've never met anyone more evil than her.

372
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,179
How dare she come here.

373
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:24,079
Didn't she go overseas to study? How come she's back all of a sudden?

374
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,919
I wonder why she needs to see your cousin.

375
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,440
Maybe she feels guilty.

376
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,039
With that cold and aloof attitude of hers, it'd be hard not to dislike her.

377
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,559
Only my dumb cousin would consider her a gem.

378
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:37,969
Now that she has realized no one likes her,

379
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,799
she remembers how well my cousin treated her.

380
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,319
I was wondering why your cousin has been acting so strange lately.

381
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,079
Do you think he still likes her?

382
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,240
No way.

383
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,680
My cousin must hate her to the core. How could he still like her?

384
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
You have no idea.

385
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,519
These past years, I've tried to set him up on many blind dates.

386
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,480
He either said he was too busy to go, or he wasn't interested after meeting them.

387
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,039
There's no way.

388
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,396
Even if my cousin will be single all his life, he cannot be nice to her.

389
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,133
Did he forget how much he suffered because of her?

390
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,133
This is...

391
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,804
This won't do. I'm going to talk some sense into him.

392
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:13,319
- He likes being tortured, huh? I won't have... 
 - Wait!

393
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,779
Young lady. Stay out of your cousin's business.

394
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,800
Stop shaking your leg. Go study!

395
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,954
Doctor, my baby got burned. Please treat her quickly.

396
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,314
Did you get a number?

397
00:32:04,314 --> 00:32:05,600
You need a number for emergency care?

398
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,920
Yes, you need to register for emergency care too.

399
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,240
What a stupid hospital. I got burned to this extent!

400
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,519
Sir, please register her.

401
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,079
Or else the system cannot issue her prescription.

402
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,720
Fine. Wait for me.

403
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,440
Please wait outside. Thanks.

404
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,340
Please wait outside.

405
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,879
- Get the medicine first and then get her an injection. 
 - Okay.

406
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,680
Next time you get bitten by a dog, you can go directly to the CDC.

407
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,000
No need to come to the general hospital.

408
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,300
Okay, thanks.

409
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,559
Doctor, quick!

410
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,119
Please take a look.

411
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,978
I've got a big red patch from the burn.

412
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:42,928
How did it happen?

413
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:45,000
I accidentally got burned by the hot water.

414
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Did it just happen?

415
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,119
I registered. Here.

416
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,540
It's all right. Let me give it a blow.

417
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,759
Will it leave a scar?

418
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:00,044
Don't worry. Relax.

419
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,440
Here, this is the prescription.

420
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,680
Go take the medicine as prescribed.

421
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,160
That's it? That's all?

422
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,961
Your wound is not serious. You'll be fine after using the topical cream for three days.

423
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:09,960
But it's a huge red patch!

424
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,881
- Dr. Xu. 
 - Yes?

425
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:12,995
This firefighter is injured quite badly. Please take a look.

426
00:33:12,995 --> 00:33:14,519
Check him.

427
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,980
Doctor.

428
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,640
Go to the debridement room and get ready for sutures.

429
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,599
Doctor! What about my wife?

430
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,720
I gave you the prescription, didn't I? Just get the medicine stated there.

431
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,519
You barely checked for a minute.

432
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,660
Your injury is nothing serious. Use the prescribed medicine and it'll be fine.

433
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,359
Did you really treat my wife's condition?

434
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,659
It was barely 10 seconds.

435
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:37,300
I don't have time to argue with you right now.

436
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,466
Let's go.

437
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:41,631
Stop right there! So you're not treating my wife, are you?

438
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,279
Are you being rough on a woman? Didn't your parents teach you better?

439
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,720
Who are you? I'm looking for her.

440
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,799
Are you done?

441
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,419
Let go of my husband!

442
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,960
Remember your job. Don't just stand here and ogle.

443
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,659
Go and get your medicine.

444
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:01,379
Let's hurry.

445
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:02,879
I'll wait here.

446
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,960
Hang in there. I'll inject the anesthetic soon.

447
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,100
Thanks, Doctor.

448
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,039
Let me clean you up.

449
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,399
Come. Lift your arm.

450
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,400
Don't move around.

451
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,120
This hand is fine. I can do it myself.

452
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,559
No, this hand is still swollen.

453
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,519
It's dirty. I can't let you do it yourself.

454
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,039
What happened to your arm?

455
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,179
Someone tried to jump off a bridge.

456
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,440
Thank goodness nothing bad happened. We saved him.

457
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,199
Wasn't there any ambulance on the scene?

458
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,719
I didn't see one. My colleague just bundled me up and brought me here.

459
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,960
You should make a complaint if no ambulance went there.

460
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,559
Wait a minute, Dr. Xu. The ambulance and us are under the same roof.

461
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,779
Right.

462
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:52,559
When calamity strikes, we're all in the same boat.

463
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,320
There's no reason to point fingers.

464
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,919
You doctors and us firefighters, we're all family, right?

465
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,360
It's tough for all of us.

466
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,940
I'm injecting the anesthetic.

467
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,160
Please be gentle. I don't like needles.

468
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,819
Where were you just now?

469
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,627
That man was being unreasonable and was about to hit the doctor. Didn't you see?

470
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,100
It wasn't like that. I was...

471
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,580
If I hadn't come, would you have let her get beaten up?

472
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,900
No way, Boss.

473
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,000
Anyway, nothing happened.

474
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,480
I'm not your boss.

475
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,100
You're my boss.

476
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,700
Hey...

477
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,520
Hang on.

478
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,600
Do you know that doctor?

479
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,440
No, I don't.

480
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,200
If you don't, why are you so worried about her?

481
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
- How is it, Old Jiang? 
 - I'm all right.

482
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,239
Thanks, Doctor.

483
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,760
Pay the fees and then get the anti-inflammatory medication.

484
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,160
Got it. Thanks, Nurse and Doctor.

485
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,370
Are you looking for someone?

486
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,770
Our captain just left. He went that way.

487
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,420
Go get your medication.

488
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,254
Thank you.

489
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:29,440
We'll be off then. Thanks, Nurse.

490
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,240
Are you okay?

491
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,739
I'm taking over, Dr. Xu.

492
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,199
Song Yan!

493
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,799
Song Yan.

494
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,940
What’s the matter?

495
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,860
Well...

496
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,360
Long time no see.

497
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,040
Yes, pretty long.

498
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,180
Have you been well the past years?

499
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,780
Not too bad. And you?

500
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,319
Not good.

501
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,703
Is there anything else?

502
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,480
Thanks for just now.

503
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,435
I did it for my buddy.

504
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:43,697
And regarding last time...

505
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:47,160
Xu Qin, what do you want to say?

506
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,859
Do you have time to have a cup of coffee?

507
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,340
Do you?

508
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,039
Many people want to treat me to coffee.

509
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,839
You need to get in line.

510
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,259
I'll call you when it's your turn.

511
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:24,739
   

512
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:26,304
   

513
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,559
 I hope you will think of me every time you want to smoke. 

514
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,480
 Song Yan, I don't like it when you smoke. 

515
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,160
 My mom won't like you smoking, either. 

516
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,719
 I'll stop. 

517
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,820


518
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,450
 "Fireworks of My Heart" - Na Ying 

519
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:02,250
♫  In the glow of lights and fireworks, homes are guarded  ♫

520
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:08,120
♫  Amidst the hustle and bustle, one gazes in awe  ♫

00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:14,130
♫  Is it destiny to embrace and break what is predestined?  ♫

522
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,010
♫  If life was a lie  ♫

523
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,900
♫  Those hardworking folks in the high rises and street alleys  ♫

524
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,840
♫  May you let life bloom  ♫

525
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,720
♫  Farewells and goodbyes to the loved ones or the strangers  ♫

526
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,170
♫  May you arrive safely  ♫

527
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:48,980
♫  Without asking where the road ends, is it worth it?  ♫

528
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,790
♫  Being alive is a kind of greatness  ♫

529
00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:00,760
♫  Even if it's like dust, drifting in the wind  ♫

530
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:08,540
♫  I'm searching for the answer to happiness  ♫

531
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,060
♫  For those who are young and single  ♫

532
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,030
♫  Have you found the one for you?  ♫

533
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:21,670
♫  Invited to the passion of never-ending summer  ♫

534
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,890
♫  The brave one can venture alone  ♫

535
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,880
♫  Cross the abysses and cliffs  ♫

536
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,770
♫  Doesn't matter if it's painful stepping on flames   ♫

537
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:39,740
♫  The ones who are lost in the story, have they found their home yet?  ♫

538
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:45,550
♫  Whispering sweet words under the light, yearning for you  ♫

539
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:58,870
♫  Without you under the firework, this home is incomplete  ♫
