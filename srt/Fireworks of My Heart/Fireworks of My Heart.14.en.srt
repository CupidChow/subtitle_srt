it's abdominal closed internal injury.

162
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,860
We should transfer her to General Surgery

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,180

164
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,390

166
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,610

when she was admitted to the hospital.

170
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,700
The ultrasonic diagnosis shows

171
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,880
there is hydrops in her abdomen.

172
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,060
The conservative treatment

173
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,360
can easily lead to big problems.

174
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,890
We performed abdominocentesis for her.

175
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,120
Her blood can still coagulate.

176
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,140
The ultrasonic diagnosis also shows

177
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,220
there's not much hydrops in her abdomen.

178
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,410
The capsule of the spleen is complete,

179
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,620
which means the spleen is normal.

180
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,960
But according to the ultrasonic diagnosis,

181
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,310
there is hematoma underneath the liver capsule.

182
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,670
This is also a kind of hepatic rupture.

183
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,020
But it's toxic encephalopathy

184
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,380
due to

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,930
a large amount of poisonous gas.

186
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,230
The hematoma underneath the liver capsule

187
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,140
is not the main crux.

188
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,580
You're taking a risk.

189
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,290
In this situation,

190
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,580
I think the exploratory laparotomy

191
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,420
is the safest.

192
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,870
The exploratory laparotomy

193
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,060
is indeed the safest.

194
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,340
But now,

195
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,130
the hematoma underneath the liver capsule

196
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,950
is very stable.

00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,600
to meet him.

585
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,570
As long as you want to meet him,

586
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
there's always time.

587
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Thank you.

588
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,940
Look.

589
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,340
Now,

590
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,840
you can finally meet her.

591
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,160
Yes.

592
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,800
You two busy people

593
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,960
can finally meet each other.

594
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,790
It must be fate, right?

595
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,790
Uncle.

596
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,850
I've just arrived at the fire station.

597
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,310
I still have

598
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,560
a lot of work to do.

599
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,280
Sorry.

600
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,900
If you can go down, you can also go up.

601
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,930
Working at the grass-roots units for a few years,

602
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,880
you'll have a bright future.

603
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,480
Thank you.

604
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,820
I'm flattered.

605
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,750
I have no

606
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,630
great ambition.

607
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,590
I'm content to be able

608
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,630
to do something

609
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,650
at this job.

610
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,180
Young people nowadays

611
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,030
are aiming too high.

612
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,890
There are very few people

613
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,460
as down-to-earth as you.

614
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
I'm flattered.

615
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,830
Have some tea.

616
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,880
You did a great job just now.

617
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,850
I came here in a hurry.

618
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,670
I didn't prepare anything.

619
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,470
We just talked about work.

620
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,100
My dad would think

621
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,500
your family is simple

622
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,670
and you're determined to pursue a career,

623
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,010
without being punctilious.

624
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,130
Don't praise me like that.

625
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,040
I haven't achieved anything.

626
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,740
Not even close.

627
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,610
In my dad's eyes,

628
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,900
you are diligent

629
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,120
and modest.

630
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,290
Do you like me?

631
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,440
I think you are nice.

632
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,040
But I wouldn't think about love.

633
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,990
Because we got to know each other

634
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,580
too hastily.

635
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,540
Besides,

636
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,900
I have someone I like.

637
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,120
Your parents are against it?

638
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,150
What do you want to do?

639
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,520
Do you need my help?

640
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,440
Your husband...

641
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,350
He is working in the government.

642
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,470
It's not convenient for him to come out.

643
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,250
He asked me to say hello to you.

644
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,230
I'm sorry.

645
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,820
Since it's fate,

646
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,050
let's meet more often.

647
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,060
We should

648
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,890
meet more often.

649
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,480
Yes.

650
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,590
You two

651
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,880
should meet more often, too.

652
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,770
Since I work at the fire station,

653
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,550
it's not easy to ask for leave.

654
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,790
It's not realistic

655
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,210
for us to meet each other often.

656
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,460
My son is straightforward.

657
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,540
Don't you have holidays?

658
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,330
During the holidays,

659
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,740
you can meet each other more often.

660
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,720
Mom, I want to sleep whenever I rest.

661
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,020
It's hard for me to meet you.

662
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,050
Why would I meet someone else?

663
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,190
Good.

664
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
Young people

665
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,910
should practice more

666
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,580
so that you can do great things in the future.

667
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,430
But I have no great ambition.

668
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,270
I just like

669
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,560
working at grass-roots units.

670
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,570
I'm content

671
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,710
to do what I like.

672
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,250
Let's...

673
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,300
Let's talk while eating.

674
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,550
Jiang, you need to drive today.

675
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,710
You can't drink the wine.

676
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,060
Please.

677
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,750
Thank you.

678
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,490
Here.

679
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,500
Please.

680
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,490
OK.

681
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
What a pity.

682
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
You and Jiang are so close.

683
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,620
If these two kids can be together,

684
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,650
it will be of great help

685
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,350
to our company.

686
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,880
Look at them.

687
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,980
They're well-matched together.

688
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,460
Well,

689
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,290
Jiang has a good son.

690
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,700
He's quite reliable.

691
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,580
But I don't think

692
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,220
he has any feelings

693
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,620
for Qin.

694
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,690
This won't do.

695
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,120
He has no ideals

696
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,850
and no sense of responsibility.

697
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,080
Look at our two kids.

698
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,920
They're dependable

699
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:57,890
and obedient.

700
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,310
What's wrong with you today?

701
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,830
Why are you being so rude?

702
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,150
I'm telling the truth.

703
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,520
Don't you like Xu Qin?

704
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,790
She's nice.

705
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,530
But her mother doesn't like me.

706
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,790
She likes you and Dad.

707
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,690
Her mom wants you

708
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,590
to go further

709
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,950
in your career.

710
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,030
What development?

711
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,400
Is there a problem with my job?

712
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,500
Isn't it a blind date?

713
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,340
Why do they care about my career?

714
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,239
You are really angry.

715
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,730
I rarely see you like this.

716
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,030
I'm not angry.

717
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,650
The person who will be with me in the future

718
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,900
has to accept my job first.

719
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,130
[Xu Qin]

720
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,640
[Xu Qin]

721
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,040
You and your brother

722
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,520
are both troublesome.

723
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,490
What was wrong with him

724
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,700
on his birthday?

725
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,520
You know?

726
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,830
He was drinking here

727
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,760
and had a fight with others.

728
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,460
He really

729
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,810
impressed me a lot.

730
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,890
Did you quarrel with him again?

731
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,840
Because of Song Yan again?

732
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,700
What's going on

733
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,060
between you and Song Yan?

734
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,540
Are you being together again?

735
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,950
No.

736
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,600
Are you playing a drama?

737
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,290
Can you

738
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,970
stop shilly-shallying?

739
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,920
You have plenty of opportunities and options.

740
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,100
Live a happy life.

741
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,000
Isn't that good?

742
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,120
Can you stop mentioning it?

743
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,870
I've finally calmed down.

744
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,060
Qin.

745
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,180
Since you are

746
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,470
so reluctant,

747
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
just give it a try.

748
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,400
After that,

749
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,570
even if you were broken-hearted,

750
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:15,890
you could still come back

751
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,110
and listen to your mother.

752
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,310
You would have no regrets then.

753
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,630
It's just

754
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,450
a relationship.

755
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,680
Relax.

756
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,640
You're just taking it

757
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,980
too seriously.

758
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,520
He's not that kind of person

759
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,920
who just gives it a go.

760
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,950
He's not willing to do that?

761
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,100
No way.

762
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,480
Me neither.

763
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,230
If it's just

764
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,310
a casual relationship,

765
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,280
I can date anyone,

766
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,150
except him.

767
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,960
Why?

768
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,780
If it fails,

769
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,650
it will destroy

770
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,760
all the old memories.

Is it that important?

777
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,170
Yes.

778
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,040
♫I still like you after so many years♫

779
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,960
It's very important.

780
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,660
♫I like being loved by you♫

781
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,800
♫Look at you♫

782
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,640
♫You've changed♫

783
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,080
♫You've become mature♫

784
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,870
♫You've been looking forward to♫

785
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,870
♫Having a happy ending♫

786
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,260
♫I was brave♫

787
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,150
♫But you didn't show up♫

788
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,440
♫We can only recall the past in an empty room♫

789
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:54,050
♫I stood on the lonely street and watched you walk away♫

790
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:01,760
♫This city is full of regrets♫

791
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,670
♫I'm waiting for you in this city♫

792
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,860
♫I go around and try to look for you♫

793
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:22,920
♫It's like love at first sight♫

794
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,090
♫Let's go back to that day♫
