00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,127
   

3
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:40,179
   

4
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,009
   

5
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,288
   

6
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:52,928
   

7
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,400
Waiting for me? Listen, I'm the best at making dumplings!

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,840
Old Yang, did you wash your hands?

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,801
- What's the filling? 
 - Pork with chives.

10
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,560
- Wash your hands and peel the garlic. 
 - Am I unhygienic?

11
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,739
- Quick. 
 - Am I?

12
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,039
Xiao Ge, chop up your filling more.

13
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,213
Captain, in my hometown,

14
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,960
we eat ham instead of dumplings at the beginning of the hot season.

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,174
In the north,

16
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,610
we eat dumplings to begin the hot season and noodles in the middle period.

17
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,591
Let's eat a lighter diet to remove the heat.

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,468
I'm sure we'll have a hot meal today.

19
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,819
- There's no fire alarm yet. 
  - Hey! 

20
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,520
Shut your foul crow-like mouth.

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,500
Stop jinxing it.

22
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,139
What's wrong with crows?

23
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,200
Crows are the most dutiful birds in the world.

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,419
Enough.

25
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,719
Where's the garlic?

26
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,960
It's over there.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Come on.

28
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,419
Vascular forceps.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Stop the bleeding.

30
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,280
Vascular forceps.

31
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,400
One more.

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Another one.

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,304
Press the bleeding spot.

34
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,319
Hold it.

35
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,719
Suture.

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
Hi, this is 119 Command Center. 
  (T/N: emergency number for fire department) 

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,605
 Hello. 

38
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,149
 An asphalt truck overturned at Xinghua West Street. 

39
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:04,280
An asphalt truck is overturned at Xinghua West Street.

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,113
Are any people trapped at the scene?

41
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,000
 There are two people trapped in the truck. 

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,919
Two people are trapped.

43
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,719
Please leave your name and contact details.

44
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,560
 My surname is Dong, and this is my phone number. 

45
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,710
Okay, we'll be on our way. Please keep your phone on.

46
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,160
 An asphalt truck overturned at Xinghua West Street. 

47
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,439
 Emergency rescue. Send one vehicle from Squad One and Squad Two immediately. 

48
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,739
Let's go.

49
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,200
Captain, I'll eat the dumplings for you!

50
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,321
   

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm sorry, so sorry.

52
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,879
- I'll wipe it for you. 
 - It's all right, Auntie.

53
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,360
Let me wipe it.

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,385
Really, it's okay.

55
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,720
I'll take care of it myself.

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,323
Dr. Xu, thank you for your hard work.

57
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,879
- Thank you for your hard work, too. 
 - Don't mention it.

58
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,940
Don't overexert yourself. Get more rest.

59
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,749
Hi, Doctor. Please check on him.

60
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,839
Which one of you is unwell?

61
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,721
- Him. 
 - It's him.

62
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,000
Come on, sit down.

63
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,680
Hurry up.

64
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,695
What's wrong?

65
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,560
He has a toothache. It hurts so badly.

66
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,000
   

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,120
I can't treat a toothache. You need to go to an outpatient clinic.

68
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,219
"Outpatient clinic"? The clinic is closed. When does it open?

69
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,075
Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.

70
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,399
So we have to wait a whole night?

71
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,720
Doctor, we didn't make ourselves clear.

72
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
He doesn't have a cavity.

73
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,199
He hit his tooth while on a mission, and it hurts like hell.

74
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,839
Please take a look.

75
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,339
Yes, right.

76
00:06:59,318 --> 00:06:59,920
Fine.

77
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,980
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

78
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,260
Okay, take off your mask.

79
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,401
It's all right. Thank you.

80
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,740
- Why don't you want to get treated? 
 - Captain.

81
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,120
Aren't you in a lot of pain?

82
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,767
- I'm sorry, Doctor. Thank you. 
 - Thank you, Doctor.

83
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,541
 Captain, aren't you in a lot of pain? 

84
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,160
Captain. 
    

85
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
Since you're here, just let the doctor check.

86
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,681
Right.

87
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,879
We're here already. Have it looked at.

88
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,339
Weren't you in a lot of pain just now?

89
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,720
Old Jiang, isn't that the doctor from just now?

90
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,241
- Yes. 
 - It is.

91
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,260
Why did she come after us?

92
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,740
Let's go.

93
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,520
   
   

94
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,519
 Song Yan. 

95
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,999
 Song Yan! 

96
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,500
 Song Yan. 

97
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,639
 Song Yan. 

98
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,819
 Song Yan. 

99
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,039
I can't get the stains off my fingernails. What's going on?

100
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,520
This doesn't work.

101
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,679
Toothpaste. Try the toothpaste.

102
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,879
Will toothpaste work? Give me some.

103
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,039
Give him extra.

104
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,725
Enough. Don't waste it.

105
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,399
- Rub harder. 
 - Brother Chi.

106
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,679
Brother Chi, try this.

107
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,379
Toilet bowl cleaner?

108
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,720
Are you kidding me? Isn't this for cleaning toilets?

109
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,000
This is a good stain remover. Try anything we have here.

110
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
Why should I?

111
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,080
If not, it won't come out.

112
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,360
Brother Chi.

113
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
- Brother Chi. 
 - It won't work.

114
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,219
Brother Chi.

115
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,279
I just searched online, and there's a folk remedy.

116
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,119
- What is it? 
 - What folk remedy? Tell me.

117
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,279
Boy's urine.

118
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,600
It's said to be very effective.

119
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,480
 Boy's urine? 

120
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,159
- Where can we get this? 
 - Well...

121
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,700
Who has it?

122
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,940
- Captain. 
 - Captain?

123
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,996
Captain has never been in love?

124
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:46,440
You've been here a long time but haven't heard of the four rules of Shili Tai?

125
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,320
Captain has never been in love.

126
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
The instructor's girlfriend can hardly wait to get married.

127
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,240
Jiang Yi is precise in jinxing things.

128
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,600
Jun Ping's muscles are well-built.

129
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,999
- Instructor. 
 - Instructor.

130
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,008
- Instructor. 
 - Instructor.

131
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,012
You startled me. Why did Captain pass on his bad habit

132
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,279
of beating people behind their backs to you?

133
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,559
If he finds out you're badmouthing him behind his back, he'll beat you even harder.

134
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,221
Don't tell him.

135
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,829
- Where is he? 
 - He's in the garage.

136
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,459
Use this. It works.

137
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,459
Metal scrub brush.

138
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,000
It'll rub off my skin, won't it?

139
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,519
- Try it. 
 - Try it?

140
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,020
- Try it! 
 - Stop it!

141
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,679
What are you thinking about by yourself?

142
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,166
Is your tooth better?

143
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,659
It's all right.

144
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,079
Here.

145
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,460
Go to the dentist tomorrow.

146
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,340
Come on, take the medicine.

147
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,860
Drink slowly. Don't choke.

148
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,360
What are you looking at?

149
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,759
Are there words on my face?

150
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,140
I think you have something on your mind.

151
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,367
What could I have on my mind?

152
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,799
We eat and sleep together every day.

153
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,980
I can tell whether you have something on your mind.

154
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,998
   

155
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,134
Zhan Dapeng, that's a failure!

156
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,619
Zhan Dapeng.

157
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
What's your problem? Pick it up.

158
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,559
No!

159
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,680
What's wrong with you?

160
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,279
Pick it up.

161
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,360
I'm protesting!

162
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,080
We're here to be firefighters, not special forces!

163
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,856
Are you trying to bully us, newcomers, with all these new trainings every day?

164
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,840
What's your problem?

165
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
If you want to do this, do it. If not, get lost!

166
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,120
- Pick it up now! 
 - No!

167
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,320
Pick it up!

168
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,280
- Stop it! 
 - Will you pick it up or not?

169
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,159
Zhan Dapeng!

170
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,909
What's going on?

171
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,000
Report, Captain and Instructor.

172
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,879
The training is too tough!

173
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,279
Climbing the rope in 22 seconds

174
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,350
and taking a ladder to the 4th floor in 20 seconds...

175
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
Our station's pass standard is higher than any other station's excellent standard!

176
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,011
It can't be done!

177
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,039
We do all sorts of new training all the time.

178
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,720
There are also punishments for failing to meet performance standards.

179
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,969
It's completely inhumane.

180
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,239
Is it impossible?

181
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,605
   

182
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,040
Ready.

183
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,120
   

184
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,810
   

185
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,580
That's 19.88 seconds!

186
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,840
How many?

187
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,399
It's 19.88 seconds.

188
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,799
This isn't even Captain's best time.

189
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,223
At last year's provincial competition,

190
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:07,245
the record of 18.5 seconds was broken by Captain.

191
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,564
Zhan Dapeng,

192
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,300
take a good look.

193
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,041
Who's hands on the team don't look like this?

194
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,419
This is a training ground, not a playground.

195
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:46,960
Shili Tai never produces cowards.

196
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,979
Report! I'm not a coward!

197
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,000
Tell me,

198
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,920
what is the duty of a firefighter?

199
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
To put out fires.

200
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,699
It's to rescue people from fires and dangers!

201
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:07,200
You have to use extraordinary strength, intelligence and will power

202
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,620
to race against time and the God of Death!

203
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
You whine when you sweat a little and get moody when you have a hard time.

204
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,279
A loser like you is combustible when thrown into a fire.

205
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,392
You can't even save yourself!

206
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,508
You even cry when I criticize you.

207
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,712
Can tears put out fires?

208
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,200
Remember this!

209
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,759
You have to be worthy of this uniform when you put it on!

210
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,759
 Yes, Sir! 

211
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,359
Yes, Sir!

212
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,079
Keep training.

213
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,644
Hello?

214
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,440
 Ms. Xu, I'm the property manager, Xiao Qi. 

215
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,550
 There's a fire at Wufang Street right beside us. It's smoky. 

216
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,853
 Keep your doors and windows closed. 

217
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,480
 There's no need to be afraid. 

218
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,079
 The fire started at the west end of the old street. 

219
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,619
 It's quite a distance from our neighborhood. 

220
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,799
Has anyone been hurt?

221
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,920
 I heard there are. 

222
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,365
 Anyway, the fire is rather big. 

223
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,268
 The rescue team is on its way. 

224
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,871
I got it.

225
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,720
- Mom! 
 - The ambulance is here!

226
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,619
Mom, come here!

227
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,100
Come here! Come here!

228
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,099
Whose car is this?

229
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,119
Whose car is this?

230
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,060
Why is this car parked like this?

231
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,160
Captain Song!

232
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Captain Song, this car is blocking the road.

233
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,559
The owner can't be reached.

234
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,445
I keep calling him, but no one answers.

235
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:22,559
How far are we from the scene?

236
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,519
Around 500 meters.

237
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,481
Is anyone trapped?

238
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,100
Many people still aren't out yet.

239
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,960
Hello?

240
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay, I'll be right there!

241
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,240
Captain Song, I'll go with him first!

242
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,139
- Flip it. 
 - Pardon?

243
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:36,139
What? Wait for it to burn to the ground first?

244
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:37,640
Get down and flip the car.

245
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,480
Captain, this is a sports car.

246
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
- Do it. 
 - Do it.

247
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,642
I'll be responsible if there's a complaint.

248
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,039
Flip it then, flip it.

249
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,919
Quick! Quick!

250
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,019
Hurry up!

251
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,920
 One, two, three. 

252
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,439
 One, two, three! 

253
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,719
- Get on the truck. 
 - Yes.

254
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,463
Old Jiang, roll out the water hose and prepare to save lives.

255
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,440
Yes, Sir!

256
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,119
- Find a water supply! 
 - Yes, Sir!

257
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,400
Yang Chi, get the new members to stand guard outside!

258
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,480
Okay.

259
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,599
Pi Pi, Xiao Ge, Dapeng, stand guard outside and set up a cordon.

260
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,589
- Yes, Sir. 
 - All right.

261
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:48,960
So we're here for nothing?

262
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,640
When can we go into the fire?

263
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
Don't even think about it. We can only do some basic tasks now.

264
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,599
- Let's get to work. 
 - Let's go.

265
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,400
Everyone, please stay away. Please cooperate. Thank you.

266
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,299
I'm...

267
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,160
I'm a doctor.

268
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,639
Follow me.

269
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,480
Pi Pi, Xiao Ge, Dapeng, evacuate the crowd! Hurry up!

270
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,800
- Quick! 
 - Captain.

271
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,160
What's the situation inside?

272
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,319
The fire has begun to spread inward.

273
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,079
Large vehicles can't get in at all. I can only use two water guns to stop the fire.

274
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,480
Also, I sent a rescue team inside.

275
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,200
Okay!

276
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
Li Bin, you're in charge of controlling the fire.

277
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,079
Our team will cooperate with the search and rescue.

278
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,020
You can't!

279
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,519
The building was full of safety hazards to begin with.

280
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,839
Under these circumstances, a large number of people inside searching

281
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,799
would be too dangerous.

282
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,273
The area burning right now

283
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,559
is homes of brick and concrete. It's not under control yet.

284
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
Look there and here.

285
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
There are old wooden buildings on both sides.

286
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
The humidity is low right now.

287
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,279
It'll be too late once the fire has spread.

288
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,000
By then, the affected area will be twice as large or even larger than it is now.

289
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
It's highly likely to be completely out of control.

290
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,920
I agree with the team going in for search and rescue.

291
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,819
Okay.

292
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,880
Be safe.

293
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,759
Shili Tai, follow me!

294
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,000
The stairs are blocked.

295
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,960
The bottom roof is confirmed to be accessible.

296
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,660
Over the wall!

297
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,079
Step back a little, step back.

298
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,079
- Please stop looking. 
 - Quit looking!

299
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,080
Please move back.

300
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,719
Move back.

301
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,480
Calm down.

302
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,761
Get the person in charge here!

303
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,440
Mister, Madam, you're not allowed in.

304
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,759
Madam. Madam.

305
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,880
It's really dangerous.

306
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,799
Mister, Madam.

307
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,559
We're concerned for your safety.

308
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,200
Your location is too close to the scene. It's very dangerous.

309
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,921
Please understand. Come on. Thank you. Please move back.

310
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,880
Why are you so slow?

311
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,240
We called 119, and it took so long for you to come.

312
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,319
Mister, Madam, w-we arrived on the scene as fast as we could.

313
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,440
You took a long time to get here!

314
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,780
My house has burnt to a crisp already!

315
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,000
Here's how it works. Our response time is strictly regulated.

316
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,119
If there really is a problem, we're responsible for it.

317
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:01,839
Please move back. Please cooperate with us.

318
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,880
Please cooperate.

319
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:09,581
Everyone, disperse!

320
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,640
Xiao Ge, move the cordon further back!

321
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,759
Please cooperate with firefighters!

322
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,759
Move back!

323
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,480
Step back!

324
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,440
Everyone, move back!

325
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,999
Song Yan, Song Yan.

326
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,000
 What's going on in there? 

327
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,119
A gas tank exploded.

328
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,279
Why? Are you afraid I might die?

329
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,359
 Don't worry. 

330
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,758
 I can't bear to leave you on your own. 

331
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,759
Can you be serious?

332
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:34,925
Instructor Suo,

333
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:38,480
there are 50 to 60 households in there, each one with a gas tank.

334
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,240
Song Yan, lead the team downstairs immediately.

335
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,640
Song Yan, lead the team downstairs immediately!

336
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,800
 Please respond when you receive the instruction. 

337
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,079
This is the last floor. We'll withdraw after the search.

338
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,899
 Song Yan, listen up. 

339
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,846
The rooms in this building are all partitioned into small rooms.

340
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,160
If every room had a gas tank,

341
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,359
even if you had ten lives, they won't be enough!

342
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,759
 I'm ordering you, as the field commander, to withdraw immediately! 

343
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:05,160
Roger. I'll withdraw right now.

344
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,839
Song Yan, Song Yan, what's the situation inside?

345
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,404
Cover them with water guns. Third floor!

346
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,839
I found someone trapped!

347
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,220
 Jiang Yi, Jiang Yi, assist Song Yan on the third floor. 

348
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,820
Roger!

349
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,420
Pliers!

350
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,180
Go to the doctor!

351
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:20,499
Song Yan, Song Yan.

352
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,300
Are you okay?

353
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,640
The trapped person has been rescued.

354
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
Be careful!

355
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,119
Have you finished searching up there yet?

356
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,680
Two rooms to the west haven't been searched.

357
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,960
Leave it to me. Hurry!

358
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,360
Okay!

359
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,439
Doctor!

360
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,700
Doctor!

361
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,079
Doctor, how is she?

362
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,559
She has suffocated.

363
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,145
Song Yan, get out of there!

364
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,748
Withdraw!

365
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:52,960
 Mommy! Mommy! 

366
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:03,000
Don't be afraid. I'll get you out of here.

367
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,835
Song Yan, Song Yan, what's going on inside?

368
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,600
Song Yan, Song Yan, respond!

369
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,100
Song Yan, are you injured?

370
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,599
Song Yan!

371
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,319
I was wrong. I'm wrong.

372
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,799
Sorry to have worried you. I'll be mindful next time.

373
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,759
I promise.

374
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,229
You disobeyed instructions and seriously violated rescue procedures!

375
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,359
Don't be like him.

376
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,279
We need to brave the fire and the danger,

377
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,240
but good safety precautions are a prerequisite, got it?

378
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,319
 Got it! 

379
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,719
Got it!

380
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,939
- Yang Chi. 
 - Yes.

381
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:53,519
- Jiang Yi. 
 - Yes.

382
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,960
- Liu Junping. 
 - Yes.

383
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,400
- Tong Ming. 
 - Yes.

384
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,480
- Gao Yu. 
 - Yes.

385
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,680
Instructor, all are present!

386
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,954
Who turned my car over?

387
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,039
I did.

388
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:14,480
Your car was parked illegally and blocked the fire escape route.

389
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,440
I just bought the car! How could you flip it?

390
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,740
Hey, why are you hitting people?

391
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm their instructor.

392
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,079
Speak to me if you have a problem.

393
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,163
We cleared the fire escape route in accordance with relevant regulations.

394
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,980
If you have any issues,

395
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,760
you can go to—

396
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,800
Do you know how much my car costs?

397
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,360
You flipped it just like that?

398
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,240
Because your car blocked the fire escape route,

399
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,639
it took us an hour to put out a 10-minute fire,

400
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,850
and 28 homes burned!

401
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,100
Do you think this is reasonable?

402
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,099
If I were you, I'd be hiding.

403
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:46,819
Come on,

404
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:49,287
give me your name.

405
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:53,100
Shili Tai Fire and Rescue Station, Yanbei District,

406
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,700
Song Yan.

407
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,479
Just you wait!

408
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,280
All right, pack up and leave now.

409
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,439
Do you know that female doctor?

410
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,330
♫  Watch the sun slowly descends  ♫

411
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:42,300
♫  Settling in the corner of your gaze, my heart finds it's entrance/i&gt; ♫ 

412
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:49,300
♫  Under the last ray of light, I'm desperately chasing after the stars  ♫

413
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:57,060
♫  I'm not willing to let go of the radiant past  ♫

414
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:04,330
♫  Thank you navigating through the passage of time, and settling in my heart  ♫

415
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:11,430
♫  I bravely bear countless scars, untouched by fear  ♫

416
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:19,970
♫  As I take determined steps towards you, please give me an answer  ♫

417
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:26,010
♫  Admist the lights in countless homes, does one belong to me?  ♫

418
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:53,866
 Is she a new student? 

419
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:00,020
 Who let you in here? 

420
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,052
 Get out! 

421
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,320
 I'd like to meet the new student. 

422
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,900
 Get out. 

423
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,760
 Old Lu, why are you so fierce? 

424
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,563
 Don't scare the new student. 

425
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,722
 Get out and stand there properly. 

426
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,100
 Quiet down, everyone. 

427
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,299
 This is a new transfer student. 

428
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:22,639
 Please tell us about yourself. 

429
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,957
 Hi, everyone. My name is Meng Qin. 

430
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,159
 What are your hobbies? 

431
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,380
 I don't have any hobbies. 

432
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,519
 Then it's time for the question session. 

433
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,588
 What would you like to ask? 

434
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,799
 Which Meng? Which Qin? 

435
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:46,619
 Meng, meaning "highest in rank", and Qin, meaning "seeping into the heart." 

436
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,600
 What a good girl. 

437
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,106
 Song Yan! 

438
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,010
 Get back to your place! 

439
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,150
   

440
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,982
 Let me introduce myself. 

441
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,480
 I'm Song Yan. 

442
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,380
 Yan, meaning "flame." 

443
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,459
 Why are you so quiet? 

444
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,879
 Can you talk to me? 

445
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,180
 Give it to me. 

446
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,079
 Xu Qin? 

447
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,170
 Isn't your last name Meng? 

448
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,939
 Stand up! 

449
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,820
 Good morning, Teacher. 

450
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,099
 Good morning. Sit down. 

451
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,860
 Open to page 87 of your textbook. 

452
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:21,128
 Let's think about the question we left in the last lesson. 

453
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,332
 Xu Qin. 

454
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,619
 Hi, I'm Song Yan. 

455
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,059
 Song Yan, I'm Xu Qin. 

456
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,904
