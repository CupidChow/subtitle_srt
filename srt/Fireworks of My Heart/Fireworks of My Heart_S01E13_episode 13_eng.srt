2
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:34,270
   

3
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,078
   

4
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,964
   

5
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,359
Fired, just like that?

6
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,560
Brother Ding, you're at the top of the list.

7
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
Brother Ding, all the work you've put in 
    

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,760
over the years is wasted. How could they do this?

9
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,140
What should I do now?

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
Old Ding.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,240
What's happened?

12
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,479
Brother Yong.

13
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,840
My mom is in the hospital. My wife has to care for our two kids.

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,159
I'm the family's sole breadwinner. Now I've been fired.

15
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,800
How will my family survive?

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,159
Calm down first.

17
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,859
Calm down. We'll figure out a way.

18
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,559
What do I do?

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,220
This is too unfair.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
- My kids are waiting for me. 
 - They fired us just like that.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
- That can't be right. 
 - Yes!

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,719
We worked hard for so many years, right?

23
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,080
How are we supposed to live now?

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
My fellow workers.

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,960
At this time, we must stand together.

26
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Only when we stand united can we get our due recompense.

27
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,479
We don't want to fight for nothing.

28
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,080
So we have to remain united.

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,879
Yes, we have to be united.

30
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
Guys, we have to be united. Stand united!

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
Yes, stand united!

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,329
 - Stand united!  
 - Okay, stop. Don't make a scene.

33
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,365
Don't make a scene.

34
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:23,120
That's good. Seeing everyone's vigor makes me more confident about winning.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,439
President Meng,,

36
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:28,000
the man named Song Zhiyong leads the group of laid-off employees,

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,159
rallying at the office every day.

38
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,560
They're demanding labor compensation.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,639
They said they won't stop otherwise.

40
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,919
Their leader, Song Zhiyong,

41
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,140
is as shameless as one could get.

42
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,840
How much are they asking?

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,980
In total, it's about 1.8 million.

44
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,199
How about this?

45
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,319
Let Human Resources negotiate with them again.

46
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,740
If that's the best we can get, just pay them.

47
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,479
I think...

48
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,444
we shouldn't give them a single cent.

49
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,714
We must never compromise with people like Song Zhiyong.

50
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,599
Just let it go.

51
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,199
If this matter gets out of hand, the company's reputation will be affected.

52
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,520
That would cause even more problems.

53
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,759
This is about principle.

54
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,600
If you make an exception this time,

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,839
what will happen next time?

56
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,759
Whoever causes a ruckus gets their money.

57
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,000
Besides, we're currently undergoing structural changes.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,168
We don't have any spare funds.

59
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,600
I agree.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
We can't give them a single cent.

61
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,920
That bunch of people

62
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
are just beggars.

63
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,120
- They only want money. 
 - A greedy lot.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,049
Don't even think about it.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,839
Song Yan,

66
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,199
go to bed early after you finish your homework, okay?

67
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,099
Okay, Mom.

68
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,797
I'm going out.

69
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,439
Don't go off playing outside after you finish.

70
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,139
Okay.

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,970
Where are you going?

72
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,439
 I'm going to the dance hall. 

73
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,399
You... Can't you stay away from those places?

74
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,000
What kind of places?

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,620
Did I lose my freedom because I married you?

76
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,040
I mean, the dance hall is filled with men and women.

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,560
Getting so close to one another in summer...

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,199
It's not proper.

79
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,120
Is it any of your business?

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,260
Just like how you manage your colleagues?

81
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,439
Tell me. Do they pay you for helping them or what?

82
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,319
If you're that idle, you should fix our home up properly.

83
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,800
Did I not fix it up?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,600
 Did I starve you or not let you dress nicely? 

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,759
 What more do you want? 

86
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,173
 All you ever talk about is money. 

87
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,120
 Give it a rest. 

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,044
Other people who work in the same position as you

89
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,240
have fat wallets and full accounts.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
They drive nice cars and live in big houses.

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
What do you have?

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,539
Aside from a good name, what else do you have?

93
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,279
Dad.

94
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,081
Doing homework?

95
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,084
I got you some tangerines.

96
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,920
Here you go.

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,959
Take this one. Peel one for me.

98
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,425
And I'll peel you one.

99
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,377
Let's see if it's sweet.

100
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,079
Your mom is all dressed up today.

101
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,874
Lovely, isn't she?

102
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,759
- Is it sweet? 
 - It's good. Thanks, Dad.

103
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,079
Here, give me a slice.

104
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,879
Okay.

105
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,013
Mr. Zhao, what did I do wrong?

106
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,800
At least tell me before you fire me.

107
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,279
Someone reported you for receiving bribes.

108
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,720
Mr. Zhao, you could've said anything else, but there's no way I'd take bribes.

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,519
Who reported it? Ask them to come. We'll sort it out face-to-face.

110
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,120
Your good friend,

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,820
Ding Ming.

112
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,199
You foolishly led them to ask for recompense from management.

113
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,800
 But one by one, they all gave in. 

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,519
I regarded you as my brother and stood up for you!

115
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,759
But you framed me over some dirty money!

116
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,439
How could you do that to me?

117
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,839
You're inhuman!

118
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,399
You're inhuman!

119
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,839
What benefits did they give you?

120
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,480
What exactly did they give you?

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,800
- Tell me! Why are you keeping quiet? 
 - Stop!

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,720
- Stop it. 
 - You worthless piece of crap!

123
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,519
Stop fighting.

124
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,119
Go, leave.

125
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,279
Mom!

126
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,419
Mom!

127
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,319
Mom!

128
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,700
Dad.

129
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,959
Good.

130
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,059
Good!

131
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Dad, eat while it's hot.

132
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,279
Dad.

133
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,079
Drink some water.

134
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,860
Dad.

135
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,279
L-Let me help you to the bed.

136
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,040
Sorry.

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,920
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,610
Dad.

139
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,159
Don't cry, Dad.

140
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,440
Stop crying, Dad.

141
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,902
Don't cry.

142
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,619
Dad.

143
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:32,919
Dad, don't cry.

144
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,919
Don't cry.

145
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,680
Dad.

146
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,900
I want to pee.

147
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,539
Dad.

148
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,739
Dad?

149
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,477
Dad.

150
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,004
Dad!

151
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Dad!

152
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,460
Dad, why are you sleeping out here?

153
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,639
You can't sleep here!

154
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,162
Dad!

155
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,919
Look how big the hornets' nest is.

156
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,229
It's dangerous.

157
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,120
I poked a beehive for fun as a kid.

158
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,679
I almost got beaten to death by my dad.

159
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,720
I guess you really deserve your name.

160
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,159
Xiao Ge, get a ladder.

161
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,039
You two, put on the protection suit.

162
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,440
- Got it. 
 - Junping,

163
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,519
disperse the nearby crowd.

164
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,159
Move them back. Set up a perimeter.

165
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,279
Understood.

166
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,008
Go, put on the suit.

167
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,120
Yang Chi, you and Jiang can sit this out.

168
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,600
 Let the juniors do it. 

169
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,220
All right. This is a chance for the rookies to perform.

170
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,519
- Stay safe! 
 - Okay!

171
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,799
Do a good job!

172
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,399
Somehow, I have a bad feeling.

173
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,239
I'd be shocked if those two bumbling guys can do it.

174
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,799
Captain,

175
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,000
could you record me? Record a video.

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,039
I'm doing my first ever main mission.

177
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,879
I want to show it to my mom.

178
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,579
- Only this one time. 
 - Thanks, Captain!

179
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
Pi Pi.

180
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,119
Captain.

181
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,479
- Pi Pi. 
 - I'll take that.

182
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,100
Captain, take a photo of me.

183
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,600
Cheers.

184
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,400
Dapeng, watch out!

185
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,200
Captain, careful!

186
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,910
   

187
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,779
- Come in. 
 - Slowly.

188
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,479
- There you go. 
 - Careful.

189
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,840
Like I said, we can't be too nice to them.

190
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,759
It's okay, Captain. There's a first time for everything.

191
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,600
That's right. It was Dapeng's first main mission.

192
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,519
And it's your first time getting stung by hornets.

193
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes. Come on, let's go.

194
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,279
Captain, we'll wait for you outside.

195
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,600
Doctor.

196
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,373
Where were you stung?

197
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,500
I don't see any swollen parts.

198
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,100
- Right hip. 
 - Where?

199
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,361
Right side of the butt.

200
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,272
Take off your pants.

201
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,759
How am I supposed to treat you if you won't show me?

202
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,068
You don't have to treat it. Just get me some medicine.

203
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,120
Some hornets are quite poisonous.

204
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,100
If left unchecked, stings could be lethal.

205
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,879
Do I...

206
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,812
have to do it here?

207
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,220
We can go to the observation room, but there are even more people there.

208
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,799
The observation room is packed. We should go there and help.

209
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,480
- Is it packed? 
 - Yes.

210
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,759
Lots of people. Let's go.

211
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,705
Let's go.

212
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,319
Come on.

213
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:50,155
Close the door.

214
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,739
You can take it off now.

215
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:59,360
Doesn't the ER have any male medical staff?

216
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,880
Are you doubting my professionalism?

217
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,023
Captain Song,

218
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,079
I think you're thinking too much.

219
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,359
To me, you're just a patient.

220
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,315
It's nothing to do with gender.

221
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,732
Take it off.

222
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,000
Captain Song,

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,513
I didn't think you'd be so shy.

224
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,366
It's out.

225
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,720
Avoid getting the area wet when you shower. Don't eat spicy food.

226
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,320
Dr. Xu.

227
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Sorry. The center said a patient with food poisoning was being sent here.

228
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,963
I'm coming.

229
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,938
Is it done, Doctor?

230
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,325
Is everything okay?

231
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,679
Song Yan.

232
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,120
Let's chat.

233
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,793
Wait for me in the truck.

234
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,119
I'm busy.

235
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,119
Make it quick.

236
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,295
I know what you're thinking.

237
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,940
But I urge you to face reality.

238
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,936
Don't think that just because she's back, you can be with her.

239
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,200
Even if you're standing next to her,

240
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,714
you two still aren't from the same world.

241
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,079
That wall separating you

242
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,960
will always be there.

243
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,160
What a coincidence.

244
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,860
I'm really good at dismantling walls.

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Song Yan.

246
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,200
You two will never be together.

247
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,064
Can you please just leave her alone?

248
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,880
Stop acting like a dog,

249
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,659
constantly following her around.

250
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,599
I'm free to go where I want.

251
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,359
There's nothing you can do about it.

252
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,019
Also, who gave you the right to make decisions for her?

253
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,820
If you had the power to decide back then,

254
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,079
you wouldn't be standing before me right now.

255
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,188
It's because I'm her brother,

256
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,839
a family member she can never forsake.

257
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,219
So you know you're her brother.

258
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,319
But your care and possessiveness of your sister

259
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,928
is a little excessive, isn't it?

260
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,880
Even if you're a family member,

261
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,110
you should have a sense of propriety.

262
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Oh, I forgot.

263
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,340
You're not her real brother.

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,680
Meng Yanchen,

265
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,580
you don't even dare to face your true self.

266
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,519
What a hypocrite.

267
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,340
Only a person who can't manage their own life would impose on other people's lives.

268
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,740
- Nice. 
 - Happy birthday!

269
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,880
- Happy birthday. 
 - Help serve it.

270
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,380
All right.

271
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,960
In the blink of an eye,

272
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
the two kids are all grown up.

273
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,599
Indeed.

274
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,240
A child's birthday

275
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
is the mother's day of suffering.

276
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
Yanchen,

277
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,440
your mother went through so much giving birth to you.

278
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,799
She struggled for seven hours in the hospital but couldn't birth you.

279
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,000
At the time, your dad said the child

280
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,319
would surely cause a lot of worry and heartache for me in the future.

281
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,480
But your dad was wrong.

282
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,519
I was wrong.

283
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,623
Our dear Yanchen

284
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,793
is the most considerate child a parent could ask for.

285
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,720
He's never made us sad

286
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
and never let us down.

287
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,480
It's all thanks to you.

288
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,919
You're a good mother and taught him well.

289
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,480
You raised me well, Mom. Thank you.

290
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
Thank you, Mom.

291
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,359
- Let's begin. 
 - Let's.

292
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,920
- Here. 
 - Raise your glasses.

293
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,480
 Happy birthday. 

294
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,540
The Cypris morpho,

295
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,837
also known as the Diamond morpho.

296
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:21,759
They can only be found in the jungles of Columbia and Panama.

297
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm glad you like it.

298
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,559
Brother,

299
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,046
happy birthday.

300
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,839
Do you know why these specimens

301
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,679
are so beautiful?

302
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,640
To preserve the vivid colors,

303
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,519
a living butterfly is gutted bit by bit

304
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,359
without outright killing it.

305
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,160
So while its survival instinct is at its peak,

306
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,360
you must set it in its final position.

307
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,760
That's so cruel.

308
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,971
Sometimes,

309
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,440
I feel like we're just like them.

310
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,519
We were disciplined by Mom bit by bit.

311
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,760
We lost our ability to think for ourselves.

312
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,340
We can't grow out of shape.

313
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,240
There can't be any tarnish or stain.

314
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,880
We have to grow up according to Mom's rules.

315
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,519
We have to be perfect.

316
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,960
Only then

317
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,940
could we be placed on the wall

318
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,780
and be admired.

319
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,559
I think it's absurd,

320
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,260
but I can't bring myself to fight it.

321
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,140
Because she's Mom.

322
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,720
Sometimes,

323
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,680
I think it's unfair for you

324
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,380
to be in this family.

325
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,946
But sometimes,

326
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,781
I think selfishly.

327
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,720
With you here,

328
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,200
it means I'm not alone.

329
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,839
I'm not so scared then.

330
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,119
Today is your birthday.

331
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,700
Cheer up a little.

332
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,919
Also,

333
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,500
let's not argue again, okay?

334
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,480
I'm not arguing with you.

335
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,359
I'm just reminding you.

336
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,380
Reminding me of what?

337
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,700
Stop looking for Song Yan.

338
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,240
I told you there's no future for you two.

339
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,400
And I told you to stay out of my business!

340
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,680
Qin Qin,

341
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,640
are you still the little girl living in a fairy tale world?

342
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,599
Dad and Mom will never agree.

343
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,200
If you want to be with him, you'll have to give up everything.

344
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,960
What's so great about him? Why would you do all this for him?

345
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,419
It is my own decision.

346
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,674
What are you going to do?

347
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,880
What do you expect me to do?

348
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,440
Watch you plead with our parents over him?

349
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,548
Or watch your relationship

350
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,839
with our parents disintegrate because of him?

351
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,400
At this time, should I be backing you up

352
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,439
or shouldn't I?

353
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,440
Qin Qin,

354
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,160
are you really going to give up your parents,

355
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,000
this family, and me just to be with him?

356
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,599
Why must I give up this family if I wish to be with Song Yan?

357
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,279
Mom didn't like him before because of his lowly family background.

358
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,240
But Song Yan is doing good now.

359
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,430
He's a fire station captain. He's saved many lives.

360
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,480
Yes, there were some misunderstandings and friction in the past.

361
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,280
But it can all be resolved with proper communication.

362
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,759
I will find a way

363
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,880
to slowly but surely convince Dad and Mom.

364
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,960
That's just your own wishful thinking. Dad and Mom will never agree!

365
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,792
Neither will I!

366
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,920
You can be with anyone else,

367
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,996
- but not him! 
 - Why?

368
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,039
If you're willing to turn on the family to be with him,

369
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,531
- then why can't we— 
 - Meng Yanchen!

370
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,976
Have you lost your mind?

371
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,000
I won't give this family up.

372
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,620
And you'll always be my brother.

373
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,680
 How could you bring that home? 

374
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
 If Mom finds out, you're dead. 

375
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,400
 Didn't someone say they dreamed about eating it? 

376
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,480
 The smell is too strong. 

377
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,620
 Mom will notice. 

378
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,822
 Here. 

379
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,440
 If you get into trouble, leave me out of it. 

380
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,480
 It's not my fault. 

381
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,937
 If I die, 

382
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:20,359
 then no one's going to bring you good food to eat again. 

383
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,986
 And you won't have anyone to play with. 

384
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,799
 Why are you eating so fast? Slow down. 

385
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,240
 I have to eat it fast. 

386
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,340
 I can't let Mom find out and take your life. 

387
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,759
 Here. 

388
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,140
 - It's so good. 
 - Wipe your mouth. 

389
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,321
 - It's delicious. Do you want some? 
 - No, thanks. 

390
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,339
 Meng Qin? 

391
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,799
 That's right. 

392
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,160
 We should've changed it a long time ago. 

393
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,279
 We've long accepted you as our daughter. 

394
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,560
 How can you stay a Xu? 

395
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,142
 But... 

396
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:29,839
 But what? 

397
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,009
 Mom. 

398
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,559
 Regarding this, I think you should respect what she thinks. 

399
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,319
 Qin Qin, 

400
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,799
 what do you think then? 

401
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,752
 All this while, 

402
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,319
 did you not think of me as your mother? 

403
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,480
 No, Mom. 

404
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,640
 I... 

405
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,340
 I just wish to keep my original surname. 

406
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,631
 Then... 

407
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:56,079
 I guess you're not happy with Dad. 

408
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,359
 It's not that. 

409
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,612
 Dad treats me really well. 

410
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,400
 Then what is the reason? 

411
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,160
 Why are you so against being one family with us and taking the same surname? 

412
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,960
 Mom, we're already a family. 

413
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,359
 - The surname— 
 - I didn't ask you. 

414
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,719
 That's enough. 

415
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:23,659
 If Qin Qin doesn't want to do it, why force her? 

416
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:26,000
 Not having the surname Meng isn't important. 

417
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,559
 If she's not a Meng, does it mean she's not my daughter? 

418
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,369
 Of course, it's important. 

419
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,599
 It has to be changed. 

420
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,640
 The daughter of the Meng family having the surname Xu? 

421
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,799
 If people found out, what would they make of it? 

422
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,100
 They'd think we got a child bride. 

423
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,340
 - Wen Ying, could you let this— 
 - Dad. 

424
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,480
 I'm willing to take your surname. 

425
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,340
 This is my home. All of you are my family. 

426
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,161
 All right. 

427
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,839
 That's good, then. 

428
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,239
 Well... 

429
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,819
 Eat up. 

430
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,599
 Mom. 

431
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,109
 Why are you forcing Qin Qin to change her surname? 

432
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,359
 That's the only thing her birth parents left her with. 

433
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,711
 Is that the real reason you don't want her to change it? 

434
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,723
 You'd better think before you speak. 

435
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,359
 If she wants to remain in this family, 

436
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,760
 she has to be called Meng Qin. 

437
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,160
 She can only be your little sister. 

438
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,760
 If... 

439
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,300
 you don't want this little sister, 

440
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,000
 then fine. 

441
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,657
 I can only send her abroad to study. 

442
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,599
 Whether that happens or not 

443
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,588
 is up to you. 

444
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,369
Why are you here today?

445
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,440
Aren't you spending your birthday at home?

446
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,100
I was about to head over there when I saw your car out front.

447
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,599
"Happy..."

448
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,119
Does that word really reflect you right now?

449
00:31:58,118 --> 00:32:00,404
What's with you?

450
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,040
Fill the glass.

451
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,559
- Cheers. 
 - There's no more wine.

452
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,971
Waitress, more alcohol!

453
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,559
How old are you?

454
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,112
Missy.

455
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,880
Don't go.

456
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,377
Where do you think you're touching?

457
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:33,160
What did I touch?

458
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,680
You walked past me and touched my hand yourself.

459
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,640
I'm not dumb!

460
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,920
You did that on purpose!

461
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,240
Did you look in the mirror today?

462
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,859
I wouldn't want you, even if you offered yourself. Who would touch you?

463
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,959
You're truly shameless.

464
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,799
Who are you calling shameless?

465
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
You're the shameless one here. You hear?

466
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
- What upstanding lady would work in a wine bar? 
 - Exactly.

467
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,759
Watch what you say!

468
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,359
What's wrong with working at a bar?

469
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,980
She's earning honest money.

470
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,160
Men with no manners or proper upbringing like you

471
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,880
can keep your money to yourself!

472
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,419
Who are you criticizing?

473
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,519
Drop it!

474
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,025
What do you think you're doing?

475
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,061
Do you know how much this wine costs?

476
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:18,163
It'd be a shame to waste it on him.

477
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,160
Apologize right now.

478
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,252
Apologize!

479
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,799
Don't move!

480
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,559
- Everyone, stand back. 
 - Don't move!

481
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,960
- Stop right there! 
 - What?

482
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,119
- You want to call the police? 
 - Go on then.

483
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,279
Should I call the police for you?

484
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,279
The cameras caught everything on tape!

485
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,480
How dare you make trouble in my place

486
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,926
and harass my female staff, too!

487
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,640
Let's see what you say when the police get here!

488
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,680
I can't stand men like you who get drunk and lose their heads.

489
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,920
A group of men taking advantage of a woman?

490
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,039
Shame on you!

491
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,920
Enough of you. Get the hell out!

492
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,799
- Leave! 
 - Get lost!

493
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,119
You're not welcome here. Scram!

494
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,819
Leave!

495
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,459
You all wait!

496
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,580
Are you two okay?

497
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,280
That's good.

498
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,480
You can go home early.

499
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,599
Go back and rest.

500
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,119
Thanks, Boss.

501
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,758
Sorry about that, everyone.

502
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:21,577
Sorry for the disturbance. The bill's on us today.

503
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,840
Not bad.

504
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,859
When did you learn to fight?

505
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Are you okay?

506
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,584
You're doing so many part-time jobs.

507
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,159
Don't you go to class?

508
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,799
There aren't many mandatory courses in the final year.

509
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,399
Are you in need of money?

510
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,285
A little.

511
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,011
You're not suited to work at a bar.

512
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,760
I happen to know a better job.

513
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,260
It pays a lot more than what you make now.

514
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,679
I won't do anything that's against my values,

515
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,680
even if it pays really well.

516
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:51,879
Did you think I'd let you take on weird jobs?

517
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,519
I...

518
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,360
When you said it pays a lot,

519
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,960
I thought...

520
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,139
Sorry.

521
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,300
Move!

522
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,599
Hurry up!

523
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,560
 There's a fire on Anhua Road. 

524
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,159
 Dispatch one city fire engine, 

525
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:22,239
 two tankers, and one rescue truck. 

526
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,599
 There's a fire on Anhua Road. 

527
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,185
 Dispatch one city fire engine, 

528
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:28,426
 two tankers, and one rescue truck. 

529
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,820
 The specific location is a shanty town, west entrance of Anhua Road. 

530
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,406
Roger that. We'll arrive in two minutes.

531
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,360
Stay in touch with the caller.

532
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,160
 Roger that. 

533
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,519
All vehicles, take note. The shanty town fire is spreading quickly.

534
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,960
Gear up for action.

535
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,480
Roger that. Gear up, everyone.

536
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,519
- You guys got here quickly. 
 - Did you make the call?

537
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,800
Yes, I'm from the neighborhood committee. I called for help.

538
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,880
Is anyone trapped?

539
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,719
No one. This zone is set for demolition.

540
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,719
All the residents moved out last month.

541
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,400
- Are you sure? 
 - Water and electricity have been cut.

542
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,320
It's uninhabitable. There aren't even stray animals.

543
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,840
- Okay. Please register yourself there. 
 - Come with me.

544
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,920
- Jiang Yi, take a group to the west side. 
 - Yes, Captain.

545
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,900
Yang Chi, control the fire with a water gun.

546
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,280
- Got it. 
 - Junping.

547
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,679
The caller said no one is trapped inside.

548
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,980
- Keep monitoring. 
 - Yes, Sir.

549
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,880
Set up two water guns!

550
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,032
Hurry up! Get the fire under control!

551
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,870
- We have to stop it from spreading! 
  - Got it! 

552
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,360
Water on!

553
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,761
- Water on! 
 - Yes, Sir!

554
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,814
Make sure the fire doesn't spread!

555
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,599
Okay!

556
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,039
Focus on extinguishing the fire.

557
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,339
Okay.

558
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,875
Captain, we've cleared all possible combustibles.

559
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,679
They're all abandoned houses, set for demolition.

560
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,480
Get ready. We'll sweep the area.

561
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,519
Sweep for what? The caller said the place has been evacuated, right?

562
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,984
Those were the residents.

563
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,280
This urban village is in a good location.

564
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,360
To the west is a street of restaurants.

565
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,840
Vegetable markets are to the east.

566
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,159
We can't rule out the possibility of homeless elderly living there.

567
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,877
Okay.

568
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,719
Check this out.

569
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:30,575
Instructor, that's a nice device.

570
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:43,015
Wait. Go back.

571
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,079
Stop.

572
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,525
Zoom in.

573
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,039
This looks like untreated waste.

574
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,440
Those bottles look like they're sold for money.

575
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,649
There's a high chance someone is in there.

576
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:00,159
What happened? Did it break down due to the intense heat?

577
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,440
- Yang Chi. 
 - I'm here.

578
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,800
- Take the thermal imager. Let's go. 
 - Yes, Sir.

579
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,199
Captain, the hose isn't long enough!

580
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,797
- Lengthen the hose! 
 - Yes, Captain!

581
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,025
Continue!

582
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,133
- Jiang Yi! 
 - Here!

583
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,679
- Sir. 
 - Get backup for the captain.

584
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,599
Got it! Liu Kai, come here!

585
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,928
- Here! 
 - Zhao Dapeng!

586
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:13,119
- Here! 
 - Get over here!

587
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,639
We're going in.

588
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,159
Got it. Thanks, Brother Yi.

589
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,276
Be serious! Listen to my command when we're inside.

590
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,719
Check your equipment.

591
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,079
Understood!

592
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,379
Quick!

593
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,079
Be careful.

594
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,379
Okay.

595
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,453
Dapeng, stay close to me.

596
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,520
The juniors are in your care.
