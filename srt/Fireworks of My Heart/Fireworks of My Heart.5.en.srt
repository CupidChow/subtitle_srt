What about you?

391
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,940
I can't

392
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,180
only think about myself.

393
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,140
My parents are old.

394
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,590
They're not very well.

395
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,980
And all these years,

396
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,140
I didn't get home to be with them.

397
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
My fiancee

398
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,340
is not married to me yet,

399
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,420
and she is in charge of

400
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,930
all the big and small things in the family.

401
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,420
And it's been five years.

402
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,860
I have to figure out

403
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,540
how to pay them back.

404
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,250
So you want to go?

You really thought about it?

407
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,700
Let me tell you.

408
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,860
Don't you even think about it.

409
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,300

410
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,860
Can't bear to see me go?

411
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,390
I just don't like the trouble of changing people.
