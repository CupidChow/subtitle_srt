Let me tell you the current situation.

10
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,820
A young girl

11
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,620
lost her job

12
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,690
and fought with her parents.

13
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,690
She then took it too hard.

14
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,190
Now she's very tense.

15
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,060
Someone is trying to console her.

16
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,770
She's there.

17
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,829
Can you come down first?

18
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,300
Go away! Don't come over!

19
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,430
If you come closer, I'll jump off right now.

Yang Chi.

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,030
You take care of the ground floor.

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,520
I'll go up.

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,160

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,900
it's better if I go up

and you stay down here.

26
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,190

Yes.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,120

Go away! Don't come over!

If you come closer, I'll jump off right now.

35
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,910
Don't move.

36
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,680
Listen to me.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,990
You're still young.

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,660
You still have a long way to go.

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,980
Don't come over.

40
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,780
If you come any closer, I'll jump.

41
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,820
Fine.

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,340
Okay.

43
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,430
I won't move.

44
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,340
I promise I won't move.

45
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,870
You shouldn't move too.

46
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,400
Girl,

47
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,450
your position now

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,120
is too dangerous.

Let's talk elsewhere from there nicely.

50

How can you think that way?

52
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,290
You're still so young, girl.

Have some water.

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,380
I don't want.

59
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,829
You can't solve my problem.

60
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,480
You can find another job if you lose your job.

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,900
You don't understand. None of you does.

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
I worked so hard

63
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,860
and I did my best.

64
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,220
But my boss is a pervert,

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,770
a scumbag.

66
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,090
He ruined everything I owned.

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,290
That's all the more reason for you to stay alive.

68
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,490
Girl,

69
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,410
if someone bullies you,

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,959
I'll report it to the police together with you.

71
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,630
I'll get justice for you.

72
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,820
Okay?

73
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,980
You can't. I've lost the evidence.

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,880
My parents even scolded me,

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,390
saying I couldn't do anything well,

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,020
I'm jobless,

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,520
and I'm so useless.

78
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,620
They would only reprimand me.

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Since young,

80
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,130
no matter what happened,

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,230
it was always my fault.

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,220
My fault.

83
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,180
I myself was a mistake.

84
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,860
Since they want me to die,

85
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
I will make their wish come true.

86
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,820
Don't.

87
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,020
Don't.

88
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't jump.

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,590
Don't jump.

90
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:55,950
Don't jump.

91
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,930
Don't jump.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,770
Don't jump.

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,370
Girl.

94
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,820
Trust me.

95
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,840
It's definitely not

96
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,900
what you think.

97
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,690
It's not.

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,960
Actually, I'm just like you.

99
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,100
Since young,

100
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,450
I've never gotten

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,450
acknowledgement from my parents.

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,590
Not only did my dad scold me,

103
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,610
but also hit me.

104
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,510
I really hated them.

105
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,490
But later,

106
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,890
I gradually realized

107
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,640
it's not that my parents

108
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,430
don't love me.

109
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,710
It's because they also have

110
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,650
their limitations.

111
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,450
It's very likely that

112
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,650
they have also been

113
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,030
mistreated by their parents

114
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,710
since they were young.

115
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,690
They did that

116
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,980
because they were worried about you

117
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,820
and distressed by your situation.

118
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,500
But they don't know

119
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,490
how to express love.

120
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,620
The more they talk, the more anxious they are.

121
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,190
Then it may sound like a criticism to you.

122
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,950
Right?

123
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,940
Every parent

124
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,010
loves their children.

125
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,220
Right?

126
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,130
Here.

127
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,470
Have some water.

128
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,110
Here.

129
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,430
You drink it.

130
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,290
Drink it.

131
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,340
Girl.

132
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,940
You can stay away from

133
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,740
the people and jobs you don't like,

134
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,770
even your parents.

135
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,680
You can move out.

136
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,000
You can move to another city.

137
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,290
If you don't want to see someone, just don't.

138
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
It's no big deal.

139
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,600
You're still young.

140
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
You have great potential in the future.

141
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,060
Right?

142
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,640
You've been standing there

143
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,200
for too long.

144
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,480
You must be exhausted.

145
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,320
Come up first.

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,060
Okay?

147
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,090
Come on.

148
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,140
Come on.

149
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,020
Come on.

150
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,040
Do you think she will jump off from there?

151
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,940
Who knows?

152
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,890
Perhaps she's putting on an act.

153
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,740
Both of you,

154
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,450
stop talking sarcastically here.

155
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,950
She wants to jump off the building

156
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,740
just because she fought with her parents.

157
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,010
Someone like her doesn't deserve to be raised.

158
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

159
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,030
What are you talking about?

160
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,320
What nonsense is that?

161
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,190
Children like her are the most unlikeable.

162
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,960
She's just throwing a tantrum.

163
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,090
Her mum shouldn't have given birth to her.

164
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,780
Sir.

165
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,020
Thank you.

166
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,670
No!

168
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,040
Supervisor.

169
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,010
Yang Chi.

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,300
I'll tie it now.

171
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,260
Catch the supervisor carefully.

172
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,910
Okay.

173
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,299
Put down the supervisor slowly.

174
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,240
Aim at the air cushion.

175
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
Hold him tight.

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,150
He's up there.

177
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,710
Okay.

178
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,630
Send him to the hospital.

179
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,340
Okay.

180
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,510
Are you okay?

181
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,410
Are you okay?

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,300
Who was it?

183
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,960
Who shouted just now? Do they have any humanity?

184
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,780
It's a life.

185
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,940
A life!

186
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,040
Among you,

187
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,370
who hasn't been at a loss for a period?

188
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,140
Among you,

189
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,500
who hasn't faced any difficulties?

190
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,130
If the one standing up there

191
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,530
is your family, kin and children,

192
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,870
will you still simply

193
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,100
treat it as a joke?

194
