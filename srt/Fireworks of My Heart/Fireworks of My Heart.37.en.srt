[Episode 37]

4
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,020
Was it you?

5
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,580
The person who bribed the man in charge of physical examination reports

6
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,060
and made Song Yan fail the repetition exam.

7
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,780
Was it you?

8
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,660
The one who found someone

9
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,710
to make trouble and get in conflict with him

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,010
right before his promotion

11
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,520
was also you, right?

12
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,960
He wrote a dozen letters to me,

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,009
but I didn't receive any.

14
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,780
Was it also you?

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,280
Who told you that?

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,380
Song Yan?

17
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,270
Dad.

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,760
You too?

19
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,700
Qin.

20
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,140
About this...

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,160
I

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,210
don't know what to tell you.

23
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,500
This matter

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,160
has nothing to do with your father.

25
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,110
Your father only found out

26
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,030
about it later.

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,140
It was me

28
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,000
who did it.

29
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,350
How could you just understate it like that?

30
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,660
Not to mention an apology,

31
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,410
you don't even have any explanation for me?

32
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,650
That's a matter of a person's

33
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,880
fate and future.

34
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,660
Mum.

35
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,190
He's the person I love.

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,650
He's the person I've always wanted to get close to,

37
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,020
who I almost missed forever

38
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,900
because I was bitter about how he never committed.

39
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,580
How can you be so indifferent

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
after ruining

41
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,350
the person I love?

42
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,650
I've always treated you

43
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,790
as my real mother.

44
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,250
I even thought about

45
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,680
taking the initiative to make up with you.

46
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,590
I thought

47
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,790
maybe it's just

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,960
your personality.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Maybe it's not that you don't regard me as your daughter.

50
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,390
I'm an idiot.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,780
I'm a tool you raise at home

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,120
so that you can get me married for business.

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,840
However, this tool gained humanity,

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
and the feelings she longs for.

55
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,390
You're afraid that she'll get out of your control,

56
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,270
so you want to destroy the person she loves.

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
This way, she won't have any expectations in life,

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
and she'll be your puppet doll obediently.

59
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,510
Qin!

60
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,890
You can't

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,030
talk to your mother like this.

62
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,890
How could you talk to us like that?

63
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,940
Has all these years of education you received

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,650
been for nothing?

65
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,540
You've lived in this family

66
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,450
for more than ten years.

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,630
Are you

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,310
denying everything

69
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,700
we did

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,400
and breaking up with us,

71
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,890
just for this man?

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,120
Right.

73
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm not

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,990
a perfect mother.

75
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,210
But what about you?

76
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Are you

77
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,030
a perfect daughter?

78
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,140
Qin.

79
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,190
You disappointed me.

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,070
Hypocrite.

81
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,020
What did you say?

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,530
Hypocrite.

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,780
I disappointed you?

84
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,700
I've done nothing but follow the rules since childhood.

85
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,530
If you ask me to go east,

86
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,480
I dare not go west.

87
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,020
What did I do to disappoint you?

88
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,860
I just fell in love with him.

89
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,180
You said he doesn't deserve me.

90
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,650
What right do you have

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,230
to do something like that?

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,540
Yet you still think you're noble.

93
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,470
You're the one who doesn't deserve me.

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
You don't even deserve

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,690
to call yourself a good person!

96
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,410
Meng Qin!

97
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,310
So what do you want?

98
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,580
Go and report me.

99
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,130
Send your mother

100
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,000
to prison.

101
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,920
I won't hold you responsible

102
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,790
for what he went through

103
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,830
and what he lost.

104
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,550
From now on,

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,850
I'll have nothing to do

106
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,500
with you.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm warning you.

108
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,860
Don't ever hurt him again.

109
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,510
Right.

110
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,490
In your eyes,

111
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,650
I have nothing.

112
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,570
But I can die for him.

113
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,470
Yanchen.

114
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,070
President Fu.

115
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,470
Yanchen.

116
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,510
Where are your manners?

117
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,400
Manners?

118
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,920
How well you educated me.

119
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,610
Be an honest and upright person.

120
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,540
I thought you were also that kind of person.

121
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,600
My manners made me

122
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,549
be filial to you

123
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,220
and respect you since I was little.

124
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,590
No matter how painful I am,

125
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,380
I can't bear to hurt you.

126
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,400
I'm always afraid to let you down.

127
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,290
But now...

128
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,780
Stop!

129
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,450
Where are you going?

130
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,260
I'm going out.

131
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,380
You can't go anywhere.

132
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,130
Mum.

133
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,470
Please, take a look at me.

134
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,270
Mum.

135
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm begging you. Please look at my face.

136
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,980
The one standing in front of you

137
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,100
is your son.

138
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,100
All these years,

139
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,860
he's been living a miserable life.

140
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,940
He lives like a shell.

141
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,870
Can't you tell at all?

142
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,000
Right.

143
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,380
The only one you can see

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,410
is yourself.

145
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,310
Yanchen!

146
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,380
Enough.

147
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,090
Stop forcing them.

148
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,450
Do you have to

149
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,320
drive both kids crazy?

150
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,510
Rules

151
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,500
are rules.

152
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,110
I admit that

153
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,180
I did

154
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,660
those two things disgracefully.

155
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,500
But who did I do it for?

156
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,380
I did it for the Meng family

157
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,630
and my children.

158
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,290
I don't regret it.

159
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,980
Back then,

160
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,580
I did disagree

161
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,710
with Qin being with him.

162
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,200
But we had

163
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,140
already broken them up.

164
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,870
Why did you

165
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,140
have to hurt that boy?

166
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,750
His father is a piece of trash.

167
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,030
His mother ran away with someone else

168
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,730
just for a little money.

169
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,100
What kind of son

170
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
could these parents

171
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,630
have raised?

172
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,740
If you want me to

173
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,220
let Qin be with him,

174
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,630
you may as well kill me.

175
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,340
Do you think

176
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,770
these two kids

177
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,000
may break up?

178
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,810
Don't you worry about that.

179
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,360
Their relationship is out of our hands.

180
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,760
You only know to watch TV.

181
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,070
Why is the kid's life so hard?

182
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,500
Song Yan!

183
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,230
Let's make up.

184
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's make up.

185
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,470
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,590
We never broke up.

187
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,060
Song Yan.

188
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,250
How did you make it through

189
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,930
all these years?

190
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,100
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,630
I should have trusted you.

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,750
I shouldn't have been willful.

193
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,580
I shouldn't have fought with you

194
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,690
and run away from home.

195
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,870
Don't be silly.

196
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,340
It's all in the past.

197
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,300
You don't know.

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,080
I missed you so much.

199
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,420
I missed you too.

200
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,180
Let's go in.

202
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,490
I still need to go back to the station.

203
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,670
They came back together.

204
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,150
Good news.

205
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,560
The kids are back.

206
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,780
I wonder if they have eaten.

207
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,220
They've made up.

208
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,730
What do you want to do?

209
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,750
Are you stupid?

210
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,570
It doesn't matter whether they ate or not.

211
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,960
This is what matters.

212
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,840
You old perv.

213
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,540
So annoying.

214
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,790
Let's go back in.

215
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,790
Okay.

216
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,520
Let's go.

217
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,290
Mr. Meng.

218
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,430
Do you want me to call Mr. Xiao?

219
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,670
But it's been a while

220
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,210
since he last came here.

221
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,980
No need.

222
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,710
This way, please.

223
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,190
Bring my wine.

224
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,190
OK.

225
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,330
Go get Mr. Meng's wine.

226
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,350
Mr. Meng, let me know if you need anything.

227
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,070
Our numbers these days.

228
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,670
This post has good numbers.

229
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,800
This one has good potential.

230
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,990
[Tiantian]

231
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,110
We need that vibe.

232
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,100
I have to take this.

233
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:55,560
Hello.

234
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,870
Ye'zi.

235
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,580
You asked me

236
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,470
to call you

237
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,410
when Mr. Meng comes here, right?

238
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,570
He's here today.

239
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,780
He's there?

240
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,220
Thank you.

241
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,060
You're welcome.

242
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,030
It's nothing.

243
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,870
Why do you want to see him?

244
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,280
Nothing.

245
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,220
I just want to thank him

246
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,370
for a favor he did for me before.

247
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,090
Thank you.

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,470
Zhai Miao.

249
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,380
I'm going out.

250
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,150
Didn't you say

251
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,330
you'd review the numbers with me today?

252
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,870
Tomorrow.

253
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,660
I will do it tomorrow.

254
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,230
I promise.

255
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,420
I'm running late.

256
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I have to do my makeup now.

257
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,020
Are you okay?

258
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,400
Why are you here?

259
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,630
You drank so much.

260
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,500
Are you in a bad mood?

261
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,050
I wanted to treat you to dinner

262
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,610
and return the favor.

263
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,890
But you said you were busy.

264
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,070
Is there something

265
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,180
bothering you at work?

266
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,150
Why are you smiling?

267
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,030
Moths and butterflies

268
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,819
are two similar insects.

269
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,329
But they are very different.

270
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,440
Some moths

271
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,780
have beautiful wings

272
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,220
like butterflies.

273
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,570
It's hard for ordinary people to notice.

274
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,210
But I can tell right away.

275
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,300
There's another difference between them.

276
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,350
Butterflies like to fly under the sun,

277
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,710
but moths

278
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,130
are always active at night.

279
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,280
I don't understand what you're talking about.

280
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,250
Really?

281
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,690
It doesn't matter whether you understand or not.

282
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,670
I just want

283
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,460
to be alone for a while.

284
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,930
Yes.

285
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,820
I do like you.

286
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,870
But do you have to treat me like this?

287
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,510
You like me?

288
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,240
What do you like about me?

289
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,100
I just think you're a nice person.

290
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,600
There's no reason.

291
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,750
Can't I?

292
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,510
How much do you have to pay each month

293
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,840
for your student loan?

294
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,080
What's your monthly

295
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,110
living expenses?

296
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,670
What do you mean?

297
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,220
I'm a businessman.

298
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,380
I deal with all kinds of people

299
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,220
every day.

300
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,680
Don't think

301
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,740
too much of yourself.

302
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,300
And don't think of me as a fool.

303
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,990
I won't be fooled

304
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,120
that easily.

305
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,590
So all this time,

306
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,790
you've been playing me.

307
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,770
What's there to play?

308
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,340
Go away.

309
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,920
Wenying.

310
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,610
You must be tired.

311
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
Go to bed early.

312
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,550
I feel

313
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,310
very uneasy.

314
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,600
Yanchen

315
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,720
has never been like this.

316
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,530
Leave him alone for a while.

317
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,150
You know how he is.

318
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,040
He will change his mind.

319
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,090
It'll be fine.

320
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,470
I called him several times,

321
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,430
but he didn't answer.

322
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,770
He's never

323
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,040
ignored my calls.

324
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,830
Don't worry.

325
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,290
Give him some time

326
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,500
to think about it.

327
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,290

338
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,510
I was bullied.

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm

340
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,270
by myself now.

341
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,270
I don't know

342
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,780
what to do.

343
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,570
Help me.

344
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,020
Sir. Ma'am.

345
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,130
Lawyer Guo is here.

346
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,080
Still couldn't reach him?

347
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,180
No.

348
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,300
Should we call the police?

349
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,500
But we have no reason to call the police.

350
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,420
Also, in this case,

351
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,640
the other party claimed to be the victim.

352
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,930
If we call the police,

353
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,630
it equals turning ourselves in.

354
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,800
Don't call the police for now.

355
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,620
There has been

356
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,170
enough chaos in our family

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,980

Whether it's true or not,

359
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,380
it's no good for us

360
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,850
to blow it up.

361
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,160

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,420
I know my child.

579
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,060
He would never

580
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,130
do such a thing.

581
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,660
We need to find a way

582
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,420
to

583
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,940
reveal the truth

584
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,850
in the most credible way.

585
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,880
And we need to find witnesses and physical evidence as soon as possible.

586
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,470
Didn't they say a customer saw it?

587
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,150
Find that witness first.

588
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,900
Hurry up.

589
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,080
Okay.

590
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,880
Why didn't you answer my call?

591
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,340
Why do you want to see me?

592
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,530
About Meng Yanchen.

593
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,290
Aren't you the key witness

594
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,000
caught on CCTV camera?

595
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,370
I don't know what you're talking about.

596
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,570
Drop the act.

597
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,820
Even if you run 100 meters away

598
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,860
in a sack,

599
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,260
I can still recognize you.

600
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,230
So why do you want to help them?

601
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,280
It's not right.

602
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,640
Why would the police show you the CCTV footage?

603
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,050
Are you tricking me?

604
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,900
Zhai Miao.

605
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,930
I thought you knew

606
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,920
the seriousness of matters.

607
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,810
I thought you wouldn't do anything to harm people.

608
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,760
You're not thinking

609
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,540
the posts online have something to do with me, are you?

610
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,930
You're not that wicked.

611
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,900
Tell me.

612
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,310
Ye'zi called the monitor.

613
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,810
Monitor was so worried,

614
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,080
so he rounded up the entire Student Union.

615
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,190
Ye'zi was crying,

616
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,620
saying

617
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
she was bullied.

618
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,940
Meng Yanchen has an impressive background.

619
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,460
Everyone was angry,

620
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,170
so they wanted to post about it.

621
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,850
I neither participated

622
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,830
nor stopped them.

623
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,630
I simply looked on.

624
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,760
You know that

625
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,620
Meng Yanchen didn't rape Ye'zi.

626
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,920
I don't know.

627
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,890
How would I know?

628
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,340
Since you think it's beneath you to get involved,

629
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,060
why don't you tell the truth?

630
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,170
What truth?

631
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,240
I wasn't involved.

632
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,470
I have a clear conscience.

633
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,650
Their posts

634
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,040
have nothing to do with me.

635
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,980
I didn't even

636
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,810
leave a thumbs-up or a comment.

637
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,560
You know the truth is not like that.

638
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,260
You have evidence.

639
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,250
You saw it at the door.

640
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,410
You recorded it too, right?

641
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,290
You know how urgent this is.

642
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,850
If this goes on,

643
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,090
Meng Yanchen will be doomed.

644
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,310
He's doomed?

645
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,170
He'll still be better than you even if he's doomed.

646
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,430
Why do you have to worry about him?

647
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,130
If this is only because you hate the Meng family,

648
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,660
it's not necessary.

649
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,170
I've let go of

650
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,620
the past events.

651
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,670
Don't be willful.

652
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,420
But if you have evidence,

653
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,710
come with me to the police station.

654
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,170
You've let it go?

655
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,610
How could you?

656
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,630
If I graduated from high school

657
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,250
and sold socks

658
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,470
on the overpass for ten years,

659
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,780
then I tell you

660
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,410
I was actually admitted to Yan University.

661
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,030
It's because someone

662
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,190
ruined my grade.

663
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,440
Can you let go of it?

664
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,440
If I got a postgraduate recommendation,

665
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,820
but someone reported me

666
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,510
and got me disqualified from the exam,

667
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,810
can you let go of it, too?

668
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,030
Brother.

669
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
Can you really let it go?

670
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,120
The best ten years of your youth

671
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,100
were ruined.

672
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,170
All the things you fought for

673
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,520
have been in vain.

674
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,800
Have you forgotten about all these?

675
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,390
Have you forgotten

676
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,230
how my dad begged her back then, too?

677
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,160
Zhai Miao.

678
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,940
Brother.

679
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,560
Stop pretending and

680
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,880
saying that you've let it go.

681
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,390
Saying that you don't care and you don't hate them.

682
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,020
If you've really let it go,

683
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,850
last year, when Xu Qin first

684
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,870
came to see you,

685
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,300
you wouldn't have kicked her out.

686
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,060
If you've really let it go,

687
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,900
why do you keep so many books

688
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,680
at home?

689
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,980
Why do you

690
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,910
work so hard?

691
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,250
If you've really let it go,

692
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,400
if you really don't care,

693
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,750
our family wouldn't have

694
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,620
dared not

695
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,770
bring up anything that happened back then.

696
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,640
We're just afraid that it might hurt your pride.

697
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,300
And now, you want to forgive them

698
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
because of Xu Qin?

699
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,560
That's your own business.

700
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,080
I won't.

701
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,100
I will never.
