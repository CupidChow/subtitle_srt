Aunt. Uncle.

5
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,880
Qin, you're back.

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,700
Come here.

7
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,500
Dinner is ready.

8
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,570
Song Yan didn't even have time to have dinner with us

9
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,020
and rushed back to the team.

10
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,860
Honestly.

11
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,340
Where is Zhai Miao?

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,500
She went back to college.

13
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,140
She also needs to find a job now, right?

14
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,260
Yes.

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,660
I wonder how that will go.

16
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,460
Here.

17
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,140
Let me do it myself.

18
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,060
It's not a big deal, kid.

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,380
Let him do it for you.

20
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,340
You're welcome.

21
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,940
Is it enough?

22
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,060
Yes. Thank you, Uncle.

23
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,890
Girls don't eat much.

24
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,620
Eat more.

25
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,100
You must try this.

26
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,980
I marinated the chicken wings

27
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,890
for two hours.

28
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,820
It's very tasty.

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,420
Okay.

30
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,579
Thank you, Aunt.

You're welcome.

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,340
She made it specially for you.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,620
She cooked it very attentively.

34
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,579
Why did no one fill my bowl?

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,980
Sorry.

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,290
I neglected it.

37
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,579
I paid too much attention to the kid.

38
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,140
It's delicious.

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,860
Is it?

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,820
Enough.

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,500
I'll eat less.

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,540
Although it may not show on your face,

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,740
you are too thin.

44

Come on.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,300

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,660

49

Drink some.

50

87

91

wasn't broken by me

No.

There are so many people outside.

97

You can't get a taxi.

98
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,500
Actually, that vase wasn't worth much.

99
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,180
It was not worth one tenth

100
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,140
of the ticket price.

101
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,100
It doesn't matter to me

102
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
how much it was worth.

103
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,980
It wasn't me

104
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,060

105
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,100
So...

106
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,970
Why did you treat me to this concert?

107
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,810
The other person couldn't make it.

108
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,740
The seat would be empty anyway.

109

So, who

110
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,980
was the ticket meant for?

111
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,580
How about this?

112
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,540
Since you treated me to a concert,

113
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,500
I'll treat you to a small live performance.

114

I'm not interested.

115
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,179
Right.

I know.

121
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,210
Actually, it has nothing to do

122
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,460
with age.

123
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,180
It's just someone is cold

124
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,180
and doesn't look dynamic at all.

125
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,980

Kind of.

147
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,380
When there's an orchestra I like,

148
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,930
I'd go listen to it.

149
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I used to think symphony

150
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,020
must be so elegant that

151
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,660

It's nothing.

Are you gifted?

170

Children learn instruments

171

Actually,

173
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,460
I'm pretty jealous of those who can play instruments.

the girls who can play instruments on stage

178
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,580
are very charming.

179
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,100
Although it's hard to learn for children,

180
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,330
it'll become their specialty.

181
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,420

to be performed

183
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,020
in an art show?

184
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,420
Maybe it's because I didn't have

185
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,770
the opportunity to learn it when I was a child

186
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,230
that I'm jealous.

You're still up?

How did you know?

201
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,340
I guessed

202
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,700
you were not asleep.

203
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,180
So I tried to call you.

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,260
What's wrong?

205
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,310
Are you not used to it?

206
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,660

Are you sad?

208

No.

209
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,940
I didn't expect

210
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,340
things would happen so suddenly.

211
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,900
Otherwise, I could have kept you company

212
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,940
at home for a while.

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,460
You could get more used to it that way.

214
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,900
I'm okay.

215
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,220
It was not my first time

216
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
meeting uncle and aunt.

217
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,580
Plus, they also liked me

218
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,780

219

You know what?

226
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,380
Xiao Meng had outstanding performance,

227
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,220

228
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,610
both got commended.

I'll teach it some lessons.

234

You named it Xiao Meng?

235
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,580
Is it because of me?

236

What do you think?

237

It has to be because of me.

I'm not used to it either.

241

Because you recuperated at home for too long?

242
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,050

No.

Mum called me and told me about it.

What did she say?

263
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,450

What do you want me to do then?

You want me to break up with him

284

I didn't mean to do that.

385
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,180
Right. I wanted to say it myself.

390
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,600
I used to dream about

391
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,670
becoming an entomologist

392

No.

That's my home.

399
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,790
Fine.

400
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,180
Then why didn't you become

401
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,460
an entomologist?

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,010
No.

405
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,050
Actually, I major in biology.

407
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
I still want to find

408
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,060
a biology-related job.

409

But when I think about reality,

410
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,060
it's quite pessimistic.

411
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,850
Why?

I'm not qualified for campus recruitment.

Indeed.

Also, after getting into this industry,

422
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,570

00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,700
But you came, didn't you?

758
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,260
Well, they say there are two things

759
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,940
in the world that

760
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,260
can't be mistreated.

761
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,010
Food is one of them.

762
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,220
What's the other one?

763
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,020
Love.

764
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,300
You made this up, right?

765
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,140
You can tell.

766
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,640
Do you really believe

767
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,910
there are things that can't be mistreated

768
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,590
in this world?

769
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,780
Why not?
