2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:05,879
What?

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,925
You rejected Gu Yiran's proposal?

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
But he's among the top three
diamond bachelors in Qingcheng.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,250
My father Nanfang is the top one.

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,039
Go away.

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,320
You're too young to understand it.

8
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,150
Godmother, you're also single.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,120
You haven't even had a boyfriend.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,750
You break my heart, Little Moon.

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,320
I won't team up with you in games again.

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,199
Humph, whatever.

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,120
Anyway, I'm already a silver player.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,500
but you're still a bronze.

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,519
You...

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,320
All right, all right.

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,399
Stop arguing.

18
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,840
I'm not going to marry anyone.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,679
All I want is to make money

20
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,475
and bring Little Moon up.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,100
Hello, Xiaoya.

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,280
What's up?

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,500
(Yiran,)

24
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,320
(shall we go see a movie?)

25
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,240
(I hear a new movie is on.)

26
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,719
I'm quite busy working.

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,975
Why don't you invite someone else?

28
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,359
(Gu Yiran!)

29
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,775
(You know I like you.)

30
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,000
(Why do you blow hot and cold on me?)

31
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,640
(Do you still care about Su Shaoyan?)

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,560
Sorry, Xiaoya.

33
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:04,920
You and I

34
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,280
won't be together.

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,719
I really don't understand.

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,560
Why is it so unfair?

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,079
I grew up with Nanfang.

38
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,400
Everyone thinks
we make a perfect couple.

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,550
Why could Su Shaoyan

40
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,640
marry him?

41
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,319
At their wedding,

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
she nearly killed me.

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,760
I hate her!

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,400
My brother and Gu Yiran are insane.

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,439
They keep sticking to Su Shaoyan.

46
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,200
If only Su Shaoyan

47
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,675
no longer existed!

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,000
What did you say?

49
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,519
Xiaoya,

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,159
without Su Shaoyan,

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,400
I could be with Nanfang

52
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,000
and you could be with Gu Yiran.

53
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,879
We would live the happy life
we expected.

54
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,319
Wouldn't we?

55
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,025
As long as she disappears...

56
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,479
As long as she disappears...

57
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,080
As long as she disappears...

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,360
As long as she disappears,

59
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,520
we'll live a happy life.

60
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,520
(Xiaoya,)

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
(for Su Shaoyan,)

62
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,250
(your brother threatened
to cut our credit cards.)

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,500
Sorry, Xiaoya.

64
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,759
You and I

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
won't be together.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,120
If only Su Shaoyan

67
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:40,800
no longer existed!

68
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,560
Su Shaoyan,

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,575
go to hell!
