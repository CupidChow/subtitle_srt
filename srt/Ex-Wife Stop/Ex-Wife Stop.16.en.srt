Shaoyan,

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,439
I know I made a lot of mistakes.

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,640
But I can't live without you.

5
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:10,875
Sheng Nanfang,

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,320
it's not that you can't live without me,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,560
but that you can't live
without the old Su Shaoyan

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,559
who kept sacrificing for you
even if you broke her heart.

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,525
Don't worry.

10
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,519
I won't

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,879
recommit the same error.

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,160
I know you won't accept me too quickly.

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,559
But I won't give up.

14
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,775
(DNA Test:
The paternity probability is 99.99%.)

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,425
We're getting late.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,599
Shaoyan.

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,439
Nanfang, why did you come?

18
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,560
I came to drive you to kindergarten.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,079
Sheng Nanfang, what do you want again?

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,359
I'll drive Little Moon to school

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,479
and then drive you to work.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,280
Don't bother.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,679
Aren't you getting late?

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,759
Besides,

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,240
you're the executive director.

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,039
Shouldn't you set a good example
for your subordinates?

27
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,159
How about this?

28
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,319
You drive her to school.

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,575
I'll take a taxi to work.

30
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,159
Sweetheart,

31
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,319
when school is over,

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,480
wait until I pick you up.

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,280
Don't leave with this man, got it?

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,850
Mm.

35
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,930
Take your schoolbag.

36
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,116
It will be long
before she's no longer angry.

37
00:01:19,116 --> 00:01:19,800
Mm.

38
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,480
I've got everything arranged.

39
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,959
Every day after school,

40
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,239
Mr. Chengyang

41
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,599
will take you to my office.

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
Why?

43
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,359
I want to spend more time with you.

44
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,000
May I?

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm okay with it.

46
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,840
But I can't

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,040
tell Mom about it, can I?

48
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,350
You can't. Clever girl.

49
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,750
Miss Su,

50
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,760
you not only have a beautiful face,

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,480
but also

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
a perfect figure.

53
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,175
Mr. Wang,

54
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,920
don't be kidding.

55
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,236
Shall we talk about

56
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:57,319
the supply contract?

57
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,200
It's no big deal.

58
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,280
Let's enjoy the red wine first.

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,250
When it's time,

60
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,400
nothing will be a problem.

61
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:10,080
Mr. Wang,

62
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,479
excuse me.

63
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,270
I'd like to go to the bathroom.

64
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Suit yourself.
