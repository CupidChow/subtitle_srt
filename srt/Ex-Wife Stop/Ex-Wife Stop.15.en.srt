2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,280
The launch event will be held soon.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,119
Why is there suddenly
a problem with the supplier?

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,240
Mr. Wang was

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,160
very close to our former director.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,919
So...

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,080
Got it.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,239
But time is pressing.

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,450
It's too late to contact a new supplier.

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,199
Well,

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,960
call Mr. Wang,

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,320
and tell him I'll invite him to dinner.

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,600
I'll negotiate with him personally.

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,559
But Director, this guy is very tough.

15
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,239
It's okay.

16
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:27,950
Just call him.

17
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,879
Okay.

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,679
Hello, Xiwen,

19
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,500
what's up?

20
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,560
(Shaoyan,)

21
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,840
(Little Moon is missing.)

22
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:39,840
What?

23
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,759
Why don't you enjoy the ice cream?

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,799
I don't know you.

25
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,825
Mom said I mustn't take anything
from a stranger.

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,175
My name is Sheng Nanfang.

27
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,325
Your mother Su Shaoyan

28
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,880
used to be my wife.

29
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,600
So, you're my father?

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,520
Very likely.

31
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,399
I'm Su Yueli.

33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
You can call me Little Moon.

34
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,950
Nice to meet you.

35
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:10,040
Mom!

36
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,925
Little Moon,

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,525
sweetheart,

38
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,879
you're finally back.

39
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,079
Do you know

40
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,760
how worried I was?

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,075
Sheng Nanfang,

42
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,840
you mustn't see my daughter anymore.

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,120
Nor can you take her way
without my permission.

44
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,925
Or I'll call the police!

45
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:31,301
Go.

46
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,959
Aren't you supposed

47
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,560
to explain to me about Little Moon?

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
She's my daughter.

49
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:39,680
What do I have to explain to you?

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,719
Then what makes you nervous?

51
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,840
Come on.

52
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,000
Sweetheart,

53
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,680
get in for some fun.

54
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,280
I'll have a word with Mr. Sheng, okay?

55
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,799
Mm.

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,519
Off you go.

57
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,840
She's also my daughter.

58
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,040
When will you tell me the truth?

59
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,200
Do you think

60
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,875
you're qualified to be her father?

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,875
(Pregnant uterus with gestational sac)

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,039
Shaoyan,

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
the formalities have been attended to.

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,700
You can fly to Paris tomorrow morning.

65
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:41,725
Let's go.

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,599
Sorry, Shaoyan.

67
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,429
If you don't mind,

68
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:46,919
I'll do my best
to compensate you and Little Moon.

69
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,039
I'll do anything.

70
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,879
No, thanks.

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,639
If you feel

72
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,039
even a little bit guilty,

73
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,719
please stay away from us

74
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,560
and don't disturb us anymore.

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
Anything, but this.
