2
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:06,240
(Entrance of the District
Civil Affairs Bureau)

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,320
At last, you showed up.

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,480
I also feel sorry

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,960
for Grandpa's death.

6
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,679
Since I married you,

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,119
no one has cared for me, but him.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,679
It's getting late.

9
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:15,679
Let's get in.

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,719
Shaoyan,

11
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,920
would you like to reconsider it?

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,679
Sheng Nanfang,

13
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:20,900
marrying you is

14
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,079
the most stupid decision I've ever made.

15
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,679
When I can finally get rid of it,

16
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,079
I couldn't be happier.

17
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,480
Why would I hesitate?

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,350
Fine.

19
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,480
Hope you won't regret it.

20
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,799
Nanfang,

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,240
have some honey water.

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,280
Mr. Sheng.

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,479
Go get me a glass of water.

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,840
Yes. I'm on it.

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,520
Wait.

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,000
Where is the old stuff?

27
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,039
Miss Zhang changed...

28
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,700
Nanfang.

29
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:01,100
You're back?

30
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,359
Come and check

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,959
the new house I've decorated.

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,680
Look.

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,350
Do you like it?

34
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,640
Where's the old stuff?

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,550
I threw it in the utility room.

36
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,400
Who allowed you to do that?

37
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:13,040
Get out!

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,525
Nanfang,

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,625
get up for breakfast.

40
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,000
(Today,)

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,575
(I fell in love with a man.)

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,150
(His name is Sheng Nanfang.)

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,120
(March 15, 2016)

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,599
(I didn't expect him
to be my blind date.)

45
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,424
(August 26, 2016)

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,120
(We get married.)

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,919
What a silly girl!

48
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,560
How long has she been in love with me?

49
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,750
