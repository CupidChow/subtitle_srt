2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,960
Rest assured, Xiwen.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,040
Don't bother to come today.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,400
I'll take good care
of Shaoyan and Little Moon.

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,039
Little Moon, it must be your Godmother.

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,025
Go open the door.

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:30,879
Mom.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,975
Mm.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,000
Xiwen...

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,200
Shaoyan,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
we came to apologize to you.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,719
I was

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,119
too childish.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,840
I'm terribly sorry.

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,439
You must be Little Moon.

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,479
Come on. Let Grandma look at you.

17
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,159
My dear granddaughter.

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,800
Here.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,280
This is a gift for you.

20
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,150
Thank you, Grandma.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,375
Mm.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,439
Good girl.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,280
Shaoyan,

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,359
please forgive me.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
I had a prejudice against you

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,879
because I was also forced

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,359
to marry Nanfang's father.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,439
I knew

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,079
a marriage without love

30
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,480
would hurt a lot.

31
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,760
I just didn't want my son
to repeat my poor life.

32
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,225
- Say no more.
- That's why I...

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
I knew that.

34
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,079
What's gone is gone.

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,439
Let's not bring it up again.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,799
Okay.

37
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,359
Let's forget it.

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,159
From now on,

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,359
let's live a happy life together.

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,959
Come on.

41
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,040
Little Moon, let Grandma hug you again.

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,725
Mom,

43
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,799
it's my turn.

44
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,775
Let me hug her, too.

45
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,439
Wait. In ten minutes.

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,825
(Zhang Tianwei)

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,200
Zhang Tianwei?

48
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,432
Ah?

49
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,725
Zhang Tianwei,

50
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,799
calm down.

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,080
Abandoning yourself
will solve no problem.

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,879
Shut up!

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,879
Su Shaoyan,

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
I beg you.

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Please leave Nanfang, okay?

56
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,400
I've been in love with him
since I was a teenager.

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,199
I did everything just for him.

58
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,680
I can't live without him!

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,550
Stop it, Tianwei.

60
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,680
Come down.

61
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,560
Nanfang, tell her

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,575
you'll break up with her and be with me.

63
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,199
Enough is enough.

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Say it, or I'll jump off!

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
And you'll never enjoy any peace!

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,599
I know everything you've done.

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,159
- Stop abandoning yourself.
- Nanfang.

68
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,375
Nanfang, listen to me.

69
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,000
I love you.

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,599
But I've never loved you.

71
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,350
Oh, I know. It's because of her.

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,639
She seduced you.

73
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,879
Without her, you wouldn't have
broken up with me!

74
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,280
We grew up together.

75
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,280
I thought what we had was love.

76
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,280
I didn't realize who I truly loved

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
until I divorced her.

78
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,300
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,360
I should have explained it
to you earlier.

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,280
That's impossible! I don't believe it.

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,325
It can't be true.

82
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,960
It's not true. Nanfang, tell me
it's not true.

83
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,275
It can't be true.
