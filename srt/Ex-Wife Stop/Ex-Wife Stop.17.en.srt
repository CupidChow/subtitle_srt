2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,160
(I didn't expect)

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,519
(that girl to be Nanfang's daughter.)

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,640
(I indeed shot myself in the foot.)

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:15,080
(Under such circumstances,)

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,000
(I must do something to make it right.)

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,450
Little Moon.

8
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:24,400
Hello, ma'am.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,839
I've brought you a present.

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,700
Look.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:28,839
A doll.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,075
Do you like it?

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,760
Thank you, ma'am.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
But Mom said

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,525
I mustn't take anything from a stranger.

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,719
I'm not a stranger.

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,679
I'll marry your father soon.

18
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,650
I'll be your stepmother.

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,200
Ma'am,

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,050
you won't be my stepmother.

21
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,375
Nanfang and my mother got back together.

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,775
No way.

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,240
They divorced.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,600
How can they get back to each other?

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,640
Don't talk nonsense.

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,625
What's going on?

27
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,625
Nanfang,

28
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:07,625
- she said she would be my stepmother.
- Nanfang,

29
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,159
- look at her.
- I don't want a stepmother!

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,439
I'll only marry one woman.

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,560
That is your mother.

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,025
- Got it?
- What are you talking about, Nanfang?

33
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,640
Looks like my intolerance and connivance

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,050
will only give you more illusions.

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,799
Somebody!

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,879
If you let anyone enter my office
without my permission again,

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,519
you'll be fired!

38
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,900
Do you need to be so cruel?

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,450
Take Miss Zhang to the hospital.

40
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,319
Come, please, Miss Zhang.

41
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,175
Don't touch me!

42
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,380
I'll walk out by myself.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,799
Dad.

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
What did you call me?

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,359
Dad.

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,120
Dad, don't worry.

47
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,400
I'll help you.

48
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,400
Mr. Sheng.

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,500
Mr. Wang,

50
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,840
we're done drinking.

51
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,239
Isn't it time to sign the contract?

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,519
Take it easy.

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,825
Let's get a room

54
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,120
and talk in it.

55
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
You brat!

56
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,700
Who do you think you're messing with?

57
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:09,525
Get lost with your contact!

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,960
What did you put in my drink?

59
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,479
Something that will turn you on.

60
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,550
Let go of me!

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,919
Let go of me!

62
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:42,319
Deal with that man.

63
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,120
And go to the hotel
where my wedding was held

64
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,325
and check the surveillance video
of that day.

65
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,675
Don't touch me.

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,479
Stay off me.

67
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,360
Don't worry, Shaoyan.

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,225
I won't let this happen again.

69
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,919
I'm so hot.

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,280
I don't want the quilt.

71
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,240
I don't want it.

72
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,325
My buttons...

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,199
Shaoyan.

74
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,319
Mm.
