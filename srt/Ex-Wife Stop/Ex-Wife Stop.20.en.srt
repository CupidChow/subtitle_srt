00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,039
Xiaoya,

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,825
how's your brother?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Mom.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,679
Ah?

6
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:22,500
Oh, Mom,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
he's all right.

8
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,760
He just had minor injuries.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,719
According to the doctor,

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,175
he can leave hospital in a day or two.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,760
You freaked me out!

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,719
Tell me

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,879
what on earth happened.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,079
What kind of guy hit him?

15
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:34,920
Mom,

16
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,280
it was...

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,799
It was me.

18
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:38,479
You?

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,350
What a girl!

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,799
Is there anything on my face?

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,000
Then why are you staring at me?

22
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,240
Because you look pretty.

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,079
I guess you're all right now.

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,880
I've been quite busy lately.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,159
I'm going back to my office.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,519
Ouch.

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,280
My head...

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,920
Ouch.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,800
What's wrong?

30
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:14,560
Come on.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,450
Let me check.

32
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,000
I feel much better.

33
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:31,375
It's Xiaoya's bad

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,675
for last night.

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,675
If you want to blame her,

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm definitely on your side.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Do you know it was
very dangerous last night?

38
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:44,280
Why did you save my life?

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,901
I made a mistake five years ago.

40
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,040
I'll no longer leave you

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
in danger alone.

42
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,480
But aren't you and Zhang Tianwei

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,439
- already in a relationship...?
- She and I are in no relationship.

44
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,719
In my life,

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,959
I've loved only one woman.

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,480
Her name is

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,675
Su Shaoyan.
