00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,480
Mr. Gu, to what do I

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,725
owe this honor?

4
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:20,679
Sorry, I reversed it.

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,199
Share Transfer Agreement?

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:26,925
Sheng Nanfang,

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,600
as the largest shareholder
of the Sheng's Group,

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,520
I'm informing you to hand over
your managerial authority

9
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,000
and the presidency.

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,479
Gu Yiran,

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,600
sounds like

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,725
you're sure to get what you want.

13
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:41,655
You flatter me.

14
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,200
May I ask why you want my corporation?

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,679
30 years ago,

16
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,679
my mother Gu Qingling

17
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,479
and your father Sheng Ye were a couple.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
They were even going to get married.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,560
Unexpectedly,

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,479
your family broke them up forcibly

21
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,250
and made him marry Miss Sheng.

22
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,079
They didn't care
that my mother was pregnant.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,680
So, you're my...

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,519
Since then,

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,239
my mother has been depressed.

26
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,000
When she knew Sheng Ye died
in an accident,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,480
she was further hurt.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,879
So, she's insane now.

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,239
When a stroke hits,
she can't even recognize me.

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,599
It's all

31
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,280
because of your family.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,480
The marriage of my parents
turns out to be wrong.

33
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,719
But it's the problem of our parents.

34
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,850
We're both victims.

35
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,359
What about now?

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,079
I've been loving Shaoyan for years.

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,000
Yet she loves no one, but you.

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,200
Even if you hurt her so many times,

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,359
she still doesn't give me
a little more attention.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Shaoyan decides who she loves.

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,280
We can have a fair competition.

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
Say no more.

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,799
At the shareholders' meeting next week,

44
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,680
your corporation will embrace
its new owner.

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,000
I heard about the problem
of your corporation.

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
What?

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,560
Is there too much trouble?

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,639
Shaoyan,

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,080
what if I lose everything

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,080
at the shareholders' meeting tomorrow?

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,280
I believe you're able
to make a comeback.

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,639
If the worst comes to the worst,

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
you can count on me.

54
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,975
Don't worry.

55
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,280
I won't easily be defeated.

56
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,975
I trust you.
