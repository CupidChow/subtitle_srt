2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,900
Are you done looking at me?

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,900
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,225
Hello.

5
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,325
Son,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,575
Tianwei woke up.

7
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:32,874
Okay. I'll be right there.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
Ma'am, why are you cooking personally?

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,275
Yeah.

10
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,119
Grandpa said

11
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,679
Nanfang would come back for dinner.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,975
Oh, I see.

13
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:48,150
Every time he comes back,

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,920
you cook for him personally.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,100
But he's never grateful.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,920
Sorry.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,600
It's okay.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,775
(Zhang Tianwei)
(Nanfang is with me.)

19
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,234
(He's not going back for dinner today.)

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,700
Ma'am, what happened?

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,375
Nothing.

22
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,680
Nanfang said he had some business to do

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
and he would not come back for dinner.

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,550
(Tianwei)

25
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:22,625
Mr. Sheng,

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,959
it's getting too late.

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,760
Go back home.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,560
Don't bother about me.

29
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:27,120
Okay.

30
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,425
(Su Shaoyan)

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,640
Are you

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,725
pregnant?

33
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,079
(Fu Xiwen, 27, Su Shaoyan's bestie)

34
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,560
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,400
He and I haven't even...

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,840
had sex.

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,879
What?

38
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,719
What a sleazy husband Sheng Nanfang is!

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,359
Why doesn't he cherish
such a good wife like you?

40
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,550
I'll go talk to him.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,799
Be... Be seated.

42
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,920
Don't get angry.

43
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,480
I was willing to marry him.

44
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,920
What's so special about Sheng Nanfang?

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,879
He always pulls a long face.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,799
In the college,

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,575
you had so many admirers,

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,575
especially Gu...

49
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,125
Excuse me.

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,759
Hello.

51
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:17,039
Oh, got it.

52
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,919
I'll be right back.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,300
Mom.

54
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,059
Xiaoya.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
What brings you here?

56
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,759
What?

57
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,520
I can't visit my son's house?

58
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,240
I don't mean that.

59
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,039
Why don't you tell me in advance

60
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,319
before you come next time?

61
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,650
(Shen Bihan, 50,
Sheng Nanfang's mother)

62
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,840
Then I can have
some food prepared for you.

63
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,599
You really take yourself
as the hostess of our family.

64
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,039
How shameless!

65
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,560
Xiaoya,

66
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,599
you're a girl.

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,439
Don't always talk so aggressively.

68
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,840
What do you think you are?

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,319
(Sheng Xiaoya, 20,
Sheng Nanfang's younger sister)

70
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,625
How dare you lecture me!

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Who knows what dirty trick

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,039
you and your useless grandma played

73
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,120
to have fooled my grandpa

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
so that he made my brother marry...

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,450
How dare you slap me!

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,919
Let go of me, Xiaoya.

77
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,879
What an ill-bred woman!

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,919
How dare you slap my daughter!

79
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,840
You ill-bred woman!

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,150
Let go of my daughter!

81
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,400
Ouch.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,925
- Mom!
- Mom!

83
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,806
What on earth happened?
