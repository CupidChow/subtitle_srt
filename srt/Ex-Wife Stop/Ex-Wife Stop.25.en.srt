00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:05,799
Gu Yiran,

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:07,679
are you sure

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,279
you want the Sheng's Group

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,759
and won't regret it?

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,839
Don't waste our time.

7
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,679
Just announce it.

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,679
OK.

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,120
Let me announce something.

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,725
This is

11
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,600
Mr. Gu Yiran, the new president

12
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,120
of our corporation.

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,280
Mr. Sheng, are you kidding?

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,600
We'll have
the bankruptcy reorganization.

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,079
Why do we have a new president now?

16
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:30,879
What did he mean?

17
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,159
You heard him.

18
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,225
Our corporation is

19
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,719
short of funds.

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,320
When someone wants to take it over,

21
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,550
it couldn't be better.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,520
I reviewed your proposal.

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,719
Those founding members

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
turn out to be old-fashioned,

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,359
presuming on their seniority,

26
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,719
so that our corporation
has made no progress

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,920
over so many years.

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,200
Looks like

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,850
we're in urgent need

30
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,751
of a reform.

31
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,799
Don't worry, Grandpa.

32
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,325
The new Sheng's Group

33
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,439
will emerge as we require.

34
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,439
Nanfang,

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,679
after thinking it over,

36
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,120
I decide to tell you something.

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,719
Someone wants to buy my shares
of the Sheng's Group.

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,079
Mr. Sheng,

39
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,480
Gu Yiran contacted the Zhang Family,

40
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,089
trying to buy their shares.

41
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,959
Sell him the shares,

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,680
as many as he wants.

43
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,719
You managed to buy shares
from Xiaoya and the Zhang Family

44
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,480
only because I sold them deliberately.

45
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,840
Sheng Nanfang, you!

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,319
I aimed to empty your funds.

47
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,250
The Sheng's Group you own

48
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,920
turns out to be a mere skeleton.

49
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:31,134
And your corporation

50
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,560
will be in crisis
due to the capital chain rupture.

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,525
Gu Yiran,

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,799
you lost again.

53
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,920
Sheng Nanfang!

54
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,760
Why, Xiwen?

55
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,200
What's so secret?

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
What on earth are we doing?

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,750
Don't ask.

58
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,799
I'm proposing to you, Miss Su Shaoyan.

59
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,430
In sickness and in health,

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,560
for poorer, for richer,

61
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,319
I will always be there by your side

62
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,840
and protect you.

63
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
The ring...

64
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,850
Right.

65
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,479
I've been taking it with me
in the past five years

66
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,479
because I hope

67
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,439
I could put it on for you again.

68
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Shaoyan,

69
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,919
marry me.

70
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,039
Mom, forgive Dad.

71
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,520
He knew he was wrong.

72
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,840
Right, Shaoyan.

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
Look how sincere he is.

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm sure he won't bully you again.

75
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,250
My point is

76
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,719
that he's using the ring
he bought five years ago

77
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,199
and he didn't even buy a new one.

78
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,120
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

79
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,375
Fine.

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,639
Then I'll have to agree

81
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
to marry you.

82
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,175
Come on. Kiss her.

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
- Shaoyan, may you be happy!
- Come on. Kiss her.

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,575
Mom, time to get up.

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,319
Mom, time to get up.

86
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,226
- Sweetheart, today is Sunday.
- Mom, time to get up.

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
Let me sleep for a little bit longer.

88
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,840
Lazy Mom, get up.

89
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
You promised to take me
to the amusement park.

90
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,675
Dad has got the breakfast ready.

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
All right, then.

92
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,919
Wow.

93
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,750
What a big breakfast!

94
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you, honey.

95
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,000
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

96
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,750
Um...

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm afraid

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,561
Little Moon will have

99
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,319
a baby brother or sister.

100
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,360
Really? Great news.

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,750
I'll call Godmother and Grandma
to tell them about it.

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,100
I love you.

103
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,275
I love you, too.
