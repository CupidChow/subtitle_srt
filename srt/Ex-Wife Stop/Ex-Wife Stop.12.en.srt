2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,400
What are you doing?

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,900
Stop!

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,160
You...

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,559
Nanfang.

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,280
Nanfang, aren't you supposed to explain?

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,679
Tianwei,

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,879
I told you we wouldn't be together.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,760
No way.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,850
Your mother is even preparing
for our wedding.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,384
Oh, I know.

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,275
It's because of her, right?

13
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,600
Over the years,

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,159
we're more like brother and sister...

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,975
Shut up!

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,320
Brother and sister?

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,159
Are you denying all my efforts on you

18
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,799
in the past dozen years?

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,700
Tianwei, calm down. Listen to me.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,000
I swear

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,920
I'll be your wife.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,175
What's up?

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,200
Mr. Sheng,

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
it's the invitation
to the charity party we sponsored.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,439
Let someone else go on my behalf.

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,125
But Miss Su is invited, too.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,959
Mrs. Sheng, what do I do?

28
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,200
I don't know if Nanfang is fascinated

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
by that woman or what.

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
I feel that he's a changed man.

31
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,000
Take it easy.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,599
He must be fascinated by her

33
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,600
in a moment of madness.

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,280
But Mrs. Sheng...

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,950
Don't worry.

36
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm on your side.

37
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,159
Mrs. Sheng,

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,879
why did you ask to meet me

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,079
in such a hurry?

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,025
Su Shaoyan,

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,225
looks like

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,319
I underestimated you.

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
Tell me.

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,879
How much money do you want?

45
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,560
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,250
Didn't you suddenly come back
and pester my son

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,625
just for the compensation

48
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,226
you failed to get from the divorce?

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,425
We're not

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,919
a stingy family.

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,319
As long as you promise

52
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,439
not to pester Nanfang,

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,199
name your price.

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,375
In this case,

55
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,075
I want...

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,759
Half of Sheng Nanfang's properties.

57
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,680
What do you think?

58
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,350
Su Shaoyan,

59
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
don't go too far!

60
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,280
Didn't you ask me to name my price?

61
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,639
What?

62
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,291
You can't afford it?

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,759
Then shut up

64
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,439
and don't tell me what to do.

65
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,150
You cheap girl! How dare you...

66
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,759
Mom!

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,650
What are you doing?

68
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,319
Nanfang?

69
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,650
Shaoyan, Shaoyan.

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,199
How was it going?

71
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
As soon as I called Sheng Nanfang,

72
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,840
he rushed over.

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,159
He didn't miss the fun, did he?

74
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,240
No. He was just in time.

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,879
But don't do this

76
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,964
ever again.

77
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,199
Why?

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,680
His mother asked for trouble.

79
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,639
Will you eat humble pie like before?

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,425
I just don't want to get involved
with his family anymore.

81
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:10,625
Nanfang,

82
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,560
I was just...

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,280
Mom,

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,759
stop seeing Su Shaoyan.

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,039
Stop arranging the wedding
for Tianwei and me, either.

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,280
Otherwise,

87
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,691
from next month,

88
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
I'll only afford the living expenses

89
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,010
and I'll no longer pay

90
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,825
for the credit card bills
of you and Xiaoya.

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,300
Your relatives

92
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,225
who stay in our corporation
but do nothing

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,425
will be fired immediately, too.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,960
Nanfang,

95
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,425
for such an unimportant woman,

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,319
you're so cruel to your mother?

97
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,520
Mom,

98
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,719
she isn't an unimportant woman.

99
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,639
She's my love.
