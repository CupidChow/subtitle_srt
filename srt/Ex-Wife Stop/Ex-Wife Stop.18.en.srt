2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,025
You're drunk now.

3
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:30,760
I'll let you go.

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
Go away.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,700
You brat!

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,600
Don't dream to flirt with me.

7
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,250
Dad, I want some milk.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,175
Okay.

9
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,280
I want some milk.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,275
All right.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,700
Nanfang, your breakfast is ready.

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,879
I'm in a hurry for work.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,519
It took me a long time to make it.

14
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,425
Just have a taste.

15
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:08,439
Enjoy it yourself.

16
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,879
Dad, I want some milk.

17
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,400
- I want some milk.
- Okay.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
- Okay, okay.
- Dad,

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,079
I want some milk.

20
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,550
Milk.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,525
Hurry, Dad.

22
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,100
Mom has come.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,959
The breakfast will be ready soon.

24
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,000
No, thanks.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,850
I'm not hungry.

26
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,025
Thank you

27
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,250
for last night.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,400
It's my duty to take care
of you and our daughter.

29
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,875
Shaoyan, let's get remarried.

30
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,159
Sheng Nanfang,

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,640
I loved you dearly.

32
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,040
I hated you, too.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,680
But now in my eyes,

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,719
you're only Little Moon's father,

35
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,640
just like a stranger.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Shaoyan, let me explain.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,675
I don't want to listen.

38
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,879
My heart was broken a long time ago.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,280
Yiran?

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,479
Why are you here?

41
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,075
Shaoyan, are you available?

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
I want to invite you to lunch.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,080
Mm.

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Thank you.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,300
Actually,

46
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,879
today is my birthday.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,919
I don't even get a present for you.

49
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,900
It's okay. Don't bother
to prepare a present.

50
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,919
I just want you to accept this.

51
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:03,360
Yiran,

52
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,725
what are you doing?

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,879
Shaoyan,

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,120
I swear

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,879
I'll always love you.

56
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,759
And I'll treat Little Moon

57
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,439
as my own daughter.

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,950
Thank you.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,350
But I can't

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,319
accept this.

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,879
Why?

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,475
All the time,

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,879
I've been respecting you

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,479
and I'm grateful to you.

65
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,400
But it's nothing about love.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,319
I'll take my leave.

67
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,225
(Take action as soon as possible!)

68
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,400
Yiran.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,080
Xiaoya, be seated.

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,039
Am I late?

71
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,680
No. I came too early.

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,025
I didn't expect you to ask to see me.

73
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,680
I thought you disliked me.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
Why would I?

75
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,879
You come from a good family.

76
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,879
You're clever and pretty.

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
A lot of young men like you.

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,400
But I'm interested in none of them.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,150
Yiran,

80
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,120
- I...
- Xiaoya,

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,800
I have something to tell you.

82
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
A friend of mine

83
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,560
thinks highly of the Sheng's Group.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
He wants to buy some shares

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,360
and become a shareholder.

86
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,240
I hear

87
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,360
you have 5% of the shares.

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,079
If you want to sell it,

89
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,360
he can offer a good price.

90
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Ah?

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,160
But...

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
It's okay.

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
If it's hard for you,

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,600
forget it.

95
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,360
Come on, Yiran,

96
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,319
wait a minute.

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,320
I...

98
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,240
I'll sell it to you, okay?

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,150
Thank you, Xiaoya.

100
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,319
Be seated.
