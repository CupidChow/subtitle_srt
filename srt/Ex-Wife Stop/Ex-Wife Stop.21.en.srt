2
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:14,919
I'll take my leave.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Shaoyan,

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,050
come and get me
out of the hospital tomorrow, okay?

5
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,519
Nanfang,

6
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,239
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,039
Look how rude Su Shaoyan was.

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,320
Xiaoya was just so angry that she...

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,000
Stop.

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,200
Think about what she did.

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,439
Why are you still defending her?

12
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,675
Check it carefully.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,719
Mrs. Sheng, Xiaoya,

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,039
how's Nanfang?

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,960
Tianwei,

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,200
I didn't expect you to do that.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,399
You really let me down!

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,840
Mrs. Sheng, what are you talking about?

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,520
Mom,

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,840
say no more with her.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,799
Let's go.

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,079
Here we are.

23
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,280
Get in on your own.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,400
Won't you get in?

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,480
No.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,840
I have a bad impression of this house.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,359
What are you doing?

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,840
Put me down.

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,159
Put me down.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
What do you want?

31
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,040
Put me down!

32
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,400
This is for you.

33
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,680
Boorish.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
Shaoyan, later I got to know

35
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,640
that the language of lavender is
waiting for love.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,319
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Say no more.

38
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,479
Hello, Mickey Mouse.

39
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,520
Hello.

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
Let's have fun together.

41
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,159
Wait a second.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
What's your name?

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I don't know.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,639
I don't have a name.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,479
Mom, why are you crying?

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,520
Did anyone bully you?

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,879
No.

48
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,879
I'm just reading Dad's diary.

49
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,719
Mom,

50
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,750
do you still like Dad?

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,319
I'm not sure.

52
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,775
Mom,

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,639
there was a singing contest

54
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,159
in the kindergarten today.

55
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,800
I won the first prize again.

56
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,175
You did?

57
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,225
Oh, my sweetheart.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,800
Tell me.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,840
What award do you want?

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,960
Mom will satisfy you.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,800
Anything I want?

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Mm.
