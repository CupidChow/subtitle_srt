2
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:11,599
Are you insane, Sheng Nanfang?

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,679
Some advice for you.
See a doctor if you're insane.

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,880
You're the one who asked for a divorce.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,559
Why are you still pretending

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,750
that you love me?

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,280
I asked for a divorce?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,399
Me?

9
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:30,440
Yiran,

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,679
sorry for what just happened.

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,640
It's okay.

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,750
Shaoyan,

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,884
what's your feeling

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,479
for Nanfang now?

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,679
I no longer have anything
to do with him.

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,039
Don't bring him up ever again.

17
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:44,399
Okay.

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,880
Mom, you're back?

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,225
Sweetheart.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,240
Today,

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,679
did you behave yourself
when staying with Godmother?

22
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,725
I did.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
No, she didn't.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,322
She's got

25
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,079
so many off-the-wall ideas.

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
She put me through it the whole night.

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,119
It's only because
you're not clever enough.

28
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,275
What...

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,159
Why did you come again?

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,050
The three of her family are having fun.

31
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:27,680
But you're here, drinking all alone.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,575
What a silly man!

33
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,950
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,239
Su Shaoyan had an affair
with Gu Yiran a long time ago.

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,359
They even have a daughter.

36
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,750
No way.

37
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:47,325
Look at this.

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,100
Nanfang,

39
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,950
a woman like Su Shaoyan

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,700
doesn't deserve your love.

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,700
I'm the one

42
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,799
who loves you most in this world.

43
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:17,424
Get off the car, sweetheart.

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Yiran,

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,960
thank you for driving us.

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,479
I don't know what else to say.

47
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,560
Shaoyan,

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,080
could you stop being so polite to me?

49
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:28,800
Sweetheart, say bye-bye to Mr. Gu.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Bye-bye.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,950
Bye-bye, Little Moon.

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,919
Bye-bye.

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,479
What do you want to tell me?

54
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,960
Mom,

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,680
I've grown up.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,520
I can come to kindergarten by myself.

57
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,319
I have to work overtime today.

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,759
When school is over,

59
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,400
Godmother will pick you up, okay?

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,479
Mm.

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,850
Go.

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,450
- Say bye-bye to Mom.
- Bye-bye.
