2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:05,785
Mom.

3
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:07,000
Mom, are you all right?

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,650
I didn't mean that.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,810
What on earth happened?

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,560
Look what a wife you've got!

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,919
Without a reason,

8
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,080
she just fought us.

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,000
Nanfang.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,920
What bad luck we have!

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,920
Why did you marry
such a malicious woman?

12
00:00:22,075 --> 00:00:23,359
Nanfang, that's not true.

13
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,359
Let me explain.

14
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,719
Apologize to Mom and Xiaoya immediately.

15
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,025
Don't you even let me explain

16
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,239
before you believe it's my fault?

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,039
You don't need to explain.

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,975
(Sorry.)

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,025
(Five years ago)
(Your grandpa died.)

20
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,738
(I'm sorry for your loss.)

21
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,466
Abandoning yourself
will solve no problem.

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,240
I got to know that when I was ten.

23
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:11,936
Nanfang,

24
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,079
actually,

25
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,079
do you not like

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,439
the blind date Grandpa arranged?

27
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,319
Sheng Nanfang,

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,799
because you fired me,

29
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,480
I even lost

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,280
my girlfriend.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,900
I'm gonna kill your girl!

32
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,879
If you have the guts,

33
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,359
come at me.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,680
Don't bully a girl.

35
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:49,840
Yiran,

36
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,275
thank you for driving me back.

37
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,810
We've been friends for years.

38
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:54,595
But you're still so polite to me.

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,499
You'll get sick.

40
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,675
Let me walk you in.

41
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't bother. I'm all right.

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,560
You may leave.

43
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,825
(Gu Yiran, 28,
president of the Gu's Group)

44
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,650
You're back home, at last.

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,575
When did you come back?

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,120
Why didn't you turn on the light?

47
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:36,879
You were just carrying on
with another man.

48
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:38,375
What?

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,080
Now you pretend to be innocent?

50
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,240
What do you mean?

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,439
Compared to me,

52
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,479
that man is far poorer.

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm afraid

54
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:46,725
you got the wrong guy.

55
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:49,776
What?

56
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,639
Trying to slap me?

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,150
You brat!
