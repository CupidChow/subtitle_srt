2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,960
(I loved him from afar for three years.)

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,775
(We've been married for six months.)

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,975
(I thought I finally realized my dream.)

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:13,480
(Unexpectedly,)

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,280
(I turn out to be a complete joke.)

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,239
Where's Su Shaoyan?

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,079
What?

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,399
Shaoyan is gone?

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,719
Are you sure you didn't see her?

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,760
I've been working overtime
in the office these two days.

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,825
Look at my dark circles.

13
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,305
I didn't have time to see her.

14
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,960
Let me know as soon as you find her.

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,480
Hey,

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,120
Sheng Nanfang, tell me what happened!

17
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,760
What a man!

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
What can his handsome face do?

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,119
Su Shaoyan,

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
don't let me find you.

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,840
Mom.

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,025
Son.

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,320
How's Grandpa?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,750
He's still being operated on.

25
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:06,825
(In Operation)

26
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,525
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

27
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:10,319
Doctor.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,640
Sorry, we did our best, but he's dying.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,359
Nanfang,

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,879
I shouldn't

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
have forced you

32
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,519
to marry Shaoyan.

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,800
But...

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,519
Grandpa,

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,450
now that

36
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,760
Nanfang loves someone else,

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,200
why don't we

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,200
cancel the wedding?

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
You saw

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,560
what happened today.

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,000
Do you really

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
want Nanfang to marry

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,275
such a woman?

44
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
I...

45
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,040
Shaoyan,

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,680
I will not live long.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,799
Please

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,425
do me the favor.

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,040
Why not

50
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,519
marry my grandson?

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,200
Nanfang

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,359
lost his father

53
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,439
when he was ten.

54
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,960
He appears

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,039
to be cold and heartless.

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,039
But actually,

57
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,114
he needs a woman

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,319
to care about him.

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,039
Okay.

60
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,400
I promise you.

61
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll try my best

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,050
to make him happy.

63
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
I... I'll leave

64
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,925
this family to you.

65
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,840
Grandpa.
