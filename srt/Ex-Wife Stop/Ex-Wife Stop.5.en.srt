2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,080
How could you be so foolish!

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,199
His mistress is bullying you,

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,720
but you're avoiding her.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,519
After all,

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,919
Zhang Tianwei knew Nanfang before me.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,039
Technically,

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,600
I'm the one who broke them up.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,679
Nonsense.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,120
If Sheng Nanfang really loves
that phony girl,

11
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,559
why did he marry you?

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,440
Since he married you,
he's been totally ignoring you.

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,320
Is that true?

14
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:26,039
Yiran,

15
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,199
why are you here?

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,679
I heard you were sick

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,839
and I came to check on you.

18
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,479
You would rather marry a man
who doesn't love you

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,000
than give me a chance?

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,039
Sorry, Yiran.

21
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,000
But I'm married.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,700
Nanfang,

23
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm not a homewrecker.

24
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,675
Why did they slander me?

25
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,880
All right.

26
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,280
I know you have a clear conscience,

27
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,900
okay?

28
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,320
Nanfang!

29
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,850
Are you going to see Su Shaoyan?

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,799
I'm going to the office for a meeting.

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,679
Mom,

32
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,560
I've arrived at the hospital.

33
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,240
Which ward is Tianwei in?

34
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,759
Yiran,

35
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,000
why are you here?

36
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,280
I came to visit a friend.

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,480
Are you available?

38
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,280
Shall we...?

39
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,280
I've got some business to attend to.

40
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,920
Investigate a girl named Fu Xiwen.

41
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,480
Xiwen,

42
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,439
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,760
Because of me,

44
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,120
you were fired.

45
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
It's okay.

46
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,239
I wanted to quit a long time ago.

47
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,959
But...

48
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,040
No buts.

49
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,519
If you feel sorry for me,

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,920
buy me a big dinner.

51
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,519
Order whatever you want.

52
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,519
I'm glad to hear that.

53
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,280
Go.

54
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,120
Nanfang.

55
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
May I have a word with you?

56
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:45,640
I'm busy.

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,959
Just two minutes.

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Go ahead, then.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,599
Xiwen offended you in the hospital.

60
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,680
I apologize to you on her behalf.

61
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,000
One minute left.

62
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,599
Xiwen just tried to defend me.

63
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,599
She didn't mean to be harsh.

64
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,640
If you're angry,

65
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,879
lose your temper on me.

66
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,359
Why did you play a dirty trick

67
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,800
so that Xiwen was fired?

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
I played a dirty trick?

69
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,879
You shouldn't have bullied a girl

70
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,925
just because you're powerful.

71
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,080
It's so rude of you, you know?

72
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:13,599
I'm telling you.

73
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,039
I do everything

74
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,075
fair and square.

75
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
I never play dirty tricks.

76
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:18,910
Are you sure?

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Believe it or not.

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I've been busy working

79
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,240
and I'll move out for a few days.

80
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,000
Stop.

81
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,600
Grandpa,

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,080
what did you come for?

83
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,719
Nanfang,

84
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,439
did you allow

85
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,879
the Zhang Family

86
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,000
to invest in our corporation?

87
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,719
You know they're ambitious

88
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,680
and being a minority shareholder
won't satisfy them.

89
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,350
For Zhang Tianwei,

90
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,599
will you even hand over

91
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,599
our family property to them?

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,879
It has nothing to do with Tianwei.

93
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,080
Speaking of ambition,

94
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,240
all founding members are ambitious.

95
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Their administration

96
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,159
will only lead our corporation
to a dead end.

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,950
Shut up!

98
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,240
How dare you!

99
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,879
You mustn't fool with our business

100
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,350
unless I no longer live.

101
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,280
Go.

102
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,879
Go get my whip.
