2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:05,679
Welcome.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,825
We're holding

4
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:08,640
a Valentine's Day special event.

5
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,080
If you take the best photo of kissing,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,119
you'll get a free Valentine's set.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,240
And a present.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,279
Is that true?

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,480
Dad, Mom,

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,719
kiss each other.

11
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,000
I want the present.

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,280
No. We'll skip it.

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,120
Don't. Don't.

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,079
You said I could get anything I wanted.

15
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,199
Don't lie to me.

16
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,239
Little Moon,

17
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,239
don't be ridiculous.

18
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,799
You mustn't break your promise
to our daughter.

19
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,624
What?

20
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,800
We'll do it.

21
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:43,526
Mr. Sheng,

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,240
someone has been

23
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,479
buying the shares of our corporation.

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,520
It's quite a lot.

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,525
Invite Mr. Li and other shareholders
to dinner for me.

26
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,126
(Dad, pick up the phone.)

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,880
(Dad, pick up the phone.)

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,759
(Dad, pick up the phone.)

29
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,600
(Dad, pick up the phone.)

30
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,159
Hello.

31
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,550
(Dad, Mom fainted!)

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,759
It's okay. I'm here.

33
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,640
Dad,

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,400
Mom fainted!

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,500
Dad.

36
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,519
Shaoyan.

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,519
Nanfang?

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,400
You just fainted.

39
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,799
I'll take you to the hospital
immediately.

40
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,519
Don't bother.

41
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,760
I know you work hard.

42
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
But you also have to
take care of yourself.

43
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,400
You freaked our daughter out.

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,959
Sweetheart,

45
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,700
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,775
Stop crying.

47
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,325
Dad, Mom,

48
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,825
you must always be with me.

49
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:38,575
Both of you.

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,050
Shaoyan, you're awake?

51
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,675
How do you feel?

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,040
Are you getting any better?

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,799
Much better after some sleep.

54
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,480
Where's Little Moon?

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,400
She's asleep.

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,079
I...

57
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
I made some chicken soup.

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Are you hungry?

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,599
You can make chicken soup?

60
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,275
Yeah.

61
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,159
I learned it from the video.

62
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,439
Would you like some?

63
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,199
Maybe later.

64
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,960
Ouch.

65
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,000
What's wrong?

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
Maybe because I was lying
for a long time,

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,800
my legs are numb.

68
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,400
How about now?

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Any better?

70
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Mm.

71
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,719
I feel much better.

72
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,650
You do?

73
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,625
But,

74
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,120
you'd better stop.

75
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,599
It makes me feel shy.

76
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,479
You're my wife. What makes you shy?

77
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,240
Bah.

78
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,479
Who's your wife?

79
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,851
Shaoyan,

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,879
I want to kiss you all my life.

81
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,825
May I?
