00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Miss Zhang,

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:13,839
you look gorgeous.

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,300
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,120
By the way,

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,039
where's Mr. Sheng?

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,280
I remember inviting him.

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:19,839
He's a little bit busy today.

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:20,760
He'll be arriving soon.

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,199
Mr. Gu,

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,480
welcome.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,600
Miss Su,

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,359
how stunning you are!

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,119
I'll count on you

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,079
for the first donation.

16
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,175
You flatter me, Mr. Wang.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,320
She's always flirting with men.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,320
What a woman of easy virtue!

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,799
Everybody,

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,359
thank you for coming

21
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,159
to my charity party.

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,880
All the donations

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,840
we collect tonight

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,880
will be given
to Qingcheng Children Fund.

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,039
Next,

26
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,159
Miss Su

27
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,975
will present the first pair of earrings.

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,920
We start the bidding at 3,000 yuan.

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,675
Up your offers.

30
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,120
10,000.

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,525
50,000.

32
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,760
200,000.

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,719
Mr. Gu offered a higher price

34
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,519
to make Miss Su happy.

35
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,680
200,000 going once.

36
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,850
Going twice.

37
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,825
300,000.

38
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,840
Mr. Sheng offered 300,000 generously.

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,079
400,000.

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,920
Mr. Gu offered 400,000.

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,825
What a surprise!

42
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:30,265
A pair of earrings
goes up to 400,000 yuan.

43
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
A million.

44
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,650
A million going once.

45
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,650
Going twice.

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,840
Sold.

47
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,475
Mr. Sheng, I'd like to thank you

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,680
on behalf of the children in need.

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,640
There's no need to thank me.

50
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,480
Our corporation is also keen on charity.

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,480
The earrings

52
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:56,914
look great on you.

53
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:57,680
Keep them.

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,239
No, thanks.

55
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,599
Then have a drink with me. Okay?

56
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,650
We didn't know
Mr. Sheng could be so romantic.

57
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,825
Miss Su is indeed charming.

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,759
Mr. Gu,

59
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,960
what's your relationship

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,520
with Miss Su?

61
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
I've been loving her since college.

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,159
Unfortunately, she has loved no one,

63
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,720
but Sheng Nanfang.

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Shaoyan,

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
you look gorgeous.

66
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,680
Stop saying that

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
in case others misunderstand us.

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,599
Misunderstand us?

69
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,599
Who will?

70
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,759
Gu Yiran?

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Yes, so what?

72
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,080
You're not in a relationship
with him, surely?

73
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,120
What if I am?
