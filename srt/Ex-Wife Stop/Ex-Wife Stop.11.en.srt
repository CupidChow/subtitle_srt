2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,439
Come on in.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,400
Mr. Sheng.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
I had it investigated.

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:13,800
Miss Su Shaoyan

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,160
went to France five years ago.

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,760
She was using a French name, Julia.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,839
She came back to China
not a long time ago.

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,320
No wonder I failed to find her.

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:20,960
Okay. I get it.

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,760
Get to your business.

12
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,879
Miss Zhang has come.

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,160
Tell her I'm not in.

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:33,880
Miss Zhang,

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,719
Mr. Sheng is out of the office

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,439
for some business.

17
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,759
How about coming some other day?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,799
Wait.

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,520
Ji Chengyang,

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,875
since Su Shaoyan came back to China,

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,119
has Nanfang met her privately?

22
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,640
It's Mr. Sheng's private business.

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,679
Subordinates like me

24
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,399
know nothing about it.

25
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,719
I'll go get you a cup of coffee.

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,240
Don't think I can't figure it out.

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,350
I'm sorry. Sorry.

28
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,079
It's okay.

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,599
Zhang Tianwei?

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,360
Long time no see.

31
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,359
Su Shaoyan?

32
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,239
It's really you.

33
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,439
Why are you here?

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,959
I'm working, obviously.

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,359
Unlike you, rich girls,

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,840
I have to make a living.

37
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,280
When you divorced my brother,

38
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,600
didn't you get any compensation?

39
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,840
Help yourselves.

40
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,280
Wait.

41
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,519
What?

42
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,159
Get us two cups of coffee.

43
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,920
We're friends of your director.

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,550
Here's your coffee.

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,879
Enjoy it.

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,410
Director Su,

47
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,000
all department leaders are ready.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,040
The meeting begins momentarily.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,375
Okay, I see.

50
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,760
What did you call her?

51
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,492
This is our director, Su Shaoyan

52
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:54,599
dispatched from our headquarters

53
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,400
in France.

54
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
So, Miss Zhang, you thought

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,325
you were a friend of mine?

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,319
Sorry,

57
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,040
but I don't think I'm your friend.

58
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,480
Go.

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,975
Let's go have the meeting.

60
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,319
Oops.

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,639
Let me drive you home.

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,625
No, thanks, Mr. Sheng.

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,201
Shaoyan,

64
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:21,599
have a word with me.

65
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,360
Sorry,

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,825
but I have a date with my boyfriend.

67
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,960
Come with me.

68
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,340
Sheng Nanfang, let go of me!

69
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,575
Let go of me!

70
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,455
Let me go!

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,899
What on earth do you want?

72
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,475
Believe it or not,

73
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,919
I'll call the police.

74
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,159
Just get to the point.

75
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,879
I don't have time to waste on you.

76
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,759
Shaoyan,

77
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,175
I won't hurt you.

78
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,300
(Since Grandpa passed away,)

79
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,759
(it's been a long time)

80
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,039
(since someone called me that
last time.)

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Don't call me that.

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,159
You don't deserve it.

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,475
Hello, Yiran.

84
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,560
Sorry,

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
but I'm held up...

86
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
Your date is canceled.

87
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,240
What's wrong with you, Sheng Nanfang?

88
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,319
Why do you think
you can cancel the date for me?

89
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,680
Give my phone back to me.

90
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,719
Shaoyan,

91
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,680
I just want a talk with you.

92
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,000
Calm down

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
and listen to me.

94
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,960
I don't want to listen to you
or calm down.

95
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,280
Give my phone back to me.

96
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,639
Give it back to me!

97
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,560
Give it back!
