2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,950
Grandpa.

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,080
Grandpa.

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,400
Let me flog you,

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,359
you ridiculous son.

6
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:12,960
Grandpa.

7
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:14,599
Shaoyan.

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,250
Grandpa,

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,440
I don't know what exactly happened.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,879
But times have changed.

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,640
Nanfang made sense, too.

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,440
Why don't you put away your biases

13
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:24,325
and listen to him?

14
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,079
Today,

15
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,679
for Shaoyan's sake,

16
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:29,679
I'll let you go.

17
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:30,615
You idiot,

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,480
think about

19
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,240
who you should truly cherish.

20
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,386
(Hello, Shaoyan.)

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,320
(My company asked me to return to work.)

22
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
(They not only apologized to me,)

23
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,875
(but also gave me a pay rise.)

24
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,799
(So, it's not Sheng Nanfang
who tricked me,)

25
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,546
(but Zhang Tianwei.)

26
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,550
I blamed you wrongly

27
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,679
for Xiwen's problem.

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,479
It's okay.

29
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,425
I just don't allow anyone

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,250
to take reckless action

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,679
in my name.

32
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,320
Anyway,

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,359
thank you.

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,850
This ointment is effective for healing.

35
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,675
You can hardly apply it by yourself.

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,120
Let me help you.

37
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:12,250
If you don't answer,

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
I'll take it as a yes.

39
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:22,000
Did I hurt you?

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
I'll be gentle.

41
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:26,079
You...

42
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,175
Go out.

43
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,920
Take the ointment with you.

44
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:31,319
You're wounded, too.

45
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:32,840
Apply it.

46
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,400
I think

47
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,159
Nanfang appears

48
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,775
to be insensitive.

49
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,040
But actually,

50
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
he's very gentle.

51
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,519
I believe

52
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,625
as long as I'm true to him,

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,280
he'll feel my love.

54
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,359
Yes, yes.

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,120
Anyway,

56
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
your husband is perfect.

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,640
Sheng Nanfang

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
must have done great things
in his previous life

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,400
so that he has such a good wife
this life.

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
Don't exaggerate.

61
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,039
Anyway, if he dares to bully you again,

62
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,950
I will...

63
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,080
Nanfang,

64
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:32,680
why did you ignore my calls?

65
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,439
Tianwei?

66
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,879
Why are you also here?

67
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,975
Tianwei, calm down.

68
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,025
Stay with me tonight, will you?
