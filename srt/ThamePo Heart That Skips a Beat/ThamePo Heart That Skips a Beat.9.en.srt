1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,560
Why do I have to play
this stupid game with you?

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,880
Because this'll be
a long conversation,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,920
both about the song and Po.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Stop nitpicking me already.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,480
You don’t even have feelings for him.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,200
What if I do?

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
I thought you were going to accuse me of
jumping to conclusions about Thame again.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,120
I won’t scold you anymore.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,840
Why?

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,840
It’s because I’ve realized

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,840
you’re not just imagining it on your own.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,760
I also remember our movie date promise.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,320
Can I watch this movie
in your room tonight?

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
- Just one box, right?
- Yes.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,120
My room is a mess.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,040
I didn’t expect anyone to come.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,120
Can you close your eyes for a second?

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,319
Give me two minutes.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,760
It's not messy at all.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
If we're using this one,
you don’t need to tidy up the rest.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
That way, we won’t finish too late.

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,880
Well…

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Well,

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,600
how about we eat something first?

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
You haven’t eaten anything, right?

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,880
You must be hungry.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,440
I’ll… find you something to eat.

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,200
It’s nice.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,320
We can adjust the light, too.

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
How bright do you want it?

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
That’s up to you.

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,080
If we make it completely dark,
I think the mood will be better.

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
But…

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,080
since it’s our first time,

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
I’d rather see your face clearly.

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,720
- Ouch!
- Hey!

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,920
- Hey, relax. Hey.
- Take it off or your skin will swell.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey.

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,240
Huh? It doesn't feel hot?

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,120
It doesn’t.

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
Good thing I didn’t plug it in.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,640
I’ll make a new one for you.

43
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,440
You should clean up.

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
The bathroom’s over there.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,080
I’ll find you some clothes to change into.

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Okay.

47
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,160
I made you a late-night meal.
Enjoy.

48
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
How about you take a shower while I eat?

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,960
It’ll help you feel more comfortable.

50
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,200
Why do you have so many pictures
of yourself crying?

51
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,520
My mom told me
I was such a crybaby when I was a kid.

52
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,520
I’d cry over small things.

53
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,040
What about now?

54
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
Are you still a crybaby?

55
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,360
I’m not anymore.

56
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,280
That’s good.

57
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
What’s this?

58
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,840
It’s a fabric sample book.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,920
Uncle Joei gave it to me when
I first started working at his suit shop.

60
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Why are you enjoying it this much?

61
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,760
I’m just happy

62
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,880
to learn what you like.

63
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,760
You kept the giveaway
with my picture on it?

64
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,680
Oh, hey. It’s not what you think.

65
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,520
Baifern hired me to design it,

66
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
so I kept it as a memory.

67
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,640
It’s work I like.

68
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,880
I mean it.

69
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,840
I even kept the file.

70
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
I believe you, then.

71
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,240
I didn’t just make yours.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,160
I made Jun’s too.

73
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,040
Here.

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,960
Why does Jun’s say "One and Only",

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,560
while mine just says "Happy Birthday"?

76
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
Well,

77
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,520
that’s what the client asked for.

78
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,400
How much did they hire you?

79
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,440
I want one like this too.

80
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
Thame.

81
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
I’m being serious here.

82
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Won’t you check the other shelves?

83
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,039
I won’t.

84
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,400
I want to watch a movie now.

85
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,600
I need to forget what
just burned into my mind.

86
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,679
"One and only," whatever.

87
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,160
Did you go in there?

88
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
I sure did.

89
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,640
I went to get my money from the guard,
but I was kicked out not long after.

90
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,640
I don't know.

91
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,040
I guess it's just like any other hotel.

92
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,000
Nothing special.

93
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
How so?

94
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
I don’t know
if I’ll ever see the day that…

95
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
You aren’t watching anymore?

96
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Well,

97
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,520
I’m watching through
the reflection in your eyes.

98
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,240
Let me…

99
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,000
go home now.

100
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,440
Dudes, come out quickly.

101
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,080
We need to film the line sync now,
or we won’t get it edited in time.

102
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,880
Fine. I’m here.

103
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,040
I’m here. I’m here. I’m here. I’m here.

104
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,000
Are you done?

105
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,680
Where’s Thame?

106
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
I think he’s meeting us
at the filming location.

107
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,560
He said he watched the movie
at Po’s place last night.

108
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,880
I bet he didn’t come home.

109
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,120
Let’s go.

110
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,720
What’s wrong?

111
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,800
You came home?

112
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,560
I finished watching the movie,
so I had to come home, didn’t I?

113
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,920
Wait. Are you saying you didn’t--

114
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,040
Didn’t?

115
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,360
I did.
Of course I watched the movie.

116
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,480
I even secretly bought coffee
and some sour candy

117
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,280
so I wouldn’t fall asleep
while he watched his favorite movie.

118
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,520
But the movie was so fun
that I didn’t eat anything.

119
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,840
And after that?

120
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,160
So… What do you mean?

121
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,280
Well, Thame,

122
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,800
he just wanted to know
if you slept with Po already.

123
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Hey.

124
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,880
It was my first time going to his room.

125
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
I should show some respect, shouldn’t I?

126
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,440
Jun.

127
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,240
Showing some respect is good, Thame.

128
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
But you should have figured out
if he wanted some respect

129
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,920
or something else.

130
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,520
I asked him to watch a movie with me,

131
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,960
so I was supposed
to actually watch it, right?

132
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,240
Didn’t you know this sentence is slang?

133
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,360
It doesn’t always mean
"Let’s watch a movie" literally.

134
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,000
It can also mean "Let’s have sex."

135
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,520
Yeah.

136
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,440
Do you think

137
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
he knows that slang?

138
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,640
Hey. But with things like this,
if the mood isn't right,

139
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,720
you don't have to force it.

140
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Does that mean
the mood wasn't right back then?

141
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,480
Looking at him,

142
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,640
I think the mood was definitely right,

143
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,320
but he probably made a U-turn.

144
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,760
I ruined the date, didn’t I?

145
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,920
Certainly. Did you just realize it?

146
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,600
<i>Play deaf da dub dub da dub</i>

147
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,400
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

148
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,840
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

149
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,400
<i>Don’t care what they say, I play deaf</i>

150
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,640
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

151
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,280
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

152
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

153
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
<i>Don’t care what they say, I play deaf</i>

154
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,080
<i>Who says what?</i>
<i>I’m not listening, my heart’s too loud</i>

155
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,720
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

156
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>Sorry, I’m not listening</i>
<i>My heart’s too loud</i>

157
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,280
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

158
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,480
Cut.

159
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,240
Hey, Po.

160
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,400
Yeah?

161
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,720
About last night,

162
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
I’m sorry

163
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,560
I left so suddenly.

164
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,040
It’s all right.

165
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,440
But…

166
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,160
I didn’t…

167
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,480
What do you mean?

168
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,840
I didn’t…

169
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Eh?

170
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,440
I didn’t finish watching the movie.

171
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,560
Next time, I’ll watch
a movie at your place again.

172
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,280
Yeah.

173
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,040
But once your song is out,

174
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
you’re going to be super busy, right?

175
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,360
Let’s wait until this phase is over,
and we can talk about it then,

176
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,560
so you won’t feel tired.

177
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,600
I’m not tired at all.

178
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
Next time,

179
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,520
I’ll definitely do it better.

180
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,640
Okay.

181
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Yay, it’s done!

182
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Finally!

183
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,800
- We did it. We did it.
- We’re awesome, right?

184
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Yes!

185
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,560
This is just right.

186
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,160
Come on.

187
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,040

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,800
<i>I watched the new MV already!</i>
<i>They all look amazing!</i>

201
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,200
<i>They all look super handsome in the MV!</i>
<i>Did you watch it?</i>

202
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,000
This is why I want to ask you for help.

203
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,520
What should we do

204
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,040
to make MARS’ song
beat Ice’s on every chart

205
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
by the end of this month?

206
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,160
Do everything we can!

207
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,320
The easiest way is to top the chart
that uses the voting points first.

208
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,720
Ice already won
with this song a while ago,

209
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,560
and it even got an award before.

210
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,320
<i>I don’t think their fandom</i>
<i>would go all out voting for it anymore.</i>

211
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>As for the other charts,</i>
<i>let’s boost the views and stream the song.</i>

212
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,880
Hey, but the most important thing
is the press tour.

213
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,600
<i>But it’s the company’s responsibility.</i>

214
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,120
What if the company won’t do it?
Who else can help us with the press tour?

215
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,080
God, of course.

216
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,360
<i>And the customer is God.</i>

217
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,240
Huge thanks to our main sponsor,
Brainy’s Essence of Chicken,

218
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,680
for bringing MARS to meet us today.

219
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,480
They’ve just released their latest single.

220
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,120
Yeah. Please support MARS’
new single titled "Who Says".

221
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,080
SONG: WHO SAYS
ARTIST: MARS

222
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,040
<i>Bad boy</i>

223
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,840
<i>They say I seem like this or that</i>
<i>Like I’m a</i>

224
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,800
<i>Bad boy</i>

225
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,440
<i>They assume I gotta be this or that</i>
<i>Like a real</i>

226
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
<i>Bad boy</i>

227
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,680
<i>Don’t know me but no hesitations</i>
<i>To make assumptions</i>

228
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>Bad boy</i>

229
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
<i>Hey, ask first would be nice</i>

230
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,880
<i>Do you know me enough to judge me?</i>

231
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,440
<i>Are you the referee handing down a degree?</i>

232
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,480
<i>Jump to conclusions</i>
<i>Then come to critique me</i>

233
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
<i>What right do you have to decide</i>
<i>Who I should be?</i>

234
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,200
<i>Your friends say I’m not the one for you</i>

235
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,000
<i>But I don’t like your friends</i>
<i>I like you</i>

236
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,800
<i>The only one I’ll listen to is you</i>

237
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,800
<i>Not your crew</i>

238
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,880
<i>Say I’m wrong in so many ways, alright</i>

239
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,440
<i>Like I’m supposed to care about their lies</i>

240
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,920
<i>Tell me I should do this</i>
<i>I should do that, why?</i>

241
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,160
<i>Our business isn’t for anyone else to mind</i>

242
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,440
<i>Play deaf da dub dub da dub</i>

243
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,240
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

244
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,760
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

245
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>Don't care what they say, I play deaf</i>

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,920
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

247
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,800
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

249
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,240
<i>Don't care what they say, I play deaf</i>

250
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,040
<i>Who says what? I’m not listening</i>
<i>My heart’s too loud</i>

251
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,960
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

252
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,560
<i>Sorry, I'm not listening</i>
<i>My heart's too loud</i>

253
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,560
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

254
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,560
<i>Hello? What are you doing?</i>

255
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
Go to bed already.

256
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I can stay by myself.

257
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,520
I still have a lot of work to do.

258
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,520
That’s cute.

259
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,080
You miss me, huh?

260
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,440
When I'm outside,
I have to keep my distance from you.

261
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,280
It's really frustrating.

262
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,360
But you make me feel like…

263
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,480
…we’re not far apart at all.

264
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,960
<i>Tonight,</i>

265
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
<i>I’ll watch a movie in your room.</i>

266
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,560
- This is food support for all the staff.
- Oh, thanks a lot, Thame.

267
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,080
<i>Hello, everyone</i>
<i>who’s watching this live streaming.</i>

268
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,760
<i>Today, we’re with the famous idol group.</i>

269
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
<i>Let’s just say, everyone knows them.</i>

270
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,520
<i>Today, we’re with MARS!</i>

271
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
<i>Hello. We’re MARS!</i>

272
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
<i>Oh wow, that totally brightens my heart!</i>

273
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
<i>All five of you are here with us today.</i>

274
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,960
<i>But we're not just here to chill today.</i>

275
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,520
<i>You're here to promote</i>
<i>your new single, right?</i>

276
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,080
<i>Please introduce your new single.</i>

277
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,360
TONIGHT, I’LL WATCH A MOVIE IN YOUR ROOM

278
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,760
YEAH.

279
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,240
Why are you laughing?

280
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I miss you.

281
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,280
I miss you, too.

282
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,240
Po!

283
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,840
Open the door.

284
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,880
Go hide.

285
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,520
Po, what are you doing?

286
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,840
Po!

287
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,680
Po!

288
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,440
Is something up?

289
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
I’ve already figured out

290
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
who Mr. A and Mr. B are.

291
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,880
You’re Mr. A,

292
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,640
and Mr. B is someone
connected to MARS, right?

293
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,520
See? The first photo
is from around the group’s house.

294
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,040
The second photo is from
your documentary filming job.

295
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,680
The third photo has their items,

296
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,960
shirt sleeves, and food.

297
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,120
Do you think I won’t recognize them?

298
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,240
I saw all those things
even before you knew them.

299
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,440
This is pretty clear, don’t you think?

300
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,720
Hold on, Fern. I can explain this.

301
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Stop.

302
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,120
Then you suddenly got all into MARS.

303
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
You voted, streamed,

304
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,240
- and asked me to do it even before I did.
- Fern, listen up.

305
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Stop.

306
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,000
You’re dating Mick, right?

307
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,240
Huh?

308
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,800
Am I right?

309
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
I remember that shirt sleeve.

310
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
He wore it when we met.

311
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,200
Now, you’re helping Mick’s work, huh?

312
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,040
- Well…
- Well? Eh?

313
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
Speechless?

314
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Come on, Po.

315
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,200
Seriously?

316
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,920
Mick is no different
from that jerk Earn at all.

317
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,880
Please.

318
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,640
If you’re going to be in a relationship
or date someone,

319
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,600
find a better partner, okay?

320
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Gosh, my migraine is acting up.

321
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,320
Hey. You’ve gone too far.

322
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,720
Lately, more fans have been following me,

323
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,040
so I preferred posting
on my close friend list.

324
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,000
Some of those photos you said
have their arms and legs?

325
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,280
Those are your photos.

326
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
I can’t post them too obviously,
or else it’d be like dropping spoilers.

327
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,960
Are you sure?

328
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,040
Of course.

329
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,080
Go back already.

330
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,040
I’m busy. I’m about to go to bed.

331
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,960
Let go!

332
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,880
I can walk by myself.

333
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,280
Be careful of my face, okay?

334
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,360
Hey!

335
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,440
Shoot…

336
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,000
I’m no longer a kid
who will just hide someone in my room.

337
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,680
I didn’t think that

338
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,720
you’re hiding him in your room.

339
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,600
I’m just trying to look for some evidence,

340
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
to see if I can find…

341
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,520
something to pin on you.

342
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,400
Let’s do this.

343
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,600
If you want me to quickly
head back, admit it.

344
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,000
I’m not in the talking stage with anyone.

345
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,120
Then, why do you have two pillows?

346
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,760
You usually keep that in your closet

347
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
if nobody is sleeping over.

348
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Fern!

349
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,800
Po, you…

350
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,200
Hey, I can explain this.

351
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,840
You’re getting back together
with that jerk Earn?

352
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,520
This is his, and this one is also his.

353
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,880
His pillow and these clothes,

354
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
not to mention the sandwich
you once ate every day.

355
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,480
Po!

356
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,760
Ouch!

357
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,760
Mick is even a better option.

358
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,640
Why are you so worried
about that jerk, huh?

359
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
No!

360
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,760
We’re not getting back together,
seriously.

361
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
If you didn’t get back together with him,
did you do something else?

362
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,840
No!

363
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Just leave, okay?
You’re suspecting nonsense.

364
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,520
If you’re here just for this,
then just leave already.

365
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I have a meeting in ten minutes. Leave!

366
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,720
Po!

367
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,680
Thame.

368
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,760
You can come out now.

369
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,920
My friend left.

370
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
No.

371
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Are you okay?

372
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,640
The sandwich you bought for me

373
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,920
is your ex’s favorite?

374
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
Well,

375
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,720
in the past, it was our favorite shop.

376
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Our?

377
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,320
And why are you still keeping his clothes?

378
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,560
It’s just clothes, Thame.

379
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,080
And why are you still keeping them?

380
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,320
Well…

381
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,880
Which ones are his?

382
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,360
This one is also his.

383
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,240
Huh?

384
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,840
Thame,

385
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,480
it’s just comfy to wear,
so I didn’t throw it away.

386
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
You’re still wearing his clothes?!

387
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,520
Well, yes.

388
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,120
I mean, I don’t wear them anymore.

389
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,560
I don’t even use any.

390
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,360
Keeping them takes up space, right?

391
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,560
I’ll pack them tonight to donate.

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,800
FOR DONATION

393
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,760
I’ll be right back.

394
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,120
You’ve got a new one now.

395
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,280
Throw this one away.

396
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,440
Okay.

397
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,320
Come with me now.

398
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,720
Where are we going?

399
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,240
The sandwich shop.

400
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Bro, if this guy comes
to buy your sandwich again,

401
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,280
don’t sell him tuna.

402
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,680
He can’t eat tuna anymore.

403
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,320
- He’s allergic to it.
- Eh?

404
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
You suddenly became allergic to it?

405
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,280
Well…

406
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah.

407
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
He broke out in a rash.

408
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,280
From now on,
just sell him his regular order, BLT.

409
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,600
As for the other…

410
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,360
What does he not like to eat?

411
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Well,

412
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
he doesn’t eat beef.

413
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Yeah. The other one
must be steak and cheese,

414
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
the one and only, forever.

415
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,720
This exact order only, okay?

416
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
He won’t buy anything else
because he’s allergic to all the rest.

417
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
Sure.

418
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
Take two, then.

419
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,840
I’ll give you extra
since the shop is closing soon.

420
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,680
Please give me extra veggies.

421
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,080
Sure.

422
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,040
I’m sorry.

423
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,320
You’re really angry, right?

424
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,760
No.

425
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,440
I’m mad because I’m jealous.

426
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,800
Got it.

427
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,280
Are you still smiling?

428
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,800
Is there anything else
we need to clear up?

429
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,360
No more.

430
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,280
My room is empty now.

431
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,720
Let’s go then.

432
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,640
Where again?

433
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,000
Add my stuff to your room.

434
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,480
"The sound of footsteps followed.

435
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,640
He could no longer run forward.

436
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,280
If he continued to run,

437
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,040
it wouldn’t be long
before they caught up."

438
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,600
"The towering young man

439
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,720
made his way into a house.

440
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,240
When he stopped running,

441
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,160
the chill crept in.

442
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,160
The man walked over to the radiator…"

443
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,120

446
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,040
<i>That’s up to you.</i>

447
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,880
<i>I don’t know if you’re going</i>
<i>to call me that, but I will.</i>

448
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,719

449

Go to Oner Entertainment, please.

<i>I’ll come to see you again tonight.</i>

451
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,120
The sequence is as we talked about.

452
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,120
Got it.

453
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,920
Hey,

454
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,360
let’s do our best.

455
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,400
If we win this chart,

456
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,080
we stand a high chance to all-kill.

457
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,240
I’m sure we can do it.

Bros.

459
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Why are you looking so serious?

460
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,040
Hey, I’m bringing you some drinks.

461
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,400
Drink it before we perform,
so you’ll feel refreshed.

462
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,560

<i>You finally won a music show.</i>

494
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,760

<i>I thought</i>

<i>you’re taking me to eat at a secret place.</i>

<i>I don’t do what Jun does.</i>

502
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,840
<i>I have my own style.</i>

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
<i>It’s delicious.</i>

504
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,600

507
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,360

<i>Just staying with you</i>

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,840
<i>I mean it.</i>

512
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,360
<i>But…</i>

513
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,600
<i>I want you to do something</i>
<i>for yourself, too.</i>

<i>Being with you is what I do for myself.</i>

515
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,600
Did you go in there?

516
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,440
I sure did.

517
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,000
I went to get my money from the guard,
but I was kicked out not long after.

518
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,200
Is it pretty inside?

519
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,360
I don't know.

520
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,080
I guess it's just like any other hotel.
Nothing special.

521
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,080
Are you staying here for good?

522
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,440
I want to, honestly.

523
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,000
So, the traitor I’ve been searching
for isn’t Jun, but Po, right?

524
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,840
What did you do to him?

525
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,120
Leave all of MARS’ footage with Tae.

526
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,520
