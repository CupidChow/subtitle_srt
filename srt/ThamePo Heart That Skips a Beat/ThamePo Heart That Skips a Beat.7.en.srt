1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Well, I’m in a relationship now.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,720
<i>I figured it out now.</i>

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,680
It’s Gam.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,720
<i>Don’t break up with her.</i>

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,720
<i>I believe that we can both work as a group</i>

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>and like someone at the same time</i>

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>because both are part of our lives.</i>

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,720
<i>Since we have time,</i>
<i>we should have watched the movie.</i>

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,880
Can we watch it next week?

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,360
Let’s not keep a five-meter distance

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,160
because even five centimeters
feels too far apart.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,720
LOVE YOU TO DEBT
LIFE, ROMANTIC / 135 MINUTES

THAME AND DYLAN SONG DISCUSSION
6 P.M. - 10 P.M.

THAME RECORDS THE DEMO 7 P.M. - 8.30 P.M.

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
DRAFT THE MV REF 9.00 P.M. - 11.00 P.M.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
What’s wrong?

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,440
Per,

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,880
help me.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,400
So, you haven't watched the movie
with him yet?

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Uh-huh.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,760
Lucky enough, you’ve met someone
who understands you.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,560
All right. I’ll help.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,600
How about we move this to that day?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,760
We must work hard all day one day.

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Are you okay with that? See?

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
You can save this date
and go to the movies with him.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,440
All right. I’ll call and ask him now.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,960
Thame!

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
Let’s finalize the new single already.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
So, will a breakdance be included?

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,040
You must decide as soon as possible.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,680
The work scale is different, you know.

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,280
- I must quickly plan the work.
- Thame.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,120
I can’t decide
until I get to listen to both versions.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,280
Record a guide demo for me, okay?

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
You can use the old lyrics.

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,800
Hey, it looks like
we’ve got a free day, right?

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
I’ll book that day then.

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,120
THAME - DYLAND RECORD THE SONG

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,720
So we can wrap it up quickly.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,960
I’ll put mine here.

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,400
FINALIZE THE DANCE WITH THAME

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,120
THAME

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,880
Hello?

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
<i>Po,</i>

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
<i>I’m sorry.</i>

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,120
I still can’t make time for our movie day.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
But if there’s a day
I finish my work quickly,

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
I’ll call you right away.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,880
It might be a bit abrupt.

51
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
<i>I really can’t promise when.</i>

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
It’s all right. I understand.

53
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
<i>I’ve been really busy these days.</i>

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,880
But Per told me that

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,080
when he’s busy,

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,480
he will send Gam photos
to let her know what he’s doing.

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,400
Are you okay with that?

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
Yeah.

59
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,640
Okay.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,160
But if you’re not familiar
with doing that,

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
don’t worry at all.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
I can handle it just fine.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,400
And you’re not even going to ask me

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
if I can handle it just fine too?

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,080
Anyway,

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
I’ll make time to watch
the movie with you.

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,720
I promise.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah.

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,160
I’ll wait.

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
Sure.

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Let’s stock up on a bunch of stuff, okay?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,960
For late-night snacks and all that.

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,680
It looks like we have to work
all day and night.

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,680
Yeah. That sounds like a good idea.

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,320
I think we should stock up
on lots of ready-to-eat food

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,640
because someone who loves ordering food

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,760
is never around
when it’s time to work together.

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Eh?

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,320
That’s because you guys split up and work.

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,440
I’m on my own.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
How can I be with you all everywhere, huh?

82
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,120
So, we’re going to be busy
both day and night, right?

83
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
Of course.

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Otherwise, we won’t be left
with any time to work on the MV.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
Hey, but…

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
I think we can start working
on our MV now.

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,600
But we need someone to help you, Thame.

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
I’m not available.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
I’m not talking about you.

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
I’m talking about Po.

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,640
I think he can help us.

92
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,560
That makes sense.

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,120
- He’s a director.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,680
I agree with that,

95
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
so our secret about making music
won’t get leaked.

96
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,800
Well done, bro.

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
How about his own work?

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
It seems he’s busy too.

99
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,760
Come to think of it, you’ve already got
a lot of work too, buddy.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,440
Let’s put it this way then.

101
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
I’ll take care of the MV.

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
You’re acting strange, Jun.

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
Eh?

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,000
I’m just trying to help out.

105
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,320
Why are you so suspicious?

106
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
So, it’s settled now.

107
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
I’ll get going.

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Hey, hold on. What about the welfare work?

109
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,720
Eh?

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,160
You all can help each other
with that, okay?

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,640
Bye-bye.

112
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,000
This way, it plays right into his hands

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,160
getting someone else
to do the work for him.

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,960
I bet he’ll just lie down and relax.

115
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,200
True.

116
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,520
I think I started to feel sorry
for Po a bit.

117
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,960
Per, why did you mention that?

118
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,200
Look.

119
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,120
I’m sure Jun is going
to give Po more trouble.

120
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
You… really can’t figure it out?

121
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,880
I said that

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
not because I wanted him to work
on it or anything,

123
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,800
I’m just trying to come up with an excuse,

124
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,840
so that he can come and stay close to you.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,640
You can just work on the MV

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,640
and let him sit there and do nothing.

127
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
Shit.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,080
That’s your plan?

129
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,800
Of course.

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,840
Now look at Jun,

131
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,280
taking the chance to slip away already.

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
Per,

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,120
this is your favorite, isn’t it?

134
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,840
Do you want it?

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
You did great, buddy.

136
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,120
But you’re totally not keeping up
with Jun, man!

137
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,400
THAMETEEMA: I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET

138
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,040
Are you smiling at me?

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Who would smile at someone like you?

141
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
I smiled because…

142
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
You're missing Thame, aren’t you?

143
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Can’t I?

144
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,400
It looks like you’ve gone too far, huh?

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,400
Anyway, if you miss him that much,

146
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,400
are you interested in working
close to him?

147
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,520
What do you mean?

148
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,640
I’m now in charge of the MV thing.

149
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,039
Do you want to help me,

150
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,400
so you’ll be hanging around that area?

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
Are you serious, Jun?

152
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,880
But I have a condition.

153
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,640
You must really help me ideate
and work on it.

154
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
Well,

155
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,440
but I’m not that good at it.

156
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,240
Also, this is important work, isn’t it?

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,560
So? Does that mean
you don’t want to stay close to Thame?

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,160
I want to,

159
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200
but do you think it’s a good idea

160
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,960
to let me do such important work?

161
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
So, you don’t want to be close to Thame?

162
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,960
That’s not what I mean!

163
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
But…

164
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,680
- I mean….
- Ugh. You’re annoying me.

165
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
Don’t take too long
to make a decision, okay?

166
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
The chance is right in front of you,
so, will you take it or not?

167
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,800
Why do you have to use Thame as bait?

168
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
And is it working, huh?

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,640
Fine.

170
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,800
I’ll help.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Deal.

172
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
It’s settled, then.

173
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,560
I’ll send you references.

174
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,880
Work hard, okay?

175
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,000
If you don’t do it well
and it’s not impressive,

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,640
Thame will certainly be mad at you.

177
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
You silly!

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,760
Don’t you think I have
my own work to handle too, huh?

179
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,440
What work?

180
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,360
You don’t usually work.

181
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
I’ve never seen you work.

182
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,640
<i>This is the first draft</i>
<i>of the documentary.</i>

183
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,080
<i>Add the subtitles for me.</i>

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,440
<i>The deadline is the day after tomorrow.</i>

185
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Shit.

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Why did he assign me the work
at this hour?

187
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,560
THAME

188
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,360
Hello?

189
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,560
Are you busy now?

190
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,720
<i>We can talk.</i>

191
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,640
Jun already told you to help
with the MV, right?

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>Yeah.</i>

193
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,080
Don’t worry.

194
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
I’ll give it my all.

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,280
This won’t make things harder
for you, right?

196
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,720
<i>It won’t.</i>

197
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
<i>I won’t disappoint you.</i>

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,720
I’m now preparing some references
to discuss with you tomorrow too.

199
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,400
When are you coming?

200
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
After work.

201
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
<i>I think it’s around 6 p.m.</i>

202
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,840
Okay.

203
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,760
I’ll wait to discuss it with you.

204
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,280
Yeah.

205
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,160
Today, I sent you five photos,

206
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,240
but you only sent me four.

207
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
Huh?

208
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
That’s it for now.

209
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
I’ll hang up.

210
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
Then roll.

211
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,720
- And then…
- That works. Hey, yo!

212
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
- Yo!
- Po!

213
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,880
Whoa.

214
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,120
It took you ages. Come now.

215
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,320
Let's see what work
you've gotten done today.

216
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,600
That’s strange. That’s super strange.

217
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,360
What?

218
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,160
What are these references?

219
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,200
Do you really understand MARS?

220
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,920
A cutting-edge concept is good,
but is this MARS’ identity?

221
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,200
Also, you said you'd finish work
by 6 p.m., but why are you so late?

222
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,120
The traffic was heavy, okay?

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,640
Do you know the phrase "buffer time"?

224
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
I can't deal with this.

225
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,560
Earlier this afternoon,

226
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,040
I still saw Jun sitting there
looking for lots of references.

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,520
Now, look at him, checking on the work
in such a serious mode.

228
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,680
It seems like he’s trying
to mess with you.

229
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,240
He never stops his bad behaviors.

230
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,920
Back when I started to get close
with Thame,

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
he used to do the same thing.

232
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,080
Eh? Aren’t you listening to the music?

233
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
I’m just wearing them.

234
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,800
When it's something I don't care about,
I pretend I didn't hear it.

235
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Wow,

236
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,160
the secret of the mysterious land
of the sky dragon

237
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,200
has been revealed, everyone!

238
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,120
So, does that mean you've heard
everything over all these years?

239
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,680
You should brief them with the song.

240
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
The song and the MV
have to be done together anyway.

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Go already.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,080
This is so outdated.

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,200
Look at what you’ve done.

244
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
I came to brief about the song.

245
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,400
Yeah.

246
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,720
Go ahead.

247
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,800
You don’t need to do that.

248
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,480
I briefed him yesterday.

249
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
It’s my work, so I can handle it myself.

250
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,840
You’re busy, aren’t you?

251
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
Go do your work.

252
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,360
Go.

253
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,240
- Go.
- Jun!

254
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,640
But I want to brief you on it
by myself anyway.

255
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,200
It’s my work.

256
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,320
Are you going to brief us?
Brief me on it then.

257
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,480
Will you?

258
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,800
You and me. Let’s go.

259
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,800
Let’s do it now.

260
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,600
What’s your brief?

261
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Come here.

262
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,240
You're such a liar!

263
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,160
You said you’d have me do the work
so I could stay with Thame,

264
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
but when the opportunity came,
instead of letting me stay with him,

265
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
you pulled him away to be alone with you.

266
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,920
You're clearly deceiving me.

267
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
Deceiving? Nonsense.

268
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,440
I asked you to help with the MV concept.

269
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,560
But look at you, always asking for Thame.

270
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,320
Can you become a director, huh?

271
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,600
Also, if I had you listen to his brief,
the work wouldn't get done.

272
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,720
Do you even know
what he was going to brief?

273
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,920
What?

274
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,920
All right. So, what do you want
to brief me on?

275
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
Yeah?

276
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,480
This song has a medium tempo,
with a BPM of around 94.

277
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,600
The mood leans toward pop,
but it still retains a hip-hop vibe.

278
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,640
For the rap sections, we’ll probably
incorporate rhymes like flip

279
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,680
and use a paradiddle rhythm.

280
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,840
Do you understand?

281
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
No.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,160
See?

283
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
That’s why I had to listen
to his briefs myself.

284
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Do you know the reason
behind everything I’ve done so far?

285
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,160
Nope.

286
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,600
Anyway, send me the correct references.

287
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Keep them coming.

288
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,960
I’ll be standing by
and waiting for them tonight.

289
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,920
Okay?

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,600
Can I send you tomorrow?

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,240
Mick has just assigned me extra work.

292
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,520
I have to send him the subtitles tomorrow.

293
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
This is annoying.

294
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,600
You have too many excuses.

295
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,880
When are we getting serious
about this work, huh?

296
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,240
Excuses?

297
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,840
No. I really was assigned extra work.

298
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,440
Let’s put it this way.

299
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,000
Follow me.

300
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,160
Why did you bring me here?

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
To find a place to work.

302
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,760
Not many people come here.

303
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Usually, it's for meeting up with people
you'd rather not have others see.

304
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,560
Is this why people gossip that you like to
secretly date but don't let anyone know?

305
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
You’re really good at gossiping.

306
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,800
If you were this good at work,
you’d probably be a CEO by now.

307
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
You jerk.

308
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,080
Here you are.

309
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
- Hello.
- A table for two, please.

310
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
I'd like a private corner, please.

311
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
Please head inside.

312
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,520
This way, please.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
What drink would you like?

314
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,520
Old-Fashioned, please.

315
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,160
How about you?

316
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,360
Well…

317
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
Let’s go with something simple, then.

318
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,920
Grand Martini, please.

319
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,720
Sure.

320
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Hold on.

321
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
I just told you I’ve got some work to do.

322
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
Here you go.

323
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Do your work.

324
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Turn on your notebook.

325
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,040
Give me the work
you have to submit tomorrow.

326
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,520
I’ll handle it for you.

327
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,040
Anyway, today you still have to sell
the MV concept to me

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,960
because, in the end, you're the one
who has to work on our new song.

329
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,400
Why are you pressuring me like this?

330
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You want to become a director, don’t you?

331
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
Bringing up the MV
and pressuring you like this

332
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,080
isn't to get you to meet Thame.

333
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,560
It's all for your own benefit.

334
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
I want to make you feel

335
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
that you can do it

336
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,240
and you can do it well too.

337
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,280
If you want him to love you,

338
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,880
won’t you do something
to impress him, huh?

339
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,960
Can you not come up with a simple shot?

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Come up with the idea

341
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,800
without having to be concerned
about the budget.

342
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
Don’t care what props.

343
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
Just enough to get the picture across

344
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
to show what kind of image
you're aiming for.

345
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
How about this?

346
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,280
It just doesn’t fit the lyrics.

347
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Why must we need the brief then, huh?

348
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,760
I can’t come up with any ideas.

349
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,120
Stop complaining.

350
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,680
Keep working.

351
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,600
Hurry up.

352
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
Can you sing the song one more time?

353
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,320
Sure.

354
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,440
<i>Would you mind if I ask you out?</i>

355
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,640
<i>Will you doubt me if I say I like you?</i>

356
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,960
<i>If your heart’s not taken, it’s true</i>

357
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,520
<i>It’s always you who takes my breath away</i>

358
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,760
<i>Baby</i>

359
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
<i>Would you mind if I ask you out?</i>

360
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,440
<i>Haven’t you forgotten that somehow?</i>

361
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>Can I make you mine now?</i>

362
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,080
<i>I want to claim your heart today</i>

363
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,720
<i>Before someone else takes you away</i>

364
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040
How about this?

365
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,040
Interesting.

366
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,480
But I think we need to add something more.

367
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Well…

368
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,200
Here.

369
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
Well done.

370
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,080
Hey?

371
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,000
What are you doing here?

372
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,720
I’m waiting for you.

373
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,160
You told me you went with Jun, so…

374
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,640
I see.

375
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
You’re here to check on our progress
with the MV concept, right?

376
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,240
Did you come all this way
just to follow up on it?

377
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,800
No, that’s not it.

378
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,560
Well…

379
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,360
Just forget about it.
Didn’t Jun drive you home?

380
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,120
That’s good.

381
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,040
Eh?

382
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
That’s it.

383
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,000
So, do you want to see
the idea we’ve come up with?

384
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,000
I’ll show you.

385
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,920
No.

386
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Just head to your room.

387
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,240
Oh, okay.

388
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,720
<i>Send me the last photo when you get home.</i>

389
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,240
MV: WOULD YOU MIND?

390
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,480
So, that’s the idea.

391
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,800
What do you guys think?

392
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,240
Whoa, bro.

393
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
This is just right.

394
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,640
It’s perfectly right.

395
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,800
You nailed it.

396
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,440
You two are amazing.

397
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,400
It’s totally worth it that you guys worked
all day and night.

398
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,200
Great job.

399
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,320
Just to let you know,
I contributed just a little.

400
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,920
The main idea came from him.

401
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,720
Po is good at this.

402
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Right?

403
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,480
WOULD YOU MIND? .WAV.

404
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,440
You’re gonna show…

405
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,640
- How’s that, bro?
- Groovy.

406
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,360
I think it’s different from others.

407
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,560
This is what we call a catchy song.

408
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,320
- Airdrop it to me. I don’t have it yet.
- Eh?

409
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
- I don’t have it yet.
- Sure. I’ll send it to you.

410
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,040
- Found it?
- Yeah.

411
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,760
Thanks, man.

412
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,720
THAME AND PEPPER DISCUSSION 6 P.M.

413
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,720
THAME CHECK BOTH TO MAKE SURE
THEY ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTIONS

414
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,560
DANCE PRACTICE

415
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
LOVE YOU TO DEBT
LIFE, ROMANTIC / 135 MINUTES

416
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,000
Have you applied some sunscreen yet?

417
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,600
You two, after you’re done,
come help Pepper.

418
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,600
Stick your face out a little

419
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,040
Well,

420
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,080
I texted you.

421
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
About that movie screen time, right?

422
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Yeah.

423
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,600
Since we’ve done working already,

424
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,120
you’re not too tired to watch it, right?

425
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,400
Not at all.

426
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
I’m good to go.

427
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,360
What a relief.

428
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Why?

429
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,920
The movie’s about to leave theaters,

430
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,280
and lately, you’ve been
so into the MV work.

431
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,320
I thought you might’ve forgotten about it.

432
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,240
Hey, come on.

433
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
How could I forget?

434
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,480
Well,

435
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,120
it seems you and Jun
get along pretty well.

436
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,600
Huh?

437
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,720
Getting along?

438
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,360
We fought all the time…

439
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
But, honestly, without Jun,

440
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,560
the work wouldn’t have
turned out like this.

441
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
You know what?

442
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,880
He’s super strict,

443
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,440
but he helped me with the idea

444
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,520
and also to get through
the work from my full-time job.

445
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,120
Give me a second. Mick called.

446
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,280
Yes, Mick?

447
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,960
Noted, Mick.

448
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,680
I’ll quickly edit it and send it to you.

449
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,560
What’s up?

450
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,400
I’m inviting you to the secret bar with me

451
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,760
to celebrate that
we’ve successfully finalized the concept.

452
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,000
Don’t tell me
you never thought about thanking me

453
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
for helping you realize
how well you could do your job?

454
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Of course, I want to thank you for that,

455
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,480
but can I buy some snacks for you instead?

456
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,280
I have to watch a movie with Thame.

457
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,760
See?

458
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,360
You told me
I must show him my improvement.

459
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,160
He already saw it.

460
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,120
That’s why we’re going on a date.

461
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,640
Thanks a lot, Jun.

462
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
I’m off now.

463
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,680
I need to edit the work for Mick.

464
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,880
Hey, let me ask you something.

465
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,920
When Po presented the MV concept
the other day,

466
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,520
you said Jun worked all day and night.

467
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,120
Were you talking about this MV?

468
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,240
What a strange question.

469
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,640
So, it’s this one, right?

470
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,800
I don't know for sure.

471
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,720
But by the way…

472
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,680
<i>I don’t think it’s this one, Thame.</i>

473
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,640
So, what was he doing?

474
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,720
As far as I know,
he was working on the subtitles.

475
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,120
Subtitles?

476
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,440
This one?

477
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,920
Shit.

478
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,720
You know about this too?

479
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,720
Eh?

480
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,080
Mick just sent this into our group chat.

481
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,840
None of you want to check it out, huh?

482
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,000
We’re this busy.

483
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
How can you make time to watch it?

484
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,360
My work is done, you know.

485
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,560
Jun is acting strange.

486
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,840
Thame.

487
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,120
I have something to talk to you about.

488
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,640
I want to talk to you, too.

489
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,000
Shit.

490
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,240
Guys,

491
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,080
here comes a big problem.

492
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,120
- What happened?
- Look at this.

493
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,400
<i>Would you mind if I ask you out?</i>

494
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,600
<i>Will you doubt me if I say I like you?</i>

495
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,200
<i>If your heart’s not taken, it’s true</i>

496
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,240
<i>It’s always you who takes my breath away</i>

497
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,440
<i>Baby</i>

498
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,480
<i>Would you mind if I ask you out?</i>

499
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,160
<i>Can I take a chance right now?</i>

500
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,200
<i>Will you say yes somehow?</i>

501
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,360
<i>I want to claim your heart today</i>

502
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,960
<i>Before someone else takes you away</i>

503
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,400
It’s our song.

504
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,800
The promotion plan is as discussed.

505
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,720
Please take care of it.

506
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,240
You aren’t allowed to come
to the company yet.

507
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,200
You didn’t tell anyone
to get me out of here either.

508
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,480
I haven’t seen you act like this
for so long,

509
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,199
since the day I told you
I wouldn't continue with MARS.

510
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,040
That’s because you gave
MARS’ song to someone else.

511
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,199
It’s the song you even mentioned
that you wouldn’t want it.

512
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Thame.

513
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,199
That song doesn’t belong to MARS.

514
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
The company owns it.

515
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,639
Huh? How come?

516
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
Dylan and I composed it.

517
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,760
Under Oner’s terms,

518
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,719
with the contract
you're signing with Oner,

519
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,800
every song you and Dylan compose
will belong to Oner.

520
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,680
So, the company has the right
to use the song

521
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,200
however, with whomever,
and whenever we choose.

522
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,400
Don’t tell me you all teamed up

523
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,280
just to revive that song
and use it to negotiate with me?

524
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,680
You know it’s useless.

525
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,280
And we have already finished discussing
this matter since that day.

526
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,360
It was over because I believed you

527
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
that my members wouldn’t want
to do it anymore.

528
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,800
But it turns out that
everyone still wants to be MARS.

529
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,720
And I want to prove to you
that we can do it.

530
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,160
Also, we don’t need to leave anyone behind

531
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,640
just to become successful.

532
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,400
Fine.

533
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,640
Now tell me how you define success.

534
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,920
Total sales?

535
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
Engagement?

536
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,600
BA jobs?

537
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,680
If not, then what is it?

538
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,600
It's about how the TPOP world is going
to be the new wave in the music industry.

539
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Do you think the reason
I separated you from the group

540
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,360
is because the market wants you?

541
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,320
The reason I separated you is

542
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,520
because you’re the one who can take
TPOP beyond just the local scene.

543
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,360
You’re the one chosen by Korea,

544
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,920
so this is an opportunity to make
people pay attention to TPOP.

545
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,600
The value you're creating
isn’t just money.

546
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,840
You’re building the music industry.

547
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,160
What you're doing right now

548
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,000
is causing the company
to miss out on a huge opportunity.

549
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,480
Really?

550
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
You know me well, Thame.

551
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
I love this industry
more than anyone else,

552
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,160
and I always look ahead,
focusing on the bigger picture.

553
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,520
What if my bigger picture
doesn't just include me?

554
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,320
You told me yourself that

555
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,440
what you want most
is the opportunity for TPOP.

556
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,200
And I believe it's not just me
who can make it happen.

557
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,440
MARS as a group can do it too.

558
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
What do you say?

559
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,920
But they only want you.

560
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,560
The contract only involves you.

561
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,520
That’s because, in the past,
you've only focused the spotlight on me.

562
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,680
But this time,

563
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,200
if I broaden that spotlight,

564
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,480
making every member shine and stand out,

565
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,520
do you think we stand a chance?

566
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,080
If you want the world
to pay attention to TPOP,

567
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,040
a group can get more attention
than just a solo artist.

568
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,360
Fine.

569
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
Tell me your plan, then.

570
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,160
I'll create a new song under MARS.

571
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,400
If my song beats Ice's song

572
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
and tops every chart,

573
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,880
then we'll all get to go there.

574
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
What if you fail?

575
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,440
You'll go back to fulfilling
the original contract, right?

576
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,320
Yes. I’ll do that.

577
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,760
But you know that Oner will not help you
with anything, right?

578
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,440
Just don’t get in a way.

579
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,200
Per, I’ve already talked to the company.

580
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,520
I need your help.

581
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,480
LOVE YOU TO DEBT

582
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,640
<i>If you’re still waiting at the cinema,</i>
<i>just don’t wait anymore.</i>

583
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,400
<i>I think he already forgot</i>
<i>about his date with you.</i>

584
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,680
<i>Something happened.</i>

585
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,200
<i>Would you mind if I ask you out?</i>

586
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,680
<i>Will you doubt me if I say I like you?</i>

587
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,560
<i>If your heart’s not taken, it’s true</i>

588
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,320
<i>Head home. Don’t wait anymore.</i>

589
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,080
You aren’t going to watch it anymore?

590
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,760
I’m sorry I’m late.

591
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,600
Did I make it in time?

592
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,600
I thought you were busy with the song.

593
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,360
I was.

594
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,720
But why…

595
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,960
But you are important, too.

596
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,880
I don’t want to break our promise anymore.

597
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,000
MAKE A SONG

598
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,360
Does anyone have any ideas?

599
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,440
I do. I want to make a love song.

600
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,760
What kind of love
do you want the song to be about?

601
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,480
Are you looking for song ideas
or trouble with me?

602
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,000
What did you fight with Jun about?
Nothing serious, right?

603
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,880
It is, actually.

604
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,280
Why are you avoiding me?
Can’t we just talk it out?

605
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,920
Why do I have to play
this stupid game with you?

606
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,240
Because it's going to be a long talk.

607
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,120
About both the song and Po.
