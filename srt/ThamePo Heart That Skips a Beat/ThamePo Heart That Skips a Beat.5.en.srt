1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,120
<i>Dylan is really not</i>
<i>coming back to join us.</i>

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,680
<i>Thame from MARS.</i>

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,120
<i>He’s never left you behind.</i>

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,240
<i>All he did was to make your song</i>
<i>reach Miss Pemika.</i>

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,640
It even proves to me that…

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,880
<i>Idols aren’t fake like those with egos</i>

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,720
Hey. Po, how is it going?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,240
<i>I’ve noticed it a few times already.</i>

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,600
<i>You have a crush on him, don’t you?</i>

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>What do I have to do to make us close?</i>

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,680
<i>Keep talking, I guess,</i>

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,920
<i>to learn more about each other.</i>

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>You’re really not good</i>
<i>at crossing the road?</i>

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>How do you cross the road</i>
<i>in front of Oner then?</i>

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,760
I need to watch
the traffic lights carefully

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,960
and cross when there are
many people around.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,280
How about you?

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,520
Are you good at crossing the road?

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,600
I can cross,

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,880
but since becoming an idol,

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,320
I’ve always had Mick
and the security team with me.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,360
I never get to go anywhere on my own.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,160
Being an idol seems nice.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,160
You always have people
to take care of you.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,560
But you don’t have anyone like I do,

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,800
so you need to be careful.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>Even if you're crossing with others,</i>

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,440
make sure not to stay on the edge.

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,840
And if I get the chance,

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
I'll be there to walk right with you.

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,720
What?

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,560
You just smiled at me
while you were crossing the road.

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
That’s because I didn’t think it was you.

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
Who did you think it was?

35
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Thame?

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,960
Come on.

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
You’re always thinking about him, huh?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,440
Did you already forget
he’s not allowed to come to the company?

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,800
Also, he doesn’t like men.

40
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
Do you think
you know your friend well enough?

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,520
If he doesn’t feel anything,

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
why would he stay on the phone
with me all night?

43
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
All night?

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
Yeah.

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,560
How many nights?

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,880
Yesterday was the first one.

47
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,280
One night?

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,720
I don’t want to brag,

49
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
but when we were trainees,

50
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,200
we stayed on the phone
until morning almost every day.

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
If you’re using these talks as a measure,

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,480
I’d probably already be in a relationship
with him ages ago.

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
You’re his friend,

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,240
but I’m…

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,680
His coworker.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I bet he feels nothing special about you.

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,760
What makes you say that?

58
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Let’s say it again.

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,800
What makes you think he feels that way?

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
Well,

61
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
last night when we talked,

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,640
it seemed he wanted to know
and understand me,

63
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,480
learning what I like or dislike,

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
what my family background’s like,

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,040
and how I came to work.

66
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,720
And how is that different
from a job interview?

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,800
It’s different, of course.

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,000
Before that,
I accidentally told him first that

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,640
I wanted to understand him
beyond just work.

70
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,360
Wow, you’re being pretty forward, huh?

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
It wasn’t intentional.

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,680
THAME

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Let’s find out who understands him better.

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,840
Hey. Don’t.

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,000
Annyeong.

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Damn it. Jun?

77
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,040
Why is it you talking?

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
Wow.

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,840
You recognize my voice.

80
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,480
What a sweet moment.

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,880
I’m not calling you.

82
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,240
I’m calling Po.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,520
I want to ask him
to take care of Nano’s matter.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
He told Dylan he went to practice dancing
at the studio outside,

85
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,160
but he went to check
and couldn’t find him.

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,160
He didn’t pick up the calls either,

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
but he posted an IG story of him
at the company’s practice room.

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,520
Dylan got tricked, huh?

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
Serves him damn right!

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,480
I’m going to tease him.

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,480
I’m near the practice room.

92
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,240
I’ll go check for you where Nano is.

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,280
What are you doing there?

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,720
Thame, I have a question.

95
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
If someone says
they want to understand you beyond work,

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,760
do you think they feel something for you?

97
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
<i>They just want to be friends.</i>

98
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
<i>Why did you ask such a nonsense question?</i>

99
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,880
Okay, okay.

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
That’s all I wanted to know.

101
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,760
Bye-bye.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
See?

103
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Thame has no clue.

104
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,600
All he thinks about is work.

105
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,920
You need to stop letting your mind wander.

106
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Po didn’t pick up your call either?

107
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,600
No, but Jun picked up instead.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,720
He’s with him now.

109
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
He said he’d look for Nano for us.

110
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,320
- Perfect timing, huh?
- I was thinking the same thing.

111
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,680
Why such perfect timing?
There’s no practice session.

112
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,080
Why the hell did he go there?

113
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,200
I think… he probably went there
to discuss work or meet someone.

114
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
To meet who?!

115
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
I don’t know.

116
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,920
I’m sitting with you here.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
Why are you upset with me, huh?

118
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,680
Well, I can't go to the company,

119
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
so it's inconvenient to do anything.

120
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,640
Huh?

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,440
Someone like you
wanting to go to the company?

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,720
You’re acting strange, dude.

123
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,960
By the way, last night,

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,080
who were you talking
to on the phone all sweetly?

125
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,760
I saw you talking from before I left

126
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
until I came back in the morning,
and you were still talking.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Are you in the talking stage with someone?

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,520
Talking stage? Nonsense.

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,840
- I just talked to…
- Nano pulled a fast one on me.

130
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,040
He must know for sure
that I’m back with you guys.

131
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,640
Well, you were stalking his IG story.

132
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
I was curious.

133
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,560
He told the company he was going back
to study, so I wanted to know

134
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
what he’s studying and where.

135
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,960
Look at all his IG posts.

136
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
I don’t understand even a single one.

137
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
NANO<i>WONG</i>MARS LET’S GO FISHING TOGETHER

138
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,520
MY FIRST SCUBA DIVING EXPERIENCE
I’M SUPER EXCITED

139
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,120
THANK YOU, UNCLES AND AUNTIES
FOR TEACHING ME TAI CHI TODAY

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
I HAD SO MUCH FUN
I’LL JOIN YOU AGAIN NEXT TIME

141
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
MORNING TAI CHI SESSION

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,360
LET’S LEARN HORSEBACK RIDING, HEHE

143
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
Or could it be a subtle hint

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,560
that he won't be returning
to the group’s house?

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,880
I don’t think so.

146
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,600
He’ll come back, trust me.

147
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,400
Or else, who watered that orange tree?

148
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,160
He bought it.

149
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,280
Anyway, we need
to bring him back and talk.

150
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
I’ll call Po,

151
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
asking about Nano’s schedule.

152
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,160
THAME

153
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,600
Nano isn’t in the practice room.

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,320
It’s you again?!

155
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
Po left his phone with me.

156
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,440
I just had him do a little work for me.

157
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
What did you ask him to do?

158
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,480
I saw Nano's schedule was empty,

159
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,240
so I had Po fill it up for him.

160
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,400
And this is the concept
we’ve come up with, Miss Gam.

161
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,800
It’s something like
bringing idols together

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,240
to compete in a brain teaser game.

163
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,360
<i>Well, I've done something</i>
<i>like this before,</i>

164
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,640
<i>so I don't want that repeat content.</i>

165
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,760
Oh, please excuse me.

166
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,640
I left my stuff here.

167
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,120
Oh, I’ve figured it out now.

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,320
How about doing something funny
or a role play?

169
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
<i>I think that doesn’t fit my product much.</i>

170
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,000
Well,

171
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,360
I’ve heard your discussion.

172
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,360
How about we try this?

173
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
Pepper, Dylan, are you ready for today?

174
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,200
Drink and let’s go camping!

175
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
It’s going to be fun.

176
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,800
Jun, why are you bringing so much stuff?

177
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,400
Do you have two necks?

178
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
I happen to be a generous person.

179
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,200
I’ve prepared one for others.

180
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,200
Here you are.

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,760
Thame, say hi.

182
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,640
Is he still not awake?

183
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,560
Or does he not like you yet?

184
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,840
By the way, did he call you last night?

185
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,000
He did, but…

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
So, Jun planned the camping trip?

187
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,640
<i>Yes.</i>

188
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,280
<i>It’s solely his idea.</i>

189
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,480
I’m just saying what he briefed me.

190
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,000
We ended up pushing the project through.

191
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Jun is good at it, isn’t he?

192
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,240
<i>Nano doesn’t have any schedule,</i>

193
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,800
<i>while you’re still under punishment,</i>

194
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,080
but he finally came up with a plan
to bring you all together.

195
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,400
That’s so amazing.

196
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,400
Who else could do it like that?

197
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,400
Hey.

198
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
I’m sleepy.

199
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,240
I’ll hang up.

200
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
Eh?

201
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,200
That sounds exactly like him.
He only called to ask about work.

202
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
Or maybe…

203
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,320
Thame doesn't like it
when I keep talking about you?

204
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,440
I bet this is the reason.

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
And now I’m standing close to you.

206
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,800
What?

207
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,640
Whoa.

208
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,640
Are you already thinking
that he's jealous of me and you?

209
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,360
You’re being like this again.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,720
I already asked him,
and now you’re still imagining things.

211
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,480
Come on.

212
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,600
Hey, Nano is here.

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,880
Hey?

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
Are my eyes playing tricks on me?

215
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,160
Have you been showing up early these days?

216
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm just someone
who has discipline, you know.

217
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,640
How about you, little bro?

218
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,760
Where have you been?

219
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
We haven’t met these days.

220
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,800
Hello, Sphere.
Hello. This is Nano from MARS.

221
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
I’ve heard we’re going on a trip today.

222
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
Come with us.

223
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
Hey, hello.

224
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,640
It’s been a while. How have you guys been?

225
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,440
Come sit here.

226
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,880
Where are you going?

227
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,760
I need to concentrate.

228
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,040
Who picked the location?

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,720
It’s damn far.

230
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,280
It's hot, not chilling at all.

231
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,920
What's not chilling?

232
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,520
I think it’s pretty chilling here.

233
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,600
You’re the only one chilling.

234
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,400
Why complain, huh?

235
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,960
Hurry up. Help me unload
the stuff from the car.

236
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,680
Did anyone tell Po
to keep an eye on Thame well?

237
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,040
If something’s up,
let me know as soon as possible.

238
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,280
I’ll be the one reporting it
to Miss Pemika.

239
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,520
You two aren’t allowed to say anything.

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,200
- Got it.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,960
Where are the MARS members now?

242
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,200
Have they arrived?

243
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,440
Or did they get lost?

244
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,520
Here they are.

245
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
They haven’t finished setting up?

246
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,920
It’s done.

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
We're about to start filming.

248
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,920
Let’s go.

249
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,560
Per, please open
the show as scripted, okay?

250
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
- Got it.
- I’ll help them down there.

251
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,680
The first mission Brainy
assigned MARS to do

252
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,720
is "Drink and set up the tent"!

253
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,440
Hey! Is that all the energy
you’ve got, huh?

254
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,000
When are you helping me here?

255
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
How about you squat for me instead?

256
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,840
Stop messing around and get over here.

257
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,320
I’m not messing around, okay?

258
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,920
How are we supposed to do this?

259
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,760
When did I look like
I was messing around, huh?

260
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I don’t know.

261
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,440
What we agreed on initially
was a chill glamping trip,

262
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,360
focusing on the vibe, wasn’t it?

263
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,600
Well, Miss Gam asked for a change.

264
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,080
She said glamping
doesn’t require much skill

265
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,640
and doesn’t fit her product’s concept.

266
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,880
That’s why she switched
to serious camping.

267
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,079
She wants the boys
to show what they've got.

268
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,720
Showing it now, aren’t they?

269
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,560
Can we make it up?

270
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,040
Since the tent looks this deflated,

271
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,000
I feel bad
for the client’s chicken essence.

272
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
We can’t, bro.

273
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,640
We don’t even know
how to set it up ourselves.

274
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,920
Don’t look at me.

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
Why are you looking at me?

276
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,160
They hired you, not me.

277
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,400
Thame, let me see the manual.

278
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,800
Dylan, let me give it a try.

279
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
Come take a look.

280
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,880
What is it like?

281
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Now, move.

282
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,840
Let’s drink and let the fun continue!

283
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,960
Cut.

284
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,080
You can read Chinese characters?

285
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,880
I can’t.

286
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,840
I’ve just started learning
the beginner level,

287
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,680
but I've set up this kind of tent before,

288
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,040
so I kind of know what to do by feel.

289
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,240
Hey.

290
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,280
Hey, don’t do it like that.

291
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
We must press the safety lock first.

292
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,920
Be careful.

293
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,440
Look at us messing around for so long.

294
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,160
Here we go.

295
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,600
Come.

296
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,040
You want to do this, right?

297
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
Wow.

298
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,440
- The next game is outdoors again?
- Come on.

299
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,840
Is this what he told
the company he would learn?

300
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,000
That’s why he doesn’t have any schedule.

301
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
He must have really made up his mind
not to be an idol anymore.

302
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,040
Just to not be an idol,

303
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,200
does he really have
to learn so many things?

304
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,720
Is there a way

305
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,520
I can talk to Nano alone for a moment?

306
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,680
You know how to handle him?

307
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
I’ll have to give it a try.

308
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,680
- Then, I’ll…
- I’ll tell Mick you need more interviews.

309
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,840
Why did you interrupt Thame like that?

310
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,360
So, what were you about to say?

311
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,280
You already said all that.

312
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,400
The next mission is called
"Drink and Fight"!

313
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,680
Here’s the rule.

314
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,400
Whoever gets pushed
out of the line first is eliminated.

315
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
If any member gets eliminated,

316
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,240
you can go do more interviews with him.

317
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
Stick with the same interview.

318
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,960
We’re just changing the background.

319
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,840
Actually, I’ve had this idea in mind
but didn’t share it with anyone.

320
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
But if anyone asks,
tell them it’s my idea.

321
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
Yes, Mick.

322
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,040
You’re the best.

323
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,120
<i>This is what you have to do.</i>

324
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,240
<i>The four of you must make Nano</i>
<i>the first one eliminated.</i>

325
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,080
- Start!
- Go!

326
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,840
Ouch!

327
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,680
The first member eliminated is Jun.

328
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
The plan went a bit off track,

329
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,320
but it’s good

330
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,640
since I now have time to brief you.

331
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,800
What’s good about this?

332
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,640
Now I’m stuck with you again.

333
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,440
Did you see Thame’s look just now?

334
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
He didn’t seem okay with this.

335
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,840
Wow.

336
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,640
Do you still think he’s jealous?

337
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,640
Well, if he isn’t,
why would he look at me that way?

338
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,000
You’ve taken it too far for me to handle.

339
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,560
I think we need time.

340
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,040
Anyway, let’s focus on Nano for now.

341
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,520
What are you planning
to talk to him about?

342
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,400
Hello, Thame.

343
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,160
Don’t worry about us at all.

344
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,360
I believe someone talented like you,

345
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,080
no matter where you are,
will be successful.

346
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,800
I promise, with my little finger,

347
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,720
that I’ll grab a ticket to cheer for you
at your concert in Korea!

348
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,880
See you there!

349
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,200
Keep fighting, bro.

350
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,080
Okay, cut.

351
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,040
Let me continue
the interview a little more.

352
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,200
I’m curious to know each member’s plan

353
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,480
after the group activities end.

354
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,800
What about yours, Nano?

355
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,000
Mine?

356
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,120
I’m thinking of shifting focus
to something else.

357
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,720
I want to try
something completely different.

358
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,600
For example?

359
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,480
It’s hard to answer now.

360
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,800
I’m interested in many things.

361
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,400
You know, my plans include

362
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,960
cooking, going on a trip,

363
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,480
and learning a language.

364
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,120
Forest planting sounds nice,
and diving is also interesting to me.

365
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,800
All of those things
you uploaded on your IG, right?

366
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,040
Eh?

367
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,720
You stalked my IG, too?

368
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,160
Well,

369
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,200
your IG reminds me of a friend of mine,
who went through a time in life

370
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,960
where changes were happening.

371
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
That’s why he tried
so many different things.

372
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,600
I bet your friend
was looking for something new.

373
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,880
It’s because he feared.

374
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,840
So,

375
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,000
these were what you did
before working at Oner?

376
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Yeah.

377
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,840
Nano’s IG reminds me of myself
during that time.

378
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,640
I was both heartbroken

379
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,760
and unemployed.

380
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,600
I couldn’t rely on myself.

381
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,400
I was totally lost.

382
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,640
But the strongest feeling was fear.

383
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,000
Nano?

384
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,400
He fears working as a group again?

385
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,440
<i>The person who always shines</i>
<i>bright on stage?</i>

386
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
What was your friend’s fear?

387
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
He feared disappointment.

388
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,840
My friend once devoted himself
to something,

389
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,800
thinking it would define…

390
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,040
his life forever.

391
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,280
<i>But when it didn’t go as planned,</i>

392
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
<i>he thought he must try different things</i>
<i>for himself</i>

393
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,360
<i>so that he wouldn’t have</i>
<i>to rely on others.</i>

394
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
So, how did it end?

395
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
He realized

396
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,840
he probably feared too much.

397
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,840
It’s okay to feel disappointed,

398
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,400
but we also need to be able to start over.

399
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
In the same way?

400
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,680
Perhaps

401
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,760
it’s better this time.

402
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,280
But it’s said

403
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,760
the same book,

404
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,080
no matter how many times you read it,

405
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,520
will always end the same way.

406
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,800
We can’t change the ending.

407
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,360
Thame…

408
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,960
is tearing the last page

409
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
and rewriting the whole page with you.

410
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,560
The reason everyone was trying
to make this schedule happen here

411
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,640
is not for anything else,

412
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,840
but just to talk to you.

413
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,200
They really want to write a new ending.

414
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,240
Rewriting, and then what?

415
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,440
One day, it might still end
the same way anyway.

416
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
And if that day arrives,

417
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
this main dancer
who has to rely on the group

418
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,920
will end up with no future ahead.

419
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,480
Mick! Mick! We’re in trouble now.

420
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Thame and Jun have been in the forest
for a while and still haven’t come out.

421
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,600
I don’t know if they got lost
or if they’re fighting again.

422
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,760
Gosh. We’re screwed.

423
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,400
Why didn’t you help
keep an eye on them, huh?

424
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,080
If something happens,
who must take responsibility?

425
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,160
It’s me. Which direction did they head?

426
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,040
- That way.
- Okay.

427
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,360
Everyone, stop.

428
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,920
Go look for Thame now.

429
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
That way. Go now. Hurry up.

430
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

431
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,320
- That way.
- That way.

432
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,240
Thame!

433
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
CAFE

434
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,360
CAMPSITE

435
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
POOL

436
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,840
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AREA

437
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,880
RESTROOM

438
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
He told me to come and hear you guys out.

439
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,360
But I think we can’t change anything.

440
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,440
I don’t want to rely on you all anymore.

441
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,040
After it ends,

442
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,680
someone in my position
won’t make it through anyway.

443
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,000
Do you think we'll make it through, huh?

444
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
You know what?

445
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,600
I play in a movie,
but as a supporting character.

446
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
As for me, I’ll probably end up
writing underground songs.

447
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,960
I wouldn’t get to sing anymore.

448
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,800
Others will probably remember me as an MC.

449
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,760
And what’s wrong about us
relying on one another?

450
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,440
Look at him.

451
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,880
He’s this old but just got employed.

452
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,560
Do you think we all could make it through?

453
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,320
But what Jun said is right.

454
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,160
How old are you now?

455
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,440
It’s totally fine to fail sometimes

456
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,560
and rely on others sometimes.

457
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,680
Falling once

458
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,640
doesn’t mean you have to die with it.

459
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,200
But the person who will make it through

460
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,840
is someone like Thame, right?

461
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,760
What makes you say I’ll make it through?

462
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,280
I couldn't even keep the group together.

463
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,600
How can I make it through?

464
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
That's how it is.

465
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,280
Since we're all crappy people,

466
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,040
let's get back up
and move forward together.

467
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,440
And if we fall again,
no matter how many times,

468
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,440
we'll just carry each other
along like this.

469
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,600
And if we really fall again,

470
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,280
I think you'll make it out
better than the rest of us.

471
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,960
You even have more skills

472
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,040
than Dylan, Thame,

473
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,360
Pepper, and me.

474
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,200
What’s wrong about
being a main dancer, huh?

475
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,920
Lisa is also the main dancer of the group.

476
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Come on. Lisa can rap, too.

477
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,880
Hey, I can teach you how to rap.
What the heck?

478
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,800
I don’t want to trouble you.

479
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,680
You can even ask Thame
to teach you singing.

480
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
Just tell us, okay?

481
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,160
If you kept silent and ran away like this,

482
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,000
how would anyone know
what you really wanted?

483
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,280
Do we look that smart, huh?

484
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,400
Come on.

485
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,000
Are you calling me back to join the group
or just to scold me?

486
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,000
We want you back
and also want to clear things up.

487
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,840
So, what’s your answer?

488
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,960
Try.

489
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,120
<i>Just a love song</i>
<i>That you need to listen to</i>

490
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,560
<i>Just lyrics that are nothing new</i>

491
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,480
<i>But you and I know the meaning</i>

492
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,480
<i>Between the lines</i>

493
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,880
You have to sing this song
with full projection.

494
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,840
Don't hold back your voice.

495
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,480
You need to sing strong,

496
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
push your voice out,
and add more power to it.

497
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,560
What do you mean by power?

498
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,760
Are you asking him
to do push-ups or something?

499
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,239
Can you explain it in a way
that is easier to understand, Dylan?

500
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,280
You’d better use your brain, buddy.

501
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,760
- Whoa.
- Dylan, you’re damn stupid.

502
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,679
Hey, stop.

503
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,920
If your high notes aren't strong,

504
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,880
you need to use your breath to help.

505
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Try it this way.

506
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,600
<i>Just a love song</i>
<i>That you need to listen to</i>

507
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,920
<i>Just lyrics that are nothing new</i>

508
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,240

519
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,760
<i>Love is nothing else but you</i>

520
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,400
Here you are.

521
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,200
See? If you had given it to the him
from the start,

522
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
we wouldn't have had
to struggle going to camp.

523
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,000
But camping was your idea, wasn’t it?

524
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
And it did work, right?

525
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,200
But it wasn’t comfortable for me.

526
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,080
If you had been a little smarter,

527
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,800
it would have been
more comfortable for me.

528
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,520
If you’re that smart, why didn’t
you come up with the idea yourself?

529
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,680
Also, if you were that smart,

530
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,640
you wouldn’t have been tricked
by that maknae from the start.

531
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Hey.

532
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,080
Stop fighting already.

533
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,920
I’m back.

534
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,280
Anyway,

535
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,840
thank you.

536
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,520
I want to tell you that all this time,

537
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,800
whenever a problem arose,

538
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,760
I knew you all handled it
without letting me know about it.

539
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,880
But I’ve grown up now,

540
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
and we’re the same team.

541
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,560
What I want to say is,

542
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,480
from now, when there is a problem,

543
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,600
share it with me.

544
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,400
Nano, if you can teach
this kind of mindset to Jun,

545
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,080
that will be super amazing, bro.

546
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,120
That sounds like you can help, dude.

547
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,360
Hey. I told you to stop fighting.

548
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Don’t you know that

549
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
just stopping us from fighting like this

550
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,000
already helps a lot?

551
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,080
By the way, Jun,

552
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,320
thank that person for me.

553
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,280
Po?

554
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Sure.

555
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,000
I’ll call and thank him.

556
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,480
Wow.

557
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,080
You picked up so fast.

558
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,960
<i>Why did you call?</i>

559
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
Nano wants to thank you.

560
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,600
Well, Thame,

561
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,920
do you have anything to say to Po?

562
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,320
No.

563
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,480
I’m sleepy already.

564
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
I’m leaving.

565
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,800
IS IT CLEAR ENOUGH
HE ISN’T INTERESTED IN YOU?

566
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,320
You can remember Po’s number?

567
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,880
How could you know

568
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,920
it’s his number?

569
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,240
I was just guessing,

570
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,440
and I was right.

571
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,080
So, the person you talked to
the whole night was Po, right?

572
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,000
Yeah.

573
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,280
We talked about work.

574
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,840
Nobody would talk about work all night,

575
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,040
not to mention
you acting jealous of Jun and him.

576
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,200
Jealous?

577
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,280
You didn’t realize you were jealous?

578
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,160
If I am to be jealous,

579
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,640
doesn't that mean
I must have feelings for him first?

580
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,080
Are you saying
you don’t have feelings for him?

581
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,640
Well,

582
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,120
I guess so.

583
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,720
Really?

584
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,400
So, what you're doing right now
is really bad

585
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,880
because you're giving him false hope.

586
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,840
What?

587
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,240
Think about it.

588
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,200
You talked on the phone with him
all night.

589
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,240
You remember his number.

590
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,800
You even acted jealous
when he was close to Jun.

591
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,240
He’s probably imagining things too far,

592
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
thinking that you have feelings
for him already.

593
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,360
You're really such a badass if you don't.

594
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,960
So, I’m treating him badly?

595
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,320
Before thinking
that you’re treating him badly,

596
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,360
answer me first
if you have feelings for him or not.

597
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,200
I just want to make him feel
he’s important to me.

598
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,480
Because?

599
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I don’t know.

600
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,520
You’ve never had a crush on anyone before.

601
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,360
That’s why you don’t know.

602
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,800
Do you want to know

603
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,800
if what you’re feeling now
means you like him?

604
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,400
If I like him,

605
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,440
I’m not hurting him, right?

606
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,080
You’re not.

607
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,320
But if you don’t like him,

608
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,480
then you’re seriously hurting
his feelings.

609
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,160
Tell me what I have to do

610
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,560
to find out if I like him or not.

611
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,840
Just do what I’m about to tell you.

612
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,000
Thank you.

613
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,480
Are you here to help me cross the road?

614
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,240
Well,

615
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,720
that’s not the reason.

616
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,800
So, why did you come?

617
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,840
<i>If you want to know</i>
<i>if you like him or not,</i>

618
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,800
<i>you have to walk closer to him.</i>

619
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,160
Is something up?

620
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,520
Can you…

621
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,840
stay still for a while?

622
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,320
<i>Then, try touching him.</i>

623
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,240
<i>After you touch him,</i>

624
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,680
<i>if you hear</i>
<i>your heart beat faster than usual,</i>

625
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,920
<i>that’s…</i>

626
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,280
<i>what’s called love.</i>

627
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,760
I think the way to prove to the company
that we can continue as MARS is our song.

628
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,760
<i>When you said</i>
<i>it’ll be the five of them together,</i>

629
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,360
- did that include Pepper?
- Yes.

630
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,680
If that’s the case,
it wouldn’t count as every member.

631
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,240
MARS doesn’t need to have five members.

632
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,880
<i>With four members,</i>
<i>MARS can be perfectly complete.</i>

633
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,200
<i>You see now how serious it is, right?</i>

634
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,920
That’s why I told you,
between Thame and you,

635
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
<i>it can never be possible.</i>
