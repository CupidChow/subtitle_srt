1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Did you see the leaked news about MARS?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,440
LEAKED! FAMOUS IDOL SPOTTED
BRINGING HIS SPECIAL SOMEONE TO HIS CONDO!

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,440
I had to exchange
the other member’s news to save you.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,280
Gam!

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,040
Right now, she and I…
are no longer involved with each other.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,400
You might be different from me, Po.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,360
And I hope Thame and you
could do better than me.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
I love you.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Now, it’s time for the good news
from the music industry.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,680
Congratulations, MARS,
the first Thai boy group

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
who successfully hit PAK

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>with their latest single,</i>

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,960
<i>which has been a big hit</i>
<i>all over the country,</i>

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,880
<i>titled "Who Says".</i>

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,400
<i>Let’s listen and watch their MV.</i>

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,840
Please transfer my call
to Mr. Lee Sang Hoon.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,760
I would like to discuss my business plan
about MARS with him.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
It’s amazing.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,360
You guys really swept
the #1 spot on every music chart.

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
I still can’t believe it either.

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,880
Why wouldn’t you believe it?

22
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
You guys devoted yourselves to doing
everything to achieve this, didn’t you?

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,880
Well, looking back at the moment

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,920
when we almost
couldn’t become a group again

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,520
until now,

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,120
I think it’s completely unbelievable.

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Actually, you should be spending time
with your members.

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
But because of you,

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,640
the five of us could get to make
a song together again.

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,120
That’s why they asked me
to give so much stuff to you.

31
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Actually,

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,600
it’s because you all wanted
to be together from the start.

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,880
Pepper cares about you a lot.

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
He doesn’t want you to think

35
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,480
we succeeded
just because he broke up with Gam.

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,160
I see.

37
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,840
I don’t want you to think
that way, either.

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,640
I believe that

39
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360
if even they didn’t break up,

40
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,600
the result would be the same.

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,920
Everything would be the same.

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,959
It might take time,

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
but it would certainly be like this.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,760
I want you to believe it that way.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
Can you?

46
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Yeah.

47
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,320
Tonight, I can’t go to your room.

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
I have to do the live stream
with my members,

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
and tomorrow, I have to discuss
my contract with the company.

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, then, we’ll probably meet
at the company.

51
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,480
Yeah.

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
By the way…

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well…

54
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,320
It’s a bit cold tonight,

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,840
and I can’t hug you.

56
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,280
If you want to hug me,

57
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
put your hands in your pockets, okay?

58
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,640
Do this.

59
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
Here.

60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,040
You should…

61
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,680
Just go already.

62
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
All right.

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
Good night.

64
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,920
FOR PO FROM MARS

65
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,760
YOU FILMED US A LOT
SO WE SECRETLY FILMED YOU, TOO - THAME

<i>Hello, everyone. We’re MARS.</i>

92
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,320
Today, MARS would like to thank our Sphere

93
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,320
for helping us to achieve PAK!

94
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,280
Yay!

95
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,520
I love you, Sphere.

96
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
I don’t know how to express
my thank you message.

97
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,720
Come on. Just do this and say,

98
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,640
"Thank you so much for helping me
avoid selling fried chicken

99
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
with my mom at home."

100
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
Whose bias is this?

101
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,720
Check on him, okay?

102
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
He’s so sharp-tongued.

103
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
All right.

104
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,560
Thank you, our Sphere,
for making us reach PAK.

105
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,840
Without you all,
we wouldn’t have come this far.

106
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Anyway, to thank everyone,

107
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
we’ll play this song
in an acoustic version for you all.

108
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,240
- Everyone, are you ready?
- Let’s get it.

109
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
Here we go. MARS, let’s do it!

110
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
One, two, three!

111
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
<i>Play deaf da dub dub da dub</i>

112
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,520
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

113
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,080
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

114
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,560
<i>Don’t care what they say, I play deaf</i>

115
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
CONGRATULATIONS, BUT I WON’T FORGET THAT
ONE MEMBER BETRAYED US AND DATED SOMEONE

116
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,520
- DO YOU REALLY FEEL NOTHING?
- I LOVE EVERYONE, EXCEPT PEPPER

117
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

118
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,960
<i>Don’t care what they say, I play deaf</i>

119
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Yes, Mick?

120
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,080
<i>Tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>meet Miss Pemika in her office.</i>

121
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,360
<i>She wants to talk to you.</i>

122
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,800
Mick said you asked for me.

123
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
Take a seat.

124
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Yes.

125
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
You directed this MV, right?

126
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,480
Well,

127
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
yes.

128
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,480
It seems you wasted most of your time
on tasks Oner didn’t assign to you.

129
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,040
I’m sorry.

130
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,400
But I don’t doubt the reason.

131
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,040
Did Thame tell you
that Leak It has these photos,

132
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,400
not Pepper’s photos?

133
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
But I decided to leak
Pepper’s photos to save Thame.

134
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,080
I bet you don’t know that,

135
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,800
actually, you’re the cause
of this whole situation.

136
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,600
Why are you telling me this, Miss Pemika?

137
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
MARS made a deal with me.

138
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,480
The whole group would go to Korea together

139
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,160
if they achieved PAK.

140
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,920
I guess you’re well aware of this.

141
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,920
I proposed this deal to the Korean team,

142
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,280
but there was a bit of a problem.

143
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
I don’t know if you know or not,

144
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,040
but the Korean team
is really serious about it.

145
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,920
They can’t let their idol groups
be involved in a scandal.

146
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,360
I also can’t hand MARS over to them
while hiding this either

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,360
because it will affect other conditions
between them and Oner in the future.

148
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
So, I’m not left with many choices.

149
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,240
I think it’s time for you to decide.

150
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,600
Will you let MARS
go to Korea as a full team,

151
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,960
or will you stay, harming them,

152
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
and make everything
they’ve done be in vain?

153
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,400
Whether MARS will get this or not

154
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,680
depends on whether
you’ll walk away from his life.

155
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,560
It’s your choice.

156
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
Eh?

157
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,440
You guys came to talk
with Miss Pemika already?

158
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,480
Yeah. But Jun is hungry,

159
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,160
so he took everyone with him.

160
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,680
But I guess Dylan felt annoyed,
so he asked me to go away with him.

161
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,560
But Thame said they’re discussing
this with the Korean team.

162
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
It sounds possible.

163
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
It’s nice, isn't it?

164
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,160
Yeah.

165
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
And how about you?

166
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,880
How are you feeling

167
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,120
about the whole thing that happened?

168
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,160
I’m just going with the flow.

169
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
My members never leave me by myself.

170
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,320
I don’t have time to feel sad.

171
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,360
I’m sorry.

172
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,400
Eh?

173
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Sorry about what?

174
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
- Well…
- Per.

175
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,680
They’re here. Let’s go.

176
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,280
AFTER WORK, LET’S MEET AT THE ROOFTOP

177
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,080
Our first conversation began here, right?

178
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,920
Yeah.

179
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,760
Back then, it was empty.

180
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,720
But look at it now.

181
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
I have MARS

182
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
and you.

183
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,280
I think… this is
the happiest moment of my life.

184
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,040
How about your discussion
with her earlier today?

185
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,480
She said it’s possible.

186
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
After we left the meeting,

187
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,000
they all started looking up
information about Korea,

188
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,400
but it’s all nonsense, you know?

189
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
<i>Jun keeps looking up tourist attractions.</i>

190
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,240
I’ll look up tourist attractions for you.

191
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,800
- What are you searching for?
- Yeah. Just continue.

192
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
I’m looking up food.

193
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,920
<i>Dylan is obsessed with food.</i>

194
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
<i>Nano wants to wear a Hanbok.</i>

195
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,960
<i>It seemed like Pepper</i>
<i>couldn’t take notes fast enough.</i>

196
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,800
How about you?

197
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,520
I looked up the company we’re signing with

198
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,080
to see if their internet speed
is good enough for me to call you.

199
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,720
Anyway, we’re all excited.

200
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,360
I want to make it come true,

201
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,000
though we know
that it won't be as easy as expected,

202
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,280
and it might take a lot of discussion.

203
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,440
And even if we make it there,

204
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
it still won't be easy.

205
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,960
What if you guys can really get to go?

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,680
If we can, I won't be afraid

207
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
because no matter what happens,

208
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,280
we’ll definitely get through it together.

209
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,680
That’s because…

210
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
we’ve already been through
the toughest moments in life,

211
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,000
like right now.

212
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
<i>The five of us will stick together</i>
<i>like we used to.</i>

213
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,000
<i>We’ll make music together</i>
<i>and give each other feedback.</i>

214
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,160
<i>I bet Dylan must be more strict</i>
<i>with the song than he was before.</i>

215
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,800
<i>I think Jun will just remain indifferent,</i>
<i>like he always does.</i>

216
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,240
<i>Pepper and Nano</i>
<i>will be managing this and that.</i>

217
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,440
<i>Nano will get to showcase</i>
<i>what he’s got for more people to see.</i>

218
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,000
I’m sure all of us will be so happy there.

219
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,960
I’m so proud

220
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,560
that we’ve come this far.

221
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,160
As for us,

222
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,440
I’ll call you as often as possible.

223
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,680
<i>But if I can’t do that,</i>

224
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,040
<i>I’ll keep texting you instead.</i>

225
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,120
<i>Every day after work,</i>

226
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,000
<i>I’ll give you a video call.</i>

227
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,240
<i>I’ll work hard and earn money</i>
<i>to buy you plane tickets,</i>

228
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,360
<i>so you can visit me as often as possible.</i>

229
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,400
We’ll keep moving forward together, Po.

230
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,640
You don’t like my plan?

231
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
It’s not that I don’t like it.

232
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,800
Actually, I think
I should really be happy about it,

233
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,960
seeing you standing there

234
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,680
and listening to your daily updates.

235
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Just imagining it

236
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,800
already makes me feel like
I must be really happy.

237
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,440
Is something wrong?

238
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,000
But everything that involves me
won’t happen

239
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,440
because we must break up, Thame.

240
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
Po, what are you talking about?

241
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,480
Why?

242
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,680
Thame, you guys can’t go
if they know we are dating.

243
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
She said that to you, right?

244
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,800
- I’ll talk to her.
- Thame!

245
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
You don’t need to do that anymore.

246
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,360
You’re aware that

247
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,720
Pepper is like this
because of our relationship.

248
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,520
I’ve made everything worse enough.

249
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,640
This is what you
have been fighting for all this time.

250
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,080
I won't be dragging you down again.

251
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,000
I told you this has nothing
to do with that.

252
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,760
Are you sure, Thame?

253
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,760
Ask yourself carefully.

254
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,320
During the scandal,
what happened to your song charts?

255
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,400
In the end,

256
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
if idols want to become successful,

257
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,720
they can only choose one thing.

258
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,880
And what you’ve been doing all this time

259
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,000
is for your members,

260
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
not for me.

261
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,880
But throughout the journey,

262
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,000
I’ve always had you with me.

263
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
I know

264
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,000
you want everything to work out,

265
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,400
but reality is telling us

266
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,320
that they just won't.

267
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,440
Can you just not give a shit about it?!

268
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
How can I do that,

269
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,240
since it’s about your future

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,440
and also all your members’ future?

271
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,080
I’ve been with you since the first day
you decided to reunite the group.

272
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
I’ve seen the dreams

273
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Jun, Dylan, Pepper, and Nana have,

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,760
and I know how much they mean to you.

275
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,120
I know how important this deal is.

276
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,640
I can’t allow myself to stand in your way.

277
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,360
Hey,

278
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,320
don’t do this.

279
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,000
Just focus on yourself, okay?

280
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,720
Don’t make such a decision just for me.

281
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,160
Please?

282
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
Just answer yourself,

283
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,480
on whether you want to be with me or not.

284
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,200
I’ll deal with the rest on my own.

285
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,200
Let me handle it.

286
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,600
Let me feel tired.

287
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,160
Thame,

288
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,960
aren't you tired?

289
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,600
I’m not.

290
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
I’m not tired at all.

291
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
Please, okay?

292
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Just focus on yourself for now.

293
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,000
Decide whether
you still want to be with me or not.

294
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,080
Do you remember
when we kept walking each other home?

295
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,560
<i>Do you know that I can remember</i>
<i>every single digit of your phone number?</i>

296
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,600
<i>We left the line on,</i>

297
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,960
<i>even though we didn’t have</i>
<i>anything left to talk about.</i>

298
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
I will work everything out,

299
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,440
no matter how tired I will be.

300
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,560
Just answer me,
whether you want me to do that or not.

301
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,280
If you still want that,

302
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,680
give me another chance
to fight for you again.

303
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,520
I’m sorry,

304
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,200
but I don’t want that anymore.

305
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,400
Hello.

306
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,560
It seems like everything
is settled now, Miss Pemika.

307
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Where is Po?

308
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,760
Apart from singing,
you also have a movie coming up, right?

309
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,280
That’s right.

310
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,920
I’m really excited about it.

311
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,480
It’s a horror movie.

312
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Have you ever seen
something mysterious on set?

313
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,960
Well, I want to give
a brief introduction first.

314
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
Actually, I have…

315
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,320
<i>I heard about that from Mick already.</i>
<i>Anyway, thanks a lot.</i>

316
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,320
They’re going to Korea, right?

317
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,640
Yes.

318
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,040
We’ll make sure
everything is properly managed.

319
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
Each member found out
that they’re going to Korea.

320
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,360
They’re all so happy.

321
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,960
I plan to announce this on the live show.

322
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,880
There’s one more thing I want to tell you.

323
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,320
MARS’ song achieving PAK

324
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,160
didn’t only earn them
an opportunity to go to Korea,

325
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,160
but the MV that you directed was so great

326
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,280
that I want to promote you
as the main director.

327
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,200
Pardon?

328
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,320
PAWAT NEUNGANAN CREATIVE DIRECTOR

329
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,000
Sometimes, a crisis shows us
someone’s potential,

330
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,760
like the way I saw it in you,
as did every MARS member.

331
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,040
WHO SAYS
ARTIST: MARS

332
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,840
<i>Play deaf da dub dub da dub</i>

333
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,720
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

334
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,840
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

335
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,760
<i>Don’t care what they say, I play deaf</i>

336
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,080
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

337
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,040

<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

339
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,040
<i>Don’t care what they say, I play deaf</i>

340
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,760
<i>Who says what?</i>
<i>I’m not listening, my heart’s too loud</i>

341
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,000
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

342
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,720
<i>Sorry, I’m not listening</i>
<i>My heart’s too loud</i>

343
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,440
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

344
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,160
And this is MARS!

345
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,880
Please give them a round of applause.

346
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Here we go.

347
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,360
Welcome Jun, Thame,
Pepper, Nano, and Dylan.

348
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,920
This is MARS,

349
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
who just finished performing
their latest single, titled "Who Says".

350
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
Please take your seats,

351
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,280
relax, and let's start chatting.

352
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,880
<i>I’d say MARS</i>
<i>is the hottest boy group right now.</i>

353
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,840
<i>Thank you.</i>

354
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,040
<i>Right. I have to admit</i>
<i>that it’s such a surprise to me</i>

355
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,120
<i>because you haven’t released</i>
<i>a song for some time, right?</i>

356
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,880
<i>This song is also different</i>
<i>from your previous style.</i>

357
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
The initial idea for this song came from

358
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,920
wanting to tell everyone
not to listen to what others say

359
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,320
or worry about how people see them.

360
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
Just do what you love most.
That's all that matters.

361
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,840
Wow. That’s impressive.

362
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,840
But apart from producing
this song yourselves,

363
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,760
you also choreographed it, right?

364
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,040
That’s right.
We choreographed it ourselves.

365
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,280
I wanted the choreography for this song

366
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,520
to be different from
any other song from MARS.

367
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,920
That’s why we added a fierce
and playful vibe to it.

368
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,800
That’s amazing. It’s no surprise
that when scrolling through the feed,

369
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,760
all I see are dance moves
from the song "Who Says".

370
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,240
But now, I have to say

371
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,320
that MARS came to our show today
with a surprise.

372
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,000
<i>This surprise is so grand</i>

373
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,720
<i>that the CEO of Oner</i>
<i>has to announce it herself.</i>

374
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,480
<i>Please welcome</i>
<i>the CEO of Oner, Miss Pemika.</i>

375
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
<i>Hello.</i>

376
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,320
<i>Please give her a round of applause.</i>

377
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,440
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Hello.</i>

378
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,880
<i>Please take a seat.</i>

379
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,120
<i>Apart from having MARS with us,</i>

380
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,960
<i>the CEO is also here,</i>

381
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,760
<i>so I bet the surprise they’re going</i>
<i>to announce must be grand.</i>

382
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,120
As we already know,

383
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,800
MARS is going to have a big concert
called Dream to MARS,

384
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,720
and also, we have
a surprise reserved for you.

385
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,360
Whoa. Another surprise?

386
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,880
The fans can no longer wait.

387
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,840
Can you not keep it a secret anymore?
Please reveal it now.

388
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,920
This concert not only confirms
the group's future,

389
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,440
that we won't stop here,

390
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,960
but our success
has also attracted interest

391
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,880
from Korea to sign a contract with us.

392
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
<i>Wow.</i>

393
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,320
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>the group will debut in Korea?</i>

394
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,840
We were contacted before,

395
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,560
but we haven’t received
official confirmation

396
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,639
until MARS was able to secure
the number 1 spot on all the charts.

397
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,840
Whoa.

398
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,639
So, the whole group will make
their debut in Korea.

399
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,760
Awesome! Let's give them
a round of applause.

400
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,760
Like I said,

401
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,159
going as a whole group
like this is a phenomenon!

402
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,080
No, not the whole group, just one person.

403
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,760
Korea has always been interested
in signing Thame,

404
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,440
and this single reassured them
that they made the right choice.

405
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,840
So, that means Thame is the only one
going international, right?

406
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,520
- Yes.
- He will make his debut in Korea, right?

407
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,280
Congratulations!

408
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,679
Let's give a big round of applause
to Thame from MARS,

409
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,120
who is going to make his debut in Korea!

410
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,160
<i>Please give him a round of applause!</i>

411
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What does this mean?

412
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,280
Huh?

413
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,480
This is not what we agreed on.

414
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,040
I think I've already made it clear to you

415
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,320
that if we achieve PAK,
the whole team will go to Korea.

416
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,800
I proposed it to them,
but they didn’t accept it.

417
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,160
That's why we had to revert
to the original contract,

418
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,280
which is what I just mentioned.

419
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,280
But everything we’ve done is to change it.

420
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,920
Go ask others to confirm
that I already discussed it with them.

421
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,880
I gave you a chance to prove yourselves,

422
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,360
but you didn’t do it well enough.

423
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,760
Then, why did you tell us
that the whole group would get to go?

424
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,240
That’s because I wanted to speak
the truth in front of the media

425
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,240
so that you all couldn’t complain.

426
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,120
I can’t let what happened
behind the scenes before happen again.

427
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,120
I admit that what you’ve done is amazing,

428
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,480
so I will keep MARS going,

429
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,480
but I’ll send Thame to Korea
as originally planned.

430
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,840
The four of you can stay
as a group if you still want to.

431
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,160
I’m not going.

432
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,800
So what?

433
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,920
Are you going to break the contract
and pay off your friends' debt again?

434
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
What do you mean?

435
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,440
I bet you guys don’t know this,

436
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,120
but Thame tried to help you all once
by paying off all the debts.

437
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
Are you really going to hold him back

438
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,960
and let him keep doing
the same thing for you all again?

439
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,760
This is my business.
They have nothing to do with this.

440
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,640
But I think they should also know

441
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,600
that you shouldn't be doing things
for just anyone like he once did.

442
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,840
You have no right to say this
to my members.

443
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,880
I’m saying this to you, then.

444
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,280
This decision, in reality,
was something you willingly made before.

445
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,200
And the company shouldn't have to suffer

446
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,920
just because you don't want to disband

447
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,160
or because one day you suddenly walked in

448
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,880
and asked for some ridiculous agreement,

449
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,760
when the company has already had talks
with a multinational corporation.

450
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,680
I've let you all
stay together long enough.

451
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,320
It's time for you all
to grow and look ahead.

452
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,320
Staying together won't help
your friend move forward.

453
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,760
Letting him go to make a name for himself

454
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,280
is what will help to achieve
many things in the industry.

455
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,440
If the four of you can't go,

456
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,200
then you shouldn't hold
your friend back from going.

457
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,560
Mick, handle everything
according to the original plan

458
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
and separate Thame from the group.

459
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Asshole.

460
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,760
Shit.

461
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
You lied to me.

462
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,880
You said I had to break up with him,
so MARS could go there.

463
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,400
My job is to protect
the company's interests,

464
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,120
so whatever brings
the company the most benefit,

465
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
I have to do it.

466
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
Even if I didn’t discuss this
with you today,

467
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,120
you’d still have to break up with him

468
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
because I need to make sure

469
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,040
he’s as clear and pure as possible
before sending him off.

470
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,800
You’re talking as if he has no heart,

471
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,240
no feelings at all.

472
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
You’re hurting him right now.

473
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,520
Do you realize that?

474
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,400
I’ve always thought of you

475
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,120
as a CEO who loves and understands them.

476
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,600
Everyone talks about you like that.

477
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,840
In the end, you helped build them up
just to tear them down like this?

478
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I didn’t build them up to destroy them,

479
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,880
but to help them grow stronger.

480
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,560
In your eyes, I might seem like
a cruel person,

481
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,000
but I want you to think about

482
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,000
what’s truly the most important thing
in everyone’s dreams.

483
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,520
What is it, really?

484
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,720
<i>At first, they might have just come in</i>
<i>as trainees,</i>

485
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,200
<i>but everyone wrote on their applications</i>
<i>that they wanted to succeed.</i>

486
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,320
REASON FOR INTEREST AND FUTURE GOALS

487
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
TO BE AN ARTIST AND HAVE SONGS
THAT PEOPLE CAN SING ALONG TO

488
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,560
I WANT TO BE REALLY SUCCESSFUL

489
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,200
<i>As the person who helped shape him</i>

490
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,680
<i>and seeing that his success</i>
<i>is right in front of him today…</i>

491
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,000
Don’t I have the right to make
that dream come true for him?

492
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,520
Of course.

493
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,240
Right now, everyone may have gone
through some changes,

494
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,920
but I believe, deep down,
everyone knows that the reason

495
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,800
they entered this industry
was for what they wanted.

496
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,440
You’re no different.

497
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,640
I want you to think back and ask yourself

498
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,760
why you came to work at Oner

499
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,520
and whether what I gave you,

500
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,200
the title of director
on your employee card,

501
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,360
is truly what you wanted from me.

502
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,240
On the other hand,
with everything you’ve done,

503
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,000
what Thame’s done,
what the group has done to me,

504
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,760
and what I’m doing today…

505
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,600
Do I still look cruel to you?

506
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,280
<i>Today, everyone might still hurt</i>

507
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,200
<i>because this isn’t what they expected.</i>

508
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,880
<i>But just wait.</i>

509
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,400
<i>In the days to come,</i>

510
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,320
<i>what will come to them,</i>

511
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,760
<i>what will come to you,</i>

512
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,000
<i>will make them realize that’s exactly</i>
<i>what they’ve been searching for.</i>

513
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,760
I see. MARS’ BA, right?

514
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,800
Sure.

515
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,760
- I’ll send their rate card to you.
- The sponsor list for the concert is full…

516
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,000
- I’ll also check their schedule for you.
- …but I’ll forward it to Miss Pemika.

517
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,600
Okay. What would you like
to support at the concert?

518
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,160
Dylan,

519
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,120
Miss Pemika asked me to tell you

520
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,280
that you’ll get to produce
MARS’ new song with Mr. Henry.

521
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,120
Have Pepper learn how to produce it too.

522
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,240
Seriously?

523
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,760
Pepper! Mr. Henry?

524
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,240
Mr. Henry, for real?

525
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Jun, the casting results are out.
You got the lead role.

526
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,040
Seriously, bro?

527
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,800
Jun!

528
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,400
The lead role!

529
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
You got the lead role.

530
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,200
Nano, Miss Pemika asked for you.

531
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,160
Eh?

532
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,560
This is Coach Ton,
who will coach you on singing and rapping,

533
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,280
so your skills will be improved.

534
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,120
Hello.

535
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,040
Whoa. You’ve been working
for such a short time

536
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,680
and already got promoted ahead of Tae!

537
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,360
Main director, don’t forget
to put us to work too, all right?

538
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,480
If I’ve ever said anything harsh to you,
just forget about it, all right?

539
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,880
Guys, say this together.

540
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,440
Congratulations!

541
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,280
The documentary you made…

542
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,760
I never thought it would be
the one that sent Thame to Korea.

543
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,880
I didn’t know how to explain this to you.

544
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,880
Fine.

545
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,800
It’s okay.

546
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,120
If it were me, I probably wouldn’t know
what to say either.

547
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,120
You’re sad, aren’t you,

548
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,520
that the group won’t be the same anymore?

549
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,520
Yeah, I’m sad.

550
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,240
I cried for days.

551
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,120
I always thought that MARS
would always have five members.

552
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,320
But in reality,

553
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,320
when the opportunity came,

554
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,360
you couldn’t just let it slip away
or complain, asking him not to go.

555
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,520
I can’t be the kind of fan

556
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,800
who doesn't want
the artist I love to succeed, right?

557
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,080
When we love someone,

558
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,440
we want the best for them,

559
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,240
no matter what form that takes, right?

560
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,640
You’re right.

561
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,040
But I hope that

562
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,680
Thame’s success will shine on MARS

563
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,440
and that MARS’ success
will shine on Thame as well.

564
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,720
As for my job as a fan,

565
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,840
it’s to support and surround them
the best I can.

566
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,200
- That’s the meaning of Sphere, right?
- Yeah.

567
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,520
What do you think? Deep, isn’t it?

568
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,600
Super.

569
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,880
But what makes me the happiest is that

570
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,160
you did this work and became a director!!

571
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,280
I’m so proud of you, you know?

572
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,480
I’ve been bragging to everyone about it.

573
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,080
Now, the whole class knows,

574
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,680
and even that jerk Earn knows about it.

575
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,280
I’m telling you,

576
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,520
I’ll make that jerk feel like

577
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,280
without him, you’d still do great.

578
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,400
Fine.

579
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,640
It seems you’re enjoying this, huh?

580
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,880
Certainly.

581
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,240
- Do you want a sandwich?
- Yeah.

582
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,760
I'll have…

583
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,160
a ham and cheese sandwich.
No tomatoes, please.

584
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,680
You?

585
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,280
Oh, I know his regular order. He’ll get…

586
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,440
I’ll take just one BLT, please.

587
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,680
Just one, please. I mean it.

588
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,440
Sure.

589
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,640
So, Mr. B and you…

590
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,000
I’m fine on my own now.

591
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

592
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,520
Give me that.

593
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,200
By the way, today,
my staff really messed up.

594
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,080
Oh, the boss messed up,
and so did the staff?

595
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,240
Excuse me. When I’m at work,
I never mess up.

596
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,920
You see me like this, but at work,
I’m composed, you know?

597
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,160
And how about you?

598
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,960
How’s your work going?

599
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,560
I’m about to direct the new MV.

600
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,240
The new MV?

601
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,200
But I can’t tell you. You’re an outsider.

602
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,760
Now, you have a secret, huh?

603
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,760
You owe me one, okay?

604
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,800
Come on.

605
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,360
I’m the one who got you this job.

606
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,000
Don’t forget your gratitude, kiddo.

607
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,720
Come on. You forced me to.

608
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,800
LIST OF THINGS TO BUY:
DISHWASHING LIQUID

609
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,480

610
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:41,480
FACE WASH FOAM

611

SHAMPOO

612

BODY WASH

613
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,200
<i>Hello?</i>

614
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,800
Can you please write a note for me?

615
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,320
<i>For these essentials?</i>

616
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,120
Yes.

617
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,920
<i>What do you want me to write?</i>

618
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,120
LET US BE A PART
OF EACH OTHER'S EVERYDAY LIFE - THAME

619
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,040
<i>I’m surprised at myself too.</i>

620
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,160
<i>Even though I got the job I wanted</i>
<i>and can stand on my own,</i>

621
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,000
I don’t feel like
I’ve won anything at all.

622
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,640
Have you ever sat quietly
and asked yourself why?

623
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,360
<i>Why are you trying to find Thame?</i>

624
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,400
I have something important
to talk to him about.

625
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,600
<i>Po,</i>

626
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,560
<i>I’ve written all of this to thank you</i>

627
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,760
<i>and to beg you for something.</i>
