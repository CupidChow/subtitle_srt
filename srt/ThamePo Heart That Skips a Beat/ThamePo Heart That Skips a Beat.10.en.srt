1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,840
<i>And Music of the Week…</i>

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,840
MARS!

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,840
Po!

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,240
Let me… go home now.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,080
You came home?

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,840
Wait. Are you saying you didn’t…

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,760
I ruined last night’s date, didn’t I?

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,160
Next time, I’ll watch
a movie at your place again.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,120
<i>Can we say I'm your boyfriend now?</i>

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,440
<i>That's up to you.</i>

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>I don't know if you're going</i>
<i>to call me that,</i>

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,760
<i>but I will.</i>

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
<i>My boyfriend.</i>

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Why are you watching me sleeping?

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,240
Well…

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,720
you look cute.

17
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,480
Was… last night okay?

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,800
Mm.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,040
Do I really have to go back
to the group’s house

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
and check the music chart?

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you staying here for good?

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,640
I want to, honestly.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,440
It’s time for me to leave.

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,840
I’ll get going.

25
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
One, two, three.

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yay!

27
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,560
Did we win that chart already?

28
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,160
Not yet.

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
- What are you guys celebrating for then?
- Come on.

30
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
We’re celebrating
because you’ve finally grown up.

31
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Congrats, bro.

32
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,520
That's how it should be.
The student I’ve nurtured.

33
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,840
You? Come on.

34
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
Give me the credit, okay?

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,519
Eh?

36
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,120
You're number one
when it comes to taking credit, dude.

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,880
How is the chart going, by the way?

38
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,839
This one is pretty hard to climb.

39
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,600
If we rank number one,

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,240
we stand a high chance
to win the remaining three.

41
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
I already opened the page.

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,080
All you have to do is to press
the refresh button, man.

43
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,600
1. WOULD YOU MIND? - ICE

44
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
I’ll refresh now, okay?

45
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,480
Yeah.

46
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
I’ll do it now.

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
Uh-huh!

48
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,600
- I’ll do it for real now.
- Yeah!

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,720
Damn it!

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
- Our song is number one!
- For real?!

51
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
Woo-hoo!

52
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
Number one!

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,320
Great job.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,440
Great job.

55
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,600
Great job.

56
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
- We did it, guys.
- Great job.

57
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
We did it.

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,960
Great job, guys.

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
I need to tell my mommies now.

60
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,760
Let me check it one more time.

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Eh? Where are you going?

62
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,920
ONLY THREE MORE CHARTS TO GO
AND WE’RE GOING TO PAK

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
I WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH ME NOW

64
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,040
I WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH ME NOW

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Whoa.

66
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,360
Look at those crazy in love.

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,480
Those in love are annoying, aren’t they?

68
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,280
You’re right, Dylan.

69
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,080
Did I mishear that?

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,720
You two actually agreed?

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,640
Oops, I don’t think so.

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,040
I bet it’s destiny.

73
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,960
You want a smack?

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
I’m kidding.

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
What’s up?

76
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,560
Did you see the leaked news about MARS?

77
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
Huh?

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
Check it now

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,680
because I think you can explain
the whole thing to me.

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,840
LEAKED IT! FAMOUS IDOL SPOTTED
BRINGING HIS SPECIAL SOMEONE TO HIS CONDO!

81
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
<i>Do you have anything to say?</i>

82
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,360
<i>I saw the photos on my timeline already.</i>

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
<i>How long have you been hiding this?</i>

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
Well,

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,160
I can explain it.

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
<i>What’s the point of explaining it now?!</i>
<i>It’s too late, don’t you know?!</i>

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
Hey.

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,680
I’m sorry.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
- I just…
- <i>Why, Po?!</i>

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,160
Why does it have to be my bias?

91
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,880
<i>Why does it have to be Pepper?</i>

92
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,680
LEAKED IT FAMOUS IDOL SPOTTED
BRINGING HIS SPECIAL SOMEONE TO HIS CONDO!

93
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
LET ME DIG UP MORE INFO #PEPPERMARS
REAL OR JUST FOR HYPE? #PEPPERMARS

94
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
CYBER DETECTIVES ON THE CASE NOW!
#PEPPERMARS

95
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
"WHO SAYS" IS BLOWING UP. MEMBER SCANDAL
LEAKS. IT'S OVER #PEPPERMARS

96
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,440
If the person you like likes someone else,

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,440
how do you feel?

98
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
SAYS HE LOVES US BUT SLEEPS
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN #PEPPERMARS

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,200
ARE THEY JUST USING FANS FOR MONEY?
#PEPPERMARS

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
<i>If you don’t get it, then shut up.</i>

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,960
SO LET DOWN. I DON'T WANT
TO SUPPORT HIM ANYMORE #PEPPERMARS

102
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,440
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
HE JUST HAS A GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

103
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,520
<i>Being in an idol group means there are</i>
<i>a lot of rules and expectations to follow.</i>

104
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,160
<i>Telling the fans you love them</i>
<i>doesn't hit the same anymore</i>

105
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,640
<i>because your heart's</i>
<i>already with someone else.</i>

106
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,880
I’LL STOP SUPPORTING THEM
I DON’T LIKE A LIAR #PEPPERMARS

107
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,760
<i>See?</i>

108
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,360
This is because a golden rule
for idols is that

109
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
they can’t be in a relationship.

110
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,920
PEPPER KNEW IT FULL WELL, BUT WHY
DID HE END UP DOING IT ANYWAY? #PEPPERMARS

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,920
I HAVE NO MORE PASSION TO SUPPORT HIM
#PEPPERMARS

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,880
WHEN IS THE COMPANY RELEASING
A STATEMENT? #PEPPERMARS

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,920
WE NEED YOUR ANSWER
@ONERENTERTAINMENT

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
@ONERENTERTAINMENT
WILL PROBABLY JUST PLAY DUMB AGAIN

115
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
@ONERENTERTAINMENT
DON’T KEEP QUIET, OKAY?

116
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,880
Hello, yes?

117
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, if we’re having a press conference,

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,480
we’ll inform you later.

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,600
Yes. As for now,

120
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,000
- we couldn’t reach him yet.
- Yes. Goodbye.

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
Yes. Okay.

122
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,440
- Hello? Yes?
- Hello?

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,920
Oh, I see.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Please give me a second.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,040
Please hold the line for a moment.
I’ll transfer you.

126
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,880
HOW IS PEPPER NOW?

127
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,440
What did Gam say?

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,240
She told me to clear things up
with you guys first.

129
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
I’m sorry.

130
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,640
I… made everything worse.

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
Relax, bro.

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
Nothing is ruined, okay?

133
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,440
Let’s focus on both of you first.

134
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,520
How are you feeling now?

135
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,440
I think you should go be with her now.

136
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,920
How could I go?

137
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,360
- We’re now focusing on the charts and--
- We’ll take care of it.

138
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Go to see her.

139
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
Be careful.

140
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,280
Don’t let anyone see you with Gam,

141
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
or else she will get dragged into this.

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,680
Avoid going to the condo.

143
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
Tell Gam

144
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
not to worry about it.

145
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I don’t think anyone has the photo

146
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
that can identify it’s her.

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,440
But…

148
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,480
Go, bro.

149
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
I’m thanking you all on her behalf.

150
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,840
- Have you seen the news?
- Yep.

151
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,240
This one, right?

152
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,880
Who do you think Pepper’s girlfriend is?

153
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,240
I have no idea. Her face isn’t seen.

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
Exactly.

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm sorry you had to go through
something like this because of me.

156
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,360
Sit down.

157
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,920
Why are you saying sorry?

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
We’ve prepared for this
since our first day, haven’t we?

159
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,360
It’s true,

160
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
but I’m still worried about
what’s going to happen to you.

161
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
I’m fine.

162
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,440
Fine?

163
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,800
Your situation is even worse.

164
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
With all this negative buzz,

165
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
it’s now even harder for you
to win the charts.

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,600
Your group reunion won’t be successful.

167
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
What should we do?

168
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,200
Has anyone taken any action?

169
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,440
Did they hold a press conference
or release the statement for the fans?

170
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,520
What should we do? Why is it that I can't
think of anything for stuff like this,

171
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
but I can come up with ideas
for other things so easily?

172
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,040
Why are you smiling?

173
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
Don’t you see that I’m stressed out?

174
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,880
I’m just impressed.

175
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Instead of worrying about yourself,

176
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,400
you’re now trying to figure out
how to solve a problem for my group.

177
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,280
Why are you this adorable, huh?

178
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
I’m not adorable. I’m pretty.

179
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Roger that. Got it.

180
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,160
Well…

181
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,440
If anyone finds out it’s me,
I’m totally fine.

182
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
I’ve prepared for that
since the first day I started dating you.

183
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,040
So, now you should stop worrying about me

184
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,320
and prioritize your group and yourself.

185
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,240
Okay?

186
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,800
But I certainly won’t let this affect you.

187
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

188
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
Per, honestly,

189
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,760
I’m wondering why the photos
got leaked now.

190
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,880
Those photos were taken
a long time ago, weren't they?

191
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,200
Even before you returned
to the group’s house, right?

192
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
Yeah. Dylan said the same thing.

193
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,760
Someone intentionally leaked the photos.

194
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,360
That’s why I’m here at Oner
to talk it out.

195
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>Let me know what she says.</i>

196
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Yeah. Talk to you later.

197
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,680
Ah. Here you are.

198
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,800
Miss Pemika asked for you.

199
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,160
And… Why is Po…

200
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,800
You will understand everything soon.

201
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
As for you, come with me. Now.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,120
Are you asking for me too?

203
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,040
It’s about Pepper’s scandal.

204
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,360
I thought we were on the same page.

205
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,640
I thought you’d allow MARS
to really prove ourselves,

206
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,440
but you’re doing this to get in our way.

207
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,720
You thought I leaked Pepper’s photos?

208
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
And you didn’t?

209
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,640
Yes, I did,

210
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,200
but it wasn’t for stopping your song
from winning the chart.

211
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,200
For what then?

212
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
To conceal this scandal.

213
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,040
Leak It sent me these photos,

214
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
saying they’d release this scandal.

215
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,840
I was left with not many choices.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,880
I had to exchange
the other member’s news to save you,

217
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,280
or I had to pay Leak It to save you

218
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,520
because I won’t let this ruin
your fame, no matter what.

219
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,000
So, you chose to ruin Pepper’s instead?

220
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,360
Your value is higher than his, Thame.

221
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,280
You’re in my business plan,
but Pepper isn't.

222
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
To say it correctly,

223
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
both of you broke the rule.

224
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,000
Among these four,

225
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
saving you is already enough.

226
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,640
What did you do to Po?

227
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,840
So, the traitor I’ve been searching for
isn’t Jun, but Po, right?

228
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
What did you do to him?

229
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,080
And what do you think I should do

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,680
to the person who got in
and caused damage to the company?

231
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Leave all of MARS’s footage with Tae.

232
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,000
You have no right to take any of it.

233
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,520
I’m sorry, but what’s going on?

234
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,840
But this whole thing isn’t his fault.

235
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,120
If you’re to punish someone for this,

236
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,440
it should be me.

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Thame,

238
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,000
this industry doesn't revolve around
what’s right or wrong or fairness.

239
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,440
It’s about who can sell more

240
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,360
and who the market demands.

241
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,480
And that person will always appear
spotless in everyone's eyes.

242
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,280
Right now, no matter
what mistakes you make,

243
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,600
the company will protect you at all costs.

244
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
If we have to choose between Ice and you,

245
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
the company will still choose you.

246
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,319
Listen up.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What you’re choosing is your work plan,

248
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,359
not me.

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That’s true,

250
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
but if you want me to follow
your work plan,

251
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,880
you must handle it just as you told me.

252
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,839
Try figuring out the solution, Thame.

253
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,800
If you want the company to handle it,

254
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,040
this is the only way possible.

255
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,840
Damn it.

256
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,840
What’s up, troublemaker?

257
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,800
Mick,

258
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,600
where did you take Po?

259
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,160
- Did you fire him?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

260
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,880
Hey,

261
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
he works a lot better than you.

262
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,560
What are you talking about?

263
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,320
Nobody works better than I do.

264
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>If there wasn’t someone like me,</i>

265
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>would there even be an example</i>
<i>of "easy work with good pay"?</i>

266
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,720
<i>But don’t worry.</i>

267
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,520
Why would I ask Miss Pemika to fire him?

268
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,280
Having him here makes my life
even more comfortable.

269
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,440
Huh?

270
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,920
But you said "yeah"?

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,680
I mean, I moved him from working with MARS

272
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,320
to working with Ice now.

273
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,560
Bro, can you go grab my bag for me,
please?

274
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,760
- It’s downstairs.
- Oh, sure.

275
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,240
You’re all right?

276
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
Are you okay?

277
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,680
Thame, relax.

278
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,640
I’m totally fine.

279
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
Thank you for coming to see me

280
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,120
while it’s really such a mess out there.

281
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,480
I just want to make sure

282
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,600
you’re really okay.

283
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,680
I’m good.

284
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,360
I’ll do everything to show you

285
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,640
that no matter what happens,

286
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,200
we’re going to be fine, too.

287
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Yeah.

288
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,760
Go already. I’m sure
it’s really chaotic out there.

289
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,160
Give me one moment.

290
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,160
I really have to go.

291
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,240
Please thank Ice for me.

292
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,680
<i>Come back already.</i>

293
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,680
<i>We’ve got big trouble here.</i>

294
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,760
What?

295
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,360
Our fanbase account decided to rest.

296
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
DUE TO THE RUMORS
THAT ARE CURRENTLY A HOT TOPIC

297
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,400
WE WILL BE PAUSING UPDATES
ON THE GROUP'S NEWS

298
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
All right. I’ll head back now.

299
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,560
I have to go.

300
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,320
Our fanbase account decided to rest.

301
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,320
What?

302
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,640
BAIFERN

303
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,920
PO

304
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,120
WHAT’S WRONG?

305
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
WHY DID YOU CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT?

306
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,920
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Fern,

307
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
why did you close your account?

308
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,680
Do you think I wanted to do that?

309
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,120
I didn’t want to do it either.

310
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
<i>But I'm mentally breaking down right now.</i>

311
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
<i>Do you understand?</i>

312
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,520
Don’t let your emotions take over, okay?

313
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,560
You're running a fanbase account.

314
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,240
<i>Shutting it down all of a sudden</i>
<i>has a big impact.</i>

315
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,920
It'll seem like Sphere
will stop supporting them.

316
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,840
Po, when I became his fan,
I followed my heart.

317
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,600
Now that I'm mentally breaking down,

318
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,320
can't I follow my heart too?

319
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
Did you do what I asked you to?

320
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
Are you really going to use this method?

321
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

322
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,720
I already told Per about this
when he came back.

323
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,320
We have to protect both our dreams
and our love.

324
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,200
No matter what,
we have to make it work, right?

325
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,840
But what Thame said is right.

326
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,120
Because of Pepper’s scandal,

327
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,840
more people searched for our group’s name.

328
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,080
True.

329
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,920
I already scrolled through it.

330
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,640
People are really searching
for our group's name more.

331
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,840
It seems they want to know
who we are and what we do.

332
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,400
And it seems to have an impact
on our song, too.

333
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,880
A scandal
doesn’t only have negative effects,

334
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,600
but it creates buzz too.

335
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
The point is,

336
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
how do we turn it to our advantage?

337
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,320
Are you saying

338
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,640
we should push the buzz

339
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,560
about why idols aren't allowed to love?

340
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,240
This is actually the question
people have always been asking.

341
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,080
They’re already wondering if it’s fair
for idols to not have their private lives.

342
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,200
What if they throw a question back at us?

343
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,960
Like, if you knew the rule from the start,

344
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,480
you shouldn’t have decided
to be an artist?

345
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
Shit. What if someone
really wants to be an idol?

346
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,320
Aren’t there any other choices
for them about the rules?

347
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,240
The point is,

348
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,000
Per and I dating someone doesn’t mean

349
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,600
we love our fans less than before.

350
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
What we’re doing now,

351
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,680
trying to keep the group going,

352
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
isn’t just for ourselves.

353
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
We’re doing it for our fans, too.

354
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,680
I’m totally fine with everything
you guys said,

355
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,440
but I’m just wondering

356
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,920
if this buzz can really help
our song climb up the chart.

357
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,120
I’ll consult with Gam.

358
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,400
Fern,

359
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
I understand how awful
you must be feeling now,

360
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,840
but let me ask you something.

361
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,920
Does the fact that he’s dating

362
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,320
make you like him less?

363
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,440
Frankly speaking,

364
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,440
yes, a bit.

365
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,360
I just feel like

366
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,760
they won’t love us the way
they did before.

367
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,200
Previously,

368
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
we were their everything.

369
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,280
But now, I’m no longer sure

370
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,400
what we actually are to them.

371
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,920
Hey.

372
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,320
Let me tell you something.

373
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>From filming their documentary</i>
<i>for some time already,</i>

374
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,800
<i>I can tell there’s no way</i>
<i>they will love you guys less.</i>

375
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,280
Do you know why?

376
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,000
That’s because
you’re part of their dreams,

377
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,280
their future, and their lives.

378
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,040
No matter if they’re dating
someone or not,

379
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,200
without you,

380
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,200
they won’t be able to protect
their dreams at all.

381
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,800
Damn it, Po.

382
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,920
That sounds like

383
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,640
being a fan means providing
scholarships to kids with dreams.

384
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,080
I was being so damn emotional,

385
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,240
but you went all about merits.

386
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,080
Activate your account, okay?

387
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,720
Only you can help him.

388
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,040
<i>You know well</i>

389
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,800
<i>it’s not that everyone</i>
<i>will understand this whole thing.</i>

390
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,200
And I bet you know better than I do

391
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,280
that during this time,

392
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,440
it’s really easy for anti-fans
to ruin them.

393
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,800
Fine. I get it now.

394
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,000
I’ll reopen the account now.

395
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>But can you tell them something for me?</i>

396
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Let them take action. Anything will do.

397
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,680
He can either admit or deny it.

398
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,920
Fans just want to know the truth.

399
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,400
<i>Uh-huh. I now understand</i>
<i>what Thame is about to do.</i>

400
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,360
<i>You’re appearing on a show</i>
<i>to promote your song, right?</i>

401
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,800
<i>I think they will ask you about this.</i>

402
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,280
Actually, you can start from that.

403
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,400
But if you want to start that topic,

404
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,640
you mustn’t make them feel like
you’re avoiding their questions.

405
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,840
But if you want to answer, go ahead.

406
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,240
We’ve been well prepared for this anyway.

407
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,080
We’ll hold hands
and get through this together.

408
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,200
<i>I’ll help check the buzz for you guys.</i>

409
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,000
<i>Things will turn out well. Trust me.</i>

410
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
By the way,

411
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,760
your fanbase account
is activated already, right?

412
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,840
Yes.

413
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,440
It’s settled now, then.

414
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,200
<i>Okay.</i>

415
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,040
MUSIC OF THE WEEK
CAN WE REVEAL IT ALREADY?

416
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,640
WHO ARE YOU, HUH?
HOW DARE YOU GET INVOLVED WITH MY BIAS!

417
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,280
- YOU'RE NOT WORTHY OF PEPPER!
- WILL HIS FAME FADE BECAUSE OF THIS WOMAN?

418
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,720
- THEY DON'T EVEN SUIT EACH OTHER
- IT'S YOUR FAULT "WHO SAYS" IS DROPPING

419
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,880
I’M SURE SHE’S THE WOMAN
IN THAT SCANDAL

420
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,600
- HOW DARE YOU THROW YOURSELF AT PEPPER?
- YOU’RE SUCH A CAREER KILLER

421
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,280
<i>Play deaf da dub dub da dub</i>

422
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,240
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

423
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,880
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

424
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,840
<i>Don't care what they say, I play deaf</i>

425
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,240
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

426
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

427
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,560
<i>Da dub dub da dub</i>

428
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,160
<i>Don't care what they say, I play deaf</i>

429
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,640
<i>Who says what?</i>
<i>I’m not listening, my heart’s too loud</i>

430
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,040
<i>Sorry, I can’t hear you now</i>

431
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,120
Welcome MARS!

432
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

433
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,960
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

434
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,240
Oh, come on.

435
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,880
Since you’re this popular,

436
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
why wouldn’t we invite you
to our show again?

437
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,440
Am I right?

438
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,960
I’M GOING TO SUE
MAKING MY HEART RACE LIKE THIS

439
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,920
We’re so overwhelmed now.

440
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Today’s viewership is a real phenomenon
for our live stream.

441
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
We’ve never had
this many people tune in before.

442
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,400
Wow, the live stream viewership
is at 350 K now.

443
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,080
PEPPER, YOU SHAMELESS PERSON!
BETRAYING THE FANS, HIDING A GIRLFRIEND!

444
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,640
That’s totally amazing.

445
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,320
Is there anything you want to say
to the viewers, MARS?

446
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,520
First, we want to apologize to everyone

447
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,960
for not taking any action sooner
about the whole thing.

448
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,520
Everything that happened in the past
has made us realize a lot of things.

449
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,320
What I want to tell everyone is…

450
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,200
- WHAT’S GOING ON?
- THIS IS PEPPER’S GF’S ACCOUNT

451
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,840
- THAT’S THE ONE!
- LOOK AT HER HAIRSTYLE IT’S DEFINITELY HER

452
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,000
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS BITCH?
SHE’S BEAUTIFUL BUT OBVIOUSLY OLDER

453
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,120
I’M DISAPPOINTED

454
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,760
Got it.

455
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,360
I’m sorry,

456
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,320
but we’ve just been informed
by the company

457
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,840
that they will be holding
a press conference.

458
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,680
Anyway, all the fans,

459
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,640
please wait for the company’s statement.

460
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,880
Now, let’s continue checking out
music videos.

461
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,760
The company is holding a press conference?

462
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,960
About what?

463
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,000
Hey.

464
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,520
Pepper’s girlfriend’s photo
is on X already.

465
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,280
- Have you seen it?
- Not yet. Show me.

466
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,040
There you go.

467
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,600
Whoa.

468
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,360
Clear enough, huh?

469
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,440
That’s Miss Gam.

470
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,440
Whoa. I can’t believe it.

471
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,120
There’s a huge age gap.

472
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,440
Netizens these days are scary.

473
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,160
They’re digging up her info
as if she killed someone.

474
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,360
You’re right.

475
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,760
It’s Miss Gam?

476
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,200
She didn’t pick up my call.

477
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,880
She must be running an errand
or something.

478
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,000
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Thame?</i>

479
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,160
<i>It’s Gam.</i>

480
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,040
Why didn’t you pick up Per’s call?

481
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,280
Well, I just finished the meeting.

482
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,560
I want to discuss it with you first
because I came up with a new plan,

483
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,720
and I already talked to your company.

484
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,760
The show already mentioned

485
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
that Oner will be holding
a press conference, right?

486
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,720
<i>But before that,</i>

487
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,720
<i>give me some time to talk to Per.</i>

488
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,680
Hello, members of the press.

489
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,160
We’d like to thank everyone
for being here today

490
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
to attend this press conference

491
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,880
and hear our side of the current issue

492
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,160
about the leaked photos of Pepper,
one of MARS' members.

493
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,800
This has led to rumors

494
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
that he is in a relationship
with the woman in the photo.

495
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,320
Pepper will personally
clarify the situation.

496
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,880
I’m Pepper, from MARS.

497
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,120
I would like to apologize
for everything that happened,

498
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,840
and I would like everyone to rest assured

499
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,560
that she and I are no longer together.

500
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,280
Let’s break up.

501
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,480
Are you talking about us
pretending to break up for now?

502
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,960
This is your new plan, right?

503
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,920
No.

504
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,680
I’m talking about a real breakup, Per.

505
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,880
Gam!

506
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,840
Regarding the person in the photo,

507
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,480
I admit that

508
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,800
we were in the talking stage for a while,

509
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,360
but there's nothing between us now.

510
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Why?

511
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,520
Is it because of the leaked photos?

512
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,120
But you told me that though it’s leaked,
it’d be fine, didn’t you?

513
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,000
Before this, it was fine,

514
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,360
but actually, it isn’t.

515
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,720
Hold on.

516
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,720
But you told me
we’d never let go of each other’s hands.

517
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,760
My members and I
have been trying every possible way.

518
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,040
I…

519
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,160
It wasn’t easy for me
to build myself up to where I’m today.

520
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,280
So, is it fair for random people
to tear me down like this,

521
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,080
as if I murdered someone?

522
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
Gam.

523
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,200
Don’t listen to those comments, okay?

524
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,320
We don’t know their identities.
We don’t even know if they’re real.

525
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,320
But if affects my job

526
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
and the people in my company.

527
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,600
That’s why I need to care.

528
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,800
Now, our relationship
is simply that of good colleagues.

529
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,400
Lately, it's been other teams

530
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,720
from that company
handling work with MARS instead.

531
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,920
As for the leaked photos
circulating on social media,

532
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,400
they were taken late last year.

533
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,400
As for the photos at the event,

534
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,440
it’s true they were taken
three months ago, but by that time,

535
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,440
there was nothing between us anymore.

536
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,280
You have things you need to protect,

537
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,800
and so do I, Per.

538
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,960
I’d like to ask everyone
not to bring her up anymore,

539
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,120
as she is not a public figure like I am.

540
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,560
<i>I’ve been trying so hard</i>
<i>to become who I am today.</i>

541
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,600
I can’t stand losing it.

542
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,320
I…

543
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
I’m sorry.

544
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,440
<i>And most importantly…</i>

545
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,880
But I just can’t handle
this kind of pressure anymore.

546
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,880
Right now, she and I…

547
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
are no longer involved with each other.

548
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,080
In my heart now,

549
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,640
apart from my members,

550
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,840
there is only our Sphere.

551
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,560
It's unfortunate that this scandal
came out during your comeback.

552
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,200
I’m fine,

553
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,040
but our fans must be so shocked.

554
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,640
Let’s consider the latest song
we just released

555
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,960
as both a declaration of love
and a comforting message from all of us.

556
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,640
Please accept it.

557
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,720
All right, everyone.

558
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,040
I hope that today,
we've cleared up all the issues.

559
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,240
Thank you so much for today.

560
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,160
I thought you wouldn’t come.

561
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,600
You want to talk to me, don’t you?

562
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,840
Yes.

563
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,720
What do you want to talk about? Go ahead.

564
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,120
I just don’t get it,

565
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,040
why things turned out this way.

566
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,480
Thame has figured out a way, hasn’t he?

567
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,840
And…

568
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,720
I heard that you also agreed.

569
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,720
Actually, I think Thame’s solution
might work out.

570
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,400
- But why…
- But it takes time.

571
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,880
And this huge amount of time
would stop them

572
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,760
from hitting number one on every chart.

573
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,640
Having to carry me along like this
will prevent them from succeeding.

574
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,240
1. WOULD YOU MIND? - ICE
2. TEDDY BEAR - AMECHAN

575
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,960
1. WOULD YOU MIND? - ICE
2. WHO SAYS - MARS

576
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,680
1. WOULD YOU MIND? - ICE
2. TEDDY BEAR - AMECHAN

577
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,280
I'm in so much pain

578
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,920
because I had to lie to Per,

579
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,120
that what I have
is more valuable than him,

580
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,400
while he’s the most valuable to me.

581
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,560
But I want him to be an idol again
with his members.

582
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,760
I want him to realize
how important he is to the group

583
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,120
and to stop blaming himself
for putting MARS in trouble.

584
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,160
If that’s the case,

585
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,040
you two didn’t have to really break up.

586
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,400
But that means
he’d have to lie to his fans.

587
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,320
It would be even worse.

588
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,680
This world isn’t that kind to us.

589
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
Time can’t help us with everything.

590
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,240
But I know what I can do for MARS.

591
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,760
Do you mean…

592
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,600
Do you know what’s going
to happen from now on?

593
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,400
<i>My issue will be a game-changer.</i>

594
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,600
POST UPLOADED

595
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,720
THEY'RE FRAMING HIM FOR SURE

596
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
LET'S HELP MARS GET AN ALL-KILL!

597
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,800
WHY DIG UP THE PAST
WHEN IT'S ALREADY OVER?

598
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,400
MARS MEMBERS ARE SO CUTE! SENDING THEM
LOTS OF LOVE. FROM NANO’S MOMMY

599
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,400
MOMMY IS SENDING YOU SUPPORT

600
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,320
MARS MUST GET AN ALL-KILL

601
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,560
THIS GROUP’S SONG IS GOOD
CHECK IT OUT NOW

602
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,960
EVERYONE, GO VOTE AND MAKE THE ANTIS
EXPLODE WITH RAGE!

603
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,120
LET'S SAVE OUR BOYS

604
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
WHAT’S WRONG WITH IDOLS
BEING IN LOVE?

605
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,920
INTRODUCE THIS GROUP TO ME
I WANT TO SUPPORT THEM

606
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,280
AN IDOL IS A HUMAN TOO.
HE SHOULDN’T BE TREATED LIKE THIS

607
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,320
And that’s the love I can give Per,

608
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,840
which is bringing back his dream.

609
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,840
PEPPER MARS

610
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,960
OMG!

611
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
Guys, they did it!

612
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,000
MARS has now got an all-kill!

613
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,280
Really?

614
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,440
Yeah!

615
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,960
They won!

616
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,320
See?!

617
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,720
- Whoa!
- Wow!

618
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,160
Guys, they did it!

619
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,560
Amazing!

620
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,240
Wow! Dylan!

621
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,240
<i>You might be different from me, Po.</i>

622
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,240
You might have more time than I did,

623
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,560
and I hope Thame and you
can do better than me.

624
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,960
I love you.

625
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,720
This concert is not only
a confirmation of the MARS’ future,

626
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,200
but also a step towards success

627
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,400
that could catch Korea's attention
and lead to a contract with us.

628
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,160
It’s amazing.

629
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
<i>You guys really swept the #1 spot</i>
<i>on every music chart.</i>

630
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,640
You should be spending time
with your members.

631
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,360
Pepper cares about you a lot.

632
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,360
<i>He doesn’t want you to think</i>

633
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,200
<i>we succeeded just because</i>
<i>he broke up with Gam.</i>

634
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,520
If I really get to go there,

635
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,480
I’ll call you as often as possible.

636
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,640
<i>We’ll keep moving forward</i>
<i>together like that, Po.</i>
