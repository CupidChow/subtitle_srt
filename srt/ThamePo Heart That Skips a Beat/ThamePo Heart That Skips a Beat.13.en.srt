1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,480
MARS really wants to stay together.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,960
But this is the best
the company can offer.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,160
Help him, okay?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,640
Mick told me.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,320
I just want him to get
what he truly wants.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,840
From today onward,
you’re no longer an Oner employee.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,960
Mick had Miss Pemika fire you
so you could work on this more freely.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,440
So, you’ll go up for this concert,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,120
and the plan is being coordinated by Mick.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,640
And I’m the "free" one
who can do whatever I want?

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,680
So, if we're going to take action,

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,880
we have to be really sure
that this time, it has to succeed.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,400
In the concert, the setlist
is divided into four parts.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,680
The opening, the fun moment,
the emotional moment,

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,360
and the celebration of success
before a goodbye.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
But no matter which part it is,

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
from what I’ve heard from Mick,

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,480
there’s no way
the company will let us meet Thame.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I’ve also heard that
we’ll have separate dressing rooms.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,760
And backstage,

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>Thame will be kept alone.</i>

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,640
The only place
we can meet Thame is on stage,

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,720
where we can’t do anything except perform
and follow the script.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,040
That means we have no chance
to talk to Thame at all, right?

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
So, the only thing we can do for now

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
is change this breakdown.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Yeah.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,240
The part I think we can most
easily interrupt is right here.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,520
It’s after Thame’s solo performance

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,960
because it’s when the documentary
will be shown.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,720
- Are you going to use the documentary?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
That’s because it’s the easiest thing
we can manage.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,760
Also, I know what’s going to be shown

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,200
because I edited it myself.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,240
Then, we need
to figure out a way to replace

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
the original documentary
with this new version.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Do you think Mick can help us with this?

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Like, switching the file?

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Yo!

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,200
How is it going, everyone?

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,680
I bought some snacks for you.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,920
Share them, okay?

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,479
Eat first.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,240
Even if we can change the file,

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,760
and Thame realizes what we’re doing,

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,960
the company will definitely
stop us during the concert.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
We have to take control
of the stage and make it ours.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Huh?

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,960
What do you mean?

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
After the documentary is shown,

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,480
we need to take control
of everything on stage.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
I’ll show you how.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,160
Then it’s all on you now,

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
whether you can do it or not, Po.

55
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,800
Of course, I can.

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
No matter what,
I’ll bring Thame back to you all.

57
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
LOVE YOU DYLAN

58
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,960
This is your seat.

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,960
Thank you.

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Well, Miss Gam…

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,120
Oh, Miss Gam informed us
that she isn’t available to attend.

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,160
Today, the Korea team
will be watching the live stream.

63
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,920
Make sure there are no mistakes, everyone.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,120
- Noted.
- Enjoy, and do your best.

65
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
- Got it.
- Okay.

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,320
Good luck.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Is everything all set, Mick?

68
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
Yes, it is.

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,000
Hello.

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
Hello.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
I’m here to watch
the stage from this angle.

72
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,840
Thame.

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,840
Do your best.

74
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,760
Let’s live up to MARS’ fame.

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,920
Let’s go.

76
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,160
<i>I know you want me</i>

77
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
<i>I know you want me</i>

78
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,560
<i>I know you wanna</i>

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,880
<i>I know you want me</i>

80
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,000
<i>Just admit it, baby</i>

81
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,400
<i>I know you want it like like me</i>

82
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
<i>Where do I go to file my complaint?</i>

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
<i>What you did to me, it just ain't right</i>

84
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,120
<i>Won't back down, won't compromise</i>

85
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,160
<i>Until you say you'll be my girl tonight</i>

86
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,920
<i>The damages I need you to pay?</i>

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,880
<i>All I need is</i>

88
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,760
<i>You… you… you</i>

89
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,680
<i>You… you… you</i>

90
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,480
<i>You… you… you</i>

91
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,280
<i>All I need is you</i>

92
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,200
One, two, three, go!

93
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Jun. I lost.

94
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
I want to see that one more time.

95
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,200
Will you give him another chance?

96
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,840
Of course!

97
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
Okay. Everyone is so kind to you.

98
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
Let’s do it one more time then.

99
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,240
One, two, three, go.

100
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
They’re spinning now.

101
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,360
They’re doing it.

102
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,800
Hey, that looks promising.

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
Wow, he's even doing it
with his arms crossed.

104
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
Nano, go.

105
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,120
There we go.

106
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,160
Wait.

107
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,760
Now, Nano missed once.

108
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,840
<i>The last image I’ll remember</i>
<i>Is when we were together</i>

109
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,360
<i>The last image</i>
<i>Is when you gazed at me tenderly</i>

110
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,240
<i>The image of you, I’ll hold dear</i>

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,760
<i>Still beautiful year after year</i>

112
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,480
<i>You’re in my heart always</i>

113
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,560
<i>You’re in my heart always</i>

114
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,400
<i>MARS started with us</i>
<i>supporting one another,</i>

115
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,160
<i>and even if we’re saying goodbye,</i>

116
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
<i>we’re doing that for each other as well.</i>

117
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,080
<i>I’m so happy for you</i>
<i>that you’ve come this far,</i>

118
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,000
<i>but it didn’t surprise me much</i>

119
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,000
<i>because I know you’re a talented one.</i>

120
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
<i>But from now on,</i>

121
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,240
<i>I’m no longer with you,</i>

122
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,960
<i>but I want you to remember that</i>

123
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,280
<i>you’ll always have me here.</i>

124
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,440
<i>I’m proud that I got to work</i>
<i>with a talented person like you.</i>

125
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,280
<i>Don’t worry about us at all.</i>

126
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,640
<i>I believe someone talented like you,</i>

127
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,360
<i>no matter where you are,</i>
<i>will be successful.</i>

128
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,080
<i>I’ll grab a ticket to cheer for you</i>
<i>at your concert in Korea!</i>

129
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,160
<i>I’m genuinely happy</i>
<i>for your success, Thame.</i>

130
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,920
<i>But this time, I guess I really need</i>
<i>to let go of your hand.</i>

131
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Come here.

132
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,400
What’s going on?

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,320
It’s back now.

134
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,640
<i>I’m sorry,</i>
<i>but all we just said was scripted.</i>

135
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,600
<i>Someone like me</i>
<i>wouldn’t say something cringe.</i>

136
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,720
<i>And there’s only one truth.</i>

137
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,640
<i>And the truth is…</i>

138
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,040
<i>Damn it, Thame.</i>

139
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
<i>We won't let you go.</i>

140
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,560
<i>See you!</i>

141
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Dude, you heard it already,

142
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
that we wouldn’t let you go,
no matter what, right?

143
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,520
Tell the stage manager to bring
all five of them backstage now.

144
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,680
Noted.

145
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,200
You might be a bit confused
about what you have to do next.

146
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,000
But after you go down there,

147
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
someone will guide you
on what you have to do.

148
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,920
Hey, Thame.

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,400
We’ll go play tag now.

150
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
Good luck.

151
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,240
Hurry up.

152
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,960
I have no time to explain,

153
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,360
but I just want to let you know

154
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,360
that the other members and I don’t want
the whole thing you’ve done to be in vain.

155
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
This is what you have to do.

156
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
Here’s your position.

157
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,200
The closest exit is over there.

158
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
Po.

159
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
Hmm?

160
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,880
Any questions?

161
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,080
Is this really you?

162
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
Yeah.

163
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,960
Hey, Thame. Thame. Are you there?

164
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,640
Thame, we’ve got no time left.

165
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
You should quickly see your members now.

166
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,880
Go.

167
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,880
MARS!

168
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,400
Nope, I mean, how do we
start fixing the problem?

169
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,920
What’s going on?

170
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,600
- Huh?
- Well, I have no clue either,

171
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,040
but I already asked the team
to control everything,

172
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,560
but we can’t do anything about it now.

173
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,560
Well, it seems the main control
of the concert is no longer here.

174
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,120
Eh? Where is it then?

175
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,000
Everything is all set here.

176
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,400
But let me say something as your manager.

177
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,640
Your plan is seriously…
worth my frustration.

178
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,520
<i>We must take control.</i>

179
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,160
Are you saying
we have to set our own control

180
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,400
to monitor everything?

181
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,240
Correct. We need someone
to set up the wires

182
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,600
and cut the signal
from the original control.

183
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
Do you think you can do that?

184
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,680
I’m here to watch
the stage from this angle.

185
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,680
<i>I’m sorry,</i>
<i>but all we just said was scripted.</i>

186
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,120
<i>Someone like me</i>
<i>wouldn’t say something cringe.</i>

187
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,720
Ming, find the main control
and get it back.

188
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
- Got it.
- As for you, Tae, follow me.

189
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Find the members. We need to talk.

190
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,960
Noted.

191
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,640
MARS!

192
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,240
Is there any possible way
to get everything back on track?

193
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,960
We can’t find the members.

194
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720
Miss Pemika,

195
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,280
Ming said she already found the control.

196
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,560
Mick and Po are monitoring it.

197
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
- Mick and Po?!
- Yes.

198
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
Do you want me to switch off the light now
so that we can reset the control?

199
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
But it might take some time.

200
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,920
For now, just let it continue.

201
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,760
Disconnect the live stream link
from the Korea team

202
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,360
and let me talk to them.

203
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,480
And what’s happening right here
strictly can’t be leaked anywhere.

204
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,320
I also want to know how much they can do.

205
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,960
Noted.

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
Po! Po!

207
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
Mick!

208
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,680
What are you two doing?

209
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,640
All right.

210
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,440
Let’s go all out.

211
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,040
Light.

212
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Ready.

213
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,320
<i>Living life on dreams</i>
<i>Doing things on my own</i>

214
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,600
<i>I create with my heart</i>
<i>Let my feelings shown</i>

215
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,280
<i>I paint the scene, paving ways for my path</i>

216
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,240
<i>But when I get closer</i>
<i>Why does it get so hard?</i>

217
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,720
<i>My left says this one’s right</i>

218
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,280
<i>My right says that one’s nice</i>

219
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,840
<i>They say I must do this and that to start</i>

220
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,720
<i>Everything is good, except for my heart</i>

221
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,920
<i>I’m tired of things they want me to do</i>

222
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,240
<i>Though they never ask if I ever want to</i>

223
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
<i>Do I need to pretend to be someone else?</i>

224
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
<i>Another person who is not myself</i>

225
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,360
<i>My dreams are my own, can’t be stopped</i>

226
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,720
<i>Just want to follow my heart</i>
<i>Don’t want to be on top</i>

<i>But I don’t need to be number one</i>

228
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,920
<i>Just a breeze is enough to keep me up</i>

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,920
<i>Like someone who understands</i>

230
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
<i>Who takes me for me, never want to compare</i>

231
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
<i>The weight on my shoulders</i>
<i>It’s time to let go</i>

232
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,440
<i>So my weary heart can rest on a stronghold</i>

233
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,360
<i>I may not achieve</i>
<i>What’s written in someone’s book</i>

234
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,800

<i>As happy as I could</i>

235
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,680

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,840

OT5!

252
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,760
OT5 MEANS FIVE MEMBERS FOREVER

253
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,480
Did you even realize what you’ve done?!

254
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,400
Huh?

255
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
Not only did you turn
this concert into chaos,

256
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
but you also caused damage to our company.

257
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,680
We’re sorry.

258
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,160
- But we did this because…
- Don’t say anything more

259
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,440
because you already said
what was on your mind up there.

260
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
I’m really disappointed in what you did.

261
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
I don’t think I can continue
with MARS anymore.

262
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,480
As for you,

263
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,360
the Korean team watched your performance

264
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,000
and now they want to cancel
the contract with you.

265
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,280
This much damage comes with a cost

266
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,160
that you all need to help compensate for.

267
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,040
You need to compensate Oner

268
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,360
under your own names

269
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,080
because you’re no longer our artists.

270
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,720
But I heard that

271
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,960
you disconnected our live stream
from the Korea team.

272
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,920
They didn’t even see what happened.

273
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,240
But you now want us to leave Oner.

274
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,840
Oner wanted to separate MARS,

275
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
but you all didn’t want to,

276
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,480
so you have to leave.

277
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Thank you… for understanding us.

278
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,200
I know it must be hard for you too.

279
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,480
It’s not hard.

280
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,360
You just have to pay.

281
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,600
So, you’re the one
who made all this happen?

282
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,360
It wasn’t just me.

283
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,600
That’s amazing.

284
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,600
You know what?

285
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,480
That was their best performance so far
ever since I became a fan of MARS.

286
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,520
Yeah. I hoped it would work out.

287
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,920
I also hope that from now on,
nothing can stand in MARS’ way.

288
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,240
But when they said

289
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,520
they were tired of always doing things
based on other people's opinions,

290
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,200
I’m not sure if I’m also one of the fans

291
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,600
who made them feel like
they’re not being themselves,

292
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,920
or I’m probably
the one who gave them pain.

293
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,440
Are they really doing
what they love happily,

294
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,600
or are they enduring the pain
to make fans like me happy?

295
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
Fern.

296
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,400
When Per’s dating scandal was leaked,

297
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,600
I admitted it didn’t sit right with me.

298
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,040
But after the press conference,

299
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,360
I’ve never seen Per
look truly happy again.

300
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,080
I can tell through his facial expressions,

301
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,440
eyes, and gestures.

302
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,000
Today should be
the happiest day for him, right?

303
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,200
I want to see him truly happy.

304
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,640
I don’t want him to choose,

305
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,120
say sorry,

306
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,560
endure the pain,

307
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,920
or force himself to smile at us,
their fans, to make us feel good

308
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,160
or meet our expectations.

309
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Po was the one who stood up for you.

310
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,480
He fought against
the company until he got fired.

311
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,120
<i>Can you pass my message to him?</i>

312
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,720
If he’s still in love with her,

313
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,160
follow his heart.

314
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,200
Live the life the way he wants to

315
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,320
because in the end,

316
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,920
what fans like me want to see the most…

317
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
GAM

318
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,560
<i>Hello, Per?</i>

319
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,920
Gam.

320
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,960
<i>…is their happiness.</i>

321
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,280
<i>Hello?</i>

322
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Where are you?

323
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,800
Behind you.

324
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,120
Don’t go anywhere again.

325
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,040
You aren’t mad at me at all

326
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,760
that I left you that day?

327
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,680
Because of me,

328
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,120
you could barely protect anything.

329
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,600
Though you couldn’t bring back
everything to my life,

330
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,560
just having you back…

331
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,480
is enough for me.

332
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
Thame.

333
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,160
Po.

334
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,520
No matter what the future brings,

335
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,040
I’ll say the same thing.

336
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,560
Don’t go anywhere again.

337
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
Please continue being by my side,

338
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,720
no matter what I’m going to face.

339
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,080
Don’t think that

340
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,840
you’re an obstacle in my life.

341
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
You aren’t.

342
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
Because of you,

343
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,360
my life can move forward.

344
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
I want to wake up, see you every morning…

345
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,400
and go to work.

346
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,840
The beginning might be a bit tough

347
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,880
since we have to start over on our own.

348
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
<i>Also,</i>

349
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,680
<i>what we did today</i>

350
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,120
<i>will bring a lot of debts later.</i>

351
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
But don’t worry.

352
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,880
They will help
each other get through this.

353
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,880
You just have to…

354
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,680
bear living with this poor artist.

355
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,160
But you also know that

356
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,720
I’ll be broke too, right?

357
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,320
All I can do is probably

358
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,960
work as a regular
suit shop staff like I did.

359
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,880
Hello, Uncle.

360
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,200
Hi.

361
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,680
Please put the suit
in the bag for our customer.

362
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,280
Got it.

363
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,720
I might just keep doing random things.

364
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Thank you.

365
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,320
I won’t be doing something cool,
like being a director anymore.

366
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,160
I think that’s cool, though.

367
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,840
I love you.

368
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,880
No matter what you are or aren't,

369
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
whether you succeed or not,

370
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,440
I’ll still love you.

371
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
I’ll love you
in every chapter of your life.

372
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,960
Even if we're both a mess,

373
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,560
can you still love me just the way I am?

374
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Yeah.

375
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,400
Are you nervous
about your first performance?

376
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,560
I’m not that nervous,
but Pepper feels pretty tense.

377
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,800
I see.

378
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,600
You had him replace you
as the leader already.

379
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,080
But why would he feel tense?

380
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,960
The song is perfectly all set,
and so is the choreography.

381
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,760
Today, we’re going to meet
the new group from Oner

382
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,880
and probably Miss Pemika too.

383
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,840
As a leader,

384
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,720
he might not know how to act.

385
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,120
I think he doesn’t have to worry.

386
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Honestly, they’re very kind
to you, aren’t they?

387
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,560
Hello, Uncle.

388
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,160
Hey, hi.

389
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,600
Help me finish this.

390
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,040
Got it.

391
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,040
SING STREAM
STUCK RIGHT IN MY HEART - GUMP

392
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,800
<i>That's the debut single</i>
<i>from the newly launched boy band.</i>

393
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
<i>But that’s not it</i>

394
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,840
<i>because I bet everyone is looking forward</i>

395
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,199
<i>to the group that is about to perform.</i>

396
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,719
<i>So, please give it up for MARS!</i>

397
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,520
<i>I get what you’ve been through</i>

398
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,040
<i>The love you had and all the blues</i>

399
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,679
<i>Made you cry, feeling lost</i>

400
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,600
TRUST ME - MARS

401
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,400
<i>Now you’re not ready to open your heart</i>

402
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,360
<i>If I were you, I’d be scared too</i>

403
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,840
<i>Would love again leave me bruised?</i>

404
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,240
<i>Love has given you nothing but regret</i>

405
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,080
<i>That’s why you see love and feel afraid</i>

406
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Hey!

407
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,400
The suits we made for them
are cool, aren’t they?

408
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,960
I agree.

409
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,560
<i>Which is all fine</i>

410
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,200
<i>But hear this plea of mine</i>

411
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,160
<i>If you stop fearing to love</i>

412
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,200
<i>I’m ready to be the one you love</i>

413
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,960
<i>Yesterday’s past</i>
<i>Today is here</i>

414
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,960
<i>He’s the past</i>
<i>I’m right here</i>

415
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,840
It seems those kiddos
have a promising future.

416
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,520
They must feel so delighted that

417
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,920
you allowed them
to use MARS as the group name.

418
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,720
The person who feels delighted is you.

419
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,640
Hey.

420
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,400
We haven’t cleared things up
about you helping them at the concert.

421
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,120
I know you’re also glad
that the whole thing has ended this way.

422
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,160
Am I right?

423
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,240
PLEASE KEEP THE NOISE DOWN

424
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Hey, Gam. Hello.

425
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,680
Hi.

426
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,560
Are you waiting to have dinner with us?

427
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,360
What are you talking about?
I’m waiting for Per.

428
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,120
Aw.

429
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,760
Did you hear it?

430
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,640
It’s about my girlfriend and I.

431
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,920
Don’t mess with us, okay?

432
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,520
Let’s go.

433
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,880
Bye, buddy.

434
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,440
Are you lonely?

435
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,480
Do you want someone to feel lonely with?

436
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,120
This guy kept complaining that
he’s hungry since we left the stage.

437
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,440
How about this? You two go eat together.

438
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,240
Me?

439
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,800
With him?

440
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
No way I'm having dinner
with just the two of us.

441
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,440
As for you, turn off
your shipper mode already, all right?

442
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,960
All right. I won’t do that anymore.

443
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,080
I’ll drop everything, okay?

444
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,160
Let’s go eat.

445
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,120
Do you want to join us? No?

446
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,120
Then, it’s the three of us.

447
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,840
Let’s go. Go.

448
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Let’s go.

449
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,200
- See you later.
- See you.

450
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,280
<i>My work is done.</i>

451
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,360
Same here.

452
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,120
Should we meet at the restaurant,
or do you want me to see you first?

453
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,920
Let’s meet at the restaurant.

454
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,120
How have you been?
It’s been so long since we met.

455
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,040
Cheers.

456
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,760
How have you been? Long time no see.

457
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,720
Cheers.

458
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,880
When is he arriving?

459
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,800
I can’t wait to see him.

460
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,120
How have you been?

461
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,920
- I’m good.
- He’s here.

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,840
Come on.

463
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,120
- Po!
- It’s been a while.

464
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,280
This way.

465
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,240
I’ll be right back.

466
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Why did you arrive just now?
Busy with work, huh?

467
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,320
I wasn’t busy.

468
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
There was nothing much to do
at the suit shop, you know.

469
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,560
And how come you’re working
at the suit shop?

470
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
Well, it’s fun.

471
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,880
That’s it.

472
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,040
Let’s not talk about work anymore.

473
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,840
Let’s talk about Mr. B.

474
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,680
When will you bring him to meet us?
I can’t wait.

475
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,680
When he arrives,
I will do a full interview,

476
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,000
asking where, when, and how you two met.

477
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,920
You know I’m such
a little great detective.

478
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I must spy on to make sure that
he’s good enough for you, my buddy.

479
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,520
There he is. He’s here.

480
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,360
Hello, everyone.

481
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,080
Guys, this is Thame,

482
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,960
my boyfriend.

483
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,880
Shit!

484
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,120
Aren’t you going to interrogate him?

485
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,240
You said you would.

486
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,520
Hello.

487
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,680
You’re Bifern, right?

488
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,840
He… knows my name.

489
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,800
- Fern!
- Fern!

490
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,240
- Fern!
- Wake up!

491
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,040
Shit!

492
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
- Fern!
- Fern!

493
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,120
Wake up!

494
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,520
It’s true!

495
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,720
I’m not drunk.

496
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,760
- I’m not drunk.
- You’re not?

497
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,600
You’re already drunk.

498
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,240
Sure.

499
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,840
Sure.

500
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,680
Hey, come.

501
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,600
Looking at him closely,
I think he’s super handsome.

502
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,240
Hey, Po.

503
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,160
- Cheers.
- Hey.

504
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,120
Hey.

505
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,120
Hello. I’m Earn, the owner of EarnChop.

506
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,680
Mind your own business.

507
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,720
- What, Baifern?
- Go back to your table.

508
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,680
Baifern, you’d better stay quiet.

509
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
Ouch!

510
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,400
- Cheers.
- You!

511
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,560
- Bottoms up!
- I’m here.

512
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,960
You still haven’t stopped?!

513
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,160
She’s always like this when she’s drunk.

514
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,200
Your reunion party was fun.

515
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,200
I didn’t expect it to be this fun either.

516
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,840
You know what?

517
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,320
I never joined the previous reunions.

518
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,480
I was scared.

519
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,040
What were you scared of?

520
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,400
Well,

521
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,600
I was scared
that I wasn’t as successful as others.

522
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,920
I wasn’t as good as others.

523
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,240
But in the end, it doesn’t matter.

524
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,880
That’s because you have me.

525
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,800
I guess so.

526
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,520
Won’t you argue a bit?

527
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,000
Having you here really feels nice.

528
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
You know what?

529
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,640
Because of you, I like my typical days.

530
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,640
Because of you, I like my ordinary job.

531
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,440
From now on, I don’t have to be afraid

532
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,040
of answering anyone’s questions anymore

533
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,040
because every answer
I have, ever since meeting you,

534
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,480
has made me realize that…

535
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,040
I’m truly living the life I want.

536
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Thank you.

537
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,880
I told you already

538
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,440
staying together forever will be fine.

539
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
By the way,

540
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,320
which movie should we watch tonight?

541
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,960
Let’s finish the previous one first, okay?

542
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Fine.

543
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,880
I’ll try.

544
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,360
What’s up, Mom?

545
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,000
Hello.

546
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,080
Is something up?

547
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,320
You’re watching it like this again?

548
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,400
Why?

549
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,120
Well,

550
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,440
we never really finish it, do we?

551
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,800
And who said

552
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,120
I actually wanted to watch the movie?
