00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,400
<i>Thame is tearing up the last page</i>

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,080
<i>and rewriting the whole thing with you.</i>

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,960
<i>Since we're all crappy people,</i>

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,760
<i>let's get back up</i>
<i>and move forward together.</i>

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,640
Thank that person for me.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,480
<i>Do you have anything to say to Po?</i>

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>But if you don’t like him,</i>

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,760
then you’re seriously
hurting his feelings.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,120
Tell me what I have to do
to find out if I like him or not.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
<i>If you hear your heart</i>
<i>beat faster than usual…</i>

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,640
<i>…that’s what’s called love.</i>

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,120
Are you…

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,680
trying to prove something?

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Well…

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,400
Well…

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,320
I just want to make sure

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,120
that all this time, I haven’t hurt you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,920
And… how does doing this help?

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Well…

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
It does help me understand something.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,800
What do you mean?

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
My feelings.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,360
I got to realize that…

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,520
I’m sorry,

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,520
but I booked a ride home.

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Can you cancel it, and I’ll walk you home?

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,680
Well, I’m sorry,
but I would like to cancel my booking.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
But…

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,720
take the money, please.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,040
But is it too far to walk there?

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Will you feel achy?

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,480
I won’t.

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
I’m good at walking, you know.

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,680
Baifern even complained that

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,560
she doesn’t want to walk with me

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200
because I walk fast.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,000
But I think you walk slowly.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Well… Hmm?

39
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,440
<i>I’m home now.</i>

40
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,960
<i>Well done.</i>

41
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,160
<i>While we were walking home together,</i>

42
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,520
<i>you mentioned the movie</i>
<i>you wanted to watch.</i>

43
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
<i>What is the name again?</i>

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,440
<i>It’s</i> Love You to Debt.

45
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,920
<i>They’re hosting a special screening</i>
<i>in the cinema again.</i>

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
<i>Why?</i>

47
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
<i>You’re not in a rush</i>
<i>to go watch it, right?</i>

48
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,880
<i>Uh-huh. Why?</i>

49
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
<i>I was just asking.</i>

50
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
THERE'S A SPECIAL SCREENING
AT THE CINEMA AGAIN

51
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,400
WHY?

52
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,880
YOU’RE NOT IN A RUSH
TO WATCH IT, RIGHT?

53
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,320
- UH-HUH. WHY?
- I WAS JUST ASKING

54
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Hey!

55
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Ouch!

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,800
Well…

57
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,840
Why, huh?

58
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,080
Can’t you just walk to me
and talk properly?

59
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,400
This way, it's more exciting.

60
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
It’s scandalous.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah.

62
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,520
So, what’s your business?

63
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Tell the company we’ve
successfully united the group.

64
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,360
Also, tell them
I’m behind this whole thing.

65
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
This is such an easy task.

66
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,440
You can do it, right?

67
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,560
Hold on.

68
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
What again?

69
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,680
They’re trying to find out
who the traitor is, aren’t they?

70
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Also, you’ve spent time with us the most.

71
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,880
If you have nothing to share with them,

72
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,440
they might end up suspecting you.

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,280
I’m sacrificing myself to save you.

74
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,520
Feeling touched, huh?

75
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,320
I’m trying to figure out what you want

76
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,640
as you’re offering yourself
to help like this?

77
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,480
Come on.

78
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
Why do you see me as that kind of person?

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,520
And you aren’t?

80
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,400
I am, actually.

81
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,080
Let’s talk about that later.

82
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,800
That’s it for now.

83
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,760
It’s my fault

84
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,320
for proposing that camping trip idea.

85
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Well, previously,

86
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,600
Jun often sent me
this type of show to watch.

87
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,720
MARS used this opportunity to clear
the air and understand each other better.

88
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
Jun?

89
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
But Jun said he would help us.

90
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
When does the music show
Jun appears on air again?

91
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
Music show? Please give me a second.

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
Music show?

93
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
It’s not on the schedule.

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,400
What?

95
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,840
How could Jun lie to us
through a straight face like that?

96
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
I’m sorry.

97
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
Just forget about it.

98
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,160
When you said it’ll be
the five of them together,

99
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,840
does that include Pepper?

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
Yes.

101
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,800
If that’s the case,
it wouldn’t count as every member.

102
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
Per.

103
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,160
Yeah?

104
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
- I want to ask for some advice.
- Yeah.

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Well,

106
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,640
I already understood what’s going on.

107
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,720
And I think I…

108
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,400
Where’s the damn one who told me
to hurry back for the meeting?

109
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,240
Where did he disappear to?

110
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,200
And where the hell have you been? Come.

111
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,040
People have been waiting for you
since this morning.

112
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Look. Nano is already sleeping.

113
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,080
I’m not. I’m just resting my eyes.

114
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,480
I've got my own stuff to do,
you know, meeting people.

115
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,360
Who’s like you,

116
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
just stuck in a room all the time?

117
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,880
At least I'm being useful
to the group, all right?

118
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm working on arranging the song.

119
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,000
I’m more useful than you, man!

120
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
I went to be a pawn

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
and turned the enemy’s pawn
into a favorite.

122
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,760
- It’s so damn fun!
- I’m confused.

123
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Pawn?

124
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you just come back
from a pawn shop, Jun?

125
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,280
Enough.

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,840
It’s good we’re all here now.

127
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,480
So, what’s our plan now, Thame?

128
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,400
I think the way to prove to the company

129
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,440
that we can continue as MARS is our song

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,080
to show that
we still have enough potential

131
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,880
to earn them money as a group.

132
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,880
And this is everything we have to do.

133
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
LYRICS

134
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
MELODY

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,920
CHOREOGRAPHY / MV
MV SHOOTING / MV RELEASE! / PROMOTION

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
I think we must complete all these

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,600
before the day of our concert,

138
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
so we can change
the concert pattern in time.

139
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
So, we have three months left.

140
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
But if we look back at the timeline,

141
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,040
we’ll have about one
to one and a half months

142
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
to show the company
the amount of profits we could make,

143
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,040
and that means

144
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,960
we have around one month
to produce the song.

145
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
Our MV must be finished
one day before the release date.

146
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,480
How long do you think it will take

147
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,640
to design the performance
and the MV, Nano?

148
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,760
As for the performance,

149
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I need around one week
to design the choreography

150
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
and one more week for practice.

151
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,080
I think we can work
on the MV parallel to that,

152
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,600
so we’ll have roughly three weeks.

153
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
Thame and Dylan,

154
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,600
you need to finish the song
and melody within three weeks.

155
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,560
Think you can do that?

156
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,480
Nano will be in charge of the choreography

157
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,920
and the dance challenge,

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,120
but you also need to practice
your singing more

159
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
because you will have
more lines this time.

160
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,800
Thame and Dylan
are in charge of the song together.

161
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,960
I won’t be designing
the MV concept, though.

162
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,240
Let me go mess with the company
and make them stay away from you all.

163
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,240
It’s way easier for me.

164
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,760
I don’t trust you from the start,
you know.

165
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
If I assign you to design the MV concept,

166
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
I have no clue how your idea
will turn out.

167
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
But you picked the right task
for yourself, though.

168
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,800
I’m deciding who should be
designing the MV concept.

169
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Thame and Dylan in charge of the song

170
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,040
or Nano in charge of the performance.

171
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,640
I bet you three could come up
with an idea.

172
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,280
How about you, Per?

173
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,640
What do you think he’ll do?

174
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,840
He must be supervising all the tasks
to go as planned, of course.

175
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,200
All right, it's settled then, Per.

176
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
I’ll get going.

177
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Are you messing with the company?

178
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,760
I’m off to bed.

179
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,920
Cool.

180
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,920
Then, let me write my plan

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
and insert it into the schedule.

182
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,280
I’ll schedule the date for us, Thame.

183
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,160
SHOW THAME DANCE CHALLENGE IDEA
AND THE PERFORMANCE IDEA ROUND 1/2

184
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,920
THAME CHECK BOTH TO MAKE SURE
THEY'RE IN THE SAME DIRECTION

185
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
COMBINE LYRICS + MELODY
ADJUST IT ROUND 1/2

186
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,880
BRAINSTORM THE DIRECTION WITH THAME

187
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
REFINE THE DETAILS
MEETING FOR REVISIONS

188
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,400
Are you looking for a day
for your movie date?

189
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,960
This is what I want to talk to you about.

190
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,440
Let’s go play basketball and talk.

191
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,680
Yeah.

192
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Did you really have to bring me here
to tutor me on dating?

193
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Is it that difficult?

194
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,880
You know what?

195
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,320
I asked you to reflect on your feelings

196
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,960
because I wanted you
to come back and tell me

197
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,200
you don’t have feelings for him.

198
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,160
I didn’t expect you
to come back with movie tickets.

199
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,000
Why?

200
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,560
Did you forget

201
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,240
idols aren’t allowed to fall in love?

202
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,080
That’s why I decided

203
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
not to take charge of anything
for this single.

204
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
I don’t think I can be
a part of MARS anymore.

205
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,680
Well, I’m in a relationship now.

206
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,320
What?

207
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,640
You heard it right.

208
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,880
But you were one of the first to join us.

209
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,880
I just wanted to support,
so you guys could keep the work going

210
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,360
because I guess I can’t continue anymore.

211
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,480
As for you,

212
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,480
if you’ve already realized your feelings,

213
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,960
it’s still not too late
to stop yourself now,

214
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,160
but… between the two of us,

215
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,600
there have been so many things,

216
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,040
too many for me to just walk away.

217
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,560
But MARS has always been five of us.

218
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,960
Aw, there, there.

219
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,160
MARS doesn’t need to have five members.

220
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
With four members,

221
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,520
MARS can be perfectly complete.

222
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,960
<i>You’re the main vocalist.</i>

223
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,920
<i>Jun is the sub vocalist.</i>

224
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,320
<i>Nano is the main dancer.</i>

225
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,160
<i>Dylan is the main rapper.</i>

226
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,560
See?

227
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,040
It’s complete, really.

228
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Come on. Teach me singing, okay?

229
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
Ugh.

230
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,840
Please.

231
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,040
Wait for Thame to come back and teach you.

232
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,920
He isn’t back yet.

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
Since you’re here now, teach me.

234
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,760
I don’t want to. I’m lazy!

235
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
How much longer
are you guys going to be so loud?

236
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,079
I’m trying to focus here.

237
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh, come on.

238
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
Please.

239
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
No!

240
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,319
What?

241
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
When you asked me to join the group again,
you said you would teach me, didn’t you?

242
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,440
I didn’t say that.

243
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Let the person
who said that teach you, okay?

244
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,400
He isn’t here.

245
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,079
Help me, okay?

246
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
See? He’s back.

247
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,520
Let him teach you.

248
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,560
Fine.

249
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
Bro.

250
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,720
Thame.

251
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,080
What are you doing?

252
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
I’ve got something on my mind.

253
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,720
What is it?

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
JUN MARS

255
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,560
- What?
- Why are you being so rough, babe?

256
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,280
Babe, my foot!

257
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,640
- What’s up?
- What do you want to eat tonight?

258
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,120
I’ll treat you to cheer you up.

259
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,520
<i>Why?</i>

260
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,760
Did you betray me already?

261
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,000
<i>Did you already tell Miss Pemika</i>
<i>I’m a traitor?</i>

262
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
No, of course.

263
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,880
It’s not about work.

264
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,920
Yeah?

265
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,440
PEPPER MARS
ARTIST

266
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>We haven’t figured out who Per is dating,</i>

267
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,400
<i>but I guess it’s probably someone close</i>

268
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
<i>because he told Thame</i>

269
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,200
<i>it’s the person he met often during work.</i>

270
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,240
That person makes him feel more
meaningful than when he’s with the group.

271
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,480
<i>Maybe it’s because that person</i>
<i>always has him in sight.</i>

272
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,320
<i>No wonder Miss Pemika asked</i>

273
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,320
<i>if Per would be part of the group reunion,</i>

274
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
<i>saying if we counted him in,</i>
<i>the reunion couldn’t really happen.</i>

275
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,680
You see now how serious it is, right?

276
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,520
That’s why I told you,
between Thame and you,

277
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,680
it can never be possible.

278
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,880
THAME

279
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,360
Uncle Joei isn’t here?

280
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,360
He went upstairs to sleep already.

281
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
You…

282
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
knew about Per already, right?

283
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,440
Yes.

284
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,280
This is what

285
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,320
I want to talk to you about.

286
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,840
I want to tell you in person.

287
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,680
I think between us…

288
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,680
Are you saying you saw him touch the ring

289
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,920
while talking about this?

290
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,760
Yeah.

291
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,720
The first time I saw him wear this ring

292
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,840
was around three months ago.

293
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
Why did you say that before I did so?

294
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
- Eh?
- I saw it, so I must talk about it.

295
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
But seriously,
if they gave each other the rings,

296
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,960
it means they must have been
dating before that, right?

297
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,760
See? Look at this.

298
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,000
The photos he posted
are all about his MC jobs,

299
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,600
variety shows, events, and dinners.

300
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,600
- Hold on.
- Hey.

301
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,760
Show me that IG account.

302
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,960
But seriously, I just don’t get it.

303
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,080
What’s the point of finding out
who Per is dating?

304
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,800
It’s useful for us because

305
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,920
that person will make us understand him

306
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,120
the way we haven’t before.

307
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,600
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have said

308
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,200
he’s not important to MARS.

309
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Jun, whose IG account do you want me
to show you again?

310
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,120
I think there aren’t
many possible choices left.

311
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,480
If it’s someone who has seen him
all this time…

312
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,200
Ugh, my head hurts so much.

313
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,840
I’ve submitted the work twice already,

314
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
but Miss Gam won’t approve it.

315
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,360
This time, I even went to pray for it,
you know.

316
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,920
Let’s try again next time.

317
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,040
Fine.

318
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,360
Help me pray in case my energy
doesn’t reach the divine forces.

319
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Annyeong.

320
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
What is it again?

321
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,160
MARS keeps causing trouble, huh?

322
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,160
What are you talking about?
I have no clue.

323
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,240
By the way, Ming,

324
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,200
lend me some coins to get some water.

325
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,880
Wow, now, they're asking for money.

326
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,960
Two of you came, and no one has money?

327
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,680
Come on, Ming.

328
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,920
The whole group’s been put on pause.

329
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,440
How are we supposed to have any money?

330
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,760
If you don’t have any coins with you,

331
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,320
please lend me your phone to scan and pay.

332
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,800
Fine.

333
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,000
I’ve got some change with me.

334
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,480
Here.

335
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,680
Hey,

336
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,080
- go already.
- Just go.

337
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,240
Thank you.

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,400
I’m stressed out, come on.

339
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,920
It’s not her?

340
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,560
But seriously,

341
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,520
Per didn’t mention if he’s dating
a woman or a man, right?

342
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,240
- …on 10th.
- Hey, can we have more coins?

343
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,520
Whoa. Stop it already.

344
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,320
We just saw you use your phone.

345
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
Scan and pay, okay?

346
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,720
Why are you asking us for money, huh?

347
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,880
We’re broke!

348
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,960
Come on.

349
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,560
You know we can’t compete
when it comes to luck.

350
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,000
Now, let’s not compete
with who's more broke, okay?

351
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,280
Come on, Jun.
I literally have no more left.

352
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,480
Like, I’m broke.

353
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,880
If Ming doesn’t have any,

354
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
how about you, Tae?

355
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,160
Listen up.

356
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Why do you want so many drinks, huh?

357
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,560
I have to join the meeting real soon.

358
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,560
WHATCHA SMILIN ABOUT?

359
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,840
MOTTO - WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY

360
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,200
Come on, Tae.

361
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,960
Don’t be mean to me.

362
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,600
We’ve been working together for so long.

363
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Won’t you be kind to me a little?

364
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
Ming just gave you some.

365
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,680
Spend your own money, okay?!

366
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,680
I’ll head to the meeting now.
I can’t stand this anymore.

367
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Let’s go.

368
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,720
- Now.
- You’re right.

369
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
Come on, Tae.

370
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,960
It’s only 10 THB.

371
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm begging for the last time. Please.

372
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,040
Don’t touch me. Enough.

373
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,200
I need to go now.

374
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,400
Take it!

375
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
Here you are!

376
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,680
Gotcha. Why did you buy
the same ring as me?

377
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
Eh? You saw that it looks good on me, huh?

378
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,520
- It’s you who bought that after I did.
- Oh, wow.

379
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,400
- I bought it before you.
- I bought it before you.

380
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,560
- Nope. You bought one after I did.
- It was a buy one get one free promotion.

381
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,080
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

382
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,600
- The client…
- Our client has arrived.

383
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,520
Hello.

384
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Hello.

385
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,400
Here she is,

386
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,160
the one who got me stressed out.

387
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,680
Ouch. I’m about to faint.

388
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
Hey.

389
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,680
<i>I figured it out now.</i>

390
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,160
It’s Gam.

391
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,320
You still aren’t allowed to come
to the company, are you?

392
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
That’s why I have to secretly
come here at night.

393
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,800
When you guys found out it’s me,

394
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,960
I thought all four of you
would come and talk.

395
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,480
I wanted all of them to come,

396
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,320
but I preferred talking to you alone.

397
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,280
There are many things

398
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
I want to understand and beg you.

399
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,920
Is that because you still
can’t decide which way to choose?

400
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,560
I’ve already made my decision,

401
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,680
and I want Per to make the same decision.

402
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,560
One game, okay?

403
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,520
You talked to Gam already, right?

404
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,040
Yeah.

405
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,880
So, what’s your answer?

406
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,120
All I could think was, "Really?",

407
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,720
both about your decision

408
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,360
and you saying I’m important to the group.

409
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
An all-rounder is supposed
to fulfill every position.

410
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
If you can’t sing,

411
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
I must do it.

412
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,920
If Nano can’t dance,

413
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,280
I must do it,

414
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,400
or if Dylan can’t rap,

415
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,560
I must be able to do it.

416
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,080
I think I’m not that type of member.

417
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,920
To me, an all-rounder can be defined
in two ways.

418
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
The first one is exactly what you said,

419
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,280
and the second one is who you are now.

420
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,400
Someone who can take care
of the other members.

421
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,520
It’s true I’m the leader,

422
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,600
but what I do is to represent you guys,

423
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
talking to the company

424
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,920
and determining the vision with them.

425
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,640
But the person who can
take care of our members

426
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,280
has always been you.

427
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
I believe that

428
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
if MARS could pick the leader themselves,

429
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,800
it wouldn’t be me.

430
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,920
You should have been in this position.

431
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,360
I can only set the goals,

432
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,720
but the one who can work through the steps

433
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,520
is you.

434
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,000
You said MARS doesn’t need you.

435
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,840
That’s totally not true.

436
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,320
MARS needs you the most.

437
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,280
You also said
you couldn’t do all those things.

438
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,920
That’s not true either.

439
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,960
You can sing,

440
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,360
rap, and also dance.

441
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,520
Most importantly, you excel at them.

442
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,240
Even if

443
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Gam and I are a ticking time bomb
for you guys?

444
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,400
I have my own ticking time bomb, don’t I?

445
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,760
Per, trust me,

446
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,800
don’t break up with her.

447
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,400
I know you can’t ask for a breakup

448
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,320
because when I was about to tell him

449
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,280
that I could no longer like him,

450
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,640
I turned speechless too.

451
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
That’s why I think

452
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,520
we’ll just keep going together like this.

453
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I believe that we can both work as a group

454
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,120
and like someone at the same time

455
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,600
because both are part of our lives.

456
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,800
You’re madly in love with him, aren’t you?

457
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,040
All right.

458
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,320
From listening to me,

459
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,480
are you now convinced
to become MARS again?

460
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
Well, I have a question.

461
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,400
What is it?

462
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,480
Can I take her to our group’s house too?

463
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,960
I’m sick of those crazy in love, man.

464
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,480
Come on.

465
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,720
You aren’t different from me.

466
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,240
Blue.

467
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,800
Guys,

468
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,000
this is Gam, my girlfriend.

469
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,480
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

470
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,880
I think you all know each other already.

471
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
I bet you have something
to talk to her about.

472
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,360
I’m sorry that
I used to be flirty with you.

473
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,800
Well,

474
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,000
I didn’t know you’re Per’s girlfriend.

475
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
When?

476
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,320
All the time.

477
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,239
- Per.
- Jun!

478
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,679
Don’t touch me.

479
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,520
- Per.
- You did that all the time, huh?

480
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,880
That’s what I always do, you know.

481
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,840
But she’s my girlfriend.

482
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
- Per.
- You shouldn’t have done that.

483
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,520
- Per, relax.
- Jun!

484
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
- Per. Per.
- Let’s fight.

485
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,440
- Don’t.
- Let’s fight.

486
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,719
- You know what I’m like, don’t you?
- Run.

487
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
But she’s my girlfriend!

488
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,320
- Run. Run now.
- Hurry up.

489
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,360
- Hey.
- Jun.

490
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,600
Per!

491
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Jun.

492
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
- Come here.
- Per.

493
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,640
Just jump over it.

494
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,360
<i>Po, I have something to talk to you about.</i>

495
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,960
<i>Can you come to the group's house?</i>

496
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,520
I thought he would come.

497
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
I also wanted him to come.

498
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Why?

499
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,480
I just don’t get it.

500
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,760
Well, let me ask you something.

501
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,320
When you were about to say
you would stop your feelings for him

502
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,640
and then you didn’t say it,

503
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,000
what did you say instead?

504
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
I just want to tell you

505
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,640
to take good care of yourself.

506
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
I want him to take good care of himself,

507
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,440
so that we can fight
on this journey together.

508
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,280
You know what?

509
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,320
That could be interpreted
in the other way.

510
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,160
What is it?

511
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,000
Stop feeling for each other
and take care of yourself.

512
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
Huh?

513
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,040
You're dumb.

514
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,040
I’m not surprised he didn't come.

515
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,160
He must be lying there
all sad and mopey now.

516
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,440
Thame.

517
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,480
You need to get good at laying low.

518
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,880
One more thing you need
to be careful of is the distance.

519
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,000
If you don’t want anyone to catch on,

520
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,760
when you’re outside,

521
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,160
keep a five-meter distance.

522
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,560
Gam and I have been using
this distance all this time.

523
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,800
Thanks.

524
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,960
<i>Hey, if Mr. B told Mr. A</i>

525
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,680
<i>to take good care of himself,</i>

526
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
<i>what did that mean?</i>

527
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,720
<i>It’s this clear,</i>
<i>but you couldn’t figure it out?</i>

528
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,480
<i>He dumped you.</i>

529
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,120
When I told you to take care of yourself,

530
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
how did you interpret it?

531
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,640
Huh?

532
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
You didn’t think

533
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,720
I told you to take care
of yourself alone, did you?

534
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,280
Well…

535
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,160
You did?

536
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,840
So, what did you mean?

537
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Anyway,

538
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,000
I’ll tell you about Per and Gam.

539
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,880
Per and Gam?

540
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,880
Which Gam are you talking about?

541
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,120
- You mean, Miss Gam?
- Yeah.

542
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,640
Huh?

543
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,600
So, you told Pepper

544
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,480
they could do both things
at the same time?

545
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,120
So, when you told me
to take care of myself…

546
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
Oh.

547
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,840
I meant, be careful.

548
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,920
Well, it won’t be good
if others know that…

549
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,680
Well,

550
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,360
I might get fired, right?

551
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,040
You aren’t walking fast as Baifern said.

552
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,880
Well, you’re walking at this speed.

553
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,280
Try walking at your own speed then.

554
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,720
But…

555
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Come on.

556
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,360
<i>Next time, don’t follow my speed, okay?</i>

557
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,160
<i>Just be yourself.</i>

558
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,880
<i>I want to adjust myself</i>
<i>to your rhythm too.</i>

559
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,680
<i>How about we find a balance</i>

560
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
<i>to see which speed suits us best?</i>

561
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,560
<i>That sounds like a good idea.</i>

562
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
I’m heading inside.

563
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,680
Thanks for walking me home.

564
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,680
Yeah.

565
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,920
You should go back now. It’s already late.

566
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,640
I know.

567
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,720
Why haven’t you left yet?

568
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
Why did you come back and check?

569
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,680
I just wanted to know if you left already.

570
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,840
Just go.

571
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,200
You haven’t left?

572
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,720
Come.

573
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,680
Walk me to the bus stop.

574
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,000
Which bus number are you taking?

575
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Seventy-seven.

576
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,280
Hey, it’s here.

577
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,440
Eh? You aren’t going?

578
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,240
Can I walk you home again?

579
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,600
Po.

580
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,960
Can you walk me there again?

581
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,720
Can I walk you home one more time?

582
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,360
You don’t feel achy at all?

583
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,160
You do?

584
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,320
No.

585
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,240
Well, then…

586
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,360
I bet neither of us will arrive home.

587
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
You’re right.

588
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,760
Pepper told me that

589
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,760
when we’re outside,

590
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,520
we must keep a five-meter distance,

591
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,480
so we won’t get caught.

592
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,440
Caught for what?

593
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,400
Caught for…

594
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,080
Forget about it.

595
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,600
And…

596
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,760
do we need to keep that distance?

597
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,120
Well,

598
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,720
I think we should,

599
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,240
but…

600
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,960
since we have time,

601
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,480
we should have watched the movie,

602
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,400
but we can’t make it in time now.

603
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,240
Anyway,

604
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,080
can we watch it next week?

605
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,520
Um…

606
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,360
Let’s not keep a five-meter distance

607
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,520
because even five centimeters
feels too far apart.

608
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,480
We can start working on our MV now.

609
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,440
So, we’re going to be busy
both day and night, right?

610
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,720
I will handle the MV.

611
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,520
Do you want to get to work
right beside him?

612
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,600
You’ll have to give it your all, though.

613
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,640
If you slack off,
Thame will definitely get mad.

614
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,880
Why are you putting
so much pressure on me?

615
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,320
If you want him to love you,

616
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,680
why not do something he’ll admire?
