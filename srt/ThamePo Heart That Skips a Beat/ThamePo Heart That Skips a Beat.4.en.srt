1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Thame, I've figured out
who's been helping you.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,640
Where are you?

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,760
Are you still at the set?

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,120
What did you say to him?

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,320
Why did he agree to come back
and do this for the others again?

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
He should have learned
to be selfish sometimes.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,720
He's bringing the group back together

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,520
to make up for the leadership
he failed to provide.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,080
Since your friend is being this selfish,

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,440
don't you want to support him somehow?

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,720
Thanks for going back
to the group's house.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,480
Don't think I'm into it or something.
Please, okay?

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,680
No one lives there.

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,960
Why wouldn't I stay?

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,880
<i>I cleared things up with him already,</i>
<i>but I've got a new problem now.</i>

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,120
I don't have your number.
Tell me your number.

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,600
I'll remember every single digit.

18
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,880
I don't want to forget it.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,840
I told you,
he's the easiest one to come back.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,680
I've got one point now.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,040
You guys handle the rest.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,120
You want me to help
bring Nano back first, right?

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,520
Dylan.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,480
Dylan?

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,360
THAME.TEEMA: I NEED YOUR HELP.

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,280
WHY DID YOU READ MY MESSAGE SO FAST?

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,360
MY HAND ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE SCREEN
SO, WHAT'S UP?

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,400
Whoa!

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,160
What's with that face?

30
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,320
Aren't you excited to see me?

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,760
Why should I be?

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,840
Is there anything
I should be excited about?

33
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,040
What makes Thame confident

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
that someone like you can help?

35
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,480
What does Thame want me to help with?

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,520
<i>There are two things</i>
<i>we need to split up and look for.</i>

37
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,360
<i>You need to find where Dylan is</i>

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,920
<i>because no one has been able to reach him,</i>

39
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,800
<i>except Mick.</i>

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,880
Well…

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
<i>As for me,</i>

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,040
<i>I must get the storage room key</i>
<i>to look for a specific song.</i>

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,040
Why do you want the storage room key?

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I must write a song to sing
during my live streaming,

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,280
so I want to borrow some old lyrics
the company already threw away.

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
If I just randomly pick one from Cloud,

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,680
it might be someone's comeback single.

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
But it's up to you, then.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,160
I can write a new song myself,

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,080
but I don't know how it will turn out.

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,960
Hold on.

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,160
How smart Thame is.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,640
He made you join first because he knew
you could really help a lot.

54
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
You should have
complimented me, shouldn't you?

55
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Has Thame even done anything yet?

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
Fine. You're smart.

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,240
You're so smart for being two-faced.

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,880
At least I managed
to get the hard part done,

59
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
unlike you,

60
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
who can't get anything done right.

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
Eh?

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,680
It's not my fault.

63
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
That slacker Mick doesn't even work,

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
so he doesn't know where Dylan is.

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,280
Just forget about it.

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
At least the important thing is here.

67
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,400
If we can find that song,

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,400
Dylan will probably agree to talk.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,480
A song?

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
Thame chose to bring Dylan back first

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,680
because I think he knows

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,400
the conflict between them…

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
…is this.

74
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,480
Oh?

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,960
So, so many of the songs Dylan composed
got rejected by the company?

76
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
There are more than this, actually.

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,000
Dylan agreed to sign with the company

78
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,200
because at first, he probably
thought they liked his songs,

79
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,840
but in reality,

80
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,280
they just wanted a good rapper
to add something to an idol group.

81
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,320
<i>That's why he didn't</i>
<i>get along with others much,</i>

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,880
<i>except with Thame.</i>

83
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
How about…

84
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,360
trying it this way?

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
But it's such a high note.

86
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,320
Who could hit it?

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
I could.

88
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,840
<i>Not willing to risk it</i>

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,240
<i>Can't say goodbye</i>

90
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,880
<i>From not coming</i>
<i>to the group's house at all,</i>

91
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,120
<i>he agreed to come because of Thame.</i>

92
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
<i>Thame once mentioned</i>

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,520
<i>he'd finally make Dylan a PD.</i>

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,520
- <i>That's why he agreed to stay,</i>
- Dammit. This works.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,440
<i>believing Thame</i>
<i>could really make it happen.</i>

96
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,360
Nice.

97
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,040
Let's keep it on the hard disk,

98
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,600
because if we add it on Cloud,
it will become Oner's.

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Hold on.

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Are you saying that song was…

101
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,720
I want us to produce this single for MARS.

102
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,360
It's the song that…

103
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
CAN I MAKE YOU MINE?

104
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,640
<i>He made it with Dylan.</i>

105
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,600
We aren't going to do it, Thame.

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
But I fixed it with…

107
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
Dylan.

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,600
Done, done, done.

109
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Done, done, done.

110
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,520
Done, done, done.

111
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,400
<i>Part of the reason Thame's</i>
<i>been pushing himself so hard</i>

112
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,080
<i>is for Dylan's song to be accepted.</i>

113
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,680
This one will do.

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,200
- It's exactly this one.
- Write it down.

115
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
- Write it down now.
- Okay.

116
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,480
But yeah,

117
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,240
when it didn't really happen,

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,800
the person who felt the most betrayed…

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,560
Thame!

120
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
- Dylan!
- Dylan, calm down!

121
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
- <i>…is Dylan.</i>
- Hey!

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
Why the hell should I calm myself down?

123
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,960
Can't you see?

124
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
He's betraying all of us!

125
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
You're fucking fake!

126
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Dylan!

127
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
- Dylan!
- Dylan!

128
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,559
Dylan!

129
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,480
Actually,

130
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,000
knowing that Thame is reuniting the group,

131
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,840
Dylan was supposed
to be happy about it, wasn't he?

132
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,760
Dylan is not the type to take a risk
with someone who's betrayed him once.

133
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,280
That's why Pepper and I told Thame

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,040
it's really hard to bring Dylan
back first,

135
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
but Thame insisted.

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,080
Trust me,

137
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,240
we really have to bring Dylan back first,

138
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,440
no matter how hard it is.

139
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm not sure what's on his mind.

140
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,840
Check over there first.

141
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
I'll fetch the one
who caused this trouble.

142
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,040
Huh?

143
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,360
How is everything?

144
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,920
What did you expect us to get, huh?
We've just got in here.

145
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,760
You said you split up with Per
to look for Dylan, didn't you?

146
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,240
Why did you suddenly show up here?

147
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,600
I already did, but couldn't find him.

148
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,040
Hey. Po, how is it going?

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
Well,

150
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,240
this is what I found.

151
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
It's not this one.

152
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,240
Thame, Jun.

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,720
DYLAN

154
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
<i>You aren't at the group's house, Thame?</i>

155
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
Why?

156
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm thinking about coming back to see you.

157
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,040
Yeah.

158
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,440
After knowing you didn't go to Korea,

160
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,480
I was probably too hot-headed,

161
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,880
<i>but after thinking it over,</i>
<i>it might be good for me,</i>

162
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,040
so we can produce songs together again.

163
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
You're fucking fake!

164
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,280
Well, yeah.

165
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,160
That's true.

166
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,840
<i>Eh? What's with that voice?</i>

167
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,080
<i>Aren't you happy I'm back, huh?</i>

168
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,680
Don't tell me you're suspicious

169
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,000
because I came back so easily like this.

170
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm not. I just…

171
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,600
Anyway, I'll talk to you there.

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Good.

173
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,760
But come alone.

174
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,520
Mm-hmm.

175
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
Is something up?

176
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,920
Oh,

177
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,880
Per called.

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,960
I'll see him now.

179
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,560
Please continue looking for it.

180
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,080
Shit. Thame, hold on.

181
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,640
Mick is here. Dammit. Come here.
Hide, both of you.

182
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
Hey, Mick?

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,400
What are you doing down here?
Are you helping me look for it?

184
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,880
How can you be this kind?

185
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,360
Helping? I'm not doing that.

186
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,560
I just came to check

187
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
if there's somewhere
I can secretly take a nap.

188
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
You can keep looking for it,

189
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
no matter how long it takes.

190
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,760
Tell others
I came to help you look for it already.

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,920
Hey, hold on.

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,440
Why are you sleeping there?
It's covered in dust.

193
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,800
Come with me. I'll help you find it.

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,680
I guarantee nobody will find you.

195
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,560
I'm pretty good at lying about
how good you're at doing your job.

196
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Come on. Let's go.

197
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,840
Well,

198
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm off.

199
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
THE 2021 ANNUAL CONCERT DOCUMENT

200
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,960
Yeah.

201
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,840
I'll continue looking for it.

202
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,760
Thank you.

203
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,640
<i>What the hell is damn</i>
<i>wrong with you, Thame?!</i>

204
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,040
Dylan!

205
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
<i>Thame, I'm too lazy to wait now.</i>

206
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,320
Well, I have a rap battle coming up.

207
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,480
What?

208
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,920
Yeah, come join me.

209
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
Me?

210
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
<i>Those jerks always</i>
<i>look down on rapper idols,</i>

211
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,520
<i>calling them lousy.</i>

212
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Show them

213
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,680
we're the real deal.

214
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,640
Come with me.

215
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
Where?

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll send you the location.

217
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,960
Oh, it's so cramped.

218
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,080
You two must have been
all squished together.

219
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,400
Hey.

220
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
Just so you know,

221
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,960
don't get carried away, okay?

222
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,240
I've noticed it a few times already.

223
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,280
You have a crush on him, don't you?

224
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,640
Thame won't like you.

225
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,000
He likes tiny girls,

226
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,000
not a big guy like you.

227
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
If you can't benefit him,
he won't care about you.

228
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,480
See?

229
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,240
After Pepper and I joined,
does he reply to your message?

230
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
Dylan will join soon.

231
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
Get ready to be forgotten, bro.

232
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Shut up.

233
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,920
Consider this a warning from me.

234
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,200
COME GET YOUR FRIEND'S CORPSE AT DEXSTROSE

235
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,720
PEPPER

236
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,720
What's up?

237
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,400
<i>Hello, Jun? Is Thame with you?</i>

238
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,480
<i>I think Dylan is definitely messing around</i>
<i>with Thame now.</i>

239
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Dylan left a note here.

240
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,720
From what I checked,

241
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,160
this place is an underground rappers' pub.

242
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,240
<i>To join the gang,</i>

243
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,240
<i>you have to be accepted by them first.</i>

244
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,000
<i>Those guys really hate idol rap.</i>

245
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,120
HAVING LOTS OF FANS
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE TALENTED

246
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,880
<i>They once insulted us</i>
<i>for our stupid pop music,</i>

247
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,560
<i>especially Thame,</i>

248
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,520
<i>since he's the most famous member.</i>

249
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,160
THAT'S JUST HOW THE FAKE
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WORKS

250
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,680
<i>I think Dylan is tricking Thame</i>
<i>into getting trashed there,</i>

251
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,920
<i>so he'll get accepted by that gang.</i>

252
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,720
DID THOSE POP IDOLS EVER WRITE
THEIR OWN SONGS?

253
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,200
- <i>Per, have you arrived?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

254
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,840
If you're there already,
go find Thame first

255
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Thame,

256
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
let's go back.

257
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
Dylan is really not
coming back to join us.

258
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,200
He just tricked you to come here because--

259
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
I knew.

260
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,560
- You knew, but you still…
- Yeah.

261
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
Hey? You're here?

262
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
Thame, let's go on stage.

263
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,320
Yeah.

264
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,520
Dammit. Jun, come here right now.

265
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,920
Make some noises!

266
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,760
Okay. That's enough. That's enough.

267
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,080
Today, we have a very special guest

268
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,120
to join the rap battle with us on stage.

269
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,840
He's the leader of a popular idol group.

270
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,120
Give it up for Thame from MARS.

271
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,280
Boo!

272
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,480
- So, what's the deal?
- I think you should go home.

273
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,080
You or I will go first?

274
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,440
I think I should go first

275
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,480
because from looking at you now,

276
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,800
I bet there's nothing in your brain.

277
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,040
Since you came right to my area,

278
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,520
and a good chance to bash
a stupid idol like you is pretty rare,

279
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,720
I'd better grab this good chance, right?

280
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,000
Let me give you one warning.

281
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,080
You can't use your face
to beat me on this stage.

282
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,040
What can make you win is in here.

283
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,200
Music sense. Get it?

284
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,000
You don't?

285
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm rooting for you, then.

286
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,600
I hope…

287
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,640
your handsome look and funny dance move,

288
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,720
like this,

289
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
can beat me.

290
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,200
Anything to say before you rap?

291
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
No. Just start already.

292
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
That's your choice

293
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
because after this,

294
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,400
you're probably going
to keep quiet for a long time, buddy.

295
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,880
DJ, drop the beat.

296
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,760
Everyone, hands up!

297
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,080
You might be talented
on that stupid idol stage,

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,880
but not here, dude.

299
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,240
The real deal is here.

300
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,400
Go for it, bro!

301
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,640
<i>Real style hiphop right here</i>

302
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,480
<i>I'm going head-to-head</i>
<i>With this idol for real</i>

303
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>Just a handsome look</i>
<i>With that cheesy dance?</i>

304
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
<i>I'm not feeling it even just a glance</i>

305
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,640
<i>My chill rap is ready</i>
<i>To kill that black sheep</i>

306
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,320
<i>If we compete by music, you're just gravel</i>
<i>While I'm a diamond piece</i>

307
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,440
<i>What a lie to your fans acting</i>
<i>All united only in front of the camera</i>

308
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,640
<i>Faking everything, everywhere keep</i>

309
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,240
<i>Pretending you love each other</i>
<i>That's insane</i>

310
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
<i>After some fame, you changed, went solo</i>

311
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,640
<i>Acting like the brave hero</i>
<i>Holding the fort, bro</i>

312
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,400
<i>Looking for a good friend?</i>
<i>Not even one in ten more lifetimes</i>

313
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,400
<i>Not even one in ten more lifetimes</i>

314
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,600
Yo!

315
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,160
Yo!

316
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
<i>Whatever you think is whatever you think</i>

317
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,280
<i>Thinking on your own, ignoring the truth</i>
<i>That's way too easy, huh?</i>

318
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,760
<i>Great on your own</i>
<i>Winning on your own, never losing</i>

319
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,920
<i>Just found out being great</i>
<i>Can make you look down on others</i>

320
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,120
<i>If this is what you call great</i>
<i>I'd rather not be great</i>

321
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,240
<i>Cuz you're great</i>
<i>Inside your own little world</i>

322
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,720
<i>Idols aren't always fake</i>
<i>Take a look with your eyes wide awake</i>

323
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,760
<i>Idols have their talents, too</i>
<i>Come out of your shell and see what we do</i>

324
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,920
Your rap is good,

325
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,680
but I think it's better if you don't rap.

326
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,480
Show your strengths, will you?

327
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,560
I can't see any, you know.

328
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
<i>Show me what you've got</i>

329
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,720
<i>Oh, that mini heart is on point</i>

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,720
<i>You keep acting cool</i>

331
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,960
<i>A poser, that's you</i>

332
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,480
<i>I'll bash you into pieces</i>

333
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,720
<i>Don't say a word, I don't get it</i>

334
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>You're great on camera</i>

335
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,640
<i>But in reality, you're such a fake star</i>

336
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
<i>You've got no music sense</i>
<i>Your rhyme is like a goddamn mess</i>

337
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,120
<i>All your songs are trash</i>

338
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
<i>But you trick fans with those merchandise</i>

339
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
<i>I've been moving this industry up</i>

340
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,160
<i>But it's you dragging it down</i>

341
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
<i>Idols you say are good</i>

342
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,880
<i>Turn music into a dumb mood</i>

343
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,480
<i>Dumb is what to call</i>
<i>Those full of their own hype</i>

344
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
<i>What we do ain't any different types</i>

345
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,400
<i>Cause we're making music every day</i>

346
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,920
<i>How could you judge</i>
<i>What's exactly a better way?</i>

347
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,840
<i>It can't be judged</i>
<i>Cuz art has its own value</i>

348
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,280
<i>Your music is good in your own way</i>

349
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,760
<i>Mine is good in my style</i>

350
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,000
<i>Doing our own things in different</i>
<i>Directions and different vibes</i>

351
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,040
<i>But they're music, both yours and mine</i>

352
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,160
Let me show you the real deal then.

353
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,560
You're just a baby growing up.

354
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
Go for it!

355
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>Ah, so I'm gonna hit, flip and flow</i>
<i>Let this kiddo catch a lesson</i>

356
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,280
<i>Don't buddy up, not with me</i>
<i>I ain't cool with that, can't you see?</i>

357
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,400
<i>What you do is just for a show</i>

358
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,720
<i>Don't go bragging around</i>

359
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,960
<i>You said we're the same</i>

360
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
<i>That's in your dream, bro</i>

361
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,560
<i>I'm real, but you're fake</i>

362
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,160
<i>If you don't keep your head down</i>
<i>I'll get this into your head right now</i>

363
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
<i>I'm on the top, you're way down low</i>

364
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,840
<i>Idols and artists</i>
<i>Don't share the same flow</i>

365
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,840
<i>No matter what, we aren't similar, kiddo</i>

366
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,400
Yo! Ah!

367
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,280
Yo!

368
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,120
Yo! Ah!

369
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,640
I'm waiting. Hurry up.

370
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,640
<i>It's so hard to change your mind</i>

371
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,960
<i>I'm tired of saying it all the time</i>

372
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,720
<i>It's so trivial, it ain't that tough</i>

373
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
<i>Keep this in mind, I just want you to know</i>

374
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
<i>I just want to say</i>

375
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
He's screwed.

376
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,080
<i>I just want to say</i>

377
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,560
Boo!

378
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,800
Hey?

379
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,800
You two are here, too?

380
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,200
Nice.

381
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,360
Nice? Shit.

382
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,320
I know what your plan is.

383
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
So what?

384
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,840
Thame not knowing is enough.

385
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,600
You think he doesn't know?

386
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,160
Thame,

387
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,920
wait for Jun.

388
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
If you get on stage,
you'll just get bashed.

389
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
At first, I thought he was mad at me
because of that song issue,

390
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
but when I came here,

391
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
I found out it wasn't.

392
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,760
You aren't going back home
on New Year's Day?

393
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,240
Nope.

394
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,680
You?

395
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,760
- Happy New Year, buddy!
- Happy New Year, buddy!

396
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,400
Let me feed you one bite.

397
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,760
- You didn't slice them equally.
- I think they're equal already.

398
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,360
- Move.
- Why?

399
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,320
Let him sleep here with us.

400
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,200
- You're scared of lightning, huh?
- Jun.

401
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,280
Come, come. Hug Dylan.

402
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
There, there.

403
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,200
He isn't mad at me about the song at all.

404
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,000
He's mad because

405
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
I pushed him out of my life.

406
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,920
If I can't really bring him back,

407
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,880
MARS can't be reunited anyway.

408
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,480
I must go on stage.

409
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
If I really can't bring him back,

410
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,400
I must give him
a new home, no matter what.

411
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
Let me tell you one more thing.

412
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,760
He's never left you behind.

413
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
All he did

414
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,240
was to make your song reach Miss Pemika.

415
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,200
CAN I MAKE YOU MINE?

416
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,000
<i>But it was us who chose</i>
<i>to leave him first, wasn't it?</i>

417
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,880
Today, he went on stage for you.

418
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,600
It's up to you now how to deal with this.

419
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,720
You can see now

420
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,720
that idols are such damn losers, right?

421
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,800
But this isn't enough, Mr. Thame.

422
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,320
I have a very special guest,

423
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,720
imported right from your own group.

424
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,240
I think he knows better than I do

425
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,000
how rotten the idol industry is.

426
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Give it up for Dylan!

427
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,960
Dylan! Dylan!

428
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,760
Dylan! Dylan!

429
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,120
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

430
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Dylan! Dylan!

431
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

432
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,880
Dylan!

433
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,120
If you want to join my crew,

434
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,800
break your leader down
right on this stage.

435
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,040
Give it up for Dylan!

436
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,160
How stupid you are for coming here
just to let me humiliate you.

437
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,760
But it's good

438
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,320
because it even proves to me that…

439
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,840
<i>Idols aren't fake like those with egos</i>

440
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,920
<i>You opened my eyes, set me free</i>
<i>Like a neck with no chains</i>

441
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,920
<i>Idols are trained a lot</i>
<i>Sharper than a cleaver</i>

442
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
<i>Come cut and chop</i>
<i>Ready to slice that ego fever</i>

443
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,040
<i>Listening to you got me down</i>

444
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,240
<i>Even your thoughts are so funny now</i>

445
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,360
<i>Saying pop music ain't cool?</i>

446
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,760
<i>You're the only one thinking that bullshit</i>

447
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,480
<i>I respect music</i>

448
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,720
<i>I respect freedom</i>

449
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,920
<i>Today, I realize the value of an idol</i>
<i>Like me is straight up fire</i>

450
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Oh, let me continue a bit.

451
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,440
You said you're the only one who's real,

452
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,360
but idols are super fake.

453
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm sorry, bro.

454
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
No respect for you tonight.

455
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,360
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

456
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

457
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,200
Dylan!

458
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,360
If you want me to join the group again,

459
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,280
for this comeback,

460
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,400
I must get to produce
and make our title track.

461
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,560
If any of you dudes
promise me and fail to do so,

462
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,120
don't talk crap.

463
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,280
Do it.

464
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
No matter what,

465
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,320
we'll produce this song ourselves.

466
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,240
It took you forever to give in, man.

467
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
You nearly had
Thame at his breaking point.

468
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,200
My breaking point wasn't today.

469
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,640
Come on.

470
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,320
I'll go rip it apart for you
when I head back.

471
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,240
Let's go.

472
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,760
Your face is a total mess.

473
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,920
Dang, it really is a mess.

474
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,960
Whoa, this is such a strong déjà vu.

475
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
<i>You have a crush on him, don't you?</i>

476
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,320
<i>Thame won't like you.</i>

477
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,520
<i>After Pepper and I joined,</i>
<i>does he reply to your message?</i>

478
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,560
MY HAND ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE SCREEN
SO, WHAT'S UP?

479
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,040
<i>Dylan will join soon.</i>

480
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,880
<i>Get ready to be forgotten, bro.</i>

481
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,920
THAME.TEEMA: HAVE YOU GONE TO BED YET?

482
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,280
NO. WHAT'S UP?

483
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,960
Hello?

484
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,920
I'm sorry.

485
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,680
I didn't reply to your message all day.

486
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,000
Are you overthinking?

487
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
- Well, I…
- <i>You can be frank with me.</i>

488
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,600
<i>I think it's totally fine if you are.</i>

489
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,080
I've been acting badly.

490
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,760
I should have made you
feel more important.

491
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,840
It's because you were busy.

492
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
<i>That can't be the reason.</i>

493
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,040
I don't want to use
this excuse with anyone again.

494
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,400
I almost lost all of my friends

495
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,080
because of something like this.

496
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,600
I see.

497
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
<i>You're overthinking it, right?</i>

498
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,120
I'm sorry.

499
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,480
I won't do it again.

500
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,240
I'll try harder.

501
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,760
Thank you.

502
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,480
By the way,

503
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,120
did you find the lyrics?

504
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Yeah.

505
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,560
It's in the last box I checked.

506
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,920
You want it, right?

507
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,040
<i>I'll give it to you tomorrow.</i>

508
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,720
No.

509
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,640
I don't need it anymore,

510
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
but I want to thank you

511
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,800
for helping me find it until you found it.

512
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,560
At first, I wanted to thank you in person,

513
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
so I went to the company,
but you weren't there.

514
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,120
You went back?

515
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,440
Well,

516
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,040
actually, I went to see you at the pub.

517
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,280
Why didn't you wait there to meet up?

518
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,120
There were only you
and your members there.

519
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm an outsider.

520
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,280
You aren't an outsider.

521
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,800
Or…

522
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,280
am I someone else to you?

523
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Hey, no, no.

524
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,400
<i>No, I mean…</i>

525
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,120
Well,

526
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm not close to you guys.

527
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,600
What do I have to do

528
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
to make us close?

529
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,960
Keep talking, I guess,

530
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,719
to learn more about each other.

531
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,639
Well, then,

532
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,040
ask me something personal.

533
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,560
What do you like to eat?

534
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,320
<i>Are you close with Dad or Mom?</i>

535
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,080
<i>Neither.</i>

536
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,320
<i>My parents are rarely home.</i>

537
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,719
<i>They only show up</i>
<i>when there's something for the media.</i>

538
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,360
<i>I'm closer with my dog.</i>

539
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
<i>It's good your parents</i>
<i>don't interfere much with your life.</i>

540
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,440
<i>As for me, my parents are really involved.</i>

541
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,920
<i>Especially since they got divorced,</i>

542
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
<i>it's like they're competing</i>
<i>over who I love more.</i>

543
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
<i>That's adorable, though.</i>

544
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,000
<i>It feels much warmer than my family.</i>

545
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,400
<i>It's chaotic, actually.</i>

546
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,440
<i>My mom is really close with my stepmom,</i>

547
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,040
<i>and my dad is close with my stepdad,</i>

548
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,240
<i>but my parents keep arguing until now.</i>

549
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,120
<i>They like to compete in whatever they do.</i>

550
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,800
<i>It turns out that, among these four,</i>

551
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,240
<i>the two who hate each other the most</i>
<i>are my own parents.</i>

552
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
<i>That sounds pretty fun.</i>

553
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,200
<i>It's super chaotic.</i>

554
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,360
<i>When they first got divorced,</i>

555
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,520
<i>I had to celebrate</i>
<i>my birthday twice a year,</i>

556
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,000
<i>New Year twice a year,</i>

557
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,440
<i>and Songkran twice a year.</i>

558
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
<i>But now that they're friends,</i>

559
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,560
<i>we gather to celebrate together.</i>

560
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,680
<i>Whenever there's a celebration,</i>

561
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,920
<i>we've got five members,</i>
<i>just like your group.</i>

562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,200
<i>I want to see that.</i>

563
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,480
<i>Are you coming to my house?</i>

564
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,520
<i>Yeah.</i>

565
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,080
<i>If there's a chance, I'd love to.</i>

566
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,480
<i>But… you're an idol.</i>

567
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,080
<i>Can't an idol go to your house?</i>

568
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,560
<i>That's not what I mean.</i>

569
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,320
<i>I'm worried my family will be in shock.</i>

570
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,880
<i>But if your parents like me,</i>
<i>I think it will be nice.</i>

571
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
<i>Which song is their favorite?</i>

572
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,280
<i>I'll sing it for them there.</i>

573
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,440
<i>They like those old songs</i>

574
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,600
<i>by Jae, Pun, and so on.</i>

575
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,720
<i>I see.</i>

576
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,720
<i>I played them before.</i>

577
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,520
<i>How about you?</i>

578
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,400
<i>What is your favorite song?</i>

579
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,320
<i>Recently, I've been into</i>
<i>the song called "Good Time".</i>

580
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,360
<i>I see.</i>

581
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,960
<i>I've never figured out</i>
<i>the chords to this song.</i>

582
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,520
<i>Is it a song from a series?</i>

583
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>You like this series?</i>

584
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,720
<i>Yeah.</i>

585
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>I like watching movies</i>
<i>that portray people's lives.</i>

586
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
<i>That's why you're working</i>
<i>on a documentary.</i>

587
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,840
<i>How about you?</i>

588
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,960
<i>What's your favorite movie genre?</i>

589
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,000
<i>I'm more into reading books.</i>

590
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,280
<i>That's why you can compose songs, right?</i>

591
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,880
<i>I guess so.</i>

592
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,120
<i>I enjoy reading poems</i>
<i>and some classic work.</i>

593
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
<i>I only enjoy pop style.</i>

594
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,080
<i>I have never read any classic work.</i>

595
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,640
<i>It might be a bit slow and laid-back,</i>

596
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,280
<i>but I like the way the words are used.</i>

597
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,800
<i>I see.</i>

598
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,920
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to read it out loud for you?</i>

599
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,160
THAME

600
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Thame.

601
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,960
PO

602
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,000
You got up already?

603
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,560
<i>You make the journey</i>

604
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,120
<i>Along the way more beautiful</i>

605
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,200
<i>I'm lucky to have you On this road with me</i>

606
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,360
<i>No matter how far I have to go</i>

607
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,440
<i>A hundred or thousand miles away</i>

608
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,320
<i>The horizon I aim for</i>
<i>Could be reached someday</i>

609
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,760
<i>Good time with you</i>

610
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,320
Or could it be a subtle hint

611
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,720
that he won't be returning
to the group's house?

612
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,960
I'm thinking

613
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
of shifting focus to something else.

614
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,400
Nano?

615
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
He's afraid of working as a group again?

616
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,120
<i>Thame is tearing the last page</i>

617
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,400
<i>and rewriting the whole thing with you.</i>
