1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,600
Because we must break up.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,080
<i>Today, everyone might still be hurt.</i>

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
<i>But just wait. In the days to come,</i>

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>what will come to them,</i>

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,040
<i>what will come to you,</i>

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,680
<i>will make them realize that's exactly</i>
<i>what they've been searching for.</i>

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
That's the choreography.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,920
Got it.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,120
My team and I will brainstorm
the MV concept for them.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Noted. Thank you so much.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,640
- Good luck, kiddos.
- Yes. Please take care of it for us.

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,600
Thank you.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Guys, let's continue practicing.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,760
Here you are.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,760
Thank you.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
By the way,

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,520
have you thought
of any ideas yet, Director?

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,560
Come on. I just saw the choreography.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,160
Do you expect me to come up
with an idea right away?

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,760
I'd be too smart if I could do that,
don't you think?

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Whoa.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,440
You're already smarter than Ming and me.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,040
I can never come up with anything.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
You're exaggerating.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,360
Treat me today?

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,080
You're not pulling all-nighters
with us anymore.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,240
Even with my promotion,
I still have debts to pay.

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Come on.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
But sure, I'll pay for you.

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
- Seriously?
- That's because I must leave

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,960
some work for you to do anyway.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,440
- Stop that.
- I'm sorry.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,680
We're sorry to keep you waiting.

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
What would you like?

36
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,960
I'll have this.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,440
Two Americanos, please.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,600
Two Americanos, right?

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
It's on me.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
1,000 BAHT

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,919
1,000 THB received.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
Earn?

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
Are you running an errand nearby?

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Uh-huh.

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,680
How have you been? Doing well?

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Well, I'm good.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,520
Eh? Just "good"?

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,640
The MV you directed was amazing.

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,080
That's why you got promoted
as the director at Oner.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,320
You've got a bright future ahead.

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,320
I wanted to come here
and congratulate you.

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
You said you were running
an errand, didn't you?

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,440
I had to… play it cool a bit, right?

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,320
I'm really here to see you.

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,080
I want to apologize
for how badly I treated you.

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm so sorry.

58
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,240
Actually,

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,280
I think I've started to understand you.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Back then,

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I somehow wondered why you were so mean.

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
But now,

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,240
I get it, really.

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Sometimes, people
just aren't meant to be together.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,760
You know what?

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,280
I once thought that if we ever met again,

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
I'd walk all over you.

68
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,640
But now that you're here,

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,600
I don't feel like that anymore.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,280
Why?

71
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,040
Is it because I'm as handsome as ever?

72
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,160
Nope.

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,800
I guess…

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
for many things that have come to my life,

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,400
I should thank you for leaving me.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come this far.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
Is that supposed to be my credit?

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,680
It doesn't sound very nice, though.

79
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,640
You weren't exactly nice to begin with.

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Well,

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,160
that's true.

82
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
We've grown up now.

83
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
Yep.

84
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,440
I have to go.

85
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
- I'm meeting Uncle Joei.
- Hey.

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,120
- I got something for you.
- Eh?

87
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120
What's this for?

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,600
You designed the logo, right?

89
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
I never gave these to you,

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,560
so here I am, giving them to you.

91
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,840
When people ask who made it,

92
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
you now have proof to show them.

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

94
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,960
This is good for both of us.

95
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,800
My company looks prestigious

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
with a logo designed by a famous director.

97
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,600
It's also good for your image

98
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,000
since you designed the work
for my company.

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I thought

100
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,240
you actually came to apologize.

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,120
Eh? I'm here to really say sorry,

102
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,400
but it can't be helped, you know.

103
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,600
Also, you designed it, really.

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
But I remember that

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
when you were giving out credits,

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
you never mentioned me even once.

107
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,800
Well…

108
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Keep this in mind.

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,600
I won't take things you never gave me.

110
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,120
And from now on,
you have no right to talk about me.

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,160
Hello, Uncle.

112
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,840
Eh? What happened today?

113
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
I met Earn.

114
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,240
Oh, it didn't take long for your ex
to come crawling back?

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Crawling back? No way.

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,880
He just wanted my name credited
on his app,

117
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,600
while before this, he never wanted it.

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,559
Nobody even knew who I was.

119
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,960
Whoa. That's hilarious.

120
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,799
And what did you say to him?

121
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,039
I told him he has no right
to talk about me anymore.

122
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,240
Why are you smiling?

123
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,720
Well,

124
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm happy for you.

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,360
You finally got to put him in his place.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
Are you still feeling satisfied

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,480
showing him how far you've come?

128
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,360
You even got to crush him underfoot.

129
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,920
It's not like that.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,440
Eh? I thought that

131
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,840
what you've been doing
all this time is for this thing.

132
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm surprised at myself too.

133
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,600
Even though I got the job I wanted

134
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,560
and can stand on my own,

135
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
don't even have to act awkward

136
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
about buying one or two sandwiches,

137
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,640
and received praise for overcoming it all,

138
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't feel like
I've won anything at all.

139
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,600
Have you ever sat quietly
and asked yourself why?

140
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Well,

141
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,120
I even sat and looked at you.

142
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,800
You looked at me?

143
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,800
Yes.

144
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,920
Sometimes, I envy you

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,800
because you've done your dream job

146
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,440
since you were young
until you're aging now.

147
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
You never get tired of it.

148
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,920
You can keep doing it

149
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,080
without caring about anything.

150
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
You don't get criticized by anyone,

151
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,120
no matter what kind of life you're living.

152
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
Let me tell you something, okay?

153
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes.

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,280
This is totally not my dream job,
just so you know.

155
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
Eh?

156
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,960
I did this because I had no idea
what else to do to earn a living.

157
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,360
Eh?

158
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
Then…

159
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,000
What's your dream job then?

160
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,600
I don't know.

161
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,120
I never had a dream.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,520
People always say that
we're supposed to have a dream.

163
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,440
I've been living for 60 years now,

164
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,000
and I've never had a dream,
and see? I'm still alive.

165
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,720
Hey? Here comes my customer.

166
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,520
Hello, Mr. Banjoed.

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,480
I already fixed it for you.

168
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,080
You can try it first.

169
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
If it doesn't fit properly,
I'll adjust it for you again.

170
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,880
I don't need to try it on, Uncle.

171
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,400
It's just a 5 cm stitch.

172
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,480
What a pity, tailor shops
like this are disappearing.

173
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,680
Off-the-rack suits
never really fit properly.

174
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,920
That's why tailor-made suits exist.

175
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Does it look okay?

176
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Yes.

177
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
STUCK IN YOUR HEART PROJECT

178
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,480
It's a bit cold tonight,

179
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,320
and I can't hug you.

180
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,040
If you want to hug me,

181
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,640
put your hands in your pockets, okay?

182
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,200
<i>Po.</i>

183
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>I have so much to tell you,</i>

184
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,040
<i>and I'm afraid that</i>

185
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,480
<i>if we talk in person,</i>
<i>I won't be able to get it all out.</i>

186
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,880
<i>So, I'm writing this for you.</i>

187
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,680
<i>While writing this,</i>

188
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,160
<i>we're waiting to check</i>
<i>the last music chart result.</i>

189
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,440
Welcome to Nano's kitchen.

190
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,040
I'm telling you,
the food we're cooking today is…

191
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,320
What are we going to cook?

192
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,120
<i>Pepper is trying not to be sad,</i>

193
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,960
<i>so he keeps himself busy all the time.</i>

194
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,400
<i>Nano and Jun have to accompany him always.</i>

195
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,800
<i>Dylan keeps to himself.</i>

196
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,280
<i>No matter how much we call him,</i>
<i>he pretends he doesn't hear it.</i>

197
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
<i>As for me, if I don't do something,</i>

198
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,840
<i>I'd probably lose it just like those four.</i>

199
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,040
<i>That's why I'm writing this for you.</i>

200
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,960
<i>You know what? If we can achieve this,</i>

201
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,800
<i>it will be the second all-kill in my life.</i>

202
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,440
<i>Honestly, I should be less excited</i>

203
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,640
<i>and keep myself together better,</i>

204
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,680
<i>but now, things have all turned</i>
<i>the opposite.</i>

205
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,880
<i>I asked myself why.</i>

206
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,319
<i>Is it because this all-kill carries</i>
<i>everyone's hopes and dreams?</i>

207
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,359
<i>Or is it because we get to be MARS again?</i>

208
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,319
<i>Or is it our first success as a group?</i>

209
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,440
Thame. Thame!

210
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,480
Yeah?

211
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,520
<i>But I think it's more than just that.</i>

212
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,920
<i>All this time, we've been striving</i>
<i>for the top</i>

213
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,800
<i>to prove to the world that we, too,</i>
<i>have value in it.</i>

214
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,080
<i>We all thought it was something</i>
<i>we had to do.</i>

215
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,760
<i>Every member,</i>

216
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
<i>myself,</i>

217
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
<i>and even you.</i>

218
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,480
<i>How would the world see our worth</i>
<i>if we weren't successful?</i>

219
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,320
<i>But in the end, is that really</i>
<i>the kind of world we live in?</i>

220
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,240
<i>One that measures our value by awards,</i>

221
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,720
<i>rankings, and numbers?</i>

222
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
<i>What kind of people do we have to become</i>

223
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
<i>to keep pleasing those cruel people?</i>

224
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,560
<i>When, in reality, if we had nothing</i>

225
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,400
<i>and were just trainees,</i>

226
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
<i>does that mean</i>
<i>we wouldn't have any worth at all?</i>

227
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,920
<i>I asked myself that,</i>
<i>but I never got an answer</i>

228
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,400
<i>until…</i>

229
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,520
<i>I met you,</i>

230
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,520
<i>the one who makes time slow down,</i>

231
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,600
<i>allows me to learn that</i>
<i>even if we really have nothing,</i>

232
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,240
<i>even if we don't get any praise</i>
<i>from anywhere,</i>

233
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,040
<i>the value of our work is often</i>
<i>the smallest thing that people overlook,</i>

234
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,240
<i>the truth is, we all have worth somewhere,</i>

235
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,280
<i>with someone.</i>

236
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,600
<i>And it's because of you that I realized</i>

237
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,560
<i>this all-kill means more</i>
<i>than just keeping MARS alive.</i>

238
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,000
<i>It's about saving ourselves</i>
<i>from this world.</i>

239
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,560
<i>MARS will conquer the world</i>
<i>that tells us to rush,</i>

240
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,480
<i>that tells us to abandon</i>
<i>each other to be number one.</i>

241
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,280
<i>But we will prove that we are the group</i>
<i>that will walk together,</i>

242
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
<i>supporting each other from behind,</i>

243
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,840
<i>being a safe zone when we need comfort,</i>

244
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,440
<i>a cushion to support us</i>

245
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,840
<i>when we fail and rise again,</i>

246
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
<i>just like what you've done for me.</i>

247
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,480
<i>And because of you,</i>

248
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,040
<i>MARS is rebuilt with that meaning.</i>

249
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,080
<i>Because of you,</i>

250
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,680
<i>I believe that after this all-kill,</i>

251
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,080
<i>our group will last a long time,</i>

252
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,280
<i>and no one will have to be stuck</i>
<i>in loneliness again.</i>

253
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,080
<i>Po, I've written all of this</i>

254
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,360
<i>to thank you and to beg you.</i>

255
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,040
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

256
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
<i>no matter what I have to go through,</i>

257
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,120
<i>and how serious it is,</i>

258
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
<i>can you not let go of my hand?</i>

259
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,760
<i>Even if the world doesn't welcome us</i>

260
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>or is falling apart right in front of us,</i>

261
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,720
<i>I still want to stand with everyone</i>
<i>and with you.</i>

262
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,280
<i>Please stay and support me as I am.</i>

263
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
<i>Stand by my side</i>
<i>and fight together against the world</i>

264
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,920
<i>that keeps placing expectations on us.</i>

265
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,080
<i>What's up?</i>

266
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,040
Where are you?

267
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,840
I need your help.

268
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
You haven't found him?

269
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,920
Well, I picked up your call
when we were about to head home.

270
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,160
Eh? You want me
to find Thame's new number?

271
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,920
How would I have that? I'm not Mick.

272
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,960
<i>Why don't you call Mick?</i>

273
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,840
Do this, then.

274
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,040
Go to the rooftop

275
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,520
and check if Thame's there.

276
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,040
Talk to you later.

277
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,120
Let's go to the rooftop.

278
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,680
Go! Run!

279
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,480
But when we got there, he wasn't there.

280
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,320
By the way,
why are you trying to find Thame?

281
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
I need to talk to him
about something important.

282
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,760
Well,

283
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,000
Thame's situation now is a real mystery.

284
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
We don't even know
where the company's keeping him.

285
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,480
They have everyone practicing separately,

286
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,280
and I don't even know where he's staying.

287
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,680
Working like this is a mess for us.

288
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,280
I'm telling you,

289
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
Ming might not be able to help you,

290
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,720
but I can.

291
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
- Really?
- Of course.

292
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,920
Don't you see how smart I am?

293
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,280
I asked for Thame's new phone number.

294
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,920
Hold on. Who did you get it from?

295
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Eh?

296
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,040
Here we go.
He's here to give it to you in person.

297
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
Why do you need Thame's phone number?

298
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
I need to talk to him.

299
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,760
About what?

300
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,800
I have to apologize to him
about something.

301
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,840
Oh.

302
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,360
If it's something small like that,
leave it to me.

303
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,280
I'll tell him.

304
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,320
Mick.

305
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,400
What?

306
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,960
MARS really wants to stay together.

307
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,960
Come on, Po.

308
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,960
That's all in the past.

309
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Miss Pemika has already given them
the best things they need.

310
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,240
No,

311
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,640
that's not what they want at all.

312
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,880
It's true that we used to think
climbing higher

313
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,520
was happiness,

314
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,680
but if we realize along the way
that it's not,

315
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
don't we have the right to change things?

316
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,800
You've been with them longer than I have.

317
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,000
You should know better than me
what they truly want.

318
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,520
But this is the best
the company can offer.

319
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,320
Are you saying that
when the company made you a director,

320
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
it wasn't what you wanted?

321
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,960
You're right.

322
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
It might have been what I wanted before,

323
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,040
but not anymore for now.

324
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,680
Right now, all I want is his number

325
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,720
and a chance to meet him.

326
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,040
Mick,

327
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,320
I want him to be happy, really.

328
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
Help him, okay?

329
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,760
Well, then,

330
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,400
come to the company tomorrow.

331
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,600
Meet Thame where you two always used to.

332
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,560
Is this where you two usually meet?

333
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,760
I never knew it was this peaceful.

334
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,480
Mick told me you're not happy
with the company's decisions.

335
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,520
I just want him to get
what he truly wants.

336
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,480
Same here.

337
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,320
But MARS isn't the same anymore.

338
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,640
They're not the ones
who want what you told us.

339
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,680
But I think we're seeing this differently.

340
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,120
So,

341
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,640
I guess you're seeing things
differently from MARS now too.

342
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,840
No matter what, MARS is Oner's asset.

343
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,080
It's a team that has to follow
company policies,

344
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,360
and every member
should know what those are.

345
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,120
If they don't,
they should train elsewhere, not here.

346
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,200
But maybe you joined by accident.

347
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,360
Maybe our visions just don't align.

348
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,880
You don't want to be a director anymore,

349
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,040
so it's better for us to part ways.

350
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,240
We can't keep someone
who harms MARS and Thame.

351
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,720
From today onward,

352
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,440
you're no longer an Oner employee.

353
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,800
I'll be taking back everything
that belongs to the company,

354
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,960
including the contacts
between you and our artists.

355
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,000
Hey. Hello.

356
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,440
I'll have my usual. Just one, please.

357
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,480
Sure.

358
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,880
NO SEARCH RESULTS FOR MARS

359
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,320
Are you worried about something?

360
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,840
Your work?

361
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,080
It's not that much about work.

362
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,680
I just feel guilty.

363
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,320
I feel I should have done something more,

364
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
but I just can't figure out what to do.

365
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,760
Have you asked your friends
for any advice?

366
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,880
Who would I even ask?

367
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,840
I can't talk to anyone now.

368
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,880
Here you are. The rest are on the house.

369
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Whoa.

370
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,880
Isn't this too much? I can't eat all this.

371
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,480
I think it's enough for everyone.

372
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,040
Look at you.

373
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,640
You want to reunite the group
but only went to see Thame?

374
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,840
I feel left out.

375
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,520
Why are you all here?

376
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,240
If I tell you,

377
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,600
you'll probably think it's cheesy.

378
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,600
Gags.

379
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
Per, explain.

380
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,080
Where do I even start?

381
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,360
Should I begin with how we found out
we should come here,

382
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,520
or why we knew about the whole thing?

383
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,360
Fine. I'll say it.

384
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,240
Hey, if you don't want to talk,
I can do it for you.

385
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,080
But I might throw in a little extra
for flavor,

386
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,640
just to make it more interesting.

387
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
Don't. Leave it to me.

388
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,960
There was a time
I scolded Thame about you,

389
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,719
<i>and he brought up the sandwich.</i>

390
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,199
His favorite sandwich
isn't from this store.

391
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,920
<i>After that,</i>

392
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,120
I saved a screenshot
of this sandwich shop.

393
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,440
Then, when I found out about
you bringing the group together,

394
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,880
<i>I looked up this location.</i>

395
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,679
That's how we figured out
that if we wanted to find you,

396
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,400
we'd have to wait here.

397
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
By the way,

398
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,720
how did you even know

399
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,320
I'm trying to reunite MARS?

400
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Well, you told someone,
and they ended up telling us.

401
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,120
Are you talking about Ming and Tae?

402
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,400
So…

403
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,160
How will you bring MARS back?

404
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,600
What's your plan?

405
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,960
Before this, I received Thame's schedule.

406
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,920
WORK SCHEDULE

407
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,640
I'm planning to talk to Thame

408
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,600
on the day he's meeting
with the Korean team.

409
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,080
I'm going to ask Thame
to request their contract

410
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,720
for another review to see
what terms are included

411
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,480
and if there are any loopholes

412
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,680
that would allow us to make changes.

413
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,320
But by the time we fully understand
the terms

414
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,960
and figure out a solution,

415
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,000
it'll probably be too late.

416
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,160
Then, what if we find an event
before the concert

417
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,560
where you guys can meet and talk?

418
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,160
No way.

419
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
The company won't let us
see Thame before the concert.

420
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,760
Even now, all his contacts
are being erased.

421
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,720
I think if we're doing something,
we can't let her find out.

422
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,680
We'll handle everything at the concert.

423
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,520
But…

424
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,040
If you do it at the concert,

425
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,720
it will cause Oner damage,

426
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,760
and you guys will end up in trouble.

427
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,040
You might get sued and so on.

428
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,480
Bring it on. Just sue us.

429
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,240
At least we'll get to pay off
the debt for Thame,

430
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,240
and we'll be even.

431
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,120
What are you even saying?

432
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,000
He's just talking nonsense, bro.

433
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,240
How could we even find the money to pay?

434
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,200
So, if we're going to take action,

435
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,560
we have to be really sure
that this time, it has to succeed.

436
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Besides,

437
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,120
I don't think anything
could get worse than it is right now.

438
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,600
By the way,

439
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
don't you have any other idea, Director?

440
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,400
Actually, I do.

441
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,160
But we'll need help
from someone backstage.

442
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,160
Since I'm no longer an Oner employee,

443
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,200
it's hard to pull strings back there.

444
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,680
Hard? I don't think so.

445
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,920
I think it's way easier for you this way.

446
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,400
Since you're not working for Oner anymore,

447
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,720
if you make little mistakes,

448
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,280
no one's going to call you out on it.

449
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,040
Mick had Miss Pemika fire you

450
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,920
so you could work on this more freely.

451
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,920
Huh?

452
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,040
Mick might seem like
he's sucking up to Pemika

453
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,880
and ignoring us,

454
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
but deep down, he's always had our backs.

455
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,640
He probably knew everything
from the moment I called him

456
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,040
and told him you were the traitor.

457
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,280
So, it's Po, right?

458
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,040
No. It's not him.

459
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,040
<i>But he let you keep going,</i>

460
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,440
<i>as long as it didn't affect him.</i>

461
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,840
Everyone, stop.

462
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,800
Go look for Thame now. That way.

463
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,000
Go now. Hurry up.

464
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Hey. Hey, stop.

465
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,440
It's not this way. Head there.

466
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,280
That's right. Go.

467
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,240
<i>Actually, I guess he</i>
<i>wanted to help us all this time,</i>

468
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
<i>but he didn't dare to do anything.</i>

469
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Does that mean the group
will debut in Korea?

470
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
No, not the whole group, just one person.

471
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,920
<i>Until he found out that</i>
<i>you're planning to help Thame again.</i>

472
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,680
I want him to be happy, really.

473
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
Help him, okay?

474
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,440
Hey, Jun.

475
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,880
Mick and I discussed it and agreed that

476
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
firing you would make things easier.

477
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,520
I see.

478
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,960
So, you'll go up for this concert,

479
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,880
and the plan is being coordinated by Mick,

480
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,880
and I'm "free" to do whatever I want?

481
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,480
Yes. That's right.

482
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,160
But the real problem is
we can't talk to Thame

483
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,080
because he has to practice
separately from us.

484
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,680
<i>He also has to work separately from us.</i>

485
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,280
<i>And Pemika is monitoring this whole thing.</i>

486
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,720
Being close to the boss
makes this a bit difficult.

487
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,920
Or should we come up with a plan for Mick

488
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,960
to help him separate Thame
so he can come to us?

489
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,160
What kind of plan are you thinking about?

490
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,160
Like,

491
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,160
it's okay if Thame doesn't know about it?

492
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
How could that be okay?

493
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,440
- If he's clueless, it's even harder.
- Yeah.

494
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,280
The chance of success drops too.

495
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,200
All this time,

496
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,640
Thame has already managed
to do difficult things,

497
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,120
like bringing the four of us together.

498
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
<i>So, can't we really help him come back?</i>

499
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,760
The four of us can't be weaker
than Thame alone, right?

500
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,960
<i>Are you doing all right?</i>

501
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,720
<i>That question keeps repeating in my mind</i>

502
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,920
Hold on, Thame.

503
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,080
You don't sound like you feel this verse.

504
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,800
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

505
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
Try again, okay?

506
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,080
I need you to really feel it,

507
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,280
or think of anyone who brings
that feeling to you.

508
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,480
- Let's start, okay?
- Yes.

509
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,640
<i>Are you doing all right?</i>

510
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,720
<i>That question keeps repeating in my mind</i>

511
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,840
<i>Just wanna know when you're there</i>
<i>Without me</i>

512
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,280
<i>How have you been?</i>

513
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,720
<i>Have you missed me?</i>

514
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,800
<i>Cuz I keep on missing you in my mind</i>

515
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,040
<i>I can only hope that when you're there</i>
<i>You're happier</i>

516
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,360
<i>Wanna see that smile on your face</i>

517
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,240
<i>Like when</i>

518
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,000
<i>We're in love again</i>

519
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,200
<i>We must control the stage</i>
<i>and make it ours.</i>

520
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,760
We need someone to set up the wires

521
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,600
and someone to cut the signal
from the original control.

522
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,280
I'm all set here.

523
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,960
Then it's all on you now,

524
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,880
whether you can do it or not, Po.

525
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,440
Of course, I can.

526
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,000
<i>No matter what,</i>
<i>I'll bring Thame back to you all.</i>
