1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,880
I’m now in charge of the MV thing.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,480
Do you want to help me,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,000
so you’ll be hanging around that area?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>You're such a liar!</i>

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,520
You said you’d have me do the work
so I could stay with Thame.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,360
<i>Bringing up the MV</i>
<i>and pressuring you like this</i>

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,040
isn't to get you to meet Thame.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,120
<i>It's all for your own benefit.</i>

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,240
Guys,

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,080
here comes a big problem.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,400
<i>Would you mind</i>

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,800
<i>If I fell for you?</i>

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,600
<i>Don’t tell me you all teamed up</i>

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,200
just to revive that song
and use it to negotiate with me.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,960
I'll create a new song under MARS.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,120
<i>If my song beats Ice's song,</i>

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,760
we'll all get to go there.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,080
I’m sorry.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,720
I rushed there, but still
couldn’t make it to the movie in time.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,080
I told you already
I didn’t want to break our promise,

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,960
but here I am, breaking it again.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,280
It’s fine.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,320
I’m actually more surprised that you came,

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,600
while such a serious problem
just happened.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,000
How could I forget?

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,040
Well…

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,280
By the way,

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,000
what about the song that got stolen?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
I talked to the company already.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,480
We have to make a new song.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,440
What a shame.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,240
All that was left was releasing the MV.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,880
I feel even worse for you.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
You worked so hard on the MV.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Hey.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,640
Why are you worrying about me?

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
You should be worrying about MARS.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,680
Aren’t you already
worrying about that for me?

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
Hold on.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,160
Where is the storyboard?

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
I think I left it in front of the cinema.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,560
Oh, where you were sitting, right?

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,280
- I’ll go get it for you.
- Hey, don’t.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
It’s fine.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
How come?

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,640
It’s full of great ideas.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
I’ll go get it for you.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,640
It’s fine, Thame.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,080
You should head back
and talk to your members.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
Just drop me off here.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,240
I don’t want to take up
too much of your time.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
You're not taking up my time at all.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Go back, okay?

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,280
All right.

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,560
But…

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,960
let me know when you get home.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,480
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
I should be asking
why you’re here at this hour.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,680
LOVE YOU TO DEBT

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
<i>Would you mind if I fell for you?</i>

62
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,320
<i>There’s no one next to you?</i>

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
<i>You’re making me breathless, baby</i>

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm so damn pissed off.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,320
I went as far as selling my soul
to make this song.

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,440
Look at the choreography.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
It doesn’t look right at all.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Ours is even better.

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
Turn it off already,

70
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,680
or it'll get stuck in everyone's head.

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,360
We need to clear our minds
and refocus here.

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
PRODUCE A SONG

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Back to square one.

74
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,680
What do we have to even compete with him?

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,560
That song is about to top
almost every chart.

76
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,120
I bet it'll hit a perfect all-kill
in no more than a week.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,760
Based on our timeline,
how many days do we have left?

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,040
We only have one week left.
Wow. How impressive.

79
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
So, does anyone have any ideas?

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you doing here?

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,720
I should be asking
why you’re here at this hour.

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,920
Where is Po?

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,240
He went back already.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,240
If you have to write a movie review,

85
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,360
then head inside and watch it.

86
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,960
Forget about that for now.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
We need to talk.

88
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,240
I’m not available.

89
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
I do.

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
I want to make a love song.

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,680
But Ice just made one.

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,680
Won't it be too similar?

93
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Let’s just make it different.

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,240
- You’re getting on our nerves.
- I’m not.

95
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,160
To play safe, a love song
is the best choice, isn't it?

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,440
This style of song is easy to mainstream,
catchy, and people get into it.

97
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,880
Plus, love can take many forms.

98
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
We can just make it different.

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,600
What kind of love song
do you want to make?

100
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,400
Is it like, "You stepped in
and changed my life?"

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
Something like that?

102
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,960
That sounds like a good idea.

103
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
"Become a better person for you,

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,560
instead of that previous guy,
who was good for nothing."

105
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,040
So, you two are still
talking about the song, right?

106
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
- Yes.
- No.

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
I’m not bringing personal stuff into work.

108
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,760
But the idea you just proposed

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,320
is your personal matter, isn’t it?

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
Are you trying to find an idea
for the song,

111
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,960
or start a fight with me?

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,920
I’m not trying to start a fight with you.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,760
But I just want to clear things up
with you about…

114
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
Who’s here?

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,600
I’m enjoying their conversation, you know.

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Oh. I guess it’s Po.

117
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,840
- I’ll…
- I’ll go.

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Hey, come. Let me help.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,200
Hey, let me carry some myself.

120
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,000
Why are you here?

121
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,160
Do you want me to help
with your full-time job again?

122
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,840
I do.

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Well,

124
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Mick assigned me to film
the footage of you all

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
praising Ice’s song.

126
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,360
Damn. That's such a black comedy.

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,520
Turn on the camera now.

128
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,360
I’ll do a diss rap to get him embarrassed.

129
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,520
Calm down, Dylan.

130
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Sit down.

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Don’t hurt him.

132
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,880
I bet someone like him
was clueless about the whole thing.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,960
Perhaps the situation was like…

134
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,840
WOULD YOU MIND?

135
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
This is such a great song.

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,560
It feels like it was written
for my comeback.

137
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,960
Yeah.

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,760
We composed it especially for you, Ice.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,159
He’s just a clueless bystander, you know.

140
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,919
We can record it now.

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,559
Do you have scripts for us?

142
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
Yes.

143
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
But we don’t have to rush.

144
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
Let’s eat first. I bought a lot of food.

145
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,880
- I’ll help you then.
- I’m good, Thame.

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
Just continue what you’re working on.

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,000
I’ll let Jun help.

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
He’s free.

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,720
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

150
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,760
Let’s go.

151
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,480
I’m free now. I want to help.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
All right.

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,960
You’re free?

154
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
You have to produce a new song

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,240
and also a bunch of new stuff.

156
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,120
How could you say you’re free?

157
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
Why don’t you work on the MV then?

158
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
It’s your job, isn’t it?

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,440
I have to wait for the song
to be finished first, don’t I?

160
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Also,

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,240
I’m in charge of the welfare service,
you know.

162
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,720
That’s such an intense atmosphere.

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
When are they going to punch each other?

164
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,280
Dylan!

165
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,440
What?

166
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,360
Jun, go arrange the table.

167
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Thame and I will take care of it here.

168
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,720
Eh?

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,880
You asked me to help you, didn’t you?

170
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
Come on.

171
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,560
What did you argue with Jun about?

172
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,640
It isn’t a big deal, is it?

173
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,680
It’s a big deal.

174
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,040
Eh?

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,800
Do you want me to help clear things up?

176
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
It’s all right.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,120
If you get involved,

178
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,240
it’ll get even more serious.

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,360
Yeah?

180
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,080
It’s all right. Don’t worry.

181
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
- And…
- I’m done arranging the table.

182
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Bring me more plates.

183
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
Ask Thame to do it.

184
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,280
He’s standing close to that.

185
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,400
Thanks.

186
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
- Who said you can eat first?
- Come on.

187
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,960
It looks yummy.

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,960
I’ll take this one.

189
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
- I’m hungry already.
- It’s not yours.

190
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,040
Who is this for?

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,160
Give it to me.

192
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,280
Hey, give it back to me.

193
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,960
I can’t choose which side to take.

194
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,320
That guy is my friend,
and so is the other.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
- True.
- I’m rooting for Thame for sure.

196
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
Someone like me
will never take sides with Jun.

197
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
No way.

198
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,560
No.

199
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you saying this

200
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,160
because you don’t want Jun to date Po?

201
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,880
Eh? Of course.

202
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,120
Someone like Jun
isn’t supposed to date anyone.

203
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
Well, then, I’m going to root for Jun.

204
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,240
My sense says there’s chemistry
between them.

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
Can I take that one?

206
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
Give me, okay?

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
Are you sure there's chemistry?

208
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Uh-huh.

209
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
I’m trying to look for it.

210
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Where are you going after this?

211
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,840
- I’m heading home.
- Already?

212
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,400
Do you seriously have no ideas at all?

213
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,680
I don’t have any.

214
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
His life is so chaotic.

215
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
How could he come up with anything?

216
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
Eh? Why?

217
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
I’m just reading the atmosphere, you know.

218
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,680
But it’s true, Thame.

219
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,800
If you let it go on like this,
won't it just get worse?

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,160
Be careful, or you might end up
losing both your friend and your job.

221
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
- And you’ll probably…
- You’ll probably lose Po, too.

222
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Hey?

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,520
I didn’t tell these two anything.

224
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,200
But Jun and you are obviously overacting.

225
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,560
I didn’t mean to keep it a secret,

226
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,720
but it’s Jun
who didn’t agree to talk it out.

227
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,920
So, the problem is Jun again, right?

228
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
Jun always avoids problems.

229
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,360
Don’t you know that?

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Think about it.

231
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,920
When he wanted you to go to Korea,

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
he didn’t tell you directly,

233
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,280
but ended up causing so much chaos

234
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,920
that everyone turned their back on you.

235
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
Are you still going to keep
someone like this as your friend?

236
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,640
So, are you trying to stir things up,

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
or are you just showing off
that you know Jun best?

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,480
I’m stirring things up!

239
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
Thame.

240
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
What do you think the reason is
that he won't talk to you?

241
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,600
Po.

242
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,760
Oh, I’m done filming
all the footage of MARS.

243
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,120
I’m working on the storyboard now.

244
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,600
I wasn’t going to ask you about that.

245
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,480
I was going to ask
who gave you those snacks.

246
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Yeah?

247
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Those.

248
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,640
Here you are.

249
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,680
Eh?

250
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,840
How could you know it’s my favorite?

251
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
I’m someone who cares.

252
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
I stalked your IG stories.

253
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,720
I don’t do things half-heartedly, okay?

254
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,440
How annoying.

255
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,160
You’ve just started working here
and already become so popular,

256
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,160
unlike someone here,

257
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
who’s been here forever
and still not hot at all.

258
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,680
- Why are you insulting yourself?
- I’m insulting you.

259
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,080
Stop it.

260
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,600
You know what? I'm hot too.

261
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,320
I’ve got some hitting on me,

262
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
even if the one doing it sucks a bit.

263
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,160
Ugh.

264
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,120
I’m also curious about
how good-looking that person is.

265
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,480
He’s more good-looking than you,
obviously.

266
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,040
Eat that!

267
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,840
By the way, can you tell us who?

268
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,520
It’s nothing. It’s just…

269
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>What do you want to eat?</i>

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
<i>I’ll buy some for you.</i>

271
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
<i>If you don’t reply,</i>
<i>I’ll let you eat trash.</i>

272
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,920
It’s just someone who wants to tease me.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,080
I see.

274
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,280
<i>Are you being arrogant?</i>

275
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,240
<i>You’ll get to eat trash for sure.</i>

276
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
<i>Eh? You like sandwiches, don’t you?</i>

277
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,040
<i>I’ll grab some for you.</i>

278
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,240
His favorite sandwich
isn’t from this store.

279
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,960
Why are you avoiding me?

280
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,600
Why don’t we just talk properly?

281
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,200
- We have nothing to talk about.
- We do.

282
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,320
About what? You’ve finished
working on the song, huh?

283
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,040
Not yet.

284
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,280
But I’ve already got an idea.

285
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
Why? What’s not good about my idea?

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,360
I just want to present
my idea to you first.

287
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,320
Go ahead.

288
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,320
Can we talk somewhere else?

289
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,000
Why do I have to play
this stupid game with you?

290
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,520
It’s because this is going
to be a long conversation,

291
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
both about the song

292
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
and Po.

293
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,720
Why did you avoid me?

294
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,280
Me?

295
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,680
- I didn’t.
- Really?

296
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,240
Say whatever you want.

297
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,880
Stop pressuring me already.
If you want to say something, just say it.

298
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,040
See? I’m not avoiding you anymore.

299
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,640
If I did, I wouldn’t be standing here.

300
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,200
- Why did you go to see him at the cinema?
- Because I thought you wouldn’t go.

301
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,160
But I did!

302
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,319
- I saw that.
- This is what you want, huh?

303
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,720
Don’t act like you know me well.

304
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
But I do know.

305
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,280
Someone like you

306
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,560
has never done this much
for someone else before.

307
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
You helped him with the subtitles

308
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
and the idea for our MV concept.

309
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
You like him, right?

310
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,480
It doesn’t matter how I feel.

311
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
It’s you I should be asking.
What do you even see him as?

312
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,080
You use him without even knowing
what he’s skilled at.

313
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,080
Have you ever even noticed his potential?

314
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,920
You kept asking him to do nonsense stuff.

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
You wanted to thank him
by just giving a free movie ticket,

316
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,720
and on top of that, you tried to use him
to write a movie review for you.

317
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,480
Stop nitpicking me already.

318
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,240
Someone like you should back off
and stay in your place.

319
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,120
If you can’t take care of him well,
then just don’t do it.

320
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,760
Otherwise, he’ll end up
facing the same thing as before.

321
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,960
You don’t even have feelings for him.

322
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
What if I do?

323
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,600
OPPOSITE MAKRO SATHON

324
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,920
I think you’ve already realized that

325
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,280
since you saw me at the cinema.

326
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,320
That’s why you’re acting
this way towards me.

327
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,680
I don’t know what’s more annoying for you.

328
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,440
Me not being the kind of person
you thought I was

329
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,400
or the fact that we both
like the same person.

330
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,840
So, you want to be
this straightforward, right?

331
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,680
Yeah.

332
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,920
Fine.

333
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,200
Come up with some excuses now.

334
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,960
You like him,
but why did you treat him like that?

335
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,840
Why does he have to revolve around you,

336
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,960
your life, and your work

337
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
without even caring about what he wants?

338
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
I’ve been trying.

339
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
You must try harder.

340
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,000
At least you should know what he likes
and what he can do.

341
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
You must be able to support him.

342
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,400
Look at you also.

343
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,040
If you like him, stop avoiding me already.

344
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,280
Others are already worried
that we’re having conflict.

345
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,560
But I think I know
you’re not that type of person.

346
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
Really?

347
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I think you know that

348
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,640
this isn’t about losing
or winning,

349
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
but this is what
makes us realize

350
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
whether we’re true friends.

351
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
And are we?

352
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,320
What do you think?

353
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
We’re standing here,
scolding each other like this.

354
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,880
And what about that song idea
you mentioned?

355
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,000
I just told you, it’s the song.

356
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,560
Huh?

357
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,160
I think it’s a perfect fit for you,
me, and MARS.

358
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,160
How?

359
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,640
Here you are.

360
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,400
<i>Why have you been so quiet this week?</i>

361
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,720
<i>Don’t tell me Mr. A and Mr. B are secretly</i>
<i>dating without letting me know.</i>

362
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,440
<i>Date? Nonsense.</i>

363
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,240
<i>I’ve got so much extra work recently.</i>

364
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,840
<i>Do you want to come and see where I’m now?</i>

365
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,280
<i>Don’t challenge me, okay?</i>
<i>You know I can really go.</i>

366
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,320
<i>By the way, you mentioned before</i>

367
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
<i>that you wanted me to help MARS.</i>
<i>So, what is it about?</i>

368
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
<i>I’ll send you the brief</i>

369
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,720
<i>but I’m not sure when,</i>

370
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,760
<i>and I’m also not sure</i>
<i>if we’ll still get to do it.</i>

371
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,200
<i>Fine. Just let me know.</i>

372
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,440
<i>I’ll be on standby.</i>

373
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,520
LET'S GO

374
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,040
Po.

375
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,800
Just a few days and MARS managed
to get this much done?

376
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,240
What do you think?

377
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,120
It’s incredible.

378
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
It perfectly fits your group.

379
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,440
But…

380
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,880
is this really Thame’s idea?

381
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
It’s this great,

382
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,200
but you still don’t believe it’s his idea?

383
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,480
I’m not saying I don’t believe it’s his,

384
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,880
but I’m just surprised.

385
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,760
When it comes to Thame,

386
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,520
I thought he would come up
with a song about friendships,

387
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
giving off a heartwarming vibe.

388
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,320
I didn’t expect this style from him.

389
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,720
I want our song to deliver these messages,

390
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,080
"Just do whatever you want to do."

391
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,600
"Be persistent in chasing
what you desire."

392
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,640
"Feel what you truly want to feel."

393
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,880
"Go after what you want…

394
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,520
without worrying about anything else."

395
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
If you also have feelings for him,

396
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,040
I think we both stand an equal chance.

397
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,720
Even though we have been friends
for so long,

398
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,160
neither of us has to back down, right?

399
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,840
By the way,

400
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,400
do you think the footage of us

401
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,520
can be used in this song somehow?

402
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,440
Let me see.

403
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,800
Whether he chooses him or me,

404
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
it’s not anyone’s fault, is it?

405
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,720
We still remain friends anyway.

406
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,480
So, this is the fairest way
for the whole thing.

407
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,320
You really like him, don’t you?

408
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,360
I know I’m not doing well enough,

409
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
but I’ve been trying.

410
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,960
For everything I just scolded you, right?

411
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,520
Yeah.

412
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,040
Otherwise, he’ll choose you.

413
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,760
If you can promise me that,

414
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,560
let me tell you something.

415
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,120
If we film the new line sync,
I think it will work.

416
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,480
But I want to show this to Thame first.

417
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,040
Eh?

418
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,760
I thought you were going to accuse me of
jumping to conclusions about Thame again.

419
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,240
I won’t scold you anymore.

420
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,760
Why?

421
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,920
It’s because I’ve realized

422
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,520
you’re not just imagining it on your own.

423
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,040
What do you mean?

424
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,320
I just talked to him,

425
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
so I realized

426
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,480
he does have feelings for you.

427
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,600
I don’t have feelings for him.

428
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,440
All I did is just to let you know that

429
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,440
when you like someone,

430
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,280
don’t be a loser.

431
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,000
It’s nothing much,

432
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,600
but I just don’t want to see you
being a lousy partner.

433
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,200
Honestly,

434
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,720
from spending time with him,

435
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,080
I’ve realized he also likes you.

436
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
Congratulations.

437
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,520
You’ve won this game,

438
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,520
even from the start already.

439
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,920
You silly.

440
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,440
Who told you to confess love
on someone else’s behalf?

441
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,920
Eh?

442
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,160
Then why did you both
tell me about it, huh?

443
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,040
Ugh, you’re just…

444
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,400
Tell me where Thame is.

445
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,040
Whoa. Do you have to be
in a rush to see him?

446
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,840
I’ll show him the MV.

447
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,640
Why should you be in a rush?

448
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,560
Seeing him today,

449
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
I guess, at most, you’ll just end up
staring at each other.

450
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,960
I’m telling you,
during the first six months of dating him,

451
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,760
even holding hands is an achievement.

452
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
And it will take two whole years

453
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
before you two get to kiss.

454
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,280
As for going to his room,

455
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,200
I’d say it will definitely
take up to five years.

456
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,000
I told you I’m going to show him the MV.

457
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,960
Tell me where Thame is now.

458
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,600
You’re here?

459
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,120
Yeah.

460
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,880
Well,

461
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,800
I…

462
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,000
I…

463
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I’ve finished… the MV draft.

464
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,880
Do you want to take a look?

465
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,720
Are you sure this is the first thing
you want to talk about?

466
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,600
Well, yeah.

467
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,080
I think if we add a line sync,
it will work just fine.

468
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
What do you think?

469
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,120
I really like it.

470
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,320
You’re not just saying that
to please me, right?

471
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,840
I mean it.

472
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
It’s amazing.

473
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,200
I can’t believe that
with our limited amount of footage,

474
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,080
it can turn out this well.

475
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
You’re talented.

476
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,280
You are.

477
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,000
Your song is good.

478
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,440
That’s why I could edit the MV well.

479
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,200
It’s like you planned ahead

480
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,800
that this song
would fit the footage we have.

481
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,000
Am I right?

482
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, let me forward it to my members,

483
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,040
so they will know what to work on next.

484
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,200
Yeah. Go ahead.

485
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,360
I’m going to grab my stuff.

486
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I already talked to Jun.

487
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,640
Well,

488
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,400
I met him already.

489
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,360
You did?

490
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,680
What did he say to you?

491
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,800
So… what did he tell you?

492
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,880
He said

493
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,720
you like…

494
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
our new song a lot.

495
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,080
Exactly. I really like it.

496
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,360
I enjoyed it so much when editing it.

497
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,920
So…

498
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,360
What did he tell you?

499
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,640
He said

500
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,280
you like…

501
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,480
our MV a lot.

502
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,920
Yes. I really do.

503
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,480
But…

504
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,840
we watched it together just now,
haven’t we?

505
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,800
That’s right. You just watched it.

506
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,400
So…

507
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,160
What did Jun tell you?

508
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,480
He said…

509
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,400
you might be waiting for me here.

510
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,240
Why here?

511
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,040
I remember that every Monday and Tuesday,

512
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480
you have to come and help Uncle Joei here.

513
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,160
I also remember our movie date promise.

514
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,600
Here.

515
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,120
I always have them with me.

516
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,639
I’m sorry I’ve been busy recently.

517
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,719
It’s all right.

518
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,600
You don’t have to say sorry.

519
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,840
You already said sorry for this.

520
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,560
But…

521
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,000
I haven’t made it up to you.

522
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
It’s totally all right.

523
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,480
Po,

524
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,440
can you not say, "It’s all right"?

525
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,159
From now on,

526
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,000
just make a request.

527
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,320
Tell me what you want

528
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,600
or what you want to do.

529
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,679
I’ll try to make it happen.

530
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,600
If you're angry,

531
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,560
just tell me straight up.

532
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,760
I'll make you stop being mad.

533
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,240
Let’s begin it this way.

534
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Begin what?

535
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,840
What do you want to begin?

536
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,320
Begin…

537
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,120
Let’s begin by watching this movie.

538
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,480
I want to watch the movie today.

539
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,320
Okay.

540
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,080
Let’s go.

541
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,640
Today is the 3rd.

542
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,640
Eh?

543
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,080
I’ll book the tickets then.

544
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,720
It’s all right.

545
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,800
I think it's already out by now.

546
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,600
That's how a special screening works.

547
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,880
Po, I’m sorry.

548
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,640
It’s all right.

549
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
I know you’ve been busy.

550
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,520
Po.

551
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,840
I told you to stop saying,
"It’s all right".

552
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
I also said

553
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,560
I want us to have a good start.

554
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,240
Hey,

555
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,880
I’m not that serious about it.

556
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,520
Actually,

557
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,800
this movie was shown in a special theater,

558
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,400
but it's also available on streaming.

559
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,520
We can watch it anytime.

560
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,640
But…

561
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,080
I don’t want our beginning
to be these expired movie tickets

562
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,600
or something that disappoints you.

563
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,160
Well,

564
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,120
let’s watch another movie.

565
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,040
No.

566
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,080
I want to watch this movie with you.

567
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,920
You said it’s
on the streaming platform, right?

568
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,800
Yeah.

569
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,640
So…

570
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,640
can I watch this movie
in your room tonight?

571
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,040
Others might see us.

572
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,640
Really?

573
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,040
Yeah.

574
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,720
Since I’m doing this,
nobody will see it, okay?

575
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,920
Anyway,

576
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,560
there aren’t many people around here.

577
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,200
I didn’t expect you
to do something like this.

578
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,960
Well, someone told me

579
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,840
not to treat you badly.

580
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,360
That’s why I want to do everything well.

581
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,760
You… talked to your friend about me?

582
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,080
Yeah.

583
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,040
Well…

584
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,720
We talked a bit.

585
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,680
He told me…

586
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,520
not to disappoint you.

587
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,600
Also,

588
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,680
I don’t want to keep you waiting anymore.

589
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,880
Oh…

590
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,520
I see.

591
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,280
Actually,

592
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,640
there are many things I want to do,

593
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,280
but let’s start with watching this movie.

594
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,160
What do you mean by "many things"?

595
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,160
Well, it’s just many things.

596
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,680
But before we arrive at your place,
let me stop by to buy something.

597
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,840
You can wait here.

598
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,400
- Just one box, right?
- Yes, please.

599
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Just one box, right?

600
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Thank you.

601
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,160
<i>What should we do to make MARS’ song</i>
<i>beat Ice’s on every chart</i>

602
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,160
<i>by the end of this month?</i>

603
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,560
Do everything we can!

604
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,520
Yep, man.
This is just perfect.

605
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,600
<i>Since it’s our first time,</i>

606
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,120
<i>I’d rather see your face clearly.</i>

607
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
<i>When I'm outside,</i>
<i>I have to keep my distance from you.</i>

608
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,280
<i>It's really frustrating.</i>

609
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,880
<i>I’ll come to see you again tonight.</i>
