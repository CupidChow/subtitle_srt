1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,100
Dead. Dead. Dead.

2
00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:04,450
Ozone just drew this today.

3
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:06,682
I don’t have time to decode
your brother’s doodles.

4
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:07,846
What the hell was that for?

5
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:08,962
What you gonna do about it?

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,439
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,468
You need to apologize to Day.

8
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,620
And don’t do what Wiwat says.

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,090
Where is Day?

10
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,842
Keep an eye on him.

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,588
We need to stop Night and Wiwat.

12
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:22,530
Can you leave Night alone?

13
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,831
You know now, don’t you?

14
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,336
- Dream, hear me out.
- Let go.

15
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:26,275
Don’t think.

16
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,991
Just know you’re doing this for her.

17
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,279
He’s going into V-fib.

18
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:34,515
Everyone, back off.

19
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:35,544
Clear.

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,820
CPR.

21
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,540
Clear.

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,230
Are you ready?

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Yes.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,846
Nurse, scalpel.

25
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,340
If you’re ready,

26
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,020
do it.

27
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:03,600
(But who else will die?)

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,436
Which children will have to live
the lives we’ve been living?

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,602
A dead mom,

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,591
a dead dad,

31
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,188
and then a whole lot of dead relatives.

32
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:17,948
(Night.)

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
(No.)

34
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,835
He killed your family.

35
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,377
Would you do that to...

36
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,380
I don’t care who doesn’t agree with me.

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,053
But you have to.

38
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,050
Don’t say you choose it for me.

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,330
I don’t want it.

40
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,602
Dream, hear me out.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,297
You have to be realistic.

42
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,024
Realistic?

43
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,460
You can’t let multiple people die
in my place.

44
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,166
Look.

45
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:55,470
I don’t want to die.

46
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:58,010
But I believe, Night,

47
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,380
that there is another way.

48
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,031
(But who else will die?)

49
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:06,120
(Don’t say you choose it for me.)

50
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,704
(The only reason he wants to help)

51
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,580
(is because he did this to us!)

52
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:11,839
(A dead mom, )

53
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,980
(a dead dad, )

54
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,338
(and then a whole lot of dead relatives.)

55
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,519
(How can you be sure
there’s no other way?)

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,068
I can’t do it.

57
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,910
I can’t do this to anyone.

58
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,020
I will take over.

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,311
Scalpel.

60
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,170
Everyone freaks out on their first try.

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,028
But you can’t walk away like that again.

62
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,457
You have to fight it.

63
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,013
If you can’t do it now,

64
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,479
when Leap Day comes,

65
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,144
you’ll be under a lot of pressure.

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,744
Your girlfriend won’t make it.

67
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,330
I’m sorry.

68
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,642
I won’t do it.

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
I can’t agree with your method.

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,624
Thank you for all your help, Professor,

71
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,439
but I’ll find another way.

72
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Hey.

73
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,366
What’s with you, Night?

74
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,177
Are you going to let Dream die?

75
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,360
No one will die again.

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,330
No one other than my family

77
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,730
and Day’s family…

78
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,577
who you’ve killed yourself.

79
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Professor.

80
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,024
There’s still blood on your hand.

81
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,668
When there was an actual woman
right in front of me,

82
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:39,900
and I had to deliver her baby,

83
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,440
every feeling just came rushing back.

84
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,526
Loneliness,

85
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,017
sadness,

86
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,200
and pain

87
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,584
of never wanting anyone
to go through what I did.

88
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,133
Do you still feel that way now?

89
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,711
Now I’m just scared.

90
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,562
I’m scared someone might have to go through the same thing.

91
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,006
I’m scared something might
happen to you,

92
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,991
and that we’d never find another way out.

93
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Night.

94
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,060
There has to be a way

95
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,002
as long as we work together.

96
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,842
Just like last time.

97
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,864
Leap Day couldn’t hurt us

98
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,180
as long as we’re all together.

99
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,715
All four of us.

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,999
If Leap Day really couldn’t hurt us,

101
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,760
then how come you lied injured
in bed for days?

102
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:56,870
We just got lucky last time, Dream.

103
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,460
But we can’t keep living in fear like this forever.

104
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,744
Well, then…

105
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,280
Let’s go to Day and Ozone.

106
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,344
They’re probably with Kit.

107
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,435
Come on.

108
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:17,464
Let’s go.

109
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
Dream.

110
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,070
Yes?

111
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,991
Will you come back to me?

112
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,890
Nope.

113
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,220
Oh, that kicked puppy look.

114
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:46,690
What’s with that?

115
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,850
Well, then…

116
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,926
Don’t go anywhere again.

117
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,013
You can stop giving me
the cold shoulder now.

118
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Of course.

119
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
Promise?

120
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Promise.

121
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,882
My microwave can do all that?

122
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Of course it can.

123
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,802
It’s versatile like that.

124
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Here.

125
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,748
Eat, eat.

126
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:55,780
Eat.

127
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,780
I guess he likes steamed eggs.

128
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,999
Come on in.

129
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,090
Thank you.

130
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,330
Thank you.

131
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,359
Thanks.

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,370
Eat lots. Grow old.

133
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,650
Thank you, Ozone.

134
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,333
This is… kind of nice.

135
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,675
Did you find anything else after that day?

136
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
No.

137
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,813
There’s just Ozone’s drawing.

138
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,191
I’ve looked through all the documents,

139
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,333
and no matter how I look at them,

140
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,777
I can’t find anything relevant at all.

141
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,264
Can I… have another look at Ozone’s drawing?

142
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,460
You have time to decode that now?

143
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah.

144
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,071
I’m sorry.

145
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,653
I’m really sorry.

146
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
Yeah.

147
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,900
I’m sorry, too.

148
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,744
You don’t need to apologize
to the likes of me.

149
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,264
Fine. I’ll just stay mad, then.

150
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,068
What?

151
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
You jerk.

152
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:25,577
You know what?

153
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:27,577
Since you two are here,

154
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,759
I have something to show you.

155
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Follow me.

156
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,046
This is the report I sent initially.

157
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,642
I did not explain clearly what Leap Day is,

158
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,220
or how it is transmitted,

159
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:45,991
UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF DR. WIWAT JIRACHOTE/MEDICAL COUNCIL

160
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,450
or what Wiwat’s vile plan was.

161
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,613
They all called me crazy.

162
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,788
So I recorded his voice,

163
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:57,511
just as you’ve just heard.

164
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,930
But in the end, he got away with it,

165
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,570
because I didn’t have enough evidence.

166
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,355
He filed a counter-report against me

167
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,726
and that cost me my medical license.

168
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,053
I was left with nothing.

169
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,370
That’s why he needs our help.

170
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:19,817
But now, you’re the very evidence

171
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,602
that proves Leap Day is real.

172
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,399
You are the result

173
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,995
of Wiwat’s evil doing.

174
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:34,670
Wiwat belongs in jail.

175
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,330
Everyone has to know

176
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,875
that the family he has

177
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,480
and the beautiful life he’s living

178
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,937
are built on your families’ dead bodies.

179
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,431
What do you think of this?

180
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Night.

181
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,006
I think he has a right to his grudge.

182
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,871
But after spending some time with Professor Wiwat,

183
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:21,744
I don’t think the life he’s leading
is very happy.

184
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,315
What about what he did to you?

185
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,475
I told you.

186
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:32,704
I don’t have time for things
that already happened.

187
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,428
We should probably focus on

188
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:36,430
making it through the present and the future.

189
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,191
One more thing,

190
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,900
we will still need his help

191
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,126
one way or another.

192
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,606
If he refuses to help,

193
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,610
we can use this against him.

194
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,770
Do you…

195
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,675
still want his help?

196
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,588
There are six stars in Ozone’s drawing.

197
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,457
That means we need both Kit and Professor Wiwat.

198
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Am I right?

199
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:11,868
Fine, then.

200
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,679
I trust you.

201
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:33,831
So, this ‘szoz’ here is 2024.

202
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,366
But what do these stars even mean?

203
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,882
Let’s get back to that tomorrow.

204
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,378
Why don’t you go take a shower and get some rest?

205
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:42,675
We’ve been at it all day.

206
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,646
Roger.

207
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
Night!

208
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Night!

209
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,519
Look at this.

210
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,733
Could it be that these creases here
means that?

211
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:52,471
The clock’s hands?

212
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,686
Look.

213
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,417
Short and long.

214
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,013
A quarter after noon?

215
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,613
I’m gonna ask again…

216
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,930
Did someone fold this paper?

217
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,911
I did.

218
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,871
The stars told me to when I drew it.

219
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,420
That was all.

220
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,922
I couldn’t have done it.

221
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,231
I have to ask for permission
to even touch it.

222
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,650
Neither could I.

223
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,860
That’s how it looked when I first saw it.

224
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,275
Is it possible that this is a message from the stars?

225
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,377
We still can’t be sure.

226
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,617
The information we get is still…

227
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,682
untrustworthy.

228
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,573
I mean— The creases could be accidental, you know?

229
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:03,206
But of course it could really indicate
a quarter after noon.

230
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,962
If that was the case,

231
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,006
why would the stars tell us time?

232
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,508
Maybe it’s when Leap Day will happen.

233
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,119
Yeah, well, but why?

234
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,577
So we can be prepared?

235
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,206
That would be pointless.

236
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,210
If it was really the time of death,

237
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,140
death would come anyway.

238
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,980
No one escapes it.

239
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Agreed.

240
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,890
We will.

241
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,791
We will.

242
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:29,504
We will.

243
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:32,206
But then again, Ozone and Dream are still under Leap Day’s attacks.

244
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,122
I think we’re overlooking,

245
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,402
or missing, something.

246
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
The jigsaw puzzles are incomplete.

247
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,050
But once we find it,

248
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:44,413
we will know right away

249
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,533
if these are just creases

250
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,690
or the time 12.15, as told by the stars.

251
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Mr. Kit.

252
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:06,813
Actually, there’s another way.

253
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,990
What?

254
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,555
Why didn’t you bring that up sooner?

255
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,010
Yeah.

256
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,310
Yeah.

257
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,350
Yeah.

258
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,470
Yeah.

259
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,708
I thought

260
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,053
this method was impossible.

261
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,311
And even if it was possible,

262
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,310
it was still too risky to try.

263
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,657
Which is?

264
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,308
If it wants death, give it death.

265
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,690
What?

266
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,519
What do you mean?

267
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,704
If what Leap Day wants

268
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:55,080
is to take away the life of someone we love,

269
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,540
then we just have to let them die…

270
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,871
to get through Leap Day.

271
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,293
So… we fake their death?

272
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,748
Trick Leap Day into thinking
it has taken a life?

273
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:09,777
Is that what you mean?

274
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:10,846
Yes.

275
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,886
How can we even do that?

276
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,021
Make them sleep in coffins to trick Leap Day they’re already corpses?

277
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,897
What we need to do is

278
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,530
stop Dream and Ozone’s breathings

279
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,690
before Leap Day actually occurs.

280
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,999
When Leap Day is through,

281
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,860
we revive them.

282
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,715
Are you out of your mind, Kit?

283
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,533
Kill them and then bring them back?

284
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,212
You could never do this before because

285
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:47,210
you didn’t know the specific
time of death, right?

286
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,348
Yes.

287
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,486
But suddenly the time 12.15 came to us

288
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,642
from Ozone who drew and folded the paper according to the stars.

289
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,060
This is why I wanted to procure Ozone
in the first place.

290
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,013
He has what I don’t have.

291
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,471
You two have the upper hand now.

292
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
But…

293
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,006
But how do we stop their breathings?

294
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,700
The easiest way is with drugs.

295
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,344
Are you insane?

296
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,573
If a person stops breathing for
no longer than 15 minutes,

297
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,053
they can be resuscitated.

298
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,340
There’s a chance.

299
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,711
How so?

300
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,359
It’s been done before.

301
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:30,550
But the chance of surviving is 50-50,

302
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:32,988
depending on the patient’s
physical condition.

303
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,926
If the next Leap Day is coming at 12.15, like the stars said,

304
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,730
we can stop Dream and Ozone’s
breathings at 12.10.

305
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,260
Which means…

306
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,900
Leap Day won’t take anyone from us.

307
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Correct.

308
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,860
All we have to do is wait for 12.15 to pass

309
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,304
and begin resuscitating Dream and Ozone.

310
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,300
We don’t need to wait for
15 whole minutes.

311
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,340
Why must it be five minutes
before Leap Day?

312
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,340
When a person stops breathing,

313
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
their brain begins to suffer from a lack of oxygen within 3-5 minutes.

314
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,991
That’s when they’re pronounced dead.

315
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,355
After that, each body part begins to slowly shut down.

316
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,630
Hold on, that means,

317
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,799
Dream and Ozone can’t stop breathing for no more than five minutes?

318
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,580
Roughly so, yes.

319
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,380
This might be our best shot right now.

320
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,875
No way.

321
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,493
I can’t risk my brother’s life like that.

322
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:10,202
If he didn’t wake up,

323
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:12,479
it would be just like watching someone
kill him.

324
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,020
Hold that thought right now.

325
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:15,606
You can count me out.

326
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,868
I’m never agreeing to this.

327
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,630
Do you have a wide variety
of choices here?

328
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,090
You won’t do this. You won’t do that.

329
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,879
Dream has to go through it, too.

330
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:28,880
You know I’d never just let Dream die.

331
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,390
Night.

332
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,439
What are you doing up so late?

333
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,537
I only need a minute.

334
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:03,911
You go to bed.

335
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:07,264
You’re still mulling over what Kit said, aren’t you?

336
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,762
I just think it’s not a bad idea,

337
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,191
not considering the risk you and Ozone have to take, that is.

338
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,013
I think so.

339
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,435
It sounds scary

340
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:34,440
but I believe it will work, Night.

341
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,995
More importantly,

342
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,628
it’s the only option we have right now.

343
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,188
Stop it.

344
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,064
Stop working your brain so hard.

345
00:26:52,093 --> 00:26:53,417
Go to bed.

346
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,090
And you know,

347
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,686
you should stop trying to solve problems on your own, you know?

348
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,190
I’m not doing it on my own, am I?

349
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,610
He’s with me.

350
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:07,780
He’s talking to the stars, at this point.

351
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,810
Yeah, I guess.

352
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,082
From my analysis and various studies,

353
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,013
the most possible way out

354
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,664
is Kit’s method.

355
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,773
I still can’t agree with you.

356
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,977
It’s simply too risky.

357
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:35,664
I get it.

358
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:38,980
That’s why I’m gonna try it before letting Ozone and Dream go through it.

359
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,610
Night?

360
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:46,680
I can’t let you do it,

361
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,864
not unless I’ve done it.

362
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,377
The problem now is that

363
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:54,860
we can’t do this at the hospital.

364
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,420
The most equipped
and safest place to do it

365
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,748
is at Professor Wiwat’s house.

366
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,584
We also need your help with it, Kit,

367
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,322
for it to work out perfectly,

368
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,006
according to Ozone’s drawing.

369
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
No.

370
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,984
I can’t help you.

371
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:36,559
We can’t expect fair play from Leap Day.

372
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:38,282
And even if we could,

373
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,060
if we were to make one mistake…

374
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,333
It’s too dangerous.

375
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
No.

376
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,650
I can’t do it.

377
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,308
I can’t help you.

378
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,310
What if Wiwat refused to help?

379
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,191
A guy like him isn’t likely to risk himself for someone else.

380
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,897
If he refuses,

381
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,984
we’ll threaten to blackmail him.

382
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,846
If it comes to that,

383
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:04,646
Night and I will be the evidence you need to do him in.

384
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,570
But if he agrees to help,

385
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,613
you have to help us, too,

386
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,610
and leave him alone afterwards.

387
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,806
That’s our offer to him if you’re okay with it

388
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,359
But, Professor,

389
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,202
this is the only way.

390
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:21,231
No.

391
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
No.

392
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,766
That’s not the only way.

393
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,926
I’m not doing it your way.

394
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,070
Hey.

395
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,740
Kit’s in.

396
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,664
What about Wiwat?

397
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,220
Professor Wiwat said no.

398
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,853
I’m going to his place tomorrow.

399
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,642
I’ll talk to him again.

400
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,344
I’m coming with you.

401
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,093
Kit, too.

402
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,882
No, don’t.

403
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,733
If Kit is there, Wiwat will only resist.

404
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:55,762
No way.

405
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,951
Hey, but who else is better at threatening Wiwat into this but Kit?

406
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,013
Trust me.

407
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,322
Fine.

408
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,653
But stick to the plan.

409
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:11,682
Okay?

410
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:19,955
Deer.

411
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,290
I’m stepping on the gas today.

412
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,340
I’ve got something urgent at work.

413
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,213
Okay.

414
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:24,886
I’ll pick you up from school later.

415
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,351
What’s going on, Dad?

416
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,417
What are all these people doing here?

417
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,671
That uncle is…

418
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:57,519
Get out here and talk, bud.

419
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,068
Wait here.

420
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,767
Call your mother and tell her to stay inside.

421
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:01,875
Lock the door.

422
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:02,911
Doc.

423
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:04,246
Come on.

424
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,210
It’s okay.

425
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,380
Nothing to be scared of.

426
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,355
Wait, Dad.

427
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,413
Don’t go.

428
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,842
Do as I said.

429
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,526
DEARLY DEER

430
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
What now?

431
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,690
You’re as good as forcing me to call the cops on you.

432
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,791
Call them.

433
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,257
I’ve got a lot of evidence this time.

434
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,788
Day and Night are the crucial evidence
of what evil thing you did

435
00:31:55,824 --> 00:31:57,790
to be able to build what you have now.

436
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,730
Doc.

437
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,148
If you don’t help us,

438
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,264
I’m going to expose you.

439
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,199
Do you still believe that,

440
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,559
even with evidence, someone would believe you?

441
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,017
Why don’t we start with your family?

442
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,202
Should I march into your house right now and tell your wife

443
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,562
that you killed the families of these two kids

444
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,504
to keep your own?

445
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,475
Kit.

446
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,733
What do you mean by that?

447
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,200
Did you notice that he always disappears

448
00:33:04,224 --> 00:33:06,980
on the morning of his birthdays?

449
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,697
He visits the graves of these boys’ families.

450
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,399
Kit, please stop.

451
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Mom.

452
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,486
For Doc and I, and these two kids here,

453
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,704
ever since we were born,

454
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,660
someone we love always dies
on February 29.

455
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,500
You can trace it all back.

456
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,810
His mother, father, and relatives

457
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,791
they all died on February 29.

458
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,853
The only reason you two are still alive

459
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,915
is because he traded your lives for these boys’ families.

460
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,100
Honey, take our daughter inside.

461
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,264
I’ll handle this.

462
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
He’s gone mad.

463
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,710
Don’t listen to him.

464
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,690
What are you talking about?

465
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,900
It’s not true.

466
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,930
It is!

467
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,810
Day.

468
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,333
Everything he said is true.

469
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,490
Professor Wiwat passed those deaths
onto us.

470
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,457
Everyone in our family is dead

471
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,090
just to keep you alive.

472
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,413
Day.

473
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:45,810
This isn’t helping.

474
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,213
That’s why

475
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:52,300
I’m asking you to talk to him,

476
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,562
force him, or whatever you have to do,

477
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,920
to get your husband to help us.

478
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,588
You really are gone every morning
on your birthdays.

479
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,230
Honey.

480
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,970
Come on.

481
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,519
You don’t let us leave the house
on your birthdays.

482
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Honey.

483
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,108
And your family members

484
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,977
really all died on your birthdays.

485
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,526
Stop it.

486
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,006
What exactly is going on, Dad?

487
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,682
He was here once before, too.

488
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,559
What does he want now?

489
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,977
You met them before?

490
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,810
Not all of them.

491
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,766
Just Kit.

492
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:14,711
You personally tutored Night here.

493
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:15,962
What for?

494
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,050
A murder workshop?

495
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,933
It’s not like that.

496
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,551
Will you hear me out?

497
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,624
You’re asking me to listen.

498
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,693
But will you tell me and your daughter
the truth?

499
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:29,511
Or are you going to spin some more lies?

500
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:33,893
Fine.

501
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,042
Yes.

502
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,330
I did it.

503
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,664
If I hadn’t, you would have been dead.

504
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,722
It might sound ridiculous,

505
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,406
but it is true.

506
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,737
Someone I love really does die every February 29.

507
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,944
The only way to stop it

508
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,624
is to bring two new lives into the world on February 29 instead.

509
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,362
Those two boys are my victims.

510
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,697
Their families died because of me.

511
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,668
Are you happy now?

512
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,670
What good does it do now that you know?

513
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,519
I’m sorry

514
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,580
for keeping this from you.

515
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,362
I love you.

516
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,490
I want to spend my life with you.

517
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,922
We have a beautiful family.

518
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,231
We have our daughter.

519
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,006
My dearly beloved Deer.

520
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,391
Right, Deer?

521
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:07,991
Deer, love.

522
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,173
After everything you said,

523
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:31,911
you think he’d want to help us now?

524
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,671
We talked about this!

525
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,300
We were supposed to only threaten him.

526
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,828
I know.

527
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,460
The only people who matter to him
now know.

528
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:40,882
What else does he have to lose now?

529
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,762
His reputation.

530
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,453
Please.

531
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,759
We’ve all had Leap Day all our lives.

532
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,359
Do we ever care what people think of us?

533
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,959
Okay, okay.

534
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:54,762
But it’s already happened.

535
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,824
I think we should be thinking about
what to do next.

536
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,013
I don’t know.

537
00:38:58,057 --> 00:39:00,010
If Wiwat won’t help,
I’m at a loss what to do.

538
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,170
I’m a doctor. Or at least I was.

539
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:06,479
You’re a medical student.

540
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,450
We can pull it off.

541
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Look.

542
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,006
We need someone to keep an eye
on the vitals at all times.

543
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,457
We need another one to be on standby
to start CPR.

544
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,759
We also need someone to supervise the dosage of the drugs used.

545
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,617
And in the case of CPR failing to do its job,

546
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,442
we need someone to inject adrenaline.

547
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,700
Now remember, we’ll have two dead-to-be’s.

548
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,410
It means we actually need at least
six people to be safe.

549
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,719
Honey.

550
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,359
Honey.

551
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,610
Can we talk?

552
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,006
Give me some time.

553
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,013
Let’s talk tomorrow.

554
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,210
Honey?

555
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,130
Deer.

556
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:29,282
Deer?

557
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Honey.

558
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,468
DON’T CONTACT US AGAIN.

559
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:58,497
(If Wiwat won’t help,
I’m at a loss what to do.)

560
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,588
(Now remember, we’ll have two dead-to-be’s.)

561
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,202
(It means we actually need at least
six people to be safe.)

562
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,453
Hey!

563
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,482
What are you doing?

564
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:22,544
Don’t you dare!

565
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,388
Why are you doing this?

566
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,750
Day?

567
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,380
There.

568
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,551
Look what the bastard did.

569
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,200
What would happen if I weren’t here?

570
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,362
You should have let me die.

571
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,799
For what I did.

572
00:44:40,828 --> 00:44:42,800
You took my family from me

573
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,002
for your own happiness.

574
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,570
And you’re just gonna throw it away— Make that make sense!

575
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,170
Look up.

576
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:00,373
Look up.

577
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,624
You’re fine.

578
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,504
But I agree with what Day said.

579
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,602
Your action

580
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,806
was thoughtless and selfish.

581
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,522
I know for a fact that Deer and your wife

582
00:45:22,544 --> 00:45:24,010
wouldn’t have felt relieved

583
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,660
if they had to learn what might have happened to you.

584
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
Here.

585
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,620
DON’T CONTACT US AGAIN.

586
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:09,620
The other side!

587
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,199
Turn it over.

588
00:46:16,995 --> 00:46:24,399
I KNOW YOU CAN HELP THEM, DAD.

589
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Read more carefully!

590
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,468
Some doctor you are.

591
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,610
What’s it gonna be?

592
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,766
You gonna help us or not?

593
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,122
I will.

594
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:05,351
But not here.

595
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,951
Are you sure about this?

596
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,871
Tell Night to change his mind.

597
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:18,006
Tell him.

598
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,162
Tell him to change his mind.

599
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:19,831
It’s okay.

600
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:21,220
No, don’t.

601
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:22,900
Are you ready?

602
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:23,628
Yes.

603
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:25,926
No, no, no.

604
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,886
No.

605
00:47:26,908 --> 00:47:27,908
No.

606
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,024
No.

607
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:30,053
No.

608
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,279
No, no.

609
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,330
- No.
- Day.

610
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,555
- No, no.
- If I didn’t...

611
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:38,584
No.

612
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,537
You’ll be fine.

613
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,202
No, no.

614
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:42,820
No.

615
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,551
No, no.

616
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,730
No.

617
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,551
No, no.

618
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
I’m ready.

619
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:54,475
No.

620
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,548
No, no.

621
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:59,790
It’s okay.

622
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:23,646
Start the timer.

623
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,653
CPR on standby.

624
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,013
He’s going into V-fib.

625
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Charging.

626
00:48:47,439 --> 00:48:48,439
200 joules.

627
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:53,810
Stand back.

628
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:56,326
I’m standing back.

629
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:57,402
Everyone, back away.

630
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,410
Clear.

631
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
CPR.

632
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,479
He’s still in V-fib.

633
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,668
Charging to 200 joules.

634
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
Clear.

635
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,133
Night.

636
00:49:47,162 --> 00:49:47,977
Can you hear me?

637
00:49:48,006 --> 00:49:49,006
Night!

638
00:50:01,846 --> 00:50:03,708
Why did you stop, Professor?

639
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,370
Leap Day is coming next year.

640
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
You ready?

641
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,606
Of course not.

642
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:18,755
But I’m not afraid anymore.

643
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,690
Do not underestimate it.

644
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,268
We don’t know when it’s coming.

645
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,590
Maybe Leap Day is waiting for this exact moment.

646
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:26,704
Ozone!

647
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Ozone!

648
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,430
Ozone.

649
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,922
I have to tell Day!

650
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:33,453
I have to tell Day.

651
00:50:33,482 --> 00:50:33,991
I’m dead.

652
00:50:34,028 --> 00:50:35,170
I’m dead.

653
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:37,955
The sky turned a messy color after that.

654
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,199
I saw my younger self.

655
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:40,275
He told me,

656
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,693
“You know what to do.”
