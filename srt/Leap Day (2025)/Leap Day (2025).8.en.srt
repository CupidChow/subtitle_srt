1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,966
I share my Leap Day with Dr. Wiwat.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,826
Someone is going to die.

3
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:10,513
Die.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,233
Die.

5
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,040
Someone is going to die.

6
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,120
Let’s go help Day.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,320
Don’t fight me on this.

8
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:15,990
You know what you’ve just been through.

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,340
Ozone!

10
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:17,740
Why put yourself at risk again?

11
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:18,440
Ozone!

12
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:20,606
I thought we’d have more time to talk.

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,753
Tell Day what we talked about today.

14
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,013
You must not tell Night.

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,120
Only let Day know.

16
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:29,890
Go to Day.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,426
There’s nothing but houses on this side.

18
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:44,546
You can’t see anything past the big house across the street.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,660
I doubt there’s a city view from there.

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,906
How about this?

21
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:49,440
I’ll give you a lower rent.

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,980
Thank you.

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,613
You’re welcome.

24
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:55,726
Would you like to sign a lease agreement right away?

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,780
Of course.

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,993
Do you work around here?

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,660
Yes.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,860
This place is also near my friend’s house.

29
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,840
It’s as good as taking lives.

30
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,260
Don’t you realize that?

31
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,406
You know what we’ve been through.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,360
Do you want the same fate for someone else?

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,460
Would you rather we keep living like this?

34
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:31,613
Would you rather other people keep dying for our sake?

35
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:34,633
Yes.

36
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,946
They’re nobody to us.

37
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,940
We’ll keep our loved ones safe.

38
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,726
You would save strangers’ lives over your loved ones’?

39
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,720
We’re doctors.

40
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,080
Doctors are supposed to save lives,

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,433
not take them.

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,410
EVERYONE WILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

43
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,726
Day.

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Day.

45
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,220
No!

46
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:54,253
No!

47
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,573
Doctors are supposed to save lives.

48
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:34,926
Dream, Dream, Dream.

49
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,953
What the hell is going on?

50
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,880
Dream. Dream.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Ozone!

52
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,080
Ozone, Ozone.

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,920
Ozone, calm down.

54
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,180
Calm down.

55
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:54,753
Please, calm down.

56
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,013
Listen to me.

57
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,353
Ozone, calm down.

58
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,386
Calm down.

59
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,460
Dream, stay with me.

60
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,426
Dream.

61
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:10,846
Dream, Dream, stay with me.

62
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:11,913
- Please. - Stop her blood.

63
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,406
Her vital’s fading.

64
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,413
She’s not breathing.

65
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,373
I’m going to start CPR.

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Will you help me?

67
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,926
Can you do that?

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,380
Can you?

69
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,033
Yes.

70
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,606
Hold her head steady.

71
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,086
Yes.

72
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,773
Dream, stay with me.

73
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:36,806
Please

74
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,820
Look at me, Ozone.

75
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,046
I’m right here.

76
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:46,866
Let’s recite the planets.

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Shall we?

78
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,940
- Mercury. - Mercury.

79
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:49,720
- Venus. - Venus.

80
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:50,580
- Earth. - Earth.

81
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:51,553
- Mars. - Mars.

82
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:52,393
- Uranus. - Uranus.

83
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,553
- Neptune. - Neptune.

84
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,333
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,400
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

86
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,340
You got it.

87
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,500
Better now?

88
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Night.

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,760
Splint her arm.

90
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,080
Medical student!

91
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:42,766
Splint the patient’s arm!

92
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:43,806
Yes.

93
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,333
Hello?

94
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,330
We need an ambulance.

95
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,826
The location is Jintanasawad 24.

96
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:08,676
We’re right at the intersection in front of an apartment building.

97
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,860
Come quickly.

98
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:10,953
Someone’s been injured.

99
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,466
I’ll back away.

100
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,333
You back away.

101
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,406
Everyone, back away.

102
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,873
One, two, three. Clear.

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,893
Back away. Back away.

104
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,860
One, two, three. Clear.

105
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:53,873
Please.

106
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,473
Yes.

107
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,453
I’m coming with you.

108
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,153
No.

109
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,426
You stay with him.

110
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,940
Keep me updated.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
I’m coming with you.

112
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,873
I can help.

113
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Please, sir.

114
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,910
Walk.

115
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,580
We need to talk.

116
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,026
We will.

117
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,756
Just look through the documents I gave Ozone.

118
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,073
We’ll get to the bottom of this!

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,840
Are you alright?

120
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,953
I’m Dr. Wiwat.

121
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,293
This way, Doctor.

122
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,973
Please stay and wait outside, sir.

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Wait outside.

124
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,686
I’ll let you talk to him

125
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,060
as you asked.

126
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,713
But I can only give you 10 minutes.

127
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,900
Any longer than that and my boss will have my head.

128
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,746
Did you read through the files?

129
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,853
Did Ozone tell you everything?

130
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,766
You must not tell Night about this.

131
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,780
If he finds out, everything...

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,893
I’m sorry for taking your brother away from you.

133
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,393
It was the best way...

134
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:25,160
Kidnapping?

135
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,366
You took my brother.

136
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:29,726
You hurt Dream.

137
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,293
That’s what you think is the best way?

138
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,546
Tell me everything.

139
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,273
Don’t spare a damn thing.

140
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,973
Tell me everything about you.

141
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,753
You’re still safe and alive

142
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,693
because you were also born on a Leap Day.

143
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,726
The days have met.

144
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,640
The nights have met.

145
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,386
The days have met.

146
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,160
The days have met.

147
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,373
The nights have met.

148
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,826
The days have met.

149
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,940
My name is Kit.

150
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,980
I was born at midday, just like you.

151
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,300
KITTIPHOB JARUDEJ, BORN 12.00 P.M.

152
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,300
This is Wiwat.

153
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,300
He was born at midnight, just like Night.

154
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,826
WIWAT JIRACHOTE, BORN 12.00 A.M.

155
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,013
He and I were friends.

156
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,873
We were best friends.

157
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,173
We went through similar things.

158
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:11,653
Just like you and Night did.

159
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,920
It’s all in the past now.

160
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
And?

161
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,713
No.

162
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,593
No.

163
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,413
No.

164
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:36,980
No.

165
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,786
No.

166
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,760
No.

167
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:39,626
No.

168
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,446
No.

169
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:41,386
No.

170
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,073
No.

171
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
No.

172
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,460
Hello, Mr. Ozone.

173
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,466
I’m here to give you a check-up.

174
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,086
No.

175
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,900
May I approach?

176
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,633
No.

177
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,233
No.

178
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:00,773
No.

179
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:01,700
No.

180
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
No.

181
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,793
Please calm down.

182
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,446
There’s nothing to be scared of.

183
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,486
No. No. No. No.

184
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:12,722
Once we’re done with your check-up,

185
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,913
you can see Day right away.

186
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Please.

187
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,620
Let’s get you checked up.

188
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
Please.

189
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,986
Be careful.

190
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,433
Be careful.

191
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,166
Please.

192
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,053
Take a seat.

193
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Please, relax.

194
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,093
He and I went to the same university.

195
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,640
We were both medical students.

196
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,666
When I learned he was born on February 29,

197
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,833
I pestered him about Leap Day,

198
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,980
just like you did with Night at the cemetery.

199
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Yes.

200
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:24,660
I’ve been following you since then.

201
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,933
I know who you should talk about this with

202
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,260
and who you shouldn’t.

203
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,846
What do you mean?

204
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,406
This is about Wiwat

205
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,120
and how he evaded Leap Day.

206
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,046
Where’s the ER doctor?

207
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,553
Saving another patient, sir.

208
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:06,420
I think we need a specialist.

209
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,233
I want the best one.

210
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:09,400
Yes, Doctor.

211
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,280
Joy. Joy.

212
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,113
If no one will hear you out,

213
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,093
I, I, I will.

214
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,153
I don’t know what happened,

215
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,953
but there’s a solution to every problem.

216
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,753
Can you hear me?

217
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:09,260
There really is a solution to everything.

218
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,093
I don’t have to eat.

219
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,753
I’m full just looking at you.

220
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,986
It’s good.

221
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,060
If you really, really, are in love with me,

222
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,620
you’ll do this.

223
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,633
Because I really, really, am in love with you.

224
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,213
I won’t let you go through this alone again.

225
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,686
Please, Dream.

226
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,553
Don’t leave me.

227
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,173
Don’t...

228
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,373
How–How is Dream?

229
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:57,773
Take a deep breath.

230
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,226
I did everything I could.

231
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:13,000
You–You did everything you could?

232
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,620
What do you mean?

233
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,133
We need to talk.

234
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,526
How is Dream?

235
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,200
Why are we here?

236
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,833
Dream is safe now.

237
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,793
She’s recovering.

238
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,413
Her condition is critical, though.

239
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,773
But she’s in good hands.

240
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Why didn’t you start with that?

241
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,153
What are we coming up here for?

242
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,673
We need to talk.

243
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,106
You asked me about Leap Day.

244
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,573
Everything you said was right.

245
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,933
I was born on February 29.

246
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,966
Exactly at midnight.

247
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,953
I had Leap Day.

248
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,566
Not only did I have it,

249
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,220
I’m cured of it.

250
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Yes.

251
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,553
It’s curable.

252
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,546
What do you mean?

253
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,120
Wiwat knows how to evade Leap Day?

254
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Yes.

255
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,066
But it’s a cruel solution.

256
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:43,180
It’s inhumane.

257
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,233
He’s taken lives,

258
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:52,480
the lives of none other than your

259
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:54,850
and Night’s families.

260
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,220
When I was in medical school,

261
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,520
there was a foreign professor

262
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,813
who was researching February 29-born people.

263
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,793
He… also has Leap Day?

264
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,633
Not him.

265
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,686
His wife of more than 30 years.

266
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,580
He survived every Leap Day without a scratch.

267
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,440
How?

268
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,480
Transmission.

269
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,700
His wife found that by transmitting the condition,

270
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,700
she gets to keep her loved ones.

271
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,946
That’s how the professor stays alive.

272
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
That’s how I keep my kid and wife alive.

273
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,060
There are two ways that Leap Day occurs.

274
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,646
First, they are born naturally.

275
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,640
One child is born at midnight of February 29

276
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,100
while another at midday of February 29 of the same year.

277
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,086
The two children would share the same Leap Day.

278
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,080
In your case,

279
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,166
you share it with Night.

280
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,600
What’s the other way?

281
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,180
The other way is by transmission.

282
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,180
This is what that professor’s wife and I did.

283
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,333
You…

284
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,860
You mean to tell me…

285
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,610
Yes.

286
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,540
I transmitted Leap Day to you two.

287
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,266
Push.

288
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,660
Just a little more.

289
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,133
Keep pushing.

290
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,286
Good.

291
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:55,700
Why did it say here

292
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,340
that you induced my mother’s labor?

293
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
I’m sorry.

294
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:10,426
You killed my family?

295
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,066
I will help you.

296
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
I will help you and Day both.

297
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,386
I mean it.

298
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,086
I will.

299
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,353
It’s easy.

300
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,780
I’ll find two pregnant mothers

301
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,606
whose terms are due on the next February 29.

302
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,600
All you have to do is deliver the babies.

303
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,026
That’s it.

304
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,620
You evade Leap Day

305
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,166
by giving it to someone else.

306
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,620
We’ll need two babies.

307
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:23,710
They’ll be born at midnight and midday.

308
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,133
But that’s not a problem.

309
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,860
I did it.

310
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,060
And it worked.

311
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,493
And those babies are supposed to go through all this?

312
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
To go through what we went through?

313
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,066
Nobody should ever have to experience anything like this.

314
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,740
That’s why I am here talking to you.

315
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,093
You know Night is looking for a solution.

316
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,486
Between you who study Communication Arts,

317
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:02,333
and Night who studies medicine…

318
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,746
Who do you think is more likely to choose that solution?

319
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,706
I will help you.

320
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:14,093
Do it, and you can keep Dream safe.

321
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,440
No way.

322
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
There’s no way Night would do it.

323
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,200
Are you sure?

324
00:26:01,313 --> 00:26:04,120
After seeing Dream like that,

325
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,620
are you still sure he won’t?

326
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,220
Ozone.

327
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,680
Long.

328
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,773
Too long.

329
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:34,846
Too long.

330
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Too long.

331
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,786
I’m sorry.

332
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,320
Something came up.

333
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,133
We have to go somewhere before we can go home.

334
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Is that okay?

335
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,713
No need to be scared, Ozone.

336
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,986
He won’t hurt you again.

337
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,820
I need his help with something.

338
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,833
If he still scares you,

339
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,380
you can stay right behind me any time.

340
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,266
I won’t let anyone hurt you again.

341
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,380
I promise.

342
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,313
No.

343
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:39,973
No.

344
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:40,820
No.

345
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
No.

346
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,593
It’s alright now, Ozone.

347
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,766
Can we leave the door open?

348
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
Yeah.

349
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,453
He’s probably still scared.

350
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,086
I understand.

351
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,533
Sit here.

352
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,990
If I ever scare you,

353
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,266
you can run away immediately.

354
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,046
This Leap Day theory,

355
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,613
no one knows how it started.

356
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,893
Many mention a physics theory Super Circle

357
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,653
which is possible

358
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,673
when there’s an anomaly in the universe.

359
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,613
It’s all about time and the earth’s revolution

360
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,610
which makes an extra day possible.

361
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,870
Hold on.

362
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,033
I don’t care how it began.

363
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,806
I only care about how to stop it.

364
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,506
Can we just get to the point?

365
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
How to stop it…

366
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,486
That’s something I don’t know.

367
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,593
What?

368
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:12,633
What the hell?

369
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,060
What I do know

370
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,153
is that I won’t ever do what Wiwat did.

371
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,560
I can’t do it.

372
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,966
Let’s go, Ozone.

373
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:30,986
We’re going home.

374
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Wait!

375
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,466
But you and Night have what I don’t.

376
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,060
What is that?

377
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,646
Ozone.

378
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,333
You have Ozone.

379
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,940
For us, it was just Wiwat and me.

380
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:05,046
We didn’t have someone like Ozone who could hear the stars

381
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:07,040
or foresee the future.

382
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,113
That’s why I…

383
00:30:10,153 --> 00:30:12,706
That’s why you took Ozone before even talking to me?

384
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,286
You wanted to use Ozone to solve your own Leap Day, didn’t you?

385
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,660
I just wanted to show him what I found.

386
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,020
Maybe he knew something I didn't.

387
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,340
Maybe the stars would tell him something.

388
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,646
If he could help me,

389
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,873
he could help you all.

390
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,793
Let’s go, Ozone.

391
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:32,710
We really are going home.

392
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:35,040
I can help you get back at Wiwat.

393
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,920
The Leap Day theory has been mocked and ridiculed.

394
00:30:42,953 --> 00:30:44,506
No one believes in it.

395
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,413
Wiwat was accused by a doctor who lost his license like me.

396
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,733
But now, there are you and Night.

397
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,293
You two are the prime evidence

398
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,186
of what awful things Wiwat did.

399
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,286
Help me get back at him.

400
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:06,766
I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time.

401
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,186
Look what he did to you and what he did to me.

402
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,713
It will work.

403
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,806
No one has to go through what you and Night went through again.

404
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,633
I will help you.

405
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,180
Do it, and you can keep Dream safe.

406
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,400
Sleep on it.

407
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,360
I’ll be here when you decide.

408
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,293
Pass the message to Day as well.

409
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,166
What should I do, Dream?

410
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,313
Would you think I’m a bad person?

411
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,393
Ozone.

412
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,060
Ozone.

413
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,053
Ozone.

414
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,166
What are you doing sleeping here?

415
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:35,793
Won’t it be more comfortable in your own bed?

416
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,213
I was… I was scared.

417
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:42,213
I was scared he’d kidnap me again.

418
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,806
No one will come and take you anymore.

419
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,440
You’re safe now.

420
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,440
Go and sleep in your own bed.

421
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,393
Ozone.

422
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,773
Well?

423
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:58,806
You hungry?

424
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,886
Let me whip up something good for you, then?

425
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,680
Spoil me rotten.

426
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,126
Okay, okay.

427
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,600
Let’s have breakfast.

428
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:07,773
Hang on.

429
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,033
Dig in.

430
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
It’s all good.

431
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,280
Do you like it?

432
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,360
Yes?

433
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,040
How’s Dream?

434
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,406
She’s safe now.

435
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,620
She’s still unconscious, though.

436
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,540
How are things over there?

437
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,580
Ozone is still a little shaken,

438
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,886
but we’re fine.

439
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,480
I suppose things are worse on your end.

440
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Good to hear he’s okay.

441
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,466
We’ll come visit.

442
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,540
Don’t.

443
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:52,380
You guys should rest.

444
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,106
Dream is still sleeping anyway.

445
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,730
I see.

446
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,266
Have you talked to Wiwat at all?

447
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,946
Have you talked to that guy?

448
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,760
Yes.

449
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:21,760
His name is Kit.

450
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:23,733
He told me all about Wiwat.

451
00:37:23,753 --> 00:37:25,526
Don’t get involved with him.

452
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:26,753
He’s bad news.

453
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,873
I’ll tell you everything when I see you

454
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,833
so let me know when we can meet.

455
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:34,226
I… need a favor.

456
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:38,480
I’m not sure I can meet you any time soon.

457
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,126
But I’ll be in touch.

458
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,900
I have something I need to talk to you about, too.

459
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,453
Alright.

460
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,033
Don’t wait too long.

461
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:49,546
I’m kinda in a hurry.

462
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,580
It’s better to stick together and watch each other’s backs.

463
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,850
Yeah.

464
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,846
All done.

465
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,846
It was good, then?

466
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,460
Are you full?

467
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,800
Do you want more?

468
00:38:39,513 --> 00:38:41,020
Come back soon, Dream.

469
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,480
I need you.

470
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,486
I really need to talk to you.

471
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,250
What the hell is he doing here?

472
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,733
Ozone is still scared of him.

473
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,613
I’m sorry but I really couldn’t wait.

474
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:37,626
Did you have a word with Night?

475
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I…

476
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,140
Let’s talk inside.

477
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,713
Dangerous.

478
00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:52,960
Stay away.

479
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,140
It’s alright, Ozone.

480
00:39:56,173 --> 00:39:57,540
I got this.

481
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,146
Why don’t you wait inside?

482
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,666
I stay with you.

483
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,289
Here’s the thing, Ozone...

484
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,426
Mister.

485
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,446
Mr. Ozone.

486
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:11,673
Night is taking the wrong side.

487
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,220
We need to talk as soon as possible.

488
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,400
If we can fix it,

489
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
we might be able to get Night back on our side.

490
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,593
Are you alright with that, Ozone?

491
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,873
We go inside.

492
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,620
Day, listen to me.

493
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,360
I can help you.

494
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:11,006
Let me help you.

495
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,606
I can’t, bud.

496
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,700
You won’t be able to save anyone.

497
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:34,020
Is that what you want?

498
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,266
You know damn well what we went through.

499
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,989
Do you want someone else to go through that?

500
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,700
Would you rather we keep living like this?

501
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:55,773
Would you rather we keep letting people die for us?

502
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,166
Day–Day kills Night.

503
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:03,173
Day kills Night.

504
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,340
Day kills Night.

505
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,342
There’s nothing to worry about now, Dream.

506
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:08,330
We found a way to stop Leap Day.

507
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,966
What the hell do you want?

508
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,733
Stop it!

509
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:15,413
Stop!

510
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:16,153
Stop!

511
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:16,920
Stop!

512
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:17,760
Stop!

513
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:18,793
Stop!
