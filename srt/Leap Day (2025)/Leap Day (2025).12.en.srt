1
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:02,664
Everyone.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,367
I believe this could work.

3
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,370
Leap Day could be waiting for this moment.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,752
But I believe this is no coincidence.

5
00:00:09,784 --> 00:00:12,304
This is the first time the three of us could hear the stars,

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,592
and it happened right after you and I “died.”

7
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:17,050
You already know what to do, don’t you?

8
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:19,104
You’re in a dream, Ozone.

9
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:20,896
If you really are here…

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,688
Dead. I’m dead.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,664
- I’m dead. - Ozone, stay calm.

12
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:28,944
Ozone!

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
Ozone!

14
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:12,704
FEBRUARY 28, 2024

15
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,432
Ozone!

16
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Ozone.

17
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,904
Maybe it was the stars?

18
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:28,936
I wonder.

19
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,760
Did you hear the stars?

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,712
Are you hurt?

21
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,488
No, I didn’t.

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,024
No, I’m not.

23
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,792
Nothing at all, Ozone?

24
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,864
You were asleep for quite a while.

25
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Yes.

26
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,288
We need to get you checked up or something.

27
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,816
You had a seizure and now this?

28
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,100
I’ll call Professor Wiwat.

29
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,224
I…

30
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,256
I… had a dream.

31
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:14,216
I saw the desert,

32
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,344
like you and Night told us about.

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,448
I met Kid Day.

34
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,584
He said you know what to do, Day.

35
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,550
I see.

36
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
What else?

37
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,976
I fell asleep again.

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,600
I saw someone riding…

39
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,070
Riding…

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,432
A bicycle?

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Yes.

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,928
I didn’t see his face.

43
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:52,952
But I knew him well.

44
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:55,672
So you…

45
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,880
You dreamed of younger me telling you I know what to do,

46
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,488
and of someone on a bicycle.

47
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Anyway.

48
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,872
I think he should get a checkup, just in case.

49
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:10,216
Yeah.

50
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,216
Hello, Professor.

51
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,896
So something happened…

52
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,048
Shall we go?

53
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,280
I’ll help Ozone get changed.

54
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,112
It’s not good.

55
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,072
How is this not good?

56
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,616
It’s all so normal.

57
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,872
I don’t find anything wrong at all.

58
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,296
Like I told you before, he’s very healthy.

59
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,490
So?

60
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,824
So we don’t even know

61
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,304
what we’re supposed to worry about.

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,496
Leap Day is tomorrow.

63
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,784
I’m afraid the only thing we can do

64
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,280
is to monitor our plan according to the situation tomorrow.

65
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,072
Don’t be afraid, Ozone.

66
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,864
Okay. It’s alright. Let’s stay calm.

67
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,208
We’ll all be there.

68
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,560
No one will let anything happen to Ozone whatever happens.

69
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,272
Don’t forget Leap Day has one rule:

70
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,736
Someone you love will die.

71
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,896
Ozone will have to go under tomorrow anyway.

72
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,900
There’s nothing worse than that.

73
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:41,880
We just all have to make it through.

74
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,896
I agree.

75
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,960
But more importantly,

76
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,304
you have to figure out

77
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,416
what your younger self told you the solution is.

78
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Yes.

79
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,270
I’ll try my best to figure it out.

80
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,104
I’ll save Ozone no matter what.

81
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,216
Guys, I have an idea.

82
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,144
Let’s order everything we want to eat tonight.

83
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,152
Don’t even think about finishing it.

84
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,976
We’ll just pile them up on our table.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,384
And don’t worry about gaining weight at all.

86
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,280
Good. Good.

87
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,144
Let’s. Let’s.

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,744
I take it that you’re in?

89
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,300
What do you say, Night?

90
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,088
Yeah, let’s do it.

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Yes!

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,888
Ask Day.

93
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Please.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Day, what do you want to eat?

95
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,016
Why don’t you pick?

96
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,872
I’ll eat anything you want.

97
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,544
No.

98
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,704
That’s not how this works.

99
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:03,904
You pick.

100
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,856
Can you give me a minute to think?

101
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,008
Ozone, you should help him out.

102
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,136
Vanilla. Chocolate.

103
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:14,168
Vanilla and chocolate?

104
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,104
Vanilla. Chocolate.

105
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:17,512
I’ll go with something savory, then.

106
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,248
What about pizza?

107
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,472
What topping should we get?

108
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,272
Wow.

109
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:27,424
I am super happy.

110
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,272
Eat lots.

111
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,576
We can order more if we want.

112
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,928
- I will. - Dig in, Ozone.

113
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I will.

114
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,016
You got it?

115
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,056
Yes.

116
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Day.

117
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,896
Why fried chicken?

118
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,400
When I was a kid,

119
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,750
every time I finished my exam top of the class,

120
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,336
my dad always got me fried chicken to celebrate.

121
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,190
Well, I didn’t get to eat it much after.

122
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,672
Was it because… you didn’t do well in exams anymore?

123
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,824
Eat lots, then.

124
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,056
My number one kid brother.

125
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,512
You’re my number one, too.

126
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,616
You’re my number one, Night.

127
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,470
Thank you.

128
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
That’s all?

129
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,448
Oh, yeah. Right.

130
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,216
Let’s go with this one.

131
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,190
If you want.

132
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,016
You’re… also my number one.

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,760
Let me get one for you, too.

134
00:08:58,784 --> 00:08:59,328
No.

135
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,488
I’ll give you my fried chicken.

136
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:02,512
Dig in.

137
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,656
Stop it.

138
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:09,200
It’s not like that.

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,648
This is just to say that…

140
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,912
It's been great being friends with you.

141
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,536
Even though you’re… a damn poser,

142
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,416
slightly socially inept, and ungenerous.

143
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,568
Hold it.

144
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,368
That was only at first.

145
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,928
First impression, you know?

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,032
Okay, then.

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,000
But honestly… I’m really glad

148
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,536
it’s you I share my Leap Day with.

149
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,152
I could say the same.

150
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:47,904
But I have something to tell you…

151
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,216
I have gout.

152
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,472
Crap.

153
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,770
For real?

154
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,144
As if!

155
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:00,984
I’m kidding.

156
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,224
I don’t have it.

157
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,480
I’m glad, too.

158
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,344
I’m so… happy.

159
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,360
Dream is my best friend.

160
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,280
I’m even happier.

161
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,864
I always have fun playing with you.

162
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,912
Right, Night, bestie?

163
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,910
What?

164
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Come on.

165
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,768
Fine.

166
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,704
- Yay! - Alright!

167
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,304
Say something!

168
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:40,408
What should I say?

169
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,144
Say what Day said just now.

170
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,456
Well, same here.

171
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,880
Same what?

172
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:46,728
What is it?

173
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:47,896
What he said!

174
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,240
What did I say?

175
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,264
Do you want to know, Ozone?

176
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,328
Yes.

177
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,432
What do you want me to say?

178
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,416
Am I your “bestie”?

179
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,936
You out of your mind?

180
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,688
You want me to say that out loud?

181
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:01,744
It’s freaking embarrassing.

182
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:02,328
Embarrassing?

183
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,688
There’s just the four of us.

184
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:04,504
This has gotta be a joke.

185
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,992
No way!

186
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,040
Fine! Forget it!

187
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:06,864
Funny. Funny.

188
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,024
Let’s just celebrate.

189
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,416
Let’s clink our chickens.

190
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,680
- One, two, three. - Celebrate.

191
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,704
- Cheers! - Cheers!

192
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:51,016
You already know what to do, don’t you?

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,600
What does that mean?

194
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,944
Go.

195
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:58,800
Ozone will be safe.

196
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,808
You scared me.

197
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,208
I know your brain is working hard, Day.

198
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
Aren’t you a know-it-all?

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,632
Don’t stress yourself.

200
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,192
Just go to bed.

201
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,768
I’ll be along in a minute.

202
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,088
Come on, know-it-all.

203
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,072
It’s sleeping time.

204
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:48,224
Good.

205
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,528
Hop in, Ozone.

206
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,552
This should be here.

207
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,056
Here.

208
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,304
Here.

209
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Here.

210
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,180
And here.

211
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,120
This goes here.

212
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I’ll try my best

213
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,768
to figure out what to do tomorrow.

214
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
But you will be safe, Ozone.

215
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:17,832
I…

216
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,392
I… I have something to say.

217
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,390
Go on.

218
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,656
If, tomorrow, I am…

219
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,376
dead.

220
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,888
No, Ozone...

221
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,568
I…

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,848
I’ll have you know

223
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,216
it’s not your fault, Day.

224
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,344
You… You have taken care of me very well.

225
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,160
Thank you so much, Day.

226
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,896
If I…

227
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,384
If something…

228
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,072
happened to me,

229
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,064
you must not punish yourself.

230
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,888
It’s not your fault.

231
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,896
You did your best.

232
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,280
I…

233
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,520
I…

234
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,072
I love you, Day.

235
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:44,488
I love you, too.

236
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,888
If I could die for you,

237
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,728
I would.

238
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:52,104
No, no.

239
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:52,840
No.

240
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:53,648
No.

241
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:55,336
Stay together.

242
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,910
Stay.

243
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
What is it?

244
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Night.

245
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
For you.

246
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,664
I’ve been keeping this journal since our high school days.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,552
Since I met you.

248
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,896
You… should keep it.

249
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,592
This has been my most favorite time of my life.

250
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,100
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW YOU.

251
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,456
MR. FROWN! DOES HE KNOW HOW TO SMILE?

252
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460
No.

253
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,064
I won’t ever read it alone.

254
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,664
I won’t let you read it alone, either.

255
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,320
I’ll only read it

256
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,752
when you’re by my side like this.

257
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,840
I know that.

258
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,584
But...

259
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:43,728
No “but.”

260
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,696
Everything will be alright.

261
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,648
Don’t worry.

262
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:55,050
It’s not me I worry about.

263
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,880
It’s you.

264
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Night.

265
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,984
If something happened,

266
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,576
something out of the plan happened,

267
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,464
I just want you to know that it’s not your fault.

268
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,360
And know that I’ll be happy

269
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,464
no matter where I am

270
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,200
or how this turns out,

271
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,488
as long as you’re happy, too.

272
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,472
But then again,

273
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:49,336
if you ever find yourself a new girlfriend,

274
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:51,820
I’ll be haunting her every day.

275
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:53,112
Wow.

276
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,664
Let’s say, I heard you.

277
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,880
But you will be alright.

278
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,080
Definitely.

279
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,752
And I won’t have a new girlfriend for you to haunt.

280
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,848
Please know that.

281
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,248
I do now.

282
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,712
Read it.

283
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,264
I’m right here by your side.

284
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,344
BE HAPPY FROM NOW ON. YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT. OZONE AND I THREW A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR NIGHT AND DAY TODAY.

285
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Oh?

286
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,368
Can’t sleep, either?

287
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,490
Yeah.

288
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,608
Did you figure out what Ozone said

289
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,552
about how you know what to do?

290
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,728
No.

291
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,730
Yeah.

292
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:53,900
I’ve been turning it over in my head,

293
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,880
and I can’t come up with anything.

294
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,352
Was that all you saw when you were there?

295
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah.

296
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,168
I feel like something is missing.

297
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,064
It doesn’t feel...

298
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:08,088
Right.

299
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:09,968
Yeah.

300
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,584
You feel the same, don’t you,

301
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,020
that we’re heading in the wrong direction?

302
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
Yeah.

303
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,688
I’ve been thinking about Ozone’s dreams.

304
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,376
But I honestly don’t know what they mean.

305
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,168
FEBRUARY 29, 2024

306
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,710
Ozone.

307
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Ready?

308
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,670
Yeah.

309
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,592
Tell Dad he needs to sleep more properly.

310
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,590
Don’t work so hard.

311
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,848
I’ll be rich after I graduate.

312
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,072
I’ll support you all back home.

313
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,176
But you guys gotta take care of yourselves for now.

314
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,616
Have good food and think about me sometimes.

315
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,376
Oh, Mom, I sent you some vitamins.

316
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,328
Take a photo of them when you got them

317
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:06,536
so you know which brand to buy.

318
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,264
In case I forget them later,

319
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,128
you’ll still be able to find them by yourself.

320
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,840
Tell Dad not to stay in the sun too long.

321
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,576
Take better care of yourselves.

322
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,440
I can’t always be there to look after you, you know?

323
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Yeah.

324
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:51,688
I’m sorry I don’t always text back right away.

325
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,416
That’s why I’m calling you.

326
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,456
I really miss you.

327
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,560
I have to go now, though.

328
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,104
I have to go to class.

329
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,736
I have to get dressed and all that.

330
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,528
I’ll…

331
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,488
I’ll call you again when I have time.

332
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,424
Bye, Mom.

333
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,384
You’re up.

334
00:24:01,712 --> 00:24:02,712
Dream.

335
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,808
I’m sorry.

336
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,496
What are you apologizing for?

337
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,552
I’ll be fine, right?

338
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,880
I would never let anything happen to you.

339
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,090
Ready?

340
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,376
Don’t be afraid, Dream.

341
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,584
Don’t be scared, Ozone.

342
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:05,900
You’ll be back in a bit, alright?

343
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,672
I’ll be right by your side at all times.

344
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,080
You will be back.

345
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,400
Don’t be scared.

346
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Start the timer.

347
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,776
If you really are here…

348
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,520
Either the day or the night needs to disappear.

349
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
What?

350
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,192
Either the day or the night needs to disappear.

351
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,896
Either the day or the night needs to disappear.

352
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,510
What?

353
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,992
Ozone’s vitals are back.

354
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,896
Impossible.

355
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
No.

356
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,624
What do we do?

357
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:55,504
Give him more medication?

358
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:56,112
No.

359
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:58,128
He can’t take any more doses.

360
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,824
It’ll ruin his nervous system and paralyze him.

361
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,528
But what–what did we do wrong?

362
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,464
How did this happen?

363
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:07,616
Doc, his vitals are getting stronger.

364
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,616
She’s back, too.

365
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,776
Day. Day. Day.

366
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,056
Day, what are you doing?

367
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,536
Without us, Leap Day doesn’t exist.

368
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,680
If we love them,

369
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,896
they die.

370
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:39,488
Without us,

371
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,232
they will survive.

372
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,552
What are you doing?

373
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,136
This is too dangerous!

374
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:50,296
Professor, once the time comes,

375
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:52,704
please bring Ozone and Dream back.

376
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:54,700
He and I still have some time.

377
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,592
We’ll be in your care.

378
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,216
Ozone!

379
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,570
Ozone!

380
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Day.

381
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,550
Dream?

382
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Dream!

383
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
Dream!

384
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,848
Day!

385
00:29:32,832 --> 00:29:34,830
Night… Night!

386
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,930
Dream!

387
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,136
Ozone!

388
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,392
Ozone!

389
00:29:49,424 --> 00:29:50,424
Ozone!

390
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,152
Day.

391
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,968
Day.

392
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
- Night! - Dream!

393
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Dream!

394
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,880
- Night! - Dream!

395
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,584
Dream, come on.

396
00:29:58,808 --> 00:29:59,896
Get up.

397
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,352
- Ozone. - Day. Day!

398
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:03,520
Are you okay?

399
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,184
The game is back on.

400
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,528
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

401
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,288
I’m okay.

402
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:18,784
But I can’t find Ozone.

403
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,448
Where is Day?

404
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,296
I don’t see him, either.

405
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,340
I don’t see anyone.

406
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,112
The shadows are creeping in.

407
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,880
Night and Dream are behind that dune.

408
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,512
Day and Ozone are over there.

409
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,890
Go.

410
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,610
Let’s go.

411
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,496
Let’s go, Ozone.

412
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Let’s go to them.

413
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,710
Day.

414
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,352
Ozone will be alright.

415
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Let’s go.

416
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,232
Are you all alright?

417
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,352
Yes.

418
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,504
Are you?

419
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,192
Let’s get Ozone and Dream out of here.

420
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,770
Over there.

421
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,928
Hurry up.

422
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,912
Sorry. I’m sorry.

423
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:29,920
Sorry. Sorry.

424
00:31:29,944 --> 00:31:30,680
- Ozone! - Sorry.

425
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:31,904
- Ozone, we have to go. - Sorry.

426
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:32,808
- Hurry up! - I’m sorry.

427
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,472
Ozone, come on.

428
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:33,864
No.

429
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,432
- Hurry up. - No.

430
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:35,304
No. No.

431
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,896
- Ozone, you have to go! - No, I shouldn’t have come here.

432
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:38,832
Ozone, come on.

433
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:40,830
Either the day or the night will disappear.

434
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,064
What do you mean, Ozone?

435
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,664
We can’t all go back.

436
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,400
Either you or me, Night,

437
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,880
have to stay behind.

438
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,864
This plan…

439
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,120
It wasn’t for Ozone or Dream from the beginning.

440
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,432
It wasn’t for our loved ones.

441
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,744
This plan…

442
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:29,880
is for us.

443
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,616
When did you know?

444
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,056
I wasn’t sure until just now,

445
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,136
when Ozone and Dream almost woke up.

446
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,432
I told Ozone yesterday that I would die in his place if I could.

447
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,344
It makes sense.

448
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,640
You and I have Leap Day.

449
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,320
You’re the night.

450
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,160
I’m the day.

451
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,376
Without one of us,

452
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,224
Leap Day is no longer complete.

453
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,944
Everyone we love will be safe.

454
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Crap.

455
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
What?

456
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,968
No. No.

457
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,986
- No. No. - Night, this isn’t what we talked about!

458
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,632
I don’t want it! No!

459
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:34,192
Night, please.

460
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:35,320
Listen to me.

461
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,376
This isn’t what we talked about!

462
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,376
- Ozone. - No. No.

463
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:38,784
- You have to go. - No!

464
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,568
Ozone, please.

465
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,936
You have to go.

466
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,968
Take Ozone and Dream and get out of here.

467
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,880
I’m not going!

468
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,120
Take care of my brother.

469
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,728
What are you talking about?

470
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:56,552
What the hell are you talking about?

471
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,024
You take them back.

472
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,024
You take them back!

473
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,888
It’s too late!

474
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,408
What did you do?

475
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,376
I overdosed.

476
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,208
I would have been bedridden anyway if I went back.

477
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:39,110
I wouldn’t be able to take care of anyone.

478
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,888
No.

479
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,952
You overdosed?

480
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,848
Why...

481
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Why?

482
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,424
Why did you do it, Day?

483
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,432
Why did you do it?

484
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:51,584
Why did you do it!

485
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:54,752
Day…

486
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:57,184
Ozone.

487
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,768
It’s alright now.

488
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,664
You’ll be safe.

489
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
Alright?

490
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,620
Please?

491
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
No.

492
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:06,248
No.

493
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,210
I have no one else left.

494
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:24,072
Hurry up and get Dream and Ozone out of here.

495
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,752
This time…

496
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:30,940
Don’t hold the elevator for me.

497
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
You jerk.

498
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,210
Friends.

499
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,392
Love you, man.

500
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:05,488
Lame as hell.

501
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Give him to me.

502
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,496
No! No!

503
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:11,464
- Ozone! - No!

504
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,856
Night, get Dream out of here first!

505
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,208
I’ll go get him!

506
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Hurry up!

507
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,432
Dream, let’s go.

508
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:20,464
Let’s go!

509
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,824
Doc!

510
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:51,432
Need your help over here!

511
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
Dream.

512
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,672
Dream. Dream.

513
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:58,696
Dream, are you alright?

514
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,920
Day… What about Day?

515
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:14,832
No…

516
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,552
Day. Day.

517
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,520
Doc, I need your help.

518
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,890
Crap.

519
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,800
Day, wake the hell up.

520
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,464
Ozone.

521
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:49,376
Ozone.

522
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,384
Ozone.

523
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,744
Ozone, listen to me.

524
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:53,592
You have to go back.

525
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,880
If you don’t go,

526
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,080
I will have died for nothing.

527
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
But…

528
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,350
But we have to stay together.

529
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,744
Where you are is where I’ll be.

530
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,176
We have to be together,

531
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,904
like chopsticks.

532
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,208
I’ll always be with you.

533
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,992
I promise.

534
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Mercury.

535
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
Venus.

536
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Earth.

537
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,856
Mars.

538
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
Jupiter.

539
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,856
Do you remember what comes after that?

540
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,576
- Saturn. - Saturn.

541
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,816
Uranus.

542
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,528
Neptune.

543
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,576
Mercury.

544
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:01,408
Mercury.

545
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:02,232
Venus.

546
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,160
Venus.

547
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:04,056
Earth.

548
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,856
Earth.

549
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:05,744
Mars.

550
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,824
Mars.

551
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,952
Jupiter.

552
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:08,984
Jupiter.

553
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:09,832
Saturn.

554
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:10,608
Saturn.

555
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,456
Uranus.

556
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:12,504
Uranus.

557
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,400
Neptune.

558
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:14,432
Neptune.

559
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:15,768
Mercury.

560
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:16,456
Mercury.

561
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,104
Venus.

562
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Venus.

563
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,904
- Earth. - Earth.

564
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,440
- Mars. - Mars.

565
00:39:21,672 --> 00:39:22,944

…Neptune.

570
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,168
Mercury.

571
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:29,920
Mercury.

572
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,440

Venus.

574
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,248

Hey!

623
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,176
What are you doing, Ozone?

624
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,880
I’m giving you stars.

625
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:52,040
But why does it have to be on my face?

626
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,520
You get a star, too, now!

627
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,112
That’s your prize.

628
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,576
Well, you want more?

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,176
Here’s one more.

Fine. We’ll go.

632
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,888
But you have to listen to every word I say, alright?

633
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:34,660
No acting out.

634
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,776
We go home when I say we go home.

635
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Ready!

636
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,472
Dinner is ready.

637
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,536
Look.

638
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,200
We’re back, Ozone.

639
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,288
Thank you.

640
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:17,112

00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:18,528
Let’s trade.

642
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,864
I got you some dessert.

643
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,896
A whole bagful, too.

644
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Oh?

645
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,880
You… You did well today.

646
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,096
You got one star.

647
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,528

655
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,376
How are you guys doing?

00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,560
Hey there.

657
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,856
How have you been?

Drawing.

660
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:15,136

Let us buy you dinner tonight.

662
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:36,380
(You might have heard this too many times before.)

663
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,840
(The stars in the sky, )

664
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,888
(even when you can’t see them doesn’t mean they’re gone.)

665
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,008
(I’m living not unlike those stars right now)

666
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,010
(in order to protect my most beloved.)

667
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,872
I… miss you, Day.

668
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,608
(Because of the shadows in the desert last Leap Day, )

669
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,872
(I now can’t go back to living my old life.)

670
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,992
(But at least I get to be in this world, )

671
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:28,170
(on the same planet with my loved ones.)

672
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,808
(No matter how big it is…)

673
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,888
Here it is.

674
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,104
(We will always feel each other’s presence.)

675
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,384
Ozone, will you please blow out the candles for Day?

676
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,176
Let’s sing.

677
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,200
Alright.

678
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,632

(The night will look out for him.)

00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,264
I’ll take good care of Ozone.

683
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,048
I promise.

684
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,512
(And the day will be there waiting for him every morning.)

(- Still, I hope…) - …Neptune.

695
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,984
(that one day)

696
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,912
- Mercury… (- …we’ll see each other again.)

697
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:01,496

Right now,

706
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:23,470
