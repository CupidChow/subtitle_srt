1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,250
For Leap Day to occur,

2
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:05,956
one child is born at midnight of February 29

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:11,178
while another at midday of February 29 of the same year.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,960
The two children would share the same Leap Day.

5
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:18,036
The other way is by transmission.

6
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:19,356
Yes.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,349
I transmitted Leap Day to you two.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,552
You killed my family?

9
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:25,687
I will help you.

10
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:26,843
It’s easy.

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,840
I did it and it worked.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,327
You can keep Dream safe.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,847
Are you out of your mind?

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,626
It’s as good as murdering people.

15
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,760
Don’t you realize that?

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,610
You know what we’ve been through.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,443
You want someone else to live that same fate?

18
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:44,261
Would you rather we keep living like this?

19
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,090
Would you rather we keep letting people die for us?

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,960
Use your head!

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,221
Yeah!

22
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:56,330
At least we’ll be able to keep who we love safe!

23
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:57,963
Who cares what’s become of other people?

24
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,374
You wanna save everyone else

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,138
while all your loved ones are dead?

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Is that what you want?

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,072
Stupid.

28
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,909
Are you gonna be a doctor who murders people?

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,458
What does that have to do with you?

30
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,054
You jerk!

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,185
You wanna do this?

32
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:49,629
Use your head!

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,381
Dad!

34
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,469
Hurry up! I’m late!

35
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,745
Dad, can you please hurry up?

36
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:46,880
I’m late.

37
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:47,352
Okay, okay.

38
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:48,574
You’re way too worried.

39
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:49,912
It’s only 5.30. I’ll drive fast.

40
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,200
I don’t want to miss my exam.

41
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,581
You’re too slow, old man.

42
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:53,134
We’re leaving.

43
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:54,156
Honey.

44
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,418
Your lunch.

45
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,749
Thank you.

46
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:00,036
I’ll see you tonight.

47
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:01,090
You guys gonna take forever?

48
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,385
I really am going to be late.

49
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:03,709
Would you look at your daughter?

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,752
Let’s get going, shall we?

51
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:06,952
Bye, Mom.

52
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:07,989
Bye.

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,123
Dad, who is that?

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,981
Do you know him?

55
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,447
Hey, doc.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Doc?

57
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,310
Doc?

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,123
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,883
I just got back from the temple.

60
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,570
You’re dropping your daughter off at school?

61
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,390
Are you going to the hospital next?

62
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,214
Can I tag along?

63
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,250
Or should I wait here at your house?

64
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
Well?

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,149
He’s a friend of mine, dear.

66
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,010
Say hello.

67
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,916
Hello.

68
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Hello.

69
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,618
Day.

70
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,360
Day!

71
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,407
- Ozone?
- Day!

72
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:01,207
- Ozone?
- Day!

73
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,854
- Ozone?
- Day!

74
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,647
Ozone, what’s wrong?

75
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:03,789
What’s wrong?

76
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,149
You–You…

77
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:07,338
You killed Night.

78
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,632
You killed Night.

79
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:09,432
You killed Night.

80
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:10,116
Calm down.

81
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:11,512
- Calm down.
- You killed Night.

82
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,196
- You had a bad dream?
- You killed Night.

83
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,734
Slow down.

84
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,770
It was just a dream.

85
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:16,858
You’re awake now.

86
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,916
Why would I kill him?

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,978
We’re friends.

88
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,014
Am I right?

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,818
It was just a dream.

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,538
Why don’t you get up and get dressed?

91
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:29,869
We’re going to see Night.

92
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Alright?

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,040
We’ll see our friends.

94
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,083
Yes.

95
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,310
Alright.

96
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,730
My towel.

97
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,010
Ozone!

98
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,876
Either your mother or I will come pick you up from school.

99
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,625
If this guy shows up,

100
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,789
don’t go with him.

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,250
Call the police, even.

102
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,661
Your father is joking, of course.

103
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:13,698
I’m serious.

104
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,883
Should I just call them now?

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,589
No need.

106
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
It’s alright.

107
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:22,847
Just go.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,694
Alright.

109
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,785
Bye, Dad.

110
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,640
Goodbye.

111
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,745
Bye.

112
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,214
Does your daughter want to be a doctor, too?

113
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,309
Does she know her daddy is a scumbag of a doctor?

114
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,381
Leave my family alone.

115
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,661
You don’t care when it’s someone else’s family, though.

116
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:58,140
I am working to fix it.

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,167
Stay out of my way.

118
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,509
Do you really think

119
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,901
a child whose family you murdered

120
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:06,130
would take your side?

121
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,629
Are you out of your mind?

122
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,952
You think he’d choose to live the way you do?

123
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,847
Rent a ratty old place near my house

124
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,850
just to see how happy I am.

125
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Love someone and they’re as good as dead.

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,334
No building a family.

127
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,323
No future.

128
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:30,676
Just a promise of a lonely death.

129
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,112
You save everyone,

130
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,785
except the ones you love.

131
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
It’s this room.

132
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,025
Ozone wanted to visit.

133
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,269
I’m here with him.

134
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,090
We can talk, too.

135
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,923
You had breakfast?

136
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:35,952
I bought you some congee.

137
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,785
I’m not really hungry.

138
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,363
Thanks, though.

139
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Day.

140
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,876
Can I talk to you outside?

141
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Dream.

142
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,883
I got you…

143
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,861
a sticker.

144
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,865
Wake up and play with me soon.

145
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,990
Dream.

146
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,072
Wake up.

147
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,316
Are you cold?

148
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,320
I’ll cover you up.

149
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,083
How is Dream doing?

150
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,749
What did Kit tell you?

151
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,850
What about Wiwat?

152
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,581
What did he tell you?

153
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,861
If you go on with your evil method,

154
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,010
I’m going to expose you.

155
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,745
Your daughter will be the first to know.

156
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,640
Have a good day, doc.

157
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,876
You probably already know

158
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,778
what Professor Wiwat did.

159
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,338
And I sure hope

160
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,363
you won’t go down the same path.

161
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,312
What’s your solution, then?

162
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,101
What does Kit propose?

163
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Huh?

164
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,570
What’s a way out that works,

165
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,869
that doesn’t end with Dream lying there like that again?

166
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40,465
That doesn’t put a razor in Ozone’s mouth?

167
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,189
If you’re still cluelessly looking like you are now,

168
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:46,890
don’t you dare expect me not to do anything.

169
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,610
Don’t you care at all

170
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,687
that it was Wiwat who put us here in the first place?

171
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:53,374
It already happened.

172
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,687
There’s nothing we can do to reverse it.

173
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,287
But now…

174
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,607
He’s helping us.

175
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,898
The only reason he wants to help

176
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,498
is because he did this to us!

177
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,345
What will you have me do?

178
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,865
We have never been able to save a single soul.

179
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,870
But now we know how.

180
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,883
It doesn’t matter who will teach us.

181
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,756
What matters is that

182
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,734
the people you love

183
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:23,472
don’t die again.

184
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,716
But who else will die?

185
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,066
Which children will have to live the lives we’ve been living.

186
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,749
A dead mom, and then a dead dad,

187
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,352
and then a whole lot of dead relatives.

188
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,876
By the time that child is our age,

189
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,392
five people will have been dead.

190
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,590
And in order to evade Leap Day,

191
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,910
you need two babies.

192
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,061
All in all, there will be 10 dead bodies.

193
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,861
And If I was actually in on this,

194
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,534
that’d make 20 deaths.

195
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,134
So you are okay

196
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,189
with Ozone dying instead of those 20 people?

197
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,432
Dream just woke up.

198
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,156
Dream.

199
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,723
Dream, how are you feeling?

200
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,861
He–He saved you.

201
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,450
How are you feeling?

202
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,676
Are you in pain?

203
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:13,650
I’m really sorry.

204
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,156
I’m okay.

205
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,694
She’s awake,

206
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,232
but it’s best not to move much.

207
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,450
She still has internal bleeding,

208
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:23,614
in several places.

209
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,250
Talking is difficult enough.

210
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,854
I suggest a long bed rest at the hospital.

211
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,898
But you don’t have to worry about anything anymore.

212
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,810
We found a way to fix Leap Day.

213
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,527
From now on, you will never have to get hurt again.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,029
Let’s go, Ozone.

215
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,832
Kit is waiting downstairs.

216
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,869
He probably wants to know

217
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:04,520
if you could talk Night out of it.

218
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,690
He’s not exactly a good person.

219
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,989
You know he wants to use you and Night

220
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:14,203
to exact revenge on me.

221
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,858
I’m not exactly a good person, either.

222
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:22,400
You know that already.

223
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,749
But I have a solution

224
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,530
and I’m here to help.

225
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,323
It’s nothing, Dream.

226
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,406
We need to go to your place as soon as possible.

227
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,941
We need to find a solution to Leap Day.

228
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,287
That means Night…

229
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,200
chose to believe that jerk?

230
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,618
For now.

231
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,145
I’m not letting you die.

232
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,883
I won’t trade you for anything.

233
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,025
There has to be a way nobody has to get hurt.

234
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,112
Give me some time, Ozone,

235
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
Okay.

236
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,861
I can wait.

237
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:43,378
Let’s go.

238
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,189
I need at least one nurse here at all times.

239
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,499
Come by to check on her every hour

240
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:57,665
in case she needs anything.

241
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,796
I will write you a letter of recommendation

242
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,483
once the job is done.

243
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,054
Of course, Professor.

244
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,880
Don’t you act up now.

245
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:07,990
Just stay still

246
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,214
so you can recover quickly.

247
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,603
Stay with Dream for the week.

248
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,047
We’ll start next week.

249
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,869
Don’t worry.

250
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,323
We have time.

251
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,018
You wouldn’t be able to focus on anything now anyway.

252
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,952
I’ve talked to the doctors and nurses here for you.

253
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,710
Thank you.

254
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,145
Professor Wiwat really has Leap Day, just like we thought.

255
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:53,883
But he’s cured.

256
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,876
He has a solution.

257
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,509
He will help us.

258
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,930
Don’t worry about a thing, Dream.

259
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,589
Once you’re better,

260
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,276
I’ll tell you everything.

261
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,461
Well, shall we watch something to lighten up?

262
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,460
I’ll even sit through the cartoon you love so much.

263
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,029
Can you explain to me again

264
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,890
what you told me before?

265
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,589
In simplest terms…

266
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:01,330
Dead.

267
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,130
Dead.

268
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:02,981
Dead.

269
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,796
Dead.

270
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:04,472
Dead.

271
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,538
Every contradicting thing

272
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:09,090
could begin from the same source.

273
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,069
Dead. Dead. Dead.

274
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Dead.

275
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,447
Dead. Dead. Dead.

276
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:20,254
Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead.

277
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,290
Dead. Dead. Dead.

278
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,334
Dead.

279
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,072
The day and the night, for example.

280
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,796
Before the Big Bang,

281
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,490
they coexisted.

282
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Short.

283
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,130
Long.

284
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Long.

285
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,770
Short.

286
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,218
Day.

287
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:43,141
Day.

288
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:44,163
Day.

289
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,290
This drawing has to do with Leap Day.

290
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,618
DAY

291
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Yeah?

292
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,540
I need to talk to you about something.

293
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,552
Should I go...

294
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,876
Don’t come here.

295
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,669
I’ll see you on campus.

296
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Night.

297
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,360
Just say what you’re here to say.

298
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,785
Look.

299
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:11,527
Ozone just drew this today.

300
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,876
It definitely has something to do with Leap Day.

301
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,036
Ozone was mumbling something like,

302
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,672
“Short, long, long, short.”

303
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,310
Take a look.

304
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,225
Look.

305
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,869
I don’t have time to decode your brother’s doodles.

306
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,843
There’s nothing to decode here.

307
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:34,640
Don’t you see?

308
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,658
There are six stars in the drawing.

309
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:41,803
I believe the stars represent the six of us.

310
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:45,505
The other two here must be Wiwat and Kit.

311
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,854
The six of us can work this out.

312
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:48,876
Trust me.

313
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,190
How?

314
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,705
I don’t know how right now.

315
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,240
But I believe there is a way.

316
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,854
Listen to me, Day.

317
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,501
I can help you.

318
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,883
Let me help you.

319
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,338
I can’t do it, bud.

320
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,830
You won’t be able to save anyone.

321
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,861
Is that what you want?

322
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,312
I will.

323
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,080
I will save everyone.

324
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:43,614
I will save you, too.

325
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Like you did for your family?

326
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,112
You call that “saving”?

327
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,163
What the hell was that for?

328
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:52,272
What you gonna do about it?

329
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:53,810
If you just let me help,

330
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:55,527
I’m sure I can keep everyone safe.

331
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,407
You know damn well,

332
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,905
all these times,

333
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:03,476
you weren’t able to save a single soul.

334
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:06,909
What a freaking waste of time.

335
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Night!

336
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Jerk!

337
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,418
Day!

338
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Night!

339
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,810
Stop it!

340
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:42,327
Stop!

341
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:43,200
Stop!

342
00:23:43,236 --> 00:23:43,978
Stop!

343
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:44,487
Stop!

344
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:45,083
Stop!

345
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:46,305
Day, Night, stop it!

346
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:46,858
Stop!

347
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:47,330
Stop!

348
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:47,716
Stop!

349
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,632
Stop!

350
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:49,767
Stop!

351
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,545
Stop!

352
00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:51,589
Stop!

353
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:52,898
Night!

354
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,203
Wait, wait.

355
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:07,218
Wait.

356
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,420
Wait, wait.

357
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,630
Wait.

358
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:15,956
It’s okay, Ozone.

359
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,214
I got it.

360
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,196
No.

361
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:19,578
I can do it.

362
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,218
Then, use this.

363
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,829
With this.

364
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,170
Okay?

365
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,225
Thank you so much.

366
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:53,418
You’re hurt.

367
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:54,447
You’re hurt.

368
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,270
I’m fine.

369
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,425
Does it hurt?

370
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,123
It’s okay.

371
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,280
Stay around here for now.

372
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,370
Of course.

373
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,549
Careful.

374
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,590
Thanks.

375
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,654
Here’s some snacks.

376
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,618
I got all your favorites.

377
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:02,181
I’ll put the medicines over here.

378
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,869
Take them on time.

379
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,854
Those are your pillows and blanket.

380
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,861
Let me help you settle in.

381
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,163
Hold on.

382
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,883
I’ll arrange your medicines like this.

383
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,088
Just make sure to take them on time.

384
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:29,658
Let me grab you some water.

385
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:30,709
Night.

386
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,116
What happened?

387
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,545
It’s nothing.

388
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,912
There will be a housekeeper here daily.

389
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:43,549
I’ve paid for everything.

390
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,410
Just tell them what you want and stay put.

391
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,756
I have to see Professor Wiwat...

392
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,596
Night, you’re changing the subject.

393
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,927
What exactly happened?

394
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,374
Who did this to you?

395
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,152
I got into a fight with Day.

396
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,938
But there’s nothing to worry about now.

397
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:01,534
Everything’s cleared up...

398
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,712
What was it about?

399
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,397
Was it so bad you had to use your fists?

400
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:05,309
What really happened?

401
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:05,905
Why won’t you tell me...

402
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,178
Just don’t ask questions!

403
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,494
Take care of yourself.

404
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,963
Call me if you need anything.

405
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,283
I’ll be home late.

406
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:25,876
LECTURE ROOM 7

407
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,705
What are you doing here?

408
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,352
I’m here to see you.

409
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,130
See me?

410
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:45,705
Why?

411
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:52,810
You hurt Day.

412
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,334
You need to apologize to Day.

413
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,890
And don’t do what Wiwat says.

414
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,323
Where is Day?

415
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
In class.

416
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,181
Go to him.

417
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,661
Do you want anything to happen to you?

418
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:31,890
Go back to him.

419
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,190
Ozone?

420
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,858
Keep an eye on him.

421
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,425
Night, apologize.

422
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,538
Ozone, it’s okay.

423
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,414
No.

424
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,629
Day and night must stick together.

425
00:29:10,974 --> 00:29:11,447
Night.

426
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,501
It’s okay, Ozone.

427
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Let him go.

428
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,436
There needs to be six people.

429
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,040
You’re late.

430
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,250
I’m sorry.

431
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,723
Did you read the study I sent you?

432
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:34,752
Yes.

433
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,259
Any parts you don’t understand?

434
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:37,283
No.

435
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,123
You did well on the test.

436
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,240
If you keep it up,

437
00:29:50,283 --> 00:29:52,363
you’ll be allowed to practice in a couple of months.

438
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,214
I’ll let you practice on models first,

439
00:29:57,236 --> 00:29:58,487
and then simulators.

440
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,596
You’ll have to come to my place to do that, though.

441
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,952
As for the first actual delivery,

442
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:09,400
you’ll be practicing at the hospital.

443
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,730
I will stay with you every step of the way.

444
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,080
So don’t worry.

445
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,110
Yes.

446
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,770
Work on this test today.

447
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,410
And…

448
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,792
Read this study.

449
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:38,745
Ozone.

450
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,105
Don’t go out of our plans like that again.

451
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,320
I don’t want you going missing another time.

452
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:45,910
And don’t get involved with Night anymore

453
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,123
unless I greenlight it.

454
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,225
Do not see him.

455
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:51,287
Do you understand?

456
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,829
It’s necessary.

457
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,840
I know it is.

458
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:01,556
But I’m working on it right now,

459
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,192
so don’t take this on yourself, alright?

460
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,403
Promise me

461
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,676
and I’ll buy you ice cream.

462
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,069
Okay.

463
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Let’s go.

464
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,221
Oh, Dream?

465
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,476
Why didn’t you just call me?

466
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:47,978
What are you doing?

467
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,374
You were gone the whole day.

468
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,774
Oh, I’m just working on some tests.

469
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:52,796
It’s nothing.

470
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:54,189
I don’t get one?

471
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,650
Oh…

472
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,149
This is from Professor Wiwat.

473
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,225
I think you should rest.

474
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,727
Shall we? I’ll walk you.

475
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:09,756
Hold on.

476
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,210
Night.

477
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,180
What’s going on?

478
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,974
You mentioned a solution to Leap Day,

479
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,280
but what is it?

480
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,436
Who gave you that bruise?

481
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:23,985
What are you hiding from me?

482
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,250
Okay.

483
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,550
Alright.

484
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,105
Sit down.

485
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,509
I’ll tell you.

486
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,694
So here’s the story:

487
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,334
The guy who kidnapped Ozone is Kit.

488
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,090
Kit shares his Leap Day with Professor Wiwat.

489
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,181
The solution to Leap Day

490
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,109
is by transmitting it to someone else.

491
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:25,410
Do whatever it takes for two babies to be born at midday and midnight

492
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,876
of February 29.

493
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,272
The way Day and I were born.

494
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
That’s it.

495
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,890
But Kit...

496
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:37,290
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

497
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,938
If you knew this was the way,

498
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,720
why did you put up with him?

499
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:42,589
Did he hurt you?

500
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:43,890
Let’s go to the police.

501
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:46,065
Let’s go to the Dean or whatever.

502
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,160
But Kit refused to use this solution.

503
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,734
Because he doesn’t want to hurt anyone.

504
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,883
And so all his loved ones are dead.

505
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Night.

506
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,578
Come on.

507
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,950
No.

508
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,167
Listen to me.

509
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,945
He killed your family.

510
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,458
Would you do that to...

511
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,323
Enough.

512
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:30,741
I don’t need to hear it twice.

513
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,330
I'm capable of understanding such simple logic.

514
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,287
But I’ve chosen to neglect it, Dream.

515
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,472
I choose you.

516
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:45,350
I don’t care who doesn’t agree with me.

517
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
But you have to.

518
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Hold on.

519
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,810
Night.

520
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,072
If you choose to do that,

521
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:00,730
please don’t say you choose it for me.

522
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,770
I don’t want it.

523
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,450
Dream, hear me out.

524
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:07,910
You have to be realistic.

525
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,294
Realistic?

526
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,614
You can’t let multiple people die in my place.

527
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Look.

528
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,730
I don’t want to die.

529
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,272
But I believe, Night, that there is another way.

530
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:27,527
There is no better way.

531
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,134
It's a risk we gotta take.

532
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,785
I mean it.

533
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,938
How can you be sure there’s no other way?

534
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,876
I don’t know about that.

535
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,465
But I don’t have time for it.

536
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:49,214
How many times have I watched you on your deathbed?

537
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:50,974
I never knew if you’d wake up.

538
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,030
Dream.

539
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,538
Trust me on this.

540
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,967
I’ve thought it through.

541
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,640
What about Day?

542
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,858
Did he know about this?

543
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:06,780
Who do you think gave me this bruise?

544
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,310
Night.

545
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,334
We’re through.

546
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Dream.

547
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:33,750
If that’s your solution,

548
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,218
I’m breaking up with you.

549
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:37,905
Dream.

550
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,098
Please don’t do this.

551
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:40,741
Please, don’t.

552
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:41,345
No.

553
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:42,381
Yes.

554
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,465
Then choose me.

555
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,770
Dream.

556
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,890
Just get back to your life.

557
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,916
Live a happy life.

558
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,541
I will choose to do this anyway.

559
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,854
I can’t stop loving you.

560
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,070
Come in.

561
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,981
You’re early.

562
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Professor.

563
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,356
Can you leave Night alone?

564
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,509
You know now, don’t you?

565
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,130
Can you leave Night alone?

566
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:14,581
Dream, listen...

567
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,072
If I promise to keep my mouth shut about what you did,

568
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,363
do you promise to leave Night alone?

569
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,174
Are you threatening me?

570
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,087
Am I?

571
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,898
You should spend the time you’re wasting on this conversation

572
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,454
being with Night.

573
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,552
Be there for him

574
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,701
because he’s doing something difficult for your sake.

575
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,796
Does your wife stay by your side at a time like this?

576
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,341
Or is she in the dark, even now?

577
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,970
Dream.

578
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,592
What are you doing here?

579
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,672
Will you leave Night alone, Professor?

580
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,647
Dream, stop it.

581
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Night.

582
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,905
Do you want us to stop?

583
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,430
No.

584
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,890
Dream.

585
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:10,356
Dream.

586
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:11,745
- Let go.
- Hear me out.

587
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Don’t think.

588
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,672
Don’t falter.

589
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:21,738
Just know you’re doing this for her.

590
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,930
Coming.

591
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,996
Oh, Dream?

592
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,254
How are you feeling?

593
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,770
Dream!

594
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,221
Why the long face?

595
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,654
I know about Wiwat now.

596
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:21,338
I think we need to find another solution to Leap Day.

597
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,534
Once we find a way,

598
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,778
Night will…

599
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:26,232
That’s exactly what I think.

600
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,400
We need to stop Night and Wiwat.

601
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,763
But here’s the thing…

602
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,352
It’s not easy, Dream.

603
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,116
Ever since you got in the accident,

604
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:40,007
Kit and I…

605
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:41,250
And Ozone!

606
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,200
…and Ozone have been working to find another solution.

607
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:50,509
There’s a new drawing by Ozone on Leap Day.

608
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,741
But still, we have no clues,

609
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,814
except for the fact that Kit and Wiwat will likely be there

610
00:41:56,843 --> 00:41:58,600
on the next Leap Day.

611
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,185
Can we go meet Kit?

612
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:07,898
And will you let me see Ozone’s drawing?

613
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:12,210
I will grab the drawing.

614
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,792
I’m sorry about you and Night.

615
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,349
I’m sorry.

616
00:42:56,923 --> 00:42:58,920
If I didn’t take Ozone away,

617
00:42:59,658 --> 00:43:02,018
you might not have to go through anything like that at all.

618
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:03,341
It’s okay.

619
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,890
Nobody ever meant for this to happen.

620
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,549
I think we should focus on finding a solution for Leap Day.

621
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,516
This is everything I have on February 29-born people.

622
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,643
Ozone, why don’t you show him the drawing?

623
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,592
Your drawing.

624
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:28,065
These are the accidents that happened on the same days.

625
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,669
Here.

626
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,145
Ozone drew these.

627
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:46,149
I’m sure they have something to do with Leap Day.

628
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Wrong.

629
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,047
Make sure you do it right.

630
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:02,076
Do it again.

631
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,540
Focus.

632
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,610
Wrong.

633
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,865
Get yourself together, Night.

634
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,530
Yes.

635
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,250
Wrong!

636
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Wrong.

637
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
Wrong.

638
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:54,950
Night.

639
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:57,156
Pull yourself together.

640
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,418
Night, you’re not here at all.

641
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,938
Make sure you’re more ready tomorrow.

642
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,940
Yes.

643
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,381
That’s it for today.

644
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Oh, hey…

645
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,790
Are you hungry?

646
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,996
Join us for dinner.

647
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Come on.

648
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,650
Oh.

649
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,560
Are you finished, honey?

650
00:45:43,192 --> 00:45:45,190
I made dinner.

651
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,710
Thank you.

652
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,610
You should sit back and relax.

653
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,796
I’ll handle the rest.

654
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,003
Okay.

655
00:45:51,025 --> 00:45:53,316
Our daughter is doing homework at the dining table.

656
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,712
Hi, dear.

657
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,890
You must be his favorite student.

658
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,734
He never let anyone practice here before.

659
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,570
I’ll be in your care.

660
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,341
It’s nice having young people around some time.

661
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,890
He gets to lighten up a bit.

662
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,298
Otherwise, he’s just in his room brooding.

663
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:27,327
Let me see.

664
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,261
You’re good.

665
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,738
Okay.

666
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,280
Dream!

667
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:03,650
Dream!

668
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,363
Dream.

669
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:10,360
Dream, slow down.

670
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,320
- Don’t overdo it. You’re still injured.
- Dream!

671
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,290
Dream!

672
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
Get in the car.

673
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,360
Stop being so stubborn.

674
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:19,407
Let’s go home.

675
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,661
MONTHS LATER

676
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:18,923
Let’s go, Night.

677
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,596
We have to get ready at the hospital.

678
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Yes.

679
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:01,470
Are you ready?

680
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,370
Yes.

681
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:14,356
Nurse, scalpel.

682
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,876
This is why I needed Ozone in the first place.

683
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,185
Doc, if you don’t help us,

684
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,016
get ready to see your secrets exposed.

685
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,000
Who’d believe you?

686
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:47,476
Why don’t we test it out with your family?

687
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,774
I can march into your house and tell your wife right now

688
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,632
that you killed the families of these two boys.

689
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,214
There’s another way.

690
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,465
If you die, at least you’ll die trying.
