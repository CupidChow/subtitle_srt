00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,906
Jinx.

194
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,713
Why were you even born?

195
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,740
You shouldn’t have been born.

196
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,146
Get out!

197
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:19,733
Jinx!

198
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:20,946
Go away!

199
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,620
You jinx!

200
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,466
Trash!

201
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:24,660
Trash!

202
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,566
Why were you even born?

203
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,093
Jinx!

204
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,313
Stay away!

205
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,906
Curse!

206
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,486
I miss you, Joy.

207
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,393
Hey!

208
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,353
Stop it!

209
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,086
You…

210
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,306
You over there,

211
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,367
what do you think you’re doing?

212
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:29,534
Can you hear me?

213
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,280
Just calm down.

214
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,353
Listen to me.

215
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,053
Listen to me and calm down.

216
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,273
Take a breath.

217
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,453
Take a deep breath.

218
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:38,993
Don’t move.

219
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,780
I’ll count from one to three,

220
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,580
and we both take a step back together, alright?

221
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,606
One.

222
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,480
Two.

223
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,186
Let’s take one step at a time.

224
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,186
Hey! Are you listening to me!

225
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,426
Will you… hear me out?

226
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,420
I don’t know what happened,

227
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:02,253
but there’s a solution to every problem.

228
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,086
Can you hear me?

229
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,480
There really is a solution to everything.

230
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,026
If no one will hear you out,

231
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,733
I, I, I will.

232
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:12,526
So please calm down. Just calm down.

233
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,333
Are you listening to me?

234
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,570
Stay where you are, alright?

235
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:17,706
Stay. Where. You. Are.

236
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:18,566
I’ll be right there!

237
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,066
In a flash.

238
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:20,233
Don’t you dare jump!

239
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:26,960
Hey, are you still there?

240
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,626
Hey—

241
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,613
Damn it, did he jump?

242
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,800
That scared me.

243
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,493
Where has he gone?

244
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,220
I wasn’t going to jump.

245
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:11,873
Nosy girl.

246
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,120
Ozone?

247
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,653
What are you doing here?

248
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,720
Oh, I see you run into your cousin.

249
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,113
Let’s talk inside.

250
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,673
You must have heard your aunt talk about Ozone before, Day.

251
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,820
Yes.

252
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:53,273
Your aunt told us about her intention,

253
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,160
that if anything happened to her,

254
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,366
she wanted you to take care of Ozone.

255
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,886
Ozone will be your legal guardian.

256
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,360
What?

257
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,333
Seeing as you’re nearly of age,

258
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,063
you’re going to have to leave this place soon.

259
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,526
Having a home and a family

260
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:15,143
is a good thing, Day.

261
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,720
It won’t be difficult taking care of Ozone.

262
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:21,720
He is mostly self-sufficient.

263
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:24,180
You just have to accompany him

264
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,133
when he needs to go somewhere,

265
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,840
and just make sure he eats properly.

266
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,133
But I can’t live with anyone.

267
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,813
I want to live here.

268
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,360
I don’t want family or anyone else.

269
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,166
I don’t want to live with the man who killed Mom and Dad.

270
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:44,593
I don’t like it.

271
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,880
Don’t like it.

272
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:46,706
Don’t like it.

273
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:47,506
Don’t like it.

274
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:48,293
Don’t like it.

275
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:49,120
Don’t like it.

276
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:49,900
Don’t like it.

277
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,560
Don’t like it.

278
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:51,566
- Don’t like it.
- Let’s calm down, Ozone.

279
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:52,560
That wasn’t what happened.

280
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:53,146
Don’t like it.

281
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:53,706
I won’t live with him.

282
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,420
Calm down.

283
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,153
- I won’t live with him.
- Ozone, please.

284
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,446
- That wasn’t what happened.
- I won’t live with him.

285
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:58,040
I won’t live with him.

286
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:58,840
I won’t.

287
00:17:58,873 --> 00:17:59,900
I won’t.

288
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,540
Excuse me.

289
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,686
Is there really no other choice for me?

290
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,440
The thing is

291
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,393
you and Ozone need each other.

292
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,100
You need a home, Day.

293
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,426
And Ozone needs someone to take care of him.

294
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,680
Do it for your aunt, Day.

295
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:35,680
Don’t like it.

296
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:36,540
Don’t like it.

297
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,600
Day.

298
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,613
Here is the insurance money your aunt and her husband left.

299
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,066
It should get you by for quite a while.

300
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:09,886
You might need to find a part-time job soon, though.

301
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,986
You can talk to me

302
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:13,406
if there’s anything else you need help with.

303
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,633
Don’t mess with me.

304
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,020
I’m tired.

305
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,180
Ozone.

306
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,380
Can I come in?

307
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,553
Please?

308
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,593
Don’t you think it’s hot outside?

309
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,213
So you’re not gonna talk to me.

310
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,740
Ozone.

311
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,866
May I please come in?

312
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,620
I promise not to touch your stuff at all whatsoever.

313
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,353
What?

314
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,900
Hey. Hi.

315
00:21:52,273 --> 00:21:52,893
Hey.

316
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:54,420
If no one will hear you out,

317
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:57,073
I, I, I will.

318
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,620
My name is Dream.

319
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,086
Are you here for the 6-o’clock class, too?

320
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,020
I heard we have to make a conversation in English,

321
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,960
and I don’t have a partner yet—

322
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,046
I’m here for a private class.

323
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,886
Wait, what’s your name?

324
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,606
We study at the same cram school.

325
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,166
No harm in getting to know each other, right?

326
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,366
Well, brother,

327
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,826
everyone has to join the bigger class at some point.

328
00:22:23,846 --> 00:22:24,940
Bet he doesn’t know that!

329
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,320
Tim.

330
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,400
Pond.

331
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,033
Da.

332
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,893
Kha Moo.

333
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,460
Who’d be named Kha Moo?

334
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,106
What about Moo Deng?

335
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,126
Hey there, Ting-nong!

336
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,120
I’ve been waiting for ages.

337
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,813
And today, I’m here with…

338
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,810
Somchai!

339
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,693
Mark, turn around.

340
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:53,720
What? Is your name Mark?

341
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:54,420
Is that it?

342
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,360
Are you a Mark?

343
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,826
Saman.

344
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,613
What you doing?

345
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,626
Thirsty, are ya?

346
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:28,340
Sh…

347
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:39,626
Ozone!

348
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,260
I’m so tired of this.

349
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,480
Don’t leave empty plates on the table after your meal!

350
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,680
This is ridiculous.

351
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,893
As if my life wasn’t tiring enough.

352
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,873
Bye, Night.

353
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,940
What?

354
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:33,446
I got it right?

355
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Really?

356
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,866
Oh, dear.

357
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,600
Look who’s smiling.

358
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,633
Hold on.

359
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,253
Your name is Night.

360
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,960
My name is Dream.

361
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,426
It’s meant to be!

362
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,853
Dreams happen at night, right?

363
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,520
You seem to be doing fine daydreaming.

364
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,180
Dream a little dream of me tonight, Night.

365
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,513
Night.

366
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,513
Goodbye.

367
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,293
Night.

368
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,173
Bye-bye!

369
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,173
Bye-bye!

370
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:15,406
Night, Night, Night.

371
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,533
Bye-bye, Night!

372
00:25:16,553 --> 00:25:17,013
Bye!

373
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,120
Bye, Night!

374
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,252
Bye-bye, Night!

375
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:20,313
Bye-bye.

376
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,033
Night, Night—

377
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,560
I’m sorry.

378
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,220
What are you doing?

379
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,746
Making a mess.

380
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,026
Stop that.

381
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:22,720
Stop it.

382
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,286
Ozone!

383
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,560
Wasn’t me.

384
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,873
Ozone!

385
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,060
Wasn’t me.

386
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,966
If it wasn’t you, then who did it?

387
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,886
Stop being so childish!

388
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:26,080
Don’t you dare do it again.

389
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,813
It wasn’t me.

390
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,980
Wasn’t me.

391
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,886
Ozone!

392
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,306
Hmm, yum.

393
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:45,853
Automatic shutter speeds…

394
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:50,106
- can be set to the preference of each photographer.
- Venus, Earth, Saturn.

395
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,620
- You can set the shutter speed to…
- Uranus, Neptune.

396
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,460
—Neptune.

397
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:57,266
Earth, Mars, Jupiter,

398
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,693
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

399
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:03,673
- Ozone.
- Mercury.

400
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:07,486
- Ozone.
- Venus, Earth.

401
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,713
Can you do that more quietly?

402
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,500
I’m trying to study here.

403
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,206
Day.

404
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,613
You have something on your face.

405
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,553
Something on your face.

406
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,286
What else would be on my face

407
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,166
if not the color you’re playing with?

408
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,740
You have something on your face now.

409
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,906
What?

410
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,200
I don’t believe you.

411
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,046
Just keep drawing.

412
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,620
I’m studying.

413
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,826
Venus, Earth, Mars,

414
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:56,326
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,

415
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,513
Neptune.

416
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,106
I’m going to school today.

417
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,706
I already whipped something up, though.

418
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,013
You can have it for lunch.

419
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:06,620
I’ll buy us some dinner on my way home.

420
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,740
Don’t go anywhere and don’t cause trouble.

421
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,193
Just live the way you always did before, alright?

422
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,653
I lived with Mom and Dad before.

423
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,860
Because of you,

424
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,346
they all died.

425
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,826
You know about that?

426
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,880
I’m sorry.

427
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,300
I never wanted it to be this way.

428
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:55,013
I’ll die, too.

429
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,900
I’ll die, too.

430
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,646
I’ll die soon.

431
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,006
I’ll die, too.

432
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,586
I’ll die soon.

433
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,486
I’ll die, too.

434
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,920
I’ll die soon.

435
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,453
I’ll die, too.

436
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,200
I’ll die soon.

437
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,660
I’ll die, too.

438
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,746
I’ll die soon.

439
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,720
I’ll die, too.

440
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,546
I’ll die.

441
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:52,333
Noise…

442
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,406
Noise.

443
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:01,073
Noise.

444
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,653
Noise. Noise. Noise.

445
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,853
Noise. Noise. Noise.

446
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,900
Noise. Noise. Noise.

447
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:07,813
Noise. Noise.

448
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,160
Noise!

449
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,246
Noise. Noise. Noise.

450
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:12,380
Noise. Noise. Noise.

451
00:32:12,406 --> 00:32:13,646
Ozone!

452
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:15,173
- Ozone, what’s wrong?
- 	Noise. Noise. Noise!

453
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,846
Ozone!

454
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,680
Stars. Stars.

455
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:17,146
What’s wrong?

456
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:17,960
What is it?

457
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:18,873
Stars, stars, stars.

458
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,920
- Calm down!
- Stars, stars, stars!

459
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:21,360
Calm down.

460
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:21,900
What?

461
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,166
Stars. Stars. Stars.

462
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,833
Stars. Stars. Stars.

463
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,173
- Stars. Stars.
- What stars?

464
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:26,966
Planets?

465
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,680
Do you remember the planets’ names?

466
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:30,593
Mercury, Venus, Earth.

467
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,740
What else?

468
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:32,700
What else?

469
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,620
Do you remember?

470
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,533
- Mercury.
- Mars.

471
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,120
Mars.

472
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:37,460
Mars, Jupiter.

473
00:32:37,486 --> 00:32:38,360
- Saturn.
- Saturn.

474
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:40,186
That’s it. Good job.

475
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,920
Venus.

476
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,960
Now calm down and let’s recite them together.

477
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,673
Neptune.

478
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:43,753
Can we recite them together?

479
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,920
Mercury.

480
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:45,526
Mercury.

481
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:48,526
- Venus, Earth, Mars.
- Venus, Earth, Mars.

482
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:52,179
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

483
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:55,652
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

484
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,693
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

485
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:03,106
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

486
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:07,106
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

487
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:10,060
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

488
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,306
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

489
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,753
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

490
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,133
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

491
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,893
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars…
- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars…

492
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,326
The reason I want to get into medical school is because

493
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,186
when I was a kid, I was really afraid of needles.

494
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:32,393
But I was lucky enough to meet this doctor,

495
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:34,313
who explained to me

496
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,420
that the injection would kill the bad guys in my body.

497
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:39,886
The doctor said I needed to be strong and brave

498
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,860
so that the injection could do its job.

499
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:45,540
I stopped being afraid of injections ever since

500
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,300
and wanted to become a good doctor just like that.

501
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:53,053
I was really impressed by that doctor.

502
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,806
Though I honestly don’t know if I have what it takes to be a doctor…

503
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,593
I will do my very best anyway!

504
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,980
Well done.

505
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:08,226
Most students here want to get into medical or engineering schools.

506
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,720
That student over there wants to be a doctor as well.

507
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,426
Can you please get up and share with your friends

508
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:17,126
why you want to be a doctor?

509
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:21,580
He is even tutored privately by me on every subject.

510
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,013
Well, I…

511
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,306
I want to save lives.

512
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,593
I don’t like when people…

513
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,900
Die unnecessarily.

514
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,540
“Die unnecessarily”?

515
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:39,693
I see.

516
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,700
Interesting.

517
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:42,473
Thank you.

518
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,486
Well done.

519
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,746
Night.

520
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,113
Can I ask you something?

521
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,220
What did you mean when you said “die unnecessarily”?

522
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,973
Well, when a person dies,

523
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,840
they have no choice but to go, right?

524
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:16,570
But you said they die unnecessarily,

525
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,700
so I don’t really get it.

526
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh?

527
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,140
Did you just want to sound cool?

528
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,973
Dying unnecessarily means

529
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,286
something bad happens to a person even though…

530
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:34,320
Even though…

531
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:39,170
Who would say something so cruel just to sound cool?

532
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,880
What?

533
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,900
Are you getting angry?

534
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:42,620
I was just joking.

535
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,620
Is death a joke to you?

536
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,466
No…

537
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:49,613
Wait!

538
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:06,886
Well?

539
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,966
The Ice Prince shut you down, didn't he?

540
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,840
He’s way too moody.

541
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,366
He never responds to anything I say.

542
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:15,000
He gets angry after one question.

543
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,346
What kind of question did you ask him, anyway?

544
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,020
I just wanted to know

545
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,020
what he meant by “die unnecessarily.”

546
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:25,253
I thought he was trying to be cool so I was just teasing him.

547
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:25,893
That’s all.

548
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,180
You know about the mass shooting at a mall years ago?

549
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,020
His family was killed in that incident.

550
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,286
Crap…

551
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:44,253
I didn’t know that.

552
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,240
He probably thought you wanted to bring that up.

553
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,553
I’m off, guys.

554
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:56,360
Bye.

555
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,573
Bye.

556
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,893
See you.

557
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,320
Here, please.

558
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,306
Oh?

559
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,826
You’re buying all these?

560
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:34,846
Do you like them?

561
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,700
My cousin loves them.

562
00:37:37,113 --> 00:37:38,620
He’s an expert on this, you know?

563
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:39,893
You can ask him anything.

564
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,606
Your dimwit cousin?

565
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,806
That guy?

566
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,033
Here.

567
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
What’s this planet?

568
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,146
Who the hell would know that?

569
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,853
See?

570
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,773
My cousin is already smarter than you are.

571
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,386
Idiot.

572
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,040
I’m off for real.

573
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,726
Bye.

574
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,960
Ozone?

575
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,900
Wait, wait, wait.

576
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,886
Mom said,

577
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:29,653
after work, cold water makes you feel better.

578
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,173
So I get you this.

579
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,126
Here.

580
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:47,186
Planets.

581
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,113
I got them for you.

582
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,180
Don’t worry and just open them.

583
00:38:53,426 --> 00:38:54,746
All yours, Ozone.

584
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Today–Today…

585
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,660
Today you got one star.

586
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,440
Well?

587
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,486
Do you like them?

588
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:31,413
I do.

589
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:34,320
I got you six boxes.

590
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,366
These things are hard to find, you know?

591
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,160
See all these planets?

592
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:41,613
You might get the same ones, though.

593
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,426
Let’s open them, shall we?

594
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,060
Let me help.

595
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,833
Look at these stickers.

596
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:51,893
Ozone, look.

597
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,560
See?

598
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,893
Night.

599
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,100
Night.

600
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,680
I’m sorry.

601
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,360
For?

602
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,386
For saying you only said what you said to be cool.

603
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,646
I really didn’t know about…

604
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,820
It’s okay.

605
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,673
Don’t hate me, Night.

606
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,340
It was my fault.

607
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:41,113
If I knew,
I wouldn’t have knowingly made you feel awful.

608
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,333
I’m sorry for your loss.

609
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,706
It’s okay.

610
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,653
I understand.

611
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,060
See you tomorrow.

612
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,240
1 YEAR LATER

613
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:08,673
1 YEAR LATER
UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM DAY

614
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,693
Sorry.

615
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,453
Hey.

616
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,786
If I was on the operation table,

617
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:21,806
I don’t want you to be my doctor ever

618
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,040
since you’d likely be late.

619
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:25,839
Hold on.

620
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,253
I’m panting.

621
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,793
And you made me get you coffee, too?

622
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,923
What am I, your assistant?

623
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,233
Come on.

624
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,349
Night, Night, Night.

625
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,709
Night.

626
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,702
What?

627
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,200
Well,

628
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,653
if we get into the same school…

629
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,233
Yeah?

630
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:45,893
What?

631
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,253
I’m not getting you coffee every morning.

632
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,753
It’s not that.

633
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:52,966
If we get into the same school,

634
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,760
will you go out with me?

635
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,593
No.

636
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:05,120
What?

637
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,660
But I wouldn’t mind…

638
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,280
if we keep seeing each other.

639
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,273
Yes!

640
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,140
Alright.

641
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,253
I knew I’d only get a half-response.

642
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:31,186
Good job, me.

643
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:32,940
We’ll be seeing each other, then?

644
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,066
Seeing each other.

645
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Wait for me!

646
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,000
Ozone.

647
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,706
I’ll be in the exam room soon.

648
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,106
You have to wait for me right here.

649
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:01,546
Don’t go anywhere, alright?

650
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,893
Do you understand?

651
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,133
Don’t go anywhere.

652
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,693
I’ll be gone for about two hours, okay?

653
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:12,580
I know. I know. I know.

654
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:14,360
Give me a milkshake.

655
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,240
I got one for you already.

656
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:18,726
It’ll be here soon.

657
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,733
I have to go now.

658
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,713
Day.

659
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,960
Hmm?

660
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,026
Do… your best.

661
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,966
You can do it.

662
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,993
I…

663
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,106
I am a proud big brother.

664
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,313
Thanks.

665
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,900
I’ll be right back.

666
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,953
Ozone!

667
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,380
Ozone!

668
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,613
Ozone! Ozone!

669
00:44:53,746 --> 00:44:55,610
Are you the family of the patients?

670
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:58,373
Yes.

671
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,306
Please fill in this form.

672
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,673
Fill it thoroughly.

673
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,800
The names and birth dates

674
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,800
of both you and the patients.

675
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:11,493
I will come back to retrieve it later.

676
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,540
I’m here to talk to Ms. Pakhwan’s family.

677
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:45,626
Yes?

678
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,438
What about Ms. Pakhwan’s family?

679
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,711
Are they here?

680
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,443
Her family lives out of town.

681
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,916
I must be honest,

682
00:45:58,246 --> 00:46:00,810
Ms. Pakhwan’s situation isn’t ideal.

683
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,217
I suggest you call her family and get them here as soon as you can.

684
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,715
Once you get in contact with her family,

685
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:09,389
please let us know right away.

686
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,253
Doctor.

687
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,120
How is my cousin?

688
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,880
Your cousin…

689
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,686
I think you should wait to hear it from his doctor.

690
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,980
Please wait here until then.

691
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:25,906
Stay calm for now.

692
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,700
I have to get back to work.

693
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,013
Are you Mr. Anawin’s family?

694
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,013
Yes.

695
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:42,806
That’s me.

696
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,180
What is your relationship with him?

697
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,280
I’m his brother.

698
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,333
And your parents?

699
00:46:47,353 --> 00:46:48,793
Are they informed of the situation?

700
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,853
We’re all each other’s got.

701
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,606
I suggest you go home and get some rest.

702
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,940
Your brother will likely be in the ICU all night.

703
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,360
Does that mean…

704
00:47:04,393 --> 00:47:06,360
We can’t give you any answer right now.

705
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,520
We’ll know more after 24 hours.

706
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:10,286
You should go home and take some rest.

707
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:12,280
We will contact you in any case.

708
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,440
The elevator is going up.

709
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,148
My brother is autistic.

710
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,626
We had a little accident at home yesterday.

711
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,120
He got scared and ran off.

712
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,660
It was my fault I couldn’t stop him.

713
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,700
How are you, sirs?

714
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,440
Did you get any sleep at all?

715
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,400
No.

716
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,126
And the form I asked you to fill?

717
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,886
Is it done?

718
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,680
I’ve filled mine.

719
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,940
It only needs his phone number to complete.

720
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,080
Alright, sir.

721
00:49:25,113 --> 00:49:26,366
I’ll take care of that.

722
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,766
I’ve filled mine as well.

723
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,406
Oh?

724
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,778
You two were born on the same day.

725
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,900
February 29.

726
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,433
Day

727
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:08,923
and night…

728
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,450
must not be separated.

729
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,223
You were born on February 29?

730
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,733
Don’t you want to know why this is how it is?

731
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,413
No.

732
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,006
If we really bring death to these people,

733
00:50:18,026 --> 00:50:19,446
we shouldn’t stick together.

734
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,933
It’s for everyone’s safety.

735
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,886
Day and night must meet.

736
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,291
Why did I survive?

737
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:29,146
It was my turn.

738
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,006
You and I are cursed!

739
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:32,653
If we love them, they die.
