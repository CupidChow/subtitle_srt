1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,750
Ozone?

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,990
Ozone will be your legal guardian, Day.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,380
I don’t want to live with the man who killed Mom and Dad.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,870
I’m sorry.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,220
I never wanted it to be this way.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,160
My name is Dream.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,540
I heard we have to make a conversation in English...

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,410
I’m here for a private class.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,410
Wait, what’s your name?

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,920
Bye, Night.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,020
What?

12
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,510
I got it right?

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,940
Bye-bye!

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,140
Night, Night, Night.

15
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,240
Bye-bye, Night!

16
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,280
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

17
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Night...

18
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,470
29 FEBRUARY 2008

19
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:38,470
(Day)

20
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
Oh?

21
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,700
You two were born on the same day.

22
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,370
February 29.

23
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Anawin’s family?

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes.

25
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,960
Mr. Anawin’s condition is now stable.

26
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay.

27
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,340
Thank you.

28
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,330
Ms. Pakhwan’s family?

29
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Yes.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,930
Did you hear from her relatives?

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,840
I must talk to her family about the treatment.

32
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,500
I’ve contacted them.

33
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,640
Will any of her injuries affect her permanently?

34
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,960
No.

35
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,000
I must say,

36
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,860
it was a miracle both of them survived.

37
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,560
I was concerned when I first saw them in the ER.

38
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,700
But now

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,120
both patients are responding well to the treatment.

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,560
Excuse me.

41
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Thank you.

42
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,930
I’m sorry, Dream.

43
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,860
If it wasn’t because of me,

44
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,200
all this wouldn’t have happened.

45
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,620
Hey, hold the elevator!

46
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,970
Thank you.

47
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,280
How kind of you to hold the door for me.

48
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,010
You haven’t gone home at all?

49
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,730
They sell T-shirts at convenience stores, you know?

50
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,030
In case you want to get changed.

51
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,910
Hey, can I ask you something?

52
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,540
You were born on February 29, weren’t you?

53
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,540
What the hell?

54
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,670
He’s so freaking conceited.

55
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,660
Dream, Dream.

56
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,630
Dream, you’re awake.

57
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,650
Night.

58
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,020
Try not to move too much.

59
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,710
Does it hurt anywhere?

60
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,800
Does your head hurt?

61
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,400
I’m okay.

62
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,780
This is nothing.

63
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,510
What about you?

64
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,770
Are you hurt?

65
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,040
Is everything alright with you?

66
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,170
I’m okay, Dream.

67
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,950
Don’t worry about me.

68
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,180
I’m totally fine.

69
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,030
Why don’t you

70
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,500
stay still while I call the doctor, alright?

71
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,110
Just wait.

72
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,700
Wait a minute.

73
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,570
Her recovery within the past 12 hours
has been excellent.

74
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,900
You need to monitor your condition for the time being.

75
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,400
If there are any symptoms of dizziness,

76
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,030
nausea, or visual impairment,

77
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,610
we’ll need to run a thorough test again.

78
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes.

79
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,640
Make sure she’s well supported when walking around.

80
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,590
Of course.

81
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,610
Thank you.

82
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,900
Thank you.

83
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Well?

84
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,290
Are you happy I’m still around to annoy you?

85
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,900
Of course I am.

86
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Here.

87
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,380
Let me rearrange the pillow for you.

88
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,860
You need to rest, you know that?

89
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
I’ll adjust the bed, too.

90
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,660
Rest well.

91
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,260
Mhmm.

92
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,510
I’m closing the curtain for a bit.

93
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,900
May I turn off the lights, too?

94
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
Excuse me.

95
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
That’s lovely.

96
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,270
Oh!

97
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,400
Ozone?

98
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,550
You’re awake.

99
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,550
Do you remember who I am?

100
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,680
Ozone!

101
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,970
Can you hear me?

102
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,500
Okay.

103
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,580
Hang on.

104
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,220
Nurse.

105
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,520
Yes?

106
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,540
My brother’s come to.

107
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,300
How are you feeling, Ozone?

108
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,520
I think he’s in shock right now.

109
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,520
Everything seems normal.

110
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,270
The doctor will be here for a checkup in the morning.

111
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,360
Okay.

112
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,810
Thank you.

113
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,910
Excuse me for now.

114
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,580
Let me know if you need anything.

115
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,180
Don’t move a muscle, alright?

116
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,280
Oh, my God!

117
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,320
I got hit by a car!

118
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,210
Did I float around like an astronaut?

119
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,550
Did you get a photo of me, Day?

120
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,750
Ozone.

121
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,260
Stay still and don’t talk much for now.

122
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Look. Oh, look!

123
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,230
Oh, my God!

124
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,300
I–I broke my arm?

125
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,420
Ozone.

126
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
Why am I alive?

127
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,900
Why did I survive?

128
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,640
It was my turn.

129
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,980
Why?

130
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,810
There was no one else.

131
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Do–Do you know why, Day?

132
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,640
Why am I still alive?

133
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,450
Do you know why, Day?

134
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,320
I kinda feel bad you have to take care of me.

135
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,110
Just let me do it.

136
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,300
It was my fault in the first place.

137
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,290
It was an accident, Night. An accident.

138
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,800
Nobody wanted it to happen.

139
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,440
So you’ve only been taking care of me out of guilt?

140
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,840
You totally hurt my feelings.

141
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,090
Hey.

142
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,570
You’ll be staying in my room.

143
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,486
I’ll have the housekeeper cook something for you.

144
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,780
Whatever you want.

145
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,290
Try to recover quickly.

146
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,910
Let me know if you have a headache or can’t see.

147
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,810
I’ll take you to the hospital right away, okay?

148
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,970
Okay.

149
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,370
Roger that.

150
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,010
Wait, hang on, hang on.

151
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

152
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
I’m sorry.

153
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,080
Everything’s okay now.

154
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,110
Believe me.

155
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,020
Can’t break another arm.

156
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,260
I know that.

157
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,710
There’s a lot of cool stuff inside, you know?

158
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,120
Cool…

159
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,140
Too cool last time.

160
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Come on. Just get in.

161
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
I’ve got everything taken care of.

162
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,390
There’s a surprise for you, too.

163
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,450
What surprise?

164
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Look.

165
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,910
If you want to find out,

166
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
you gotta get in.

167
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Let’s go.

168
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,770
Here.

169
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,910
My God.

170
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,200
Breaking my arm is so worth it.

171
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,180
I’m safe now.

172
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
You don’t have to worry about me anymore.

173
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,660
No need to be scared, Day.

174
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Ozone?

175
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,340
What’s wrong?

176
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Ozone.

177
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,840
Is it the stars again?

178
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,920
What are they telling you?

179
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,410
Day and night… must meet.

180
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,880
Must meet.

181
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,210
Must meet.

182
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,550
Must meet.

183
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,060
Must meet.

184
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Must meet.

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,320
(Jirat Chayutra, 48)

193
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,520
(Day)

194
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,320
(Day)

195
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,200
(Night)

196
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,650
(Another Chayutra family tragedy left only heir, Rattikan Chayutra, bereaved)

197
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,110
Ozone.

198
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Ozone!

199
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,250
Day.

200
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,820
Ozone!

201
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,920
Day. Day.

202
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,640
Day!

203
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,630
Help me…

204
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,080
Ozone!

205
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,960
Day!

206
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,960
Ozone!

207
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,990
Day!

208
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,710
Whoa.

209
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,800
Night.

210
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,030
I didn’t know you could make all of this.

211
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,220
Are you doubting me?

212
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,120
Don’t eat if you don’t trust my cooking.

213
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,140
I don’t have to eat.

214
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,660
I’m full just looking at you.

215
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,700
Just eat and take some more rest.

216
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,450
Maybe it’ll stop you from talking nonsense.

217
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,420
I’m only like this with you.

218
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
I’ll eat.

219
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,900
The sausage looks amazing.

220
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,040
It’s good.

221
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,000
Coffee is also good.

222
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,870
Is there anything you can’t do?

223
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,870
Shh!

224
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,940
No being hungry.

225
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,360
Day is still sleeping.

226
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Stop it.

227
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,730
Don’t make noise.

228
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Be quiet.

229
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,250
You’ll wake Day up.

230
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,260
Shhh!

231
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,030
Stop.

232
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,800
Stop right now.

233
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,950
I said stop.

234
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,940
You’ll wake Day up!

235
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,480
Be quiet!

236
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,890
Do you understand?

237
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,100
Stop!

238
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,490
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

239
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,940
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

240
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,780
Oh.

241
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,860
I swear I tried to stop my tummy.

242
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
What?

243
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,660
My tummy says it’s hungry.

244
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,610
Oh.

245
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Ozone.

246
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,460
Are you hungry?

247
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,820
I’ll whip something up.

248
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,280
Breakfast is served.

249
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,590
Let’s eat. Let’s eat.

250
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Here.

251
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,100
How does it look?

252
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,770
Arigato.

253
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,040
Here.

254
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Chopsticks.

255
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,680
Is it good?

256
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,740
Ozone, eat well.

257
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
We’re going to physical therapy afterwards.

258
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,100
You can do it.

259
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Ozone.

260
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,210
You said day and night must meet.

261
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,670
Why?

262
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,600
This is the day.

263
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,080
This is the night.

264
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,780
Do not separate.

265
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,980
Ozone, those are chopsticks.

266
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Same thing.

267
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,580
Day and night don’t work separately.

268
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Together, they work.

269
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,670
They work.

270
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:35,993
They work.

271
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Hello?

272
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
I’m Day.

273
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
The guy who was also born on February 29.

274
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,780
I want to talk to you about something.

275
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,720
Can we meet?

276
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,180
If this is about the compensation,

277
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,570
please call the insurance company.

278
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,350
If it’s not, I’m afraid I can’t help you.

279
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,360
Hold on, hold on.

280
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,700
I don’t want to talk about money.

281
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,460
I want to talk about the mass shooting years back.

282
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,070
My sister and your uncle…

283
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,820
So what?

284
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,820
They just happened to be at the same place.

285
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,950
A lot of people were killed that day.

286
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,820
It’s just way too freaking weird.

287
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,060
Think about it.

288
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,440
We need to talk.

289
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,120
Don’t you want to know why this is how it is?

290
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,240
It’s because you and I are bad luck.

291
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,710
What else is there to know?

292
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,540
Whoever we love dies.

293
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,500
It means we shouldn’t be with anyone.

294
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,640
Don’t you get it?

295
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,770
What was that, Night?

296
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
Why did you say that?

297
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Dream.

298
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,650
I have to tell you something.

299
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,210
Yes?

300
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
I…

301
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,630
Are you breaking up with me?

302
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,130
What?

303
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,480
“Break up” would be the wrong word,

304
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,800
since we never dated.

305
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,540
No, Dream.

306
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Listen to me.

307
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
It’s…

308
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Something bad happens to me

309
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,710
something very bad...

310
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,570
every four years.

311
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,430
Every time

312
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,440
that February 29 comes by,

313
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,330
someone I love… dies.

314
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
Night.

315
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,370
First, it was my mother.

316
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,560
Then, it claimed my father.

317
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,250
My uncle died after that.

318
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,630
Night, hold on.

319
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,670
- You don’t have to be so dramatic—
- Listen to me.

320
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,560
No.

321
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,030
You listen to me.

322
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,120
If you’re trying to get rid of me,

323
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,120
just tell me honestly.

324
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,340
There’s no need to come up with some story.

325
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,600
I’m not an idiot, you know?

326
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,330
No, that’s not what I’m doing.

327
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,150
Listen.

328
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,150
Everyone I love

329
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,720
ends up dead.

330
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,880
That’s why I’ve been trying to ignore you,

331
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,530
reject you,

332
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,856
and try not to feel anything for you,

333
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,850
or worry about you, or love you,

334
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,370
when I really am in...

335
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,790
What?

336
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,140
What is it, Night?

337
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,050
What is it?

338
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,620
I’m talking to you.

339
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,030
What is it?

340
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,410
Why won’t you tell me?

341
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,130
I really am in love with you, Dream.

342
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,540
I really, really, am.

343
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,680
You made me smile

344
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,660
when I hadn't done that in a while.

345
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,860
But I’m scared, Dream.

346
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,640
I’m scared that,

347
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,140
if I feel something for you,

348
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,830
something is going to happen to you, too.

349
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,680
I don’t want to lose anyone again.

350
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,020
But… how could you lose everyone?

351
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,020
I have no one left.

352
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,040
When I was born, my mother died.

353
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,880
Four years later, my dad did, too.

354
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,620
And then it was my uncle.

355
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,480
Even my favorite dog was long dead.

356
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Night.

357
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,870
But then I just can’t stand
seeing someone else around you.

358
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,640
And I feel absolutely bad for hurting you.

359
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,110
I just hate seeing you cry, don’t you get it?

360
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,200
But because I’m so scared,

361
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,839
I don’t know what to do.

362
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,600
I’m so scared of losing you.

363
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,800
But I’m not scared, Night.

364
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,910
I’m not scared at all.

365
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,920
If what you said was true,

366
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,300
then how come I am completely fine?

367
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I don’t know.

368
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,910
It–It’s never happened before.

369
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,540
It means we can work this out together.

370
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,580
From what you said,

371
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,580
we have four years, Night.

372
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,580
Four long years.

373
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,230
We’ll come up with something to fix it.

374
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,780
If you really, really, are in love with me,

375
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,460
you’ll do this.

376
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,490
Because I really, really, am in love with you.

377
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,320
I won’t let you go through this alone again.

378
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
From now on,

379
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
don’t let go of my hands.

380
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,140
Okay.

381
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,550
We’re dating, then?

382
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Dating.

383
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,850
What now?

384
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,570
After therapy,

385
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,570
do you want to go to the planetarium?

386
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,040
We can’t.

387
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,900
You’re not well enough for that.

388
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,200
We can’t go.

389
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,200
I have to go to work afterwards anyway.

390
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,360
My God.

391
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,360
I will never recover.

392
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,410
No rest for my soul.

393
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
How about this?

394
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,940
If you behave all through physical therapy,

395
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,410
I’ll buy you some ice cream.

396
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,400
Okay.

397
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,380
Vanilla-chocolate.

398
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,250
Vanilla-chocolate.

399
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,910
Pick one.

400
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,930
Vani...

401
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,760
Vanilla-chocolate.

402
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,650
Vanilla-chocolate.

403
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,740
One.

404
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,520
Vanilla…

405
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Chocolate.

406
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,180
Vanilla-chocolate.

407
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,490
Vanilla-chocolate.

408
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,720
Vanilla-chocolate.

409
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,200
Vanilla-chocolate.

410
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,700
Vanilla. Chocolate.

411
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,730
Vanilla.

412
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,270
Vanilla.

413
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,960
Here.

414
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,990
Thank you.

415
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,380
Dear stars, my arm is back!

416
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,450
My arm is back.

417
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,996
I’m going back to school tomorrow, alright?

418
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
I’m going, too!

419
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,040
No way.

420
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,370
- I want to go.
- Just stay home.

421
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,750
I want to go with you. I want to.

422
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,396
I’m going, too! I’m going, too! I’m going, too!

423
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,030
Hey, hey, hey.

424
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,250
Stop complaining or we’re putting the cast back on you.

425
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,370
You don’t get it.

426
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,420
I’m—I’m going so I can take care of you.

427
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,340
Look who’s so lively now.

428
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,820
I bring day and night together.

429
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,430
Dear stars, my arm is back!

430
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,100
(Lecture Hall)

431
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,530
(Medical Laboratory)

432
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,330
Ozone, let’s go.

433
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,330
Where?

434
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,280
We’re going to see the night.

435
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,620
Let’s go. Hurry up.

436
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,850
Careful.

437
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Night.

438
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,420
Who’s that?

439
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,450
Your friend?

440
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,190
The guy from the accident.

441
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,210
Let’s go, Dream.

442
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,380
February 29.

443
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
February 29, 2008.

444
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,730
My sister and your uncle died at the same time,

445
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,340
because we were both calling them.

446
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,580
I was trying to call my sister right then, too.

447
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,890
Four years before that, it was my father.

448
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,620
Eight years before that, my mother.

449
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,500
I have one question.

450
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,880
Did it happen to you in that order, too?

451
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
If we really are jinxes,

452
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,016
don’t you think we should work together to fix it?

453
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,740
We can diverge the path.

454
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,030
No.

455
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,320
If we really are jinxes,

456
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,090
we shouldn’t be anywhere near each other.

457
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,390
It’s for everyone’s safety.

458
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,510
Night, but I think...

459
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,320
Dream.

460
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,560
We’re staying away from them.

461
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,340
Day and night must meet.

462
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,660
That’s how it works.

463
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,820
Like chopsticks.

464
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,980
Chopsticks.

465
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,880
Chopsticks.

466
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Chopsticks.

467
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,620
Chopsticks.

468
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,790
Chopsticks, huh?

469
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,230
Listen to me.

470
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,210
Jinxes like us shouldn’t stick together.

471
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,550
Let’s go, Dream.

472
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,820
Night, but what he said was...

473
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,250
A coincidence.

474
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,250
Everyone has a family.

475
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,780
One more thing,

476
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,540
we don’t know what it’s like for other people

477
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,800
who were born on February 29.

478
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
Night.

479
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,360
Professor Wiwat was born on February 29.

480
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,440
He called off work that day, remember?

481
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,700
He said he was celebrating his birthday with his family.

482
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,470
Why don’t we go and ask him about it?

483
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,630
Come in.

484
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,360
Hello, Professor Wiwat.

485
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,560
Hello.

486
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,979
Please have a seat.

487
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,890
Thank you.

488
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,970
How can I help you?

489
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Uhh, I…

490
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,430
I was absent on February 29

491
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,850
so I’m here to make sure I catch up with everything.

492
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,000
It was my birthday that day.

493
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,170
It was?

494
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,690
It was my birthday, too.

495
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,216
But there was nothing to catch up on in class that day.

496
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,910
I was also absent to celebrate my birthday at home.

497
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
At home?

498
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,200
Do you mean… with your family?

499
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,890
Of course.

500
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,160
With my daughter and wife.

501
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,360
They go all out every time,

502
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,836
since it only comes around once every four years.

503
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,580
They were more excited about it than I was.

504
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,230
You have a daughter?

505
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,280
I do.

506
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,580
Professors are humans, too, you know?

507
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,510
We do have children if we want to.

508
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
Oh, of course.

509
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,920
If there’s nothing to catch up on,

510
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,260
then I’m good, Professor.

511
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,500
Excuse me.

512
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,020
Thank you.

513
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,700
Push.

514
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,710
One more push, please.

515
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,400
Keep pushing.

516
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,310
- Just a little more.
- Keep going.

517
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,780
Not long now.

518
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,060
We’re almost there.

519
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,350
One more push.

520
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
Keep pushing.

521
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,820
Keep pushing.

522
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,420
Good, good.

523
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,390
You’re doing so well.

524
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,410
Keep going.

525
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,440
Doctor, the mother died.

526
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,370
It’s right at noon, isn’t it?

527
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
Yes.

528
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,290
Day and night must meet.

529
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,290
Day and night must meet.

530
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,170
Day and night must meet.

531
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,170
Day and night must meet.

532
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,780
Day and night must meet.

533
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,880
Day and night must meet.

534
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,720
Day and night must meet.

535
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,420
Day and night must meet.

536
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,820
Day and night must meet.

537
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,380
Day and night must meet.

538
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,460
Day and night must meet.

539
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,460
Day and night must meet.

540
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,750
Day and night must meet.

541
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,800
Day and night must meet.

542
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,350
Day and night must meet.

543
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,500
Day and night must meet.

544
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,930
Day and night must meet.

545
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,290
Day and night must meet.

546
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,480
Day and night must meet.

547
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,380
Every single living thing you love

548
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,300
falls under the rules of this damn game!

549
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,560
Better not double our bad fortune.

550
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,840
Not your fault, Day.

551
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,570
It’s Leap Day’s fault.

552
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,700
You must remain where I can see you at all times.

553
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,230
Just ask your questions.

554
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,890
Don’t go and try to play detectives.

555
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,050
Let’s go home.

556
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,850
I want to draw.

557
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Teach me, too.

558
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,700
Trouble.

559
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,690
Trouble.

560
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,910
I’m in trouble.

561
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,330
Ozone!
