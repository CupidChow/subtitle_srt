1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:01,197
Here.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,109
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:08,505
Ozone!

4
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:10,360
Somebody, please help!

5
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,623
From now on, stay close to me.

6
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,605
Stay where I can see you at all times.

7
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:16,459
Understood?

8
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:21,299
Day takes the best care in the universe.

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,721
Never hurts me.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,028
Never ever.

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,103
I have to stop this stupid mess.

12
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,651
And we have to do it as soon as possible, too.

13
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,656
Trouble.

14
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:33,383
Trouble.

15
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:34,681
I am in trouble.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,489
29 FEBRUARY 2004

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,256
Happy birthday to you.

18
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:49,306
Where is Dad?

19
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:51,897
Your father is resting

20
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:53,502
so he can get better soon.

21
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:56,598
I’m afraid I’m your only company tonight, sir.

22
00:00:58,552 --> 00:00:59,579
Make a wish.

23
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:22,564
Oh, Night, you’re up.

24
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:23,669
Hang on

25
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:24,945
I’m almost done.

26
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:29,589
Wait just a minute.

27
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:46,644
What are you making?

28
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,188
What are you doing?

29
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,253
What?

30
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,088
I’m just checking out what you’re cooking.

31
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,333
I’m frying some ham.

32
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,927
Go sit down before I burn it.

33
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,004
Don’t you see I’m cooking?

34
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:23,968
Dream!

35
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,466
I’ll handle this from now on.

36
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:40,176
You should just focus on being careful.

37
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,600
Roger.

38
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,330
As I said,

39
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,426
there isn’t much time left for you guys.

40
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:53,687
You gotta hurry up,

41
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,508
or else you’re getting an F for this course.

42
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:57,706
By the way, Day,

43
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,653
about your project.

44
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,691
How’s it going? Did you come up with the ending?

45
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:02,502
No, I haven’t.

46
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,016
You might wanna work on that.

47
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,709
There’s still the pre and post production issues, casting, and all that, you know?

48
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,733
It’s a whole process.

49
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:09,220
Yes.

50
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,897
I’ve read through your script,

51
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:14,105
and I think you take your story too personally.

52
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,197
You might want to take a step back,

53
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:17,472
wear the audience lens,

54
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,099
and you’ll see the big picture,

55
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,457
the grand scheme, you know?

56
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,000
That way, you’ll notice the loophole in the story,

57
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:25,068
something you’ve always overlooked.

58
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:34,666
Something we’ve always overlooked?

59
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:39,117
D–Day?

60
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,370
Where is he going?

61
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:42,592
Did he say?

62
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:51,537
Hey, Night.

63
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Listen up.

64
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,980
I think we gotta take ourselves out of the game.

65
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,450
If we keep going with its flow,

66
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:57,820
we will never figure it out.

67
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,863
We gotta stop playing along.

68
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,096
Take a step back and see the big picture.

69
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:05,398
I think Leap Day has a loophole.

70
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:06,995
Trust me.

71
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,625
Let’s go, Ozone.

72
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,030
We’re heading home.

73
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,674
You finished class early today.

74
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
- Let’s go. - Why–

75
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:26,706
Why are we in a hurry?

76
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,404
I’ll tell you when we get back.

77
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:30,869
Let’s go.

78
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,632
Can’t you tell me now?

79
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:33,865
I’ll tell you once we’re home.

80
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:35,074
Hurry up.

81
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,165
Shall we get going?

82
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,379
Umm.

83
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:54,945
Day called.

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,570
Oh?

85
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:57,365
Do you want to call him back now?

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,265
He left a voicemail.

87
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,121
I see.

88
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:02,637
Let’s go.

89
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,217
I think we gotta take ourselves out of the game.

90
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,404
We gotta stop playing along.

91
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,597
Take a step back and see the big picture.

92
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,853
I think Leap Day has a loophole.

93
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:13,868
Dream.

94
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,647
I think we need to go home right now.

95
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:18,357
Okay.

96
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:19,626
Let’s go.

97
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,851
Night, hold on. What’s going on?

98
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:15,562
Day, what’s wrong?

99
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,186
What are you looking for?

100
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,376
Day, what’s wrong?

101
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,170
What are you looking for?

102
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,650
Ozone.

103
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,533
Your drawings.

104
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,370
What about them?

105
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,160
Does any of them have something to do with Leap Day?

106
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:56,745
Can you show me?

107
00:09:57,768 --> 00:09:58,768
Hang on.

108
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,650
(Autopsy Report)

109
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,205
There’s nothing.

110
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,328
Night, what exactly are you looking for?

111
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,551
I don’t know.

112
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,386
What?

113
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
Then what are you searching for right now?

114
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:05,626
What are you looking for?

115
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:09,010
I’m looking for…

116
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,400
Leap Day’s loophole.

117
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:13,903
There has to be one.

118
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,524
Ozone.

119
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,733
You don’t know at all why you drew these?

120
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,829
What about these letters?

121
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:27,400
These… “Hooz” and “Gloz.”

122
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,050
What are they?

123
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,813
Dunno.

124
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,441
The stars told me to draw them.

125
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:34,829
The stars told me to write them.

126
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:44,817
Where’s Day?

127
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Over there, I think.

128
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,330
What are these?

129
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,004
I don’t know. They belong to Day.

130
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:58,318
Day.

131
00:13:58,868 --> 00:13:59,340
Day.

132
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,567
Yes?

133
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,099
What’s with this pile of trash?

134
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,281
Clear them away before some customers see them.

135
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,638
Yes. I’m sorry.

136
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,487
There he is again.

137
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:17,768
Pardon?

138
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,922
That man has been sneaking around here for a while.

139
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:23,802
Strange guy.

140
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:27,694
Hey, clear them away.

141
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,404
- Yes. - It’ll make us look unprofessional.

142
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,170
Get to work.

143
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:55,979
Day.

144
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:56,915
Day.

145
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:58,303
Day.

146
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,466
Day!

147
00:14:59,543 --> 00:14:59,992
Day!

148
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:01,365
Day! Day!

149
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,456
- Day! Day! - Ozone, Ozone!

150
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,629
- Day! Day! - Ozone, what’s wrong?

151
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:04,648
- Is it the stars? - Day.

152
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:05,742
What’s wrong?

153
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:07,445
Someone. Someone. Someone.

154
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,968
Someone.

155
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:08,456
Someone.

156
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,047
Someone.

157
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,682
Someone.

158
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:10,568
Someone.

159
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,324
Someone.

160
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:12,696
Where?

161
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:14,034
There’s nobody there.

162
00:15:16,354 --> 00:15:17,195
I’m right here.

163
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:18,222
You’re safe.

164
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Alright?

165
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,047
You’re all done with your class today.

166
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,474
Do you want to go home?

167
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,487
I can drop you off.

168
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:31,850
It’s okay.

169
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,001
I’ll keep Ozone company at the library.

170
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,115
Did you find anything?

171
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,751
Hello, Ozone.

172
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:40,108
Not at all.

173
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:41,327
You?

174
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
No, not at all.

175
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,908
Not yet, you mean.

176
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,840
You haven’t found anything yet.

177
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
But you will.

178
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,666
True. True. True.

179
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,791
Right?

180
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:54,629
Just go to class.

181
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,460
Pay attention in class, the both of you.

182
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:58,484
Day.

183
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,657
No misbehaving.

184
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Roger that.

185
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:10,576
Let’s go.

186
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,173
Night.

187
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,660
What are you blushing for?

188
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,005
Ozone.

189
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:35,484
Look.

190
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Here.

191
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,131
Shh.

192
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,467
We’re not supposed to eat here.

193
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,491
So be quiet.

194
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:42,802
Okay.

195
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,484
Not supposed to.

196
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,074
Be quiet.

197
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:46,491
I’ll be quiet.

198
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:47,062
No!

199
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,531
We’re sneaking.

200
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:49,762
Ozone.

201
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,294
Sneakily. Be quiet.

202
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,539
Bend down.

203
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,780
Ozone.

204
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,748
Was Day looking for Leap Day’s loophole, too?

205
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,411
Yes, but there was nothing.

206
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:05,708
Night said the same thing.

207
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,908
He said there was nothing he could find.

208
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,899
Now we have messy piles of papers all over the place.

209
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:14,060
My drawings are also all over the place.

210
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Your drawings?

211
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:17,502
You draw?

212
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,007
Can you show me?

213
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,457
They’re with Day.

214
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:24,988
I’ll show you later.

215
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:26,940
I draw really well.

216
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,394
You do?

217
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:29,471
I can’t wait to see them.

218
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:32,762
I might be able to help Night out, too.

219
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,402
I help Day a lot.

220
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:42,484
But Day gets mad, complains,

221
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,786
and this and that.

222
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:47,666
I’m the big brother.

223
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:52,065
I think Day just worries about you.

224
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:54,205
He doesn’t want anything bad to happen to you.

225
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,294
Come to think about it,

226
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:57,677
Night is exactly the same.

227
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:00,354
He refuses to let me do anything.

228
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:04,955
I worry about Day.

229
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,453
I worry so much.

230
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,688
I’m concerned about Night, too.

231
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,943
But honestly,

232
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,880
nobody should have to go through anything like this.

233
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:20,897
I think you can say I feel bad for them.

234
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:28,459
Birthdays.

235
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,550
Birthdays must be happy.

236
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:34,607
Happy birthday.

237
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,430
Ozone!

238
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,746
Let’s throw Day and Night a birthday party!

239
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:45,094
Make it a surprise.

240
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,463
But it's a long way off.

241
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,223
It’s not at all.

242
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:50,205
Let’s do it tomorrow!

243
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,472
Let’s make up for the past 20 years!

244
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:53,284
Think about it, Ozone.

245
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,914
Day and Night never had good birthday parties for 20 years!

246
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:57,072
Forget parties,

247
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:59,351
they never even had one good day on their birthdays.

248
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,350
Are you in?

249
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,005
It’s going to be fun.

250
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,622
Cool, cool, cool.

251
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,591
Perfect!

252
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,497
I don’t have class tomorrow.

253
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,370
You’re not busy, are you?

254
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:13,583
Can you tell Day to drop you off at Night’s?

255
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,518
Tell him I want to play with you or whatever.

256
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:16,937
Once Day and Night leave,

257
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,844
there’d be no one there but you and me.

258
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:20,282
We decorate the place then.

259
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,294
Make it beautiful and elaborate.

260
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,957
Whatever our imagination will allow.

261
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:25,663
Once we’re done decorating,

262
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:26,902
we tell Day to come back.

263
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,120
Night will have been back from class by then as well.

264
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,660
The two of them will meet at Night’s house.

265
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:33,896
That’s when we yell “Surprise!”

266
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:35,733
“Surprise!”

267
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:36,997
Yes. “Surprise!”

268
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:38,573
“Surprise!”

269
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:40,607
“Surprise!”

270
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:43,755
It’s going to be so much fun!

271
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:44,768
Right?

272
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:46,029
Then...

273
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:55,703
Stay safe.

274
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,195
Call me if you need anything.

275
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:58,213
Alright?

276
00:19:58,395 --> 00:19:59,395
Roger.

277
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,567
Come straight home after class, okay?

278
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:04,111
Yeah.

279
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,176
Promise?

280
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:08,565
Bye.

281
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:31,948
Ozone.

282
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,431
Hi.

283
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:35,128
Ozone.

284
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:37,171
Don’t cause trouble, alright?

285
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,005
Be nice.

286
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,016
I’ll pick you up this evening.

287
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,274
I know. I know.

288
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:41,668
Don’t be late.

289
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,314
You said that a million times before.

290
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:45,302
I’ll leave him in your care.

291
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,327
The pleasure’s all mine.

292
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:49,014
It’s always fun playing with Ozone.

293
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,170
Am I right?

294
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
I’m off, then.

295
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Bye. See you.

296
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:55,794
Be nice.

297
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,041
Bye!

298
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,697
It’s okay. We’ll grab another one.

299
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:16,629
Alright.

300
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,885
You like this color…

301
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:20,973
Hold on to this.

302
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,220
What color do you like?

303
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,197
Red.

304
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,262
I’ll go with yellow, then.

305
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,167
Put it on like a hat.

306
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:01,014
They’re here.

307
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,419
Let’s go, Ozone.

308
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:14,712
Who’s that?

309
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:20,807
- Surprise! - Surprise!

310
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,490
Oh?

311
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,640
I guess he’s not here yet.

312
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,640
Must have gotten too excited and misheard that.

313
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:38,333
Hey!

314
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:39,417
Stop!

315
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:46,445
Hey!

316
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:47,791
I said stop!

317
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,065
How much?

318
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:31,355
50 baht.

319
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:33,555
Here.

320
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,570
Thank you.

321
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:41,407
What’s with you?

322
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,762
- Surprise! - Surprise!

323
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:54,106
- Yay! - Yay!

324
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:02,800
Are you two alright?

325
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:07,099
Ozone and Dream are super fine.

326
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:09,908
What’s wrong?

327
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,059
Well…

328
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,282
Someone was sneaking around outside.

329
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,210
When I asked him who he was,

330
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:17,632
he ran.

331
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:20,044
Oh, so that was what it was.

332
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:21,783
I thought it was you and Day.

333
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,466
But when I opened the door, there was no one there.

334
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,697
You chased after him?

335
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,708
Yeah.

336
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:29,601
But I couldn’t catch up.

337
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:34,785
Hold on.

338
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Is that him?

339
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
Yeah.

340
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,090
I had never seen him before.

341
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Hang on.

342
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,866
What are you two doing here?

343
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,491
- Surprise. - Surprise.

344
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:19,788
Wait here.

345
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,219
Sit on the sofa.

346
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:22,724
Just a jiffy!

347
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,401
Day, sit here.

348
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,130
What’s that?

349
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:39,752
Ozone.

350
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:46,453
Happy birthday to you.

351
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:51,881
Happy birthday to you.

352
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:58,066
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

353
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:05,438
Happy birth-Day-Night to you.

354
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,890
Happy birthday.

355
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:22,548
Happy birthday.

356
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:33,571
It’s…

357
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,108
It’s nice of you, Dream.

358
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:37,602
But this is no time for that.

359
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,268
You even brought Day and Ozone here.

360
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,857
You should have at least told me.

361
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
More importantly,

362
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:47,176
you and Ozone are in danger.

363
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:48,949
And you stay together?

364
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:51,032
You’ve just made yourself a perfect target!

365
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:53,357
You also nearly let a total stranger in.

366
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,071
What if he got inside and hurt you?

367
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,325
Huh?

368
00:26:56,388 --> 00:26:57,398
I get it.

369
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:00,023
I’m sorry.

370
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,154
I didn’t even think about being a target.

371
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:06,001
But about that stranger,

372
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:07,899
that was out of my control.

373
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:12,117
But I promise I’ll be more careful from now on.

374
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,078
Alright?

375
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:23,718
But you see, Night,

376
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,565
the reason Ozone and I wanted to do this was because

377
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,881
we wanted you and Day to have a good birthday for once.

378
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:33,503
That was all.

379
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,296
I know this is no time for it.

380
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:41,568
I know you’re distressed and worried.

381
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,160
But I just want to see you smile.

382
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,910
Are you mad at me?

383
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,790
No.

384
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:23,106
I–I did a good thing.

385
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:25,311
You can’t just bother them like that.

386
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:27,896
Not to mention the fact that you lied to me.

387
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,604
Blame Dream.

388
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,170
I have nothing to do with that.

389
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:34,268
Is that right?

390
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:36,872
Did she tell you to lie to me?

391
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:39,851
What about this crown?

392
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:41,601
Did she force you to make it?

393
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,579
What about singing Happy Birthday?

394
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,567
Did she make you do that, too?

395
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:48,536
Well, Ozone?

396
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,322
D–D–Dunno, dunno, dunno.

397
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,906
My head hurts, hurts, hurts.

398
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:55,210
So what was it?

399
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:59,360
Are you… hungry?

400
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:04,865
Changing the subject, are you?

401
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:07,288
Are you hungry?

402
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:14,312
Anyway…

403
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:16,259
Happy belated birthday, Night.

404
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:20,275
I hope you’re the happiest man in the world.

405
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,081
I also hope that from now on,

406
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,096
you never have to be sad again.

407
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,125
Thank you.

408
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:36,657
Truly.

409
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:42,882
Night.

410
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:44,642
Yeah?

411
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:47,731
If we’re going to make it through Leap Day,

412
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:51,002
Day and Ozone are the two people we shouldn’t ignore.

413
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:57,183
At least he has been through something similar to you.

414
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:01,004
I think you and Day should work together.

415
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,853
We’re going home now.

416
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:17,642
We’ve bothered you enough for a day.

417
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,028
Thank you for the party, though.

418
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,170
Would you like to take some cake on the go? I’ll wrap it up for you.

419
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,060
Why don’t you stay and have some cake

420
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:31,694
before you leave?

421
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:34,681
Stay.

422
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:36,797
I want cake.

423
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:39,140
Please.

424
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:40,397
I want cake.

425
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,531
Please.

426
00:30:41,545 --> 00:30:42,710
Please, please, please.

427
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:44,322
We’ll stay a while, then.

428
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,091
Yay!

429
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:50,997
Let’s have some cake!

430
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:52,312
Let’s go.

431
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:09,748
Ozone!

432
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:18,665
How on earth am I going to carry him home?

433
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:29,200
Stay the night.

434
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:30,207
It’s late.

435
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:31,345
I don’t want to impose...

436
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:32,364
Alright?

437
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,161
Dream.

438
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:57,896
Dream.

439
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,019
Dream, go and sleep in your room.

440
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:50,900
Here.

441
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:52,444
These are Ozone’s drawings.

442
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,730
He said they have something to do with Leap Day.

443
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
Maybe there’s something you can see.

444
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,370
I’ve been puzzled over them for two days now.

445
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,720
Then… you should see what I have.

446
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,470
Maybe there’s something that makes sense to you.

447
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,770
(Napat Chayutra dies)

448
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,450
(Mad man kills two in mass shooting)

449
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:01,602
What are all these?

450
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:06,352
Autopsy reports, news cuttings,

451
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,968
and information on people who died on February 29.

452
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:20,223
Hey.

453
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,958
Did your cousin tell you

454
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:23,631
what these drawings are?

455
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,915
He only said the stars told him to draw them.

456
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,379
Can he really communicate with stars?

457
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,875
I don’t know.

458
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,807
I believe him, though.

459
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,598
Whatever it is,

460
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,979
I’m certain it has something to do with Leap Day.

461
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:50,631
Is this him?

462
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,499
The man you told me was also born on February 29?

463
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:55,896
Yes.

464
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,150
About what you asked me the other day…

465
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,398
I’ve asked around.

466
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:04,506
Strange things really did happen around him.

467
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Day.

468
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:35,945
Day.

469
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:39,543
Look.

470
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:40,598
What?

471
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:42,019
Take a closer look.

472
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:43,188
Look.

473
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:14,608
That means…

474
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,188
Ozone has always known.

475
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:19,136
We just never knew how to read them.

476
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,974
These aren’t just alphabets.

477
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:33,345
They’re…

478
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:34,407
Yes.

479
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:35,502
They’re numbers.

480
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:43,909
2024.

481
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:46,765
That’s the next leap year.

482
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,940
If these are all leap years,

483
00:38:57,226 --> 00:38:58,666
what do these drawings even tell us?

484
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,391
Colors.

485
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:05,268
The colors tell time.

486
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,345
Look. Look at this.

487
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:10,402
Darker shade. Darker shade. Darker shade.

488
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:11,426
Those indicate nighttime.

489
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:16,416
Lighter shade. Lighter shade. Lighter shade.

490
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Daytime.

491
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:21,496
Here.

492
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:22,669
2008.

493
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,133
Daytime.

494
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:25,515
Look.

495
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:29,134
The mass shooting of 2008

496
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,401
happened during the day.

497
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:49,373
Ozone!

498
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,340
Ozone!

499
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,521
Ozone!

500
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Does that mean…

501
00:39:58,505 --> 00:39:59,964
The coming Leap Day curse will...

502
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:00,998
Yes.

503
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,440
The coming Leap Day curse will happen during the day.

504
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,806
The delivery notes of the day I was born?

505
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,856
It has something to do with Leap Day.

506
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
(Everyone will know what you did.)

507
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:26,082
Help! Help!

508
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:27,162
Ozone, what’s wrong?

509
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:28,616
Night…

510
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,930
Night.

511
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,401
I promise to take good care of you.

512
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:36,825
Whatever it takes.

513
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:40,678
He’s here again. He’s here again.

514
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,231
Scared. Scared. Scared.

515
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:43,362
There!

516
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:45,194
Night!

517
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:46,502
Dream! Dream!

518
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,151
Night!
