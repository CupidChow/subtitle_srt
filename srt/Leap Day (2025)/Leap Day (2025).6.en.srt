1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:03,598
Do any of your drawings have something to do with Leap Day?

2
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:10,801
Day. Day. Day!

3
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,263
- Surprise! - Surprise!

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,160
What are you two doing here?

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:20,378
Happy birthday to you.

6
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,058
It’s nice of you, Dream.

7
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:24,747
But this is no time for that.

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,311
The reason Ozone and I wanted to do this was because

9
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:30,807
we wanted you and Day to have a good birthday for once.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,198
Stay the night.

11
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:33,081
I don’t want to impose...

12
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:34,092
Alright?

13
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:36,543
These are Ozone’s drawings.

14
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,816
He said they have something to do with Leap Day.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,360
These aren’t just alphabets.

16
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:43,729
They’re numbers.

17
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,490
Quick!

18
00:01:10,752 --> 00:01:11,752
Run, run, run!

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,430
Day!

20
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:43,816
Get up.

21
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,990
Get up!

22
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,075
Night.

23
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,446
Night!

24
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:21,252
Night!

25
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:22,950
Night! Night!

26
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:25,813
Night!

27
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,786
Day! Day! Help!

28
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:29,004
Day! Day! Day!

29
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:29,467
Ozone?

30
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:29,994
Day!

31
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:30,603
- Day! - Ozone?

32
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,213
Day!

33
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:32,418
What’s wrong?

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
Is it the stars again?

35
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:35,304
Calm down. Slow down.

36
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,332
What’s wrong?

37
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:37,393
Is it the stars?

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
Ozone.

39
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,210
Alright. Alright.

40
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:41,601
Do you remember the planets?

41
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Do you?

42
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,464
Come on.

43
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:46,001
Recite their names with me.

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,369
- Mercury. - Mercury.

45
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,384
- Venus. - Venus.

46
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,303
- Earth. - Earth.

47
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:50,310
- Mars. - Mars.

48
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:51,216
- Jupiter. - Jupiter.

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,924
- Saturn. - Saturn.

50
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:52,755
- Uranus. - Uranus.

51
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,423
- Neptune. - Neptune.

52
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:54,438
Look at me.

53
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,256
Wrong.

54
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:53,240
Wrong.

55
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,207
Wrong.

56
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:55,256
It’s all wrong!

57
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:56,190
All wrong!

58
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,720
My drawings are all flipped.

59
00:03:57,907 --> 00:03:58,655
All wrong.

60
00:03:58,836 --> 00:03:59,267
Wrong!

61
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,407
All wrong!

62
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,312
- Ozone. - My drawings!

63
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,413
Ozone, stop!

64
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:03,092
Day!

65
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,055
- Calm down. Ozone, stop. - They’re all flipped!

66
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,361
- Calm down. - Day! Day!

67
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,955
Hold on, Ozone.

68
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,666
My drawings are all flipped, Day!

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,887
- Stay calm. Calm down. - They’re all flipped!

70
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,552
- Stop! - They’re all wrong!

71
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:12,224
Calm down.

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,506
Ozone, they’re not wrong.

73
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,506
- They are. They are. Day. - Calm down.

74
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:16,601
They’re not wrong, Ozone.

75
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,066
They’re not.

76
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:20,558
Why don’t you sit down?

77
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:21,721
I’ll explain.

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,903
All wrong. They’re all wrong.

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,250
(2000 - Day)

80
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:31,604
What exactly are you going to explain?

81
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,012
We found it.

82
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,003
Found what?

83
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:36,495
The loophole.

84
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,767
- What? - What?

85
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,072
Look carefully.

86
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:43,656
These drawings are not upside down.

87
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,976
These things the stars told Ozone to write

88
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,300
aren’t illegible alphabets.

89
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,733
They’re actually not alphabets at all.

90
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,399
They’re numbers.

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,312
(2020 - Night)

92
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,247
Numbers… (2020 - Night)

93
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,650
(2020 - Night)

94
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,198
They’re not just any numbers.

95
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:09,061
These are all leap years.

96
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,684
The alphabets you wrote, Ozone,

97
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,201
are not alphabets.

98
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,021
They’re upside-down numbers.

99
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,370
(2004 - Night)

100
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,604
The next Leap Day curse,

101
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,144
as Ozone tells us here,

102
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:25,966
will happen

103
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,735
during the day.

104
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:31,333
How do you know?

105
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:32,573
Colors.

106
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,112
Darker shades mean nighttime.

107
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:36,966
Lighter shades mean daytime.

108
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,676
This one is blue

109
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,170
which means it’s daytime.

110
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,653
I’ve thought through every Leap Day incident,

111
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,676
and each time, it actually matches.

112
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:51,871
Is that true for you as well, Night?

113
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:52,895
No.

114
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,107
My incidents and Day’s

115
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:56,866
don’t happen at the same time every year.

116
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:58,658
Day’s incidents align.

117
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,910
I believe what Ozone drew was for Day’s Leap Day curse.

118
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,313
Simply put,

119
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,596
what the stars made Ozone draw

120
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,596
is giving us some clues.

121
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,213
Like what time of the day the curse will happen on each February 29.

122
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:16,823
Now we know the next year that it will happen

123
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:19,678
and the time of the day that it will.

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,890
(2024 - Day)

125
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:25,223
That leaves the place.

126
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,372
Where will it happen next?

127
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:28,820
Where?

128
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,096
Where?

129
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,701
The curse will strike no matter where we are.

130
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,007
Knowing when it will happen

131
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,801
means we might be able to choose to be at the safest place.

132
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,072
This time,

133
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,570
we finally have the upper hand.

134
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,163
Ozone and I will go home after class

135
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,309
and see if there’s anything more on this matter.

136
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,496
Ozone may have drawn something strange without knowing.

137
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:55,126
We’ll be back here late at night.

138
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,447
Dream and I will look through the Leap Day files once more.

139
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,338
Maybe we’ll find some kind of pattern.

140
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,449
Hello, Mr. Night.

141
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,303
This came for you.

142
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:08,743
Thank you.

143
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:12,706
Let’s go.

144
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,630
I’m going to class.

145
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,350
Wait for me here like usual, Ozone.

146
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:32,707
Night.

147
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
What?

148
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:40,153
Night…

149
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,870
What about him?

150
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:06,352
Night.

151
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,350
Night…

152
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,098
Why don’t you tell me later when you know?

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I’ll be right back.

154
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:20,403
Night is going to die.

155
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:23,986
Night…

156
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:26,440
Night is going to die.

157
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,210
(Labor and delivery report by Dr. Wiwat)

158
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Dream.

159
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,090
Hmm?

160
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,846
I think Day is in trouble.

161
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
Heavy.

162
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:26,304
Here.

163
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:27,573
Let me help.

164
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:30,950
We have to bring every single drawing, Ozone.

165
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,706
Are you sure this is everything?

166
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:38,936
Heavy.

167
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:40,636
How can it be heavy for you?

168
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,700
I’m literally carrying it.

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Heavy.

170
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Did you find anything?

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,458
This.

172
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,989
It’s from the man from yesterday.

173
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:36,626
Medical record of my birth?

174
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,107
Dr. Wiwat is the man I told you about.

175
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,318
The man who was born on February 29,

176
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,707
but is living a normal life.

177
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:59,049
But…

178
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:00,976
But where did he get this?

179
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,501
How can we be sure this is legit?

180
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,464
I talked to someone I know who’s a nurse.

181
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,950
This document…

182
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,230
It’s certified.

183
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,064
I don’t know where he got it from,

184
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,016
but one thing I know for sure:

185
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,652
He’s trying to tell us that

186
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,030
Professor Wiwat...

187
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:27,960
has something to do with Leap Day.

188
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:29,223
Clearly he does!

189
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:33,975
Crap!

190
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:34,586
Day.

191
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:35,556
Day. Day.

192
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:36,546
What’s wrong?

193
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,032
I don’t understand.

194
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,540
He was born on February 29 like me.

195
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,203
If he really was the doctor who delivered me,

196
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:45,876
I don’t think it was a coincidence.

197
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,429
He could be responsible for my mother’s death.

198
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:50,943
Hold on. Everyone, calm down.

199
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,135
We don’t even know for sure

200
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,067
if Professor Wiwat has anything to do with this.

201
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,316
All we know is that

202
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:57,812
he was also born on February 29,

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,730
and he was the doctor delivering you.

204
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:02,503
It could all be a coincidence.

205
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,835
There’s no such thing as a coincidence anymore, Dream.

206
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,513
Nobody wants to work on their birthdays,

207
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,200
especially if that work involves life and death.

208
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:15,796
And if we’re talking realistically here

209
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,681
according to what actually happened,

210
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:24,404
nobody wants to be responsible for someone’s death on their birthdays.

211
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,629
Professor Wiwat clearly has something to do with this.

212
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,896
One way or another.

213
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:33,212
Make an appointment with him for me.

214
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:34,696
I’ll talk to him myself.

215
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:36,032
I’ll get my answers.

216
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:40,683
Okay.

217
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,490
(Labor and Delivery Report)

218
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:52,536
I scheduled an appointment with Professor Wiwat at noon tomorrow.

219
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,603
Meet me on campus.

220
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:55,015
Bring the report with you.

221
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:19,767
He’s here again.

222
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:20,429
He’s here again.

223
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:21,386
He’s here again.

224
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,175
He’s here again.

225
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:22,996
He’s here again!

226
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:24,566
He’s here again!

227
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:25,691
- Ozone, what’s wrong? - He’s here again!

228
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:26,281
Go take a look.

229
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:26,836
Go.

230
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:27,584
Go.

231
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:28,732
Go. Go. Go.

232
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,495
Go. Go.

233
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,701
Go.

234
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:38,587
Day!

235
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:45,576
You have a death wish, kid?

236
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,395
Look where you’re going!

237
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:47,809
You look where you’re going!

238
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:49,009
Don’t you see a pedestrian?

239
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:03,996
Ozone.

240
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,167
Ozone, what’s wrong?

241
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,096
I…

242
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:07,889
I…

243
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,498
I’m scared.

244
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,690
I’m scared.

245
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:13,395
Every–Everyone is in danger.

246
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,503
It’s alright.

247
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:16,993
I’m fine.

248
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:18,447
I’m right here.

249
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,870
I–I’m scared.

250
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,981
I’m scared something will happen to you.

251
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:25,855
It’s okay now.

252
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:26,935
I’m safe.

253
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,730
(Lecture Room 3)

254
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,056
Night.

255
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,970
Did I make you wait long?

256
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:52,256
I’m talking to you, mister.

257
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,229
You look especially adorable today.

258
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,930
Dream.

259
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,464
Dream, it’s embarrassing.

260
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,170
So what?

261
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,541
Here. I got this for you.

262
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,220
Thanks.

263
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,367
What?

264
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,047
What are you so embarrassed about?

265
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:14,738
What are you smiling at?

266
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:16,775
I’m not.

267
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,100
You clearly are.

268
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:19,718
I’m not.

269
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:23,595
Do I have ink on my face again?

270
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
No.

271
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,100
I have something on my lips, though.

272
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,004
What?

273
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,403
Stop it.

274
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:41,483
Dream.

275
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,984
I promise

276
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,201
to do my best to take care of you.

277
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,563
I won’t let anything bad happen to you.

278
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,872
Whatever it takes.

279
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:00,947
Really?

280
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Really.

281
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,267
Day.

282
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:40,221
Day.

Wake up!

Night, wake up!

332
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:48,509
Wake up. Wake up.

333
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:49,741
Night, wake up!

334
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,467
Night.

335
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,289
Night, wake up!

00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:53,155
Night!

337

Night!

340
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:18,361
Help! Help!

Ozone.

342
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:20,981
Ozone, what’s wrong?

343
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:21,792
Ozone.

344
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:23,053
Is it the stars?

345
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:24,589
Ozone.

346
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,989
Dead. Dead. Dead.

347
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:27,960
Calm down. Calm down.

348
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,755
- Dead. - I’m here.

349
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:30,595
I’m right here.

350
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:31,983
Dead. Dead. Dead.

351
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,887
- Dead. - Calm down.

352
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:35,120
Please calm down.

353
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:36,712
Nobody is dead.

354
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:38,480
Everyone is safe.

355
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:40,227
I am safe.

356
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:41,801
Dream is safe.

357
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:43,410
Night is also safe.

358
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:46,213
Night.

359
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,416
Night.

360
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:48,986
Night.

361
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:50,676
Night is dead.

362
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,455
Night is dead.

363
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:52,853
Are you worried about Night?

364
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:54,438
Twice.

365
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,370
Twice now.

366
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:56,690
Night is dead twice now.

367
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:57,813
Night has died twice now.

368
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:10,567
Night.

369
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,446
If Professor Wiwat really had something to do with this,

370
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,460
what would you do?

371
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,498
I’ll make him tell us everything about Leap Day,

372
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:17,929
like how to end it.

373
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,652
I don’t think this is going to impact me much,

374
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,410
but I can’t say the same for Day.

375
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,910
If Professor Wiwat really was involved with this,

376
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:26,278
it’s going to blow up for Day.

377
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:28,135
Night.

378
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,307
We need to talk.

379
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:37,872
About what?

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay.

381
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,646
Let’s talk after we meet the professor.

382
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:48,636
You probably don’t want to wait.

383
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,636
This affects you directly.

384
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:56,401
Let’s just go.

385
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:57,804
He’s waiting for us.

386
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:00,555
If you say so.

387
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:02,813
Stay with Dream, alright?

388
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:05,881
Be careful, you both.

389
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:11,980
What’s wrong, Ozone?

390
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
You sure?

391
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,183
Say goodbye.

392
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,647
Let’s go to the library.

393
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,360
You don’t have to tell me now.

394
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:33,144
Tell me when we get to the library, alright?

395
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,530
Dream, look. Look.

396
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Look.

397
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:47,586
What?

398
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:48,686
There’s nothing.

399
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:51,701
Ozone.

400
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:53,172
Believe me, there’s nothing there.

401
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:54,306
You must have imagined it.

402
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:57,604
Let’s go to the library.

403
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,958
What is it?

404
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Well…

405
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:11,589
Well what?

406
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,104
It’s that bad?

407
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,606
Ozone saw you die in his dreams twice.

408
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,140
So it’s just about dreams.

409
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,423
You got me concerned for a sec.

410
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,384
I think you should stop with superstitions,

411
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:31,384
and focus on the task at hand.

412
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:34,096
Do you really think

413
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:36,126
Ozone can foresee how I’ll die?

414
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,029
You saw his drawings about Leap Day,

415
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,049
and you still don’t believe him?

416
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:45,426
That’s one thing.

417
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,312
But has his dream ever come true before?

418
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:51,516
Exactly.

419
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,709
I appreciate you worrying about me,

420
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,646
but you might want to focus on yourself for now.

421
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,956
Are you sure you’re alright

422
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,303
meeting Professor Wiwat?

423
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:13,352
Yeah.

424
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:14,393
I’m fine.

425
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
Let’s go.

426
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:25,318
What is it?

427
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,176
Ozone, it’s alright.

428
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,003
No one can hurt you while I’m here.

429
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,435
Don’t worry.

430
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:33,976
Alright?

431
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,601
- Let’s go. - I don’t like being watched.

432
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:40,267
I don’t like being watched.

433
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:41,373
I don’t like being watched.

434
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:44,063
Ozone.

435
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:45,813
Nobody is watching you.

436
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:47,827
Trust me.

437
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Nobody is watching.

438
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:54,311
Let’s go find some interesting books in the library.

439
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,335
Alright?

440
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:17,676
Ozone.

441
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,904
Let’s go sit over there.

442
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:20,007
Come on.

443
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,987
He’s there. He’s there.

444
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,196
- Take a look. - Where?

445
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,080
- Take a look. - What is it, Ozone?

446
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:40,386
Take a look.

447
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,393
There’s no one.

448
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,378
Let’s go sit down.

449
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:47,824
I don’t like it.

450
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:48,750
I don’t like it.

451
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:49,801
There’s nothing there.

452
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:50,475
There really is nothing.

453
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:51,152
I’m scared.

454
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:52,306
- I’m scared. - Ozone, calm down.

455
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:53,055
Let’s go sit down.

456
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:53,820
I’m scared.

457
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,567
I don’t like it.

458
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:55,343
I’m scared.

459
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:56,126
I’m scared.

460
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,170
Ozone, you gotta be quiet. We’re in the library.

461
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,026
Look at me, Ozone.

462
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:00,590
Ozone.

463
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,340
There really is no one watching you.

464
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:03,436
Let’s go.

465
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,006
Ozone.

466
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,006
I’m scared. I’m scared. I’m scared.

467
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,625
- I’m scared. I’m scared. I’m scared. - Calm down.

468
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:08,086
I’m scared.

469
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:09,103
There.

470
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:16,027
Ozone.

471
00:24:16,116 --> 00:24:16,609
Scared.

472
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:17,767
Ozone, how about this?

473
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,236
I’ll go take a look.

474
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:20,904
I’ll handle it.

475
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,258
I will be right back.

476
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:24,618
So just wait for me right here.

477
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:25,909
Okay?

478
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:22,523
Ozone?

479
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Ozone!

480
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:29,013
Ozone!

481
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:31,136
Ozone!

482
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:32,161
Ozone!

483
00:26:33,043 --> 00:26:34,043
Sorry.

484
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:47,973
Ready?

485
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Ready.

486
00:26:57,773 --> 00:26:58,773
Ozone!

487
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,540
Ozone!

488
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,036
What are you doing?

489
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,140
This is a library.

490
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:06,387
Professor.

491
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,024
Have you seen my friend?

492
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,340
He’s a man with short hair.

493
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:13,052
He wears glasses and a green striped shirt.

494
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:14,924
He’s autistic.

495
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,696
He was sitting at the table just now,

496
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:18,441
but he was gone when I got back.

497
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:19,678
Slow down.

498
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,340
Maybe he’s in the restroom.

499
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:23,293
I’ve checked and he’s not there.

500
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:25,593
I’ll ask around.

501
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:26,986
Wait here.

502
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,001
Thank you.

503
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:36,046
Well?

504
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,040
You make an appointment with me.

505
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,580
Do you want to talk to me?

506
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:46,353
You were born on February 29, weren’t you?

507
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,750
Yes.

508
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,153
Did you find him?

509
00:28:01,544 --> 00:28:02,576
No, Professor.

510
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,461
There’s no one in the restroom.

511
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:06,606
Are you sure?

512
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:07,736
Did you check everywhere?

513
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,049
Yes.

514
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:11,169
Excuse me for now.

515
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,401
I have to meet up with my friends.

516
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
Thanks.

517
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,384
Why don’t you go back inside?

518
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,741
If he comes back and doesn’t see you,

519
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:23,035
things could be worse.

520
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,786
Professor, can you please make an announcement again?

521
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:29,566
Of course.

522
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:30,895
Go wait inside.

523
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,078
Thank you.

524
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,703
But you knew that.

525
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,182
We’ve talked about it before, I remember,

526
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,766
about how we were born on the same day.

527
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,035
All three of us share the same birthday.

528
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,690
Alright.

529
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,152
So we do.

530
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,120
Is that why you wanted to see me?

531
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,136
You’re the doctor who delivered me.

532
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:16,336
You’re the reason I was born on a leap day.

533
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,610
(Labor and Delivery Report by Dr. Wiwat)

534
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:08,156
I knew this day would come.

535
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,495
I was just thinking to myself yesterday

536
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,803
what I’d do if it ever came.

537
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,347
The day a baby I delivered

538
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:25,378
came asking about the death of their mother.

539
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
I’m sorry.

540
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:07,166
I tried my best

541
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,152
to save your mother.

542
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
That’s it?

543
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:21,572
His mother died.

544
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,824
That’s all you can say?

545
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:28,147
You’re going to be a doctor one day.

546
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:30,136
When a mistake is made,

547
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,801
this is all we can say.

548
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:36,704
Do the people you love

549
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,161
die every February 29?

550
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,830
What do you mean?

551
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:44,601
I mean exactly what I said.

552
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,120
Do the people you love

553
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:49,264
die every Leap Day?

554
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,850
What do you know about Leap Day?

555
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:53,646
Why did it say here

556
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:56,261
that you induced my mother’s labor?

557
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:04,529
Hello.

558
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:05,506
Excuse me.

559
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,259
Can you please make an announcement again?

560
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:07,987
Of course.

561
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:10,527
I’ll make sure we keep it repeating.

562
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:11,032
Thank you.

563
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:12,189
I have to go for now.

564
00:32:12,384 --> 00:32:13,384
Yes.

565
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:19,801
What is he talking about, Night?

566
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:21,303
Please answer his questions.

567
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:31,406
Yes, I was born on a leap day,

568
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,067
but my beloved doesn't die every leap day.

569
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,040
Are you out of your mind?

570
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:43,235
Not even once?

571
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,930
Of course not.

572
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,424
I’ve been married to my wife for 20 years.

573
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,764
We have a daughter, who’s now 16.

574
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:51,835
They are all alive and healthy.

575
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,400
What about your relatives?

576
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,875
Your family?

577
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,989
If you really must know…

578
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,461
I’m an orphan.

579
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,070
Just like you.

580
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,280
My parents abandoned me when I was a child.

581
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:12,643
I grew up in an orphanage.

582
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:13,664
I won a scholarship.

583
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,743
I never knew them.

584
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,904
I don’t know anything about Leap Day or whatever you’re saying.

585
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,149
You’re a medical student.

586
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,696
You shouldn’t waste time on such nonsense.

587
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,016
You think what we’re talking about is nonsense?

588
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:35,935
Someone we love

589
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:40,684
dies when February 29 comes around.

590
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,013
We just need to know if you,

591
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:48,360
who were born on the same day,

592
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,603
ever had to go through the same thing.

593
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,004
So if you went through something like that,

594
00:33:55,704 --> 00:33:57,652
or knew how to fix it,

595
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,501
please…

596
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Just please tell us.

597
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,775
We can’t keep living like this.

598
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:25,446
I can’t help you.

599
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,060
I’ve never experienced anything like you have.

600
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,749
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

601
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:40,447
I’m sorry

602
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,853
for your mother’s death.

603
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,104
Why weren’t you with your loved ones

604
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,404
on your birthday?

605
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:00,867
Yeah, why not?

606
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:02,713
It only comes around once every four years,

607
00:35:02,743 --> 00:35:04,903
why didn’t you call off work and celebrate it that day?

608
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,200
What do you want me to say?

609
00:35:09,963 --> 00:35:10,963
I love what I do.

610
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,620
Your mother was my patient.

611
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,150
She was in labor.

612
00:35:15,443 --> 00:35:16,723
Of course I had to come to work.

613
00:35:16,884 --> 00:35:18,206
It was part of my job.

614
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:27,352
Students.

615
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:32,403
I’m your professor.

616
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,273
I am really sorry for your loss.

617
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,730
But I have nothing to do with this.

618
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:00,803
If that’s all you’re here for,

619
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,310
please, be dismissed.

620
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,490
I have work to do.

621
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Please.

622
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,455
What now?

623
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:04,296
I don’t know.

624
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,930
(Everyone will know what you did.)

625
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,661
I’m an orphan.

626
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Just like you.

627
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:35,307
Hey.

628
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:36,727
Hold on.

629
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,041
Just now, the professor said

630
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,300
he’s an orphan…

631
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
“Just like you.”

632
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:47,103
Yeah, so what?

633
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,577
Wait, how did he know I’m an...

634
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:01,806
Attentions to all students, please be on the lookout for Ozone.

635
00:38:01,903 --> 00:38:03,518
He wears a green stripe top

636
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,200
and a pair of black shorts.

637
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:06,698
He wears glasses,

638
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:07,681
has short hair,

639
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,903
and is approximately 165 centimeters tall.

640
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:11,741
Please bring him to the library if you find him.

641
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,409
(Missed calls) His friend is waiting there.

642
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,053
Thank you.

643
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:15,586
More than 30 missed calls from Dream.

644
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:18,963
Crap…

645
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,493
Ozone disappeared.

646
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:43,170
Do you think it’s the same guy who went to your place?

647
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:45,644
Die.

648
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,021
Die.

649
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:50,703
Dream!

650
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:51,933
Dream!

651
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:54,872
We’re all gonna die.

652
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,530
Ozone!

653
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,504
Ozone!

654
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:02,269
Night!

655
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:03,516
No!
