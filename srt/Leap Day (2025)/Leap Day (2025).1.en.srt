1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,560
Day and night must meet.

2
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,653
Day and night must meet.

3
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:47,893
Day and night must meet.

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,300
27 FEBRUARY 2020

5
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,926
Our film is a mix of seven genres.

6
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,566
It’s a hybrid genre.

7
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:40,653
You know what I mean, Prof?

8
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,393
Well, go on.

9
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:44,173
We have action…

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,506
Oh.

11
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,206
Sci-fi.

12
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:45,560
Ah.

13
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,226
Thriller.

14
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:46,560
Oh!

15
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,820
Add BL into the mix.

16
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:48,333
BL as well?

17
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:48,706
Yes!

18
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:49,586
It’s romantic.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,042
Next you’re gonna tell me there’s a UFO.

20
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,513
Alright. Let’s add that...

21
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,733
There’s going to be a UFO zooming in and…

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,900
F, it is.

23
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:56,680
Good, good.

24
00:01:56,713 --> 00:01:58,420
Next group, get ready to present.

25
00:01:58,453 --> 00:01:59,060
Let’s move on.

26
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,533
That jerk Day is late again.

27
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,440
I’m adding aliens into the mix.

28
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:03,886
Not just aliens…

29
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,286
Hello?

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,460
Day, where are you?

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,226
I’m here.

32
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:20,820
Hurry up!

33
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:21,386
I am!

34
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:22,060
Just get here already.

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Got it.

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,540
Damn it.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,706
Rattikarn.

38
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:33,726
Please.

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,006
Hello.

41
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,146
My name is Rattikarn,

42
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:41,700
a first-year medical student.

43
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:45,166
My student ID is 63130010005.

44
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,910
This is my first-year research topic:

45
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,446
Golden Hour.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,106
The first hour right after an accident

47
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,340
is the most crucial period of time for the patient.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,740
A professional and immediate help

49
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,846
can definitely reduce the damage.

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,206
I want to publish my studies

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,760
because I believe that

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,886
losing someone you love

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
is something nobody wants to go through.

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,320
The film project I’d like to present today

55
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:28,860
is called Leap Day.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,800
Our film

57
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,520
is told through the perspective of a person who,

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,173
every four years,

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
the person he loves most

60
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,073
must die on his birthday.

61
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,333
This character is born on February 29.

62
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,986
Every four years,

63
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,706
he gets to celebrate his actual birthday.

64
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,493
But believe it or not…

65
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,490
He never looks forward to it.

66
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,740
The only thing he feels approaching is fear.

67
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,600
Because he doesn't know

68
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:10,533
when the person he loves will die,

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,400
or what time,

70
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,840
or how.

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,493
One thing’s for sure…

72
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,006
No one ever survives.

73
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,153
That’s good.

74
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:27,153
You guys, take this as an example.

75
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,780
The thrill lies in how they die

76
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,480
and when.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,920
Am I right?

78
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:34,093
That’s very creative.

79
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:35,393
I love it.

80
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,066
The struggle is real!

81
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,780
Well.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,353
If you’re done laughing,

83
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,000
can we move on?

84
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,033
Hold on.

85
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,573
I have a question.

86
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:56,146
Did you come up with how the people he loves
will die?

87
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,950
The first time is when he’s born.

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,160
The child bonds with the mother even in the womb.

89
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,966
Four years later,

90
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,180
his father dies in an accident.

91
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,866
A very unlikely accident.

92
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,473
He’s lucky enough to have his big sister to take care of him.

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,880
But then again,

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,893
four years later,

95
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,633
his sister gets killed in a mass shooting.

96
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,630
For real?

97
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,310
If this was real life,

98
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,609
this character was one hell of a hapless bastard!

99
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,433
He’s like a damn jinx!

100
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,706
Well, what’s the solution?

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,806
How does this story end?

102
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,566
Do they all die?

103
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:51,250
Is there a sequel?

104
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,900
I haven’t seen the end of it yet.

105
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,750
Is it, like, up to interpretation?

106
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,173
Whoa, I love it!

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,673
This is good!

108
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,560
What a hopeless story.

109
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:03,653
It’s a real struggle!

110
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:04,846
What an unlucky dude.

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,726
What’s wrong with you, Night?

112
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,773
You don’t reply to any of my texts.

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,770
You don’t answer any of my calls.

114
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,880
It’s been a week.

115
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,826
I’m talking to you!

116
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,173
I don’t want anything to do with you.

117
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,066
I’m a medical student now.

118
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,693
Can’t you guess from all that?

119
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,006
What are you doing?

120
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,516
If you didn’t want anything to do with me,

121
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,510
I doubt we’d have gotten this far.

122
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,393
I’m asking what’s wrong.

123
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,993
Why are you avoiding me?

124
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,360
Are you bipolar or something?

125
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:19,596
You think you can just come and go as you please?

126
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,166
Why can’t you just be clear with me!

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Listen.

128
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,913
Stop bothering me.

129
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,060
“Bother”?

130
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,966
If what I’ve been doing is “bothering” you,

131
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:33,026
then just know

132
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,226
I haven’t even begun to bother you half as much as I actually want to.

133
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,873
Just go, Dream.

134
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,526
Please.

135
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,006
You’re so damn annoying.

136
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,393
Day.

137
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,009
Wanna come over and watch the football match later tonight?

138
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,033
No.

139
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,700
What?

140
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,400
What the hell’s with him?

141
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,140
I told him to keep the phone close by…

142
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,433
Day and night must meet.

143
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,173
Day and night must meet.

144
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:05,886
Day…

145
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:07,413
Night…

146
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,220
Day and night must meet.

147
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Ozone!

148
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Ozone!

149
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Ozone!

150
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,750
Ozone.

151
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
Ozone!

152
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,586
Ozone, what are you doing in there?

153
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:36,940
Get out.

154
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:37,786
No.

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,773
I’m staying in here.

156
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,273
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,840
You’re going to freeze to death.

158
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:40,800
Get out of there.

159
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,880
Careful.

160
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,110
No…

161
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,573
I told you it’s dangerous.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,466
I… I won’t…

163
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:50,986
I won’t.

164
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:51,700
Stars.

165
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:52,353
Stars.

166
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,413
Stars.

167
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:55,093
Stars. Stars. Stars.

168
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,753
They keep talking.

169
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,473
They keep talking.

170
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,313
I’m scared.

171
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,580
I don’t like it.

172
00:10:58,613 --> 00:10:59,293
No.

173
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:00,006
They keep talking.

174
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,306
The stars are talking.

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
The stars?

176
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,886
What are they telling you?

177
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,280
I don’t like it.

178
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,186
I don’t like it…

179
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,456
Ozone, what are the stars saying?

180
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,040
- If you tell me…
- The stars!

181
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,040
I’ll take you to the planetarium.

182
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,450
Well?

183
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,086
What are the stars saying?

184
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,206
Die…

185
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,073
Die.

186
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,140
We’ll all die.

187
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,006
We’ll all die.

188
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:40,520
We’ll all die.

189
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:41,400
We’ll all die.

190
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:42,046
We’ll all die.

191
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,673
We’ll all die.

192
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:43,753
We’ll all die.

193
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,100
- Ouch!
- I’m sorry.

194
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,626
Oh, it’s you, Dream.

195
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Hi, Win.

196
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,053
Are you on the way home?

197
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,733
Yes, I am.

198
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,393
Wanna have dinner?

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,766
I’m… already meeting up with some friends.

200
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,933
Oh.

201
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,513
Mind if I join you?

202
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:17,753
I don’t think that’s...

203
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:18,673
Win.

204
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:19,946
Good thing I found you.

205
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:20,853
Hello, Professor.

206
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,880
Hello, Professor.

207
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,080
Can you take over my class tomorrow?

208
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,413
Sure.

209
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,453
I have to go out of town for a bit.

210
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,286
I just realized it’s going to be my birthday.

211
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,593
I’m not getting forgetful with age, mind you.

212
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:33,773
I can’t help it

213
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,713
when it only comes around once every four years.

214
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,540
Oh?

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,440
Your birthday is the 29th?

216
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,033
That’s why I keep forgetting it, right?

217
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,833
My family called to remind me

218
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,293
so I have to go home suddenly.

219
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,680
I’ll leave the class in your care.

220
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Of course, Prof.

221
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,120
Goodbye.

222
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,146
Bye.

223
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,766
I guess you can start calling me Professor Win now.

224
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,246
Oh…

225
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:01,366
I guess so.

226
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,546
Alright.

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Let’s grab dinner.

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,253
I think you’ll probably be busy preparing for class tomorrow.

229
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:07,973
I can’t possibly bother you.

230
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:08,933
I have a bit of time...

231
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:09,953
Bye!

232
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,166
Let me see.

233
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:16,766
No need to be scared.

234
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:17,826
It won’t hurt at all.

235
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,146
Will you let me see?

236
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,066
Good. You’re doing good.

237
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:20,993
Just a little.

238
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,013
And we’re all done.

239
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,226
There is nothing wrong with him.

240
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,760
Like I told you before,

241
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:38,760
people with autism are way more sensitive than other people.

242
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,913
This could be linked to what interests him.

243
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,006
From the chart here,

244
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:48,553
it seems Ozone is especially interested in outer space, isn’t he?

245
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,753
Yes.

246
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
But…

247
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
It’s never gotten to this point.

248
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,746
Some autistic people

249
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,453
are quick to detect vibration from far off.

250
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,213
Are you telling me…

251
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,193
that he really can hear the stars?

252
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,780
People with autism have a special sense

253
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:16,146
that we haven’t even begun to touch the surface of.

254
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,420
It’s all about wavelengths.

255
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:22,513
Like how we know dogs can smell and hear

256
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,160
much more than we humans can.

257
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:27,326
As for his behavior of hiding in narrow spaces,

258
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:29,906
it’s likely because he feels unsafe.

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,053
I suggest you deal with this issue

260
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,806
by spending a lot of time with him for the time being.

261
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,420
Having someone familiar around

262
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,200
will make him feel better.

263
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Yes.

264
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:44,913
27 FEBRUARY 2020

265
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:49,206
28 FEBRUARY 2020

266
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,250
Ready.

267
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Ready for what?

268
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:17,620
Planetarium.

269
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Ozone.

270
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
Let’s not go out for the next few days.

271
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,153
I’m staying in.

272
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,653
I’m not going to class, either.

273
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:27,673
Ready!

274
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,593
Ozone.

275
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,560
Let’s stay in for a few days.

276
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:36,320
Let’s wait it out for a bit.

277
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,540
I told you about the stars.

278
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,846
You said we’d go to the planetarium.

279
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,260
I told you.

280
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:46,413
I told you.

281
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,453
I told you.

282
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,306
I told you.

283
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,106
I’m ready.

284
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,873
Ready. Ready. Ready!

285
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:50,540
Okay, okay, okay!

286
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:51,653
- Ready!
- Stop it!

287
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Fine.

288
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,833
We’ll go.

289
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,240
But you have to listen to every word I say, alright?

290
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,813
No acting out.

291
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:05,520
We go home when I say we go home.

292
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,860
Do you hear me?

293
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Ready.

294
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:20,040
(Lecture Hall)

295
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,693
Hold the pipette vertically

296
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,846
and slowly transfer the liquid into the test tube.

297
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,246
Try it.

298
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:28,560
Please partner up in pairs,

299
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:30,820
and hand in your assignment to Professor Wiwat within the next week.

300
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,880
Alright?

301
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,726
Win.

302
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,153
Yes?

303
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,150
Is it okay if we do this as a group of three?

304
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,980
No can do.

305
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,200
Professor Wiwat insists you do it in pairs.

306
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:44,480
It’s okay.

307
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,866
I’ll...

308
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:45,886
Dream.

309
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,740
You don’t have a partner, do you?

310
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,673
What do you say you pair up with me?

311
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,030
Night.

312
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:00,180
Night.

313
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,920
You don’t have a partner, do you?

314
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,646
He and I will be lab partners.

315
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,826
You alright with that, Night?

316
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:10,720
Yes, I am.

317
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,700
I guess it saves you the trouble of being a freshman’s lab partner.

318
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,306
Alright, guys.

319
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,910
Let’s try it.

320
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,500
You’re treating me like I’m already dead.

321
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,902
What the hell are you saying?

322
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,320
Well, I don’t know.

323
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:53,173
You’ve been refusing to even look at me,

324
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,626
answer my questions,

325
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,300
let alone talk to me.

326
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,780
So I can’t help but think maybe I’m already dead but...

327
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,820
Don’t ever say that again.

328
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
Please.

329
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
Night.

330
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,833
Go home after class today.

331
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:22,853
Don’t stay out.

332
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
You don’t have any afternoon classes, right?

333
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,840
Just go home after this.

334
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,093
Work on this paper.

335
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:33,266
I need it by tomorrow.

336
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,173
Tomorrow?

337
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,353
If you can’t do that, partner up with that senior Win.

338
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
What?

339
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,420
Night?

340
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,773
Day.

341
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:32,806
Yeah.

342
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,886
Which one do you want?

343
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,146
Wow.

344
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
Are you sure you’ll play with all of those?

345
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,870
Yes.

346
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,046
Alright?

347
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,940
Dream.

348
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:49,493
Yes?

349
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,693
Wanna join us for a hotpot?

350
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:51,713
Hotpot?

351
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,253
You guys go ahead.

352
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,293
I have to work on Professor Wiwat’s paper.

353
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,840
It’s due next week, isn’t it?

354
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,306
I want to get it done early.

355
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,980
My hands are full these days.

356
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:03,426
I’ll go with you next time.

357
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:04,980
Send me some photos.

358
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:05,600
Alright, then.

359
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:06,226
Alright.

360
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,246
Bye.

361
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,733
Enjoy the hotpot!

362
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,433
Ozone.

363
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,993
Let’s go home now.

364
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:29,793
We have to stop by for some groceries.

365
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,506
Ozone.

366
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,500
You promised you’d listen to me.

367
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,106
Let’s go home for now.

368
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:42,820
We can come back here later.

369
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,013
There’s no later.

370
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,360
Ozone.

371
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:48,720
Death.

372
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,326
I smell death.

373
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:13,193
What the hell was that lady on about?

374
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,413
Don’t think about it.

375
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,293
There’s nothing to worry about.

376
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,266
Don’t like it.

377
00:23:17,286 --> 00:23:18,286
I don’t like it.

378
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,120
I don’t like it.

379
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,280
I don’t. I don’t like it.

380
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:41,133
I don’t. I don’t like it.

381
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,293
I don’t. I don’t like it.

382
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:42,940
I don’t like it.

383
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:43,560
I don’t like it.

384
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:44,033
I don’t like it.

385
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:44,686
I don’t like it.

386
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,313
I don’t like it.

387
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:45,946
I don’t like it.

388
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,706
I don’t like it.

389
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:47,733
I don’t like it.

390
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,600
Mr. Night.

391
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
I’ve cleaned up everything for the day.

392
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,686
Okay.

393
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,906
Tomorrow is your birthday, isn’t it?

394
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,900
I made you a cake.

395
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,266
I remember it

396
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,949
because it only comes around once every four years.

397
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:16,940
It’s a cause for celebration.

398
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,206
Thank you.

399
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,220
Excuse me for now.

400
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,220
Happy birthday.

401
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Hello?

402
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,660
Daily Housekeeper?

403
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,233
I would like to request a new housekeeper.

404
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,353
Oh, no.

405
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,813
She’s perfect.

406
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:55,480
She’s really nice.

407
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,026
But let’s just say I need a new one.
(Happy Birthday, Mr. Night)

408
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,926
Thank you.

409
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,246
Ozone.

410
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,913
We’re staying in for a couple of days.

411
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,933
Don’t go out.

412
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:46,280
Don’t think of anybody.

413
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,873
Don’t think of anybody.

414
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,840
Don’t think of anybody.

415
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,066
Don’t think of anybody.

416
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,560
Don’t think of anybody.

417
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,746
Don’t think of anybody.

418
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,086
If you’re hungry, or if you need anything,

419
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:16,300
let me know

420
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,860
and I’ll get it for you.

421
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,620
We have to stay inside this house.

422
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,133
No matter what happens,

423
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,893
do not go out.

424
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,273
Do you understand, Ozone?

425
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,873
Don’t lock the door when you’re in the bathroom.

426
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,566
You have to stay, at all times, where I can see you.

427
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,113
Do you understand?

428
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,160
You have to tell me if the stars talk to you again.

429
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,740
Don’t do anything dangerous.

430
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,786
If you don’t love me,

431
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,226
I won’t die.

432
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,480
Ozone.

433
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
You won’t die.

434
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,373
Who could even love you?

435
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,990
Good.

436
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,920
If you don’t love them,

437
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,440
they won’t die.

438
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:43,640
29 FEBRUARY 2020

439
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
Hey.

440
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,460
It’s just the water boiling.

441
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,900
I’m getting hungry.

442
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,480
The water’s ready.

443
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,540
Wait a minute.

444
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,593
Surprise!

445
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:45,866
Happy 5th birthday, you February-29th baby.

446
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,866
Blow out the candle, Night.

447
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,313
Happy birthday.

448
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,893
What are you doing here?

449
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,206
What?

450
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:01,613
Go home.

451
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,693
Why?

452
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,100
Just go home.

453
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,313
Why, Night?

454
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:12,866
This cake…

455
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,326
I took a class to learn how to make it.

456
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,133
I…

457
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,593
I was waiting out here for ages.

458
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,410
I just wanted to be the first person

459
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,820
to wish you happy birthday...

460
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,140
I told you to go home.

461
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,220
Leave me alone.

462
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,880
Go home.

463
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,546
Go!

464
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:00,850
Can’t you at least just accept it?

465
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,090
Fine!

466
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,166
I’ll leave you alone!

467
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,120
Your food is here.

468
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Here.

469
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,546
Hungry.

470
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,680
I’m hungry.

471
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:47,713
Hungry.

472
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,940
Don’t like it.

473
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:25,713
I don’t like it.

474
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:26,513
I don’t like it.

475
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:27,173
I don’t like it.

476
00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:28,120
It’s okay now.

477
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:28,653
I don’t like it.

478
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:29,446
You know what.

479
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
No.

480
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:31,693
No. No.

481
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,286
I don’t like it.

482
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:42,826
No.

483
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,593
No.

484
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,666
- Ozone!
- No.

485
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:45,686
Ozone!

486
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,653
No.

487
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,300
No.

488
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:52,900
No.

489
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:53,933
- No.
- Ozone!

490
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,330
Ozone!

491
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
Ozone!

492
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Ozone!

493
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
Dream.

494
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,433
Dream, get in the car.

495
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:14,873
Get in the car!

496
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,700
Dream!

497
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:20,453
Dream.

498
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:21,873
Dream, get in the car.

499
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:22,906
No!

500
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,333
Just get in the car.

501
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:25,453
Please get in the car.

502
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,620
Leave me alone.

503
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:28,666
Dream, listen.

504
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:30,953
You’re in danger if I love...

505
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,373
Just come with me.

506
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,769
I’ll explain everything tomorrow, alright?

507
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:40,500
Get in the car.

508
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,702
I don’t want your explanation!

509
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:42,546
I don’t want to know.

510
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:43,886
I just want to go home!

511
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,560
I’ll give you a ride home.

512
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,126
Listen, Dream.

513
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,326
You can’t stay here.

514
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,600
Let me give you a ride home.

515
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,110
Please.

516
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,353
(Timezone)

517
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:52,946
What the hell?

518
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,350
Ozone!

519
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,906
Shit!

520
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,353
Day and night must meet.

521
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:38,433
Ozone!

522
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,346
Ozone!

523
00:35:39,373 --> 00:35:40,373
Ozone!

524
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,310
Ozone!

525
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,006
Ozone!

526
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:10,093
Dream.

527
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,890
Dream.

528
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,193
Ozone!

529
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,040
Dream!

530
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,066
Dream.

531
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,153
Ozone!

532
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,710
Ozone!

533
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Ozone!

534
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,273
Ozone!

535
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,840
Ozone!

536
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,406
Ozone!

537
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,593
Ozone!

538
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,590
Day and night must meet.

539
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,113
Day and night must meet.

540
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,340
Day and night must meet.

541
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,113
Ozone.

542
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:18,453
Ozone, hang in there.

543
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,580
Dream, stay alive.

544
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,406
I must be straightforward,

545
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:23,210
but Miss Pakwan is…

546
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,046
Are you Mr. Anawin’s family?

547
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:29,840
Your cousin is…

548
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,553
Day, get out.

549
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,713
People are afraid of getting in when you’re here.

550
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:36,733
Jinx.

551
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Murderer.

552
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,080
Hey!

553
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,446
Stop right there!

554
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,893
Don’t go, Aunt Wan.

555
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:49,913
It’s dangerous.
