00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Every time

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,420
that February 29 comes by,

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,860
someone I love… dies.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,020
February 29, 2008.

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,893
My sister and your uncle died at the same time.

6
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,550
I was trying to call my sister right then, too.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,293
If you really, really, are in love with me,

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,833
you’ll do this.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,900
Because I really, really, am in love with you.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,560
From now on,

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,920
don’t let go of my hands.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,520
Dating.

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,846
Day and night must meet.

14
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:33,873
Why?

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,000
Like chopsticks.

16
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,233
They don’t work separately.

17
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:38,662
We shouldn’t be anywhere near each other.

18
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,080
It’s for everyone’s safety.

19
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:41,040
Night.

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,600
Professor Wiwat was born on February 29.

21
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,020
It was my birthday, too.

22
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,126
I was also absent to celebrate my birthday at home.

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,626
With your family?

24
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:49,426
Of course.

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,260
29 FEBRUARY 2004

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,973
Guys, I’m getting off work.

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,740
Take care of the rest.

28
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:07,366
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,540
Safe trip home.

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,140
Crap!

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,860
Hey, be careful!

32
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,480
I have a child too young for a father like me to die.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,960
Yes, sir. I’m sorry.

34
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:22,960
Safety is our priority, don’t you know that?

35
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:23,520
I’m sorry.

36
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:25,013
They’re so careless…

37
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:33,886
Every day, I gotta tell them.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,780
Can I even trust them on their own?

39
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,166
I’m in a hurry, damn it.

40
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,346
Watch out!

(Day)

51
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,534
What makes you think our chances would be worse together?

52
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,970
This is the first year

53
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,646
someone we love survived.

54
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,546
There’s gotta be a reason for that.

55
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,880
If we find out what that reason is,

56
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,880
maybe we can find a way out of this.

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,166
So you’re suggesting we brainstorm and collaborate

58
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:50,593
like a school group project?

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah.

60
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,466
If that’s what you wanna call it.

61
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,693
Isn’t it better than doing this alone?

62
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,400
I won’t let anyone else I love end up here again.

63
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,893
I won’t let anyone die because of me again.

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,106
As if I’d wanted this.

65
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,186
Then help me out!

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,920
What good does your ego do?

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Are you seriously going to put up with this?

68
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,390
Look.

69
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,246
We don’t even know what we’re up against.

70
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,673
We don’t even know if they’ll keep surviving

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,466
just because they did once.

72
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,610
And together, we can work it out.

73
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,106
What if we increase the risk by sticking together?

74
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,026
What if we don’t?

75
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,086
How can you be sure?

76
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,360
What are you drawing?

77
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,460
Do you remember me?

78
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,626
I was in the car accident with you.

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,500
We also just met on campus, you know?

80
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,466
I guess I got the wrong person.

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,793
Sorry.

82
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,486
You kinda look like him.

83
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,066
Only that he’s a little more adorable than you are.

84
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,226
Oh, and he loves talking about day and night.

85
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
One more thing,

86
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:42,313
he is Day’s younger brother.

87
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,313
Older.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
I’m older.

89
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,333
I’m the older brother.

90
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,526
I see…

91
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Oh, so you’re really him.

92
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,033
I…

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,406
I… am an awesome big brother.

94
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,786
I told Day that day and night must meet

95
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:13,280
to make this work.

96
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,153
Like chopsticks.

97
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,173
I see.

98
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,053
You’re amazing.

99
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:19,613
I’m Dream.

100
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
Ozone.

101
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,866
It’s nice to meet you, Ozone.

102
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,646
Are you here with Day?

103
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:37,000
I’m also here with Night.

104
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,590
Look.

105
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,486
Whatever you think you know is right

106
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,480
won’t be right in this game.

107
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,160
I had a girlfriend.

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,900
I never thought she’d get dragged into this,

109
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,953
because she wasn't a part of my family.

110
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,800
But she died anyway.

111
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,820
Do you need my help?

112
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,633
Can I draw a star over here?

113
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,186
Hey, Ozone.

114
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:11,226
Do you believe in this Leap Day curse?

115
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,350
Leap Day is real.

116
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Not a matter of belief.

117
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,353
It is real.

118
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,893
It is?

119
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,900
My mother died because of Leap Day.

120
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,440
I have no one left.

121
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,360
I had a dog

122
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,400
and even he died, too.

123
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,826
Every living thing that you love,

124
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,213
that you care about,

125
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,886
all falls under the rules of this damn game.

126
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Yeah.

127
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,146
I know what you mean.

128
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,340
I know how you feel.

129
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,500
I’ve been through the exact same thing.

130
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:09,746
My mother.

131
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,633
My father.

132
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,380
My sister.

133
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,360
Everyone I loved and cared for

134
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:18,046
also died because of me.

135
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:21,713
It’s a curse.

136
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,773
It’s the curse on those born on February 29.

137
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,353
That’s not true.

138
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,433
It only happens to us.

139
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,340
I asked someone else who was born on February 29,

140
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,793
and he’s living a normal life.

141
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,100
He has a family.

142
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,433
It’s just us who are cursed.

143
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,453
That’s why

144
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,026
we’re better off not combining our hapless luck.

145
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,460
How’d you know he’s living a normal life?

146
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,553
Maybe he went through the same fate,

147
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:51,550
but found a way to live with it!

148
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,550
Dream, we’re leaving.

149
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:05,220
(Lecture Hall)

150
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,320
The health system is most crucial.

151
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,106
I’ll keep repeating this point

152
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,533
because understanding the health system

153
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:19,473
will allow us to systematically take care of the patients,

154
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:24,173
which will further lead to a more efficient management.

155
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,080
Rattikan.

156
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,579
Night.

157
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,220
Rattikan.

158
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
Yes?

159
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,960
What is this lecture about?

160
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,840
Oh, it’s the health system.

161
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,873
I’m asking Rattikan.

162
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,880
I’m sorry.

163
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Night.

164
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,426
Should we ask Professor Wiwat again?

165
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,793
If he didn’t tell us anything the first time,

166
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,230
I don’t think he’d tell us anything if we insisted.

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,073
If he had been through the same thing,

168
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:11,880
I’m sure his guards must be high up.

169
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,200
But I think Day has a point.

170
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:24,133
Maybe we can ask someone who’s close to him?

171
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,466
Oh, Night, I have an idea.

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,913
I know an upperclassman who’s the professor’s pet.

173
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:33,606
Good thing.

174
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,700
I’ll take care of it.

175
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,469
Are you talking about that upperclassman Win?

176
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah.

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,020
No.

178
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:38,913
Don’t talk to him.

179
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:39,913
I don’t want anything from him.

180
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:40,966
Come on, Night.

181
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,520
I really think Win can help us.

182
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
I’m sure there are other people to ask.

183
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,806
Or what?

184
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:47,113
Do you fancy talking to him?

185
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,540
No.

186
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,066
Who’d want to talk to him?

187
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,300
I just want to help my boyfriend out.

188
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Fine.

189
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,586
I’ll let you try three times.

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Okay?

191
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
One more thing.

192
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,386
Just ask your questions.

193
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,553
Don’t go and play detectives.

194
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,406
If he asks you to go somewhere with him, turn him down.

195
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:15,680
I...

196
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:18,260
And don’t forget to tell him that you…

197
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,053
have a boyfriend.

198
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Okay.

199
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,133
Roger that.

200
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,306
Here.

201
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:52,666
(Humans and Planets)

202
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,570
Ozone.

203
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Ozone.

204
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Oh?

205
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,726
I thought you’d help me look up on Leap Day.

206
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,713
(Apollo, the God of sun and light)

207
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,793
Hungry.

208
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,186
I’m hungry.

209
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,353
Okay.

210
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,673
I’ll borrow these books so we can take them home.

211
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,420
Do it fast.

212
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,573
As fast as slipping into a wormhole.

213
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:40,080
Wait here a minute.

214
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,593
What do you want for dinner?

215
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,020
Grilled pork noodles.

216
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,720
Grilled pork noodles?

217
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,373
I’ve never heard of it before.

218
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,153
Can you make it?

219
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,910
Of course.

220
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Kung?

221
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Over here.

222
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Hello.

223
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,153
I’m not bothering you, am I?

224
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,066
Not at all.

225
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,326
I’m just done with my shift.

226
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:30,213
I haven’t seen you since the Open House, right?

227
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,493
I got in right when you graduated, after all.

228
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,753
Here.

229
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,306
I got you something.

230
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,260
Thanks.

231
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:37,733
Well?

232
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,173
What do you need my help with?

233
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,600
I’m trying to cozy up to Professor Wiwat.

234
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,680
My grades aren’t very good

235
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,486
so I just want to know more about him.

236
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:50,506
That’s it.

237
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,640
That doesn’t sound worth helping.

238
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,613
Dr. Wiwat, huh?

239
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,120
He’s… ingenious.

240
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,800
He likes hardworking people.

241
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,420
The old nurses said

242
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,226
he barely ever called off work.

243
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,300
He wouldn’t take a day off
even on his once-in-every-four-years birthdays.

244
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:09,420
So much so that…

245
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,050
What is it?

246
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,060
There was this rumor

247
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,893
that Dr. Wiwat messed up a baby delivery.

248
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,566
I don’t know if it’s true,

249
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,380
but people said the patient died.

250
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,980
Dr. Wiwat got a lot of threats after that.

251
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:32,673
It was during the first years after he messed up.

252
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,706
He always received those letters.

253
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,126
He got criticized and threatened to get exposed.

254
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:44,220
There was even a letter with his family’s photo on it

255
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,526
covered in animal blood that stank the whole place.

256
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,380
Here.

257
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,873
Dinner is ready.

258
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:06,613
Look.

259
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
What do you think?

260
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
Oh, my God.

261
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:12,913
Here’s your spoon.

262
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,440
Let’s eat, Ozone.

263
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,686
Ozone eats, eats.

264
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,306
Eat lots.

265
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,666
I did my best, you know?

266
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,186
Well, is it good?

267
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,020
It is the best in the universe.

268
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,653
Of course.

269
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,500
I put my whole heart and soul into it.

270
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,480
Ozone!

271
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,466
How the hell did it get in there?

272
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,906
Hold on.

273
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,980
Hang on to me.

274
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,606
Hang on to me.

275
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,986
Ozone, hang in there.

276
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,086
We’ll be there in a minute.

277
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,786
Ozone!

278
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,660
Ozone, stay with me.

279
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,346
Ozone!

280
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,113
Somebody, please help!

281
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,220
What happened?

282
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,573
He chewed on a razor blade.

283
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:46,380
I don’t know how it got in his food, but I didn’t...

284
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Please calm down.

285
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,020
Wait outside for the time being.

286
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,220
Please.

287
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,900
How’s his consciousness?

288
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,326
The score is 12.

289
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,366
Hey, take it easy for now.'

290
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:58,220
He’s in good hands.

291
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,246
Don’t worry.

292
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,360
What happened?

293
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,326
You remember what you said?

294
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,733
That we don’t know if the ones we love will keep surviving…

295
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,366
There was a razor blade in the food I made for him.

296
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,066
I’m sure I was careful.

297
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,173
How the hell did it even get in there?

298
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,820
I have to go.

299
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,446
Dream, Dream.

300
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:51,713
Dream, are you alright?

301
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,953
What happened?

302
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,010
It’s…

303
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Day’s big brother is in the hospital.

304
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,186
Ozone?

305
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Yes.

306
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,426
There was a razor blade in his food.

307
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,940
What hospital?

308
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,126
- Let’s go and see them.
- No.

309
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,013
You stay home.

310
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,546
Don’t go anywhere.

311
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,140
Night.

312
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,440
Maybe this has nothing to do with your birthday.

313
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,513
But this was the food Day made for Ozone, Dream.

314
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,193
You think he’d put the razor blade in it on purpose?

315
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,580
What should we do?

316
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:46,900
From now on,

317
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,866
stay close to me.

318
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,613
Stay where I can see you at all times.

319
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Understood?

320
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Okay.

321
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,690
I understand.

322
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,620
Are you Day, Ozone’s family?

323
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,633
Yes.

324
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
That’s me.

325
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,373
My name is Kung.

326
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:25,700
I’m Night’s upperclassman.

327
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:27,680
He told me you’re a friend.

328
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,166
He asked me to take care of you.

329
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:31,186
Okay.

330
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,560
I must ask you,

331
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,053
where is this razor blade right now?

332
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,360
It’s at our house.

333
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:39,513
On the dining table.

334
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
You didn’t bring it with you, I take it.

335
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,206
This is important,

336
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,386
but do you remember if it’s rusted?

337
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,806
How exactly did it happen?

338
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,680
It’s not rusted.

339
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,840
I was making grilled pork noodles for Ozone.

340
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:55,726
Everything looked fine.

341
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,720
Ozone enjoyed it, like usual.

342
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,513
He just suddenly went still and spat everything out.

343
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,400
Is… Is my brother okay?

344
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,853
He is safe now.

345
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,973
The doctor is currently sewing him up.

346
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,500
You can come in and see him if you want

347
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:15,540
but only when there’s someone with you.

348
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,733
I’m afraid you can’t stay with him tonight, though.

349
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:20,753
Why not?

350
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,866
In the case of underaged individual and an autistic patient,

351
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,682
an involved organization must come in for an evaluation

352
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:27,893
before you can go home.

353
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,566
Evaluation for what?

354
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,540
For Ozone’s safety, Day.

355
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:34,786
It’s part of the procedure.

356
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,206
We have no choice but to follow.

357
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,153
Do… Do you think I hurt him?

358
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,686
We see domestic violence cases every day here.

359
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,390
But this is part of the procedure.

360
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,540
You only have to wait until tomorrow

361
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,040
and Ozone will be home.

362
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,066
Don’t worry.

363
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,393
Night.

364
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,873
He’s here.

365
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,700
Win.

366
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:43,490
You’re early to school.

367
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,770
Dream.

368
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,450
Can I sit with you for a bit?

369
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:48,826
I’m supposed to meet my friends,

370
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:50,546
but they’re not here yet.

371
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,406
Of course.

372
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:52,553
Thank you.

373
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Dream.

374
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,433
Yes?

375
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,820
What time will you be done with your classes today?

376
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,866
Why do you ask?

377
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,860
Wanna have dinner?

378
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,193
This evening?

379
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,413
I have plans with my friends.

380
00:24:21,446 --> 00:24:23,410
How about later?

381
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,620
Later, you said…

382
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,106
How about tomorrow?

383
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Oh, hey, Win.

384
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,920
I have a question.

385
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,793
You’re pretty close with Professor Wiwat, right?

386
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,600
He always talks about you.

387
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,913
He does?

388
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,706
Yes.

389
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,700
Oh, I’m flattered.

390
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,480
Am I close to him?

391
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,553
I guess you could say that.

392
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:46,786
He’s a good lecturer

393
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:48,473
and a caring teacher.

394
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,606
I chat with him all the time.

395
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,986
You must know a lot about him, Win.

396
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,660
Can you tell me about him?

397
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,600
Professor Wiwat is just… an old man.

398
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,140
He nitpicks and complains, like usual.

399
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,090
I think…

400
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,406
We should talk about something else.

401
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,753
Let’s talk…

402
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,293
about us.

403
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,853
Well…

404
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:23,006
Well?

405
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,533
I like Professor Wiwat!

406
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,190
You like him?

407
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:35,513
As in…

408
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,666
Like “like”?

409
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Yes.

410
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,206
Like “like.”

411
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,806
I’ve felt this way for a while now

412
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,900
so I just want to know what he likes and doesn’t like,

413
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:50,406
what kind of man he is, and if he’s a good person,

414
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:51,893
that kind of thing.

415
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Well…

416
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,320
I think I have to tell you the truth.

417
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
What do you mean?

418
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,293
Actually,

419
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,420
Professor Wiwat is…

420
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:18,070
nitpicking and fussy.

421
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,026
More importantly,

422
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,680
he has an old man smell!

423
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:24,840
He’s not that great, you know?

424
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:26,553
Why would you say that?

425
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,673
I mean, he seems like a great guy, right?

426
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,920
What’s more, he just seems so cool!

427
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Did you know

428
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,969
that he stopped being an obstetrician

429
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:36,466
and became a full-time professor and gynecologist

430
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:38,960
only because he killed someone?

431
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,780
He did?

432
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,420
How did that happen?

433
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,880
My ex is a nurse.

434
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,580
She heard the old nurses talk about this.

435
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:51,346
It was his birthday that day,

436
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:54,660
and he wanted to go home early to his family.

437
00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:56,253
He was in a hurry in the delivery room.

438
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:58,520
Eventually, he messed up,

439
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,480
and killed the mother on the operating table.

440
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,593
What?

441
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,893
What about the baby?

442
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,420
They said it survived,

443
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,420
but not without some issues, I guess.

444
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,566
When it happened,

445
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:15,106
people didn’t dare talk about it much.

446
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,073
Professor Wiwat was a famous doctor back then,

447
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:20,566
so the hospital didn’t want to make a fuss about it.

448
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:23,600
I see.

449
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,420
Babe.

450
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Babe.

451
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,200
Did you have to wait long?

452
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,900
Did I make you wait, babe?

453
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,233
Oh, no. Not at all.

454
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,230
Shall we get going, babe?

455
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,086
Ye—Yes.

456
00:27:40,113 --> 00:27:41,193
- Shall we?
- Let’s go.

457
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,400
See you later, Win.

458
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:44,626
S–See you.

459
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,553
You still tell guys who hit on you off

460
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:50,240
by telling them you like the professor?

461
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,306
Look at his face.

462
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:53,473
He looks as puzzled as a chicken’s butt.

463
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,473
Well, I apologize on my girlfriend’s behalf.

464
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,720
She’s a trouble-maker, always pulling people’s legs.

465
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,693
That was bad of you.

466
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,873
You should apologize to him.

467
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,900
I’m sorry, Win.

468
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,886
S–Sure.

469
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,280
Don’t do it again, alright?

470
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,560
It’s unfortunate enough for him

471
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,846
that you don’t like him back.

472
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,100
Right?

473
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,260
Yes.

474
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,069
Careful not to hit the table, babe.

475
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:21,340
Let’s go.

476
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,080
Let’s grab some breakfast.

477
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,253
What would you like today, babe?

478
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:26,700
Is this a special occasion?

479
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,062
Every day is a special occasion with you.

480
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,300
I see.

481
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Night.

482
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,140
So now we know Professor Wiwat did kill a patient.

483
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,140
On his birthday, no less.

484
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,446
I just don’t know if it’s related.

485
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,180
At this point,

486
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,226
I don’t think there’s such a thing as coincidence.

487
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,873
Both Day and I

488
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:54,606
lost our mothers when we were born.

489
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,520
Kung said it happened roughly 20 years ago,

490
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
which means…

491
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:01,873
it aligns.

492
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Hold on.

493
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,746
Are you saying it happened the year you and Day were born?

494
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,893
Day. Day. Day!

495
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:33,406
Day.

496
00:29:33,426 --> 00:29:34,133
Where is Day?

497
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,126
Day. Day!

498
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:35,720
Day!

499
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:36,320
Day.

500
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,866
Day!

501
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:38,360
I want Day.

502
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,106
Where is Day?

503
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:39,633
Day!

504
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,200
Day.

505
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,186
Please calm down.

506
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,333
Calm down.

507
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,520
Hello?

508
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:53,726
Day. Where is Day?

509
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:54,226
Day!

510
00:29:54,246 --> 00:29:55,153
I want Day!

511
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:55,813
Day!

512
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,320
Day!

513
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,973
- I’m here. I’m here.
- No, no!

514
00:29:57,993 --> 00:29:58,573
I want Day!

515
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,386
I’m here. I’m here.

516
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:00,406
I’m here.

517
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,813
What do you want, Ozone?

518
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,040
Someone watched me sleep.

519
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,880
These are social workers.

520
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,230
They just want to talk to you, Ozone.

521
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,493
Just talk to them and we can go home, okay?

522
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,173
What is it?

523
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,406
Ozone.

524
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,386
Do you know what happened and why you’re here?

525
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Hmm?

526
00:30:34,786 --> 00:30:37,653
I’ll wait just right outside, alright?

527
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,786
Why?

528
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,113
Not your fault.

529
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,033
It’s only for a minute.

530
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,733
I’ll be just right over here.

531
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,433
No need to be scared.

532
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,780
We’ll be home soon.

533
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:48,813
Alright?

534
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:06,940
Ozone.

535
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,486
Does Day… usually pull pranks on you?

536
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,000
Only I pull pranks on Day.

537
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
Does he take good care of you?

538
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Hmm?

539
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,313
Day…

540
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,320
takes the best care in the universe.

541
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,993
Never hurts me.

542
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,086
Never ever.

543
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,673
I… am here

544
00:31:52,706 --> 00:31:55,866
because I wasn’t careful when eating.

545
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,586
Day took me here right away.

546
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,086
When I get out of here,

547
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:07,213
Day will take me to the planetarium.

548
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,073
Because I like going to the planetarium.

549
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,070
I love watching the stars with Day.

550
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,626
Day always buys me ice cream.

551
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,953
Chocolate and vanilla.

552
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,400
My favorites.

553
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:29,453
Day bought me planet stickers.

554
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Day… makes me food.

555
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,606
His food is so good.

556
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:41,510
Day takes good care of me.

557
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,753
If… If I don’t have Day,

558
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,193
I’ll be in trouble.

559
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,886
I mean it.

560
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Day.

561
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,326
All done.

562
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,086
I want to go home.

563
00:33:17,106 --> 00:33:18,133
We will go home soon.

564
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,473
Excuse us.

565
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,553
Thank you.

566
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Thank you.

567
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,633
How are you feeling?

568
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:26,653
Better now?

569
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,620
Day.

570
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,726
Hungry.

571
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:30,806
You’re hungry?

572
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,800
What do you want?

573
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,686
Omelette rice.

574
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,940
Omelette on rice?

575
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,460
How about this?

576
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:40,486
I’ll make you the sun omelette.

577
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,180
Sun omelette.

578
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:44,160
Is it good?

579
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:45,253
It is.

580
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,780
I’ll make it even better than last time.

581
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,260
I’m glad to see you healthy and happy, Ozone.

582
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,420
Let’s go home.

583
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:57,013
I want to draw.

584
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Okay.

585
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,300
Will you teach me, too?

586
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,520
What do you want to draw, Day?

587
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,520
I’m very good at drawing stars.

588
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,686
I want to draw an astronaut.

589
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,893
Tell me if it hurts.

590
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:17,053
I’ll give you some medicine.

591
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Mhmm.

592
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Ozone.

593
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,740
I’m sorry I wasn’t careful.

594
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,573
Leap Day’s fault.

595
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:30,133
Not your fault.

596
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,260
Alright.

597
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:36,320
Let’s go home.

598
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,560
Ozone.

599
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,506
Ozone.

600
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,210
Ozone.

601
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,113
Open your mouth for me.

602
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,306
All good now.

603
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,340
For you.

604
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,180
Are you sure you’re okay now?

605
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,406
I’m sorry I didn’t visit you at the hospital.

606
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,913
It hurt so much at first.

607
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:43,720
It hurt to my core.

608
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,606
I was so shocked I fell asleep.

609
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,713
And how are you feeling now?

610
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:52,860
Now I’m okay.

611
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,486
Open your mouth again.

612
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,400
It looks good now.

613
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
You did well, Ozone.

614
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,613
You can take the hoodie off, you know?

615
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,946
How was it?

616
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:11,973
That bad?

617
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,153
I can’t tell

618
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
if it was just bad luck

619
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,013
or Leap Day.

620
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,153
If it was Leap Day,

621
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:24,293
I just don’t know what the pattern is.

622
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,853
Dream has been entirely normal.

623
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,366
She’s in no danger at all.

624
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,006
But we’ve been careful

625
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,206
after what happened to you.

626
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Yeah.

627
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
I’m just tired of wondering

628
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:36,120
if it’s just bad luck or this Leap Day curse.

629
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,953
I’m done living like this.

630
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,266
I have to stop this stupid mess.

631
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,300
And we have to do it as soon as possible, too.

632
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,980
I’m going to class.

633
00:36:58,013 --> 00:36:59,386
If anything comes up…

634
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,026
If anything really urgent comes up, call me.

635
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,046
Okay?

636
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,866
Yeah.

637
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,026
Thanks.

638
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,386
Same goes to you.

639
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,786
Let’s go, Dream.

640
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,500
I have to go, Ozone.

641
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,620
But I’ll get you a spaceship next time.

642
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,726
Okay. Bye.

643
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,100
I’ll see you soon.

644
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Bye.

645
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,913
Trouble.

646
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:18,933
Trouble.

647
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:20,313
I am in trouble.

648
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,626
Trouble.

649
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:22,720
Trouble.

650
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:23,920
I am in trouble.

651
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,533
Do any of your drawings

652
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:31,140
have something to do with Leap Day?

653
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:35,670
We have to remove ourselves from the game.

654
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,620
There must be a loophole to this Leap Day curse.

655
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,626
What are you looking for, Night?

656
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,106
Ozone has known this all along.

657
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,880
We just don’t know how to read it.

658
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:50,953
Who’s that?

659
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:51,406
Hey!

660
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,466
Stop!
