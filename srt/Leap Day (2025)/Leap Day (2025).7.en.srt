1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,386
Night…

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,986
What about him?

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:05,986
Night!

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,686
Night! Night!

5
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:09,086
- Night!
- Night!

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,693
Twice.

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,626
Twice now.

8
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:12,913
Night is dead twice now.

9
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,000
Night has died twice now.

10
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,700
Ozone saw you die in his dreams twice.

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,080
So it’s just about dreams.

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,873
He’s here again.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,746
He’s here again.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,360
Go take a look.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Go.

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,886
I’m scared.

17
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:29,780
There.

18
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:31,170
I’ll go take a look.

19
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,710
I will be right back.

20
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,140
What do you know about Leap Day?

21
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,040
Why did it say here
that you induced my mother’s labor?

22
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,086
Just please tell us.

23
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,426
We can’t keep living like this.

24
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,026
Have you seen my friend?

25
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,880
He was gone when I got back.

26
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,106
I am really sorry for your loss.

27
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,460
But I have nothing to do with this.

28
00:00:58,493 --> 00:00:59,980
I’m an orphan.

29
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,153
Just like you.

30
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,173
Hey.

31
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,510
Hold on.

32
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,913
Just now, the professor said

33
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,533
he’s an orphan…

34
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
“Just like you.”

35
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,226
Attentions to all students,

36
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:22,773
please be on the lookout for Ozone.

37
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:24,393
He wears a green striped top

38
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,366
and a pair of black shorts.

39
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,760
He wears glasses,

40
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:28,713
has short hair,

41
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:30,880
and is approximately 165 centimeters tall.

42
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:32,709
Please bring him to the library if you find him.

43
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:34,106
His friend is waiting there.

44
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,133
Thank you.

45
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:06,053
(Everyone will know what you did.)

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
Crap.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,480
More than 30 missed calls from Dream.

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,453
Attentions to all students,

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,026
please be on the lookout for Ozone.

50
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,653
He wears a green striped top

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
and a pair of black shorts.

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,966
He wears glasses,

53
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:49,926
has short hair,

54
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,166
and is approximately 165 centimeters tall.

55
00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:54,062
Please bring him to the library if you find him.

56
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,613
His friend is waiting there.

57
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:56,646
Thank you.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Day!

59
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,153
Day, wait up.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,013
Wait for me.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Day!

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,113
Night.

63
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,133
Day.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,413
Dream.

65
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,493
Night. Day.

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,146
Ozone disappeared.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,866
I’m sorry, Day. I’m really sorry.

68
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,613
Ozone said somebody was watching him.

69
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:21,420
He seemed really scared

70
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,542
so I went and checked to calm him down.

71
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,340
When I got back, he was gone.

72
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,926
I’ve looked everywhere in the library

73
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,846
and asked them to make PA announcement,

74
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,026
but nothing turned up.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,340
I’m sorry.

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,013
It’s alright, Dream.

77
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:30,693
Slow down.

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Speak clearly.

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,706
Where did you last see him?

80
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,120
The library.

81
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,406
At our usual table in the library.

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,073
I don’t know if there really was someone watching

83
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,900
and they took Ozone,

84
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,566
or if Ozone was just scared and is hiding.

85
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:42,586
Day!

86
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,146
Why don’t you go back and wait at the library

87
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,240
in case Ozone comes back?

88
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,640
Don’t do anything rash, alright?

89
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,640
We don’t know if this is about Leap Day.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,113
I’ll be right back.

91
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,110
Hello.

92
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,446
My friend went missing.

93
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:30,720
Can I take a look at the security footage

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,980
in case I find something?

95
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,340
I don’t know where to even begin looking.

96
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:36,213
Where did you last see him?

97
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,726
At the library.

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,646
Please come over here.

99
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:39,540
Thank you.

100
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,293
Library.

101
00:05:40,313 --> 00:05:41,313
Ozone!

102
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:04,473
(Ozone’s location 13 minutes ago)

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,706
(Ozone)

104
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,366
(Day)

105
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:47,046
Crap.

106
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,820
Here’s the library.

107
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,446
Can–Can you track where they were going?

108
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,053
Please wait a second.

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Hey, Day.

110
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,826
You need to come to the CCTV room.

111
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes, Night?

112
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,680
Hello, Dream.

113
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:38,980
Meet me at the CCTV room.

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,906
I’ll be right there.

115
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,660
Did you find him?

116
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Where’s Dream?

117
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,833
I just called her.

118
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,956
She’s probably on her way here.

119
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Look.

120
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,440
He’s tracking them.

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,733
I think the guy who took Ozone knows

122
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:22,833
where the cameras are.

123
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,220
So we can’t see his face?

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,306
We’re still looking.

125
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,026
It might take some time.

126
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,033
I can’t find him on his tracker either.

127
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:38,686
The connection’s unstable.

128
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,073
Do you think…

129
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,170
It’s the same man who went to your house before?

130
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,286
How about this?

131
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,913
I’ll ask Dream to help take a look.

132
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,626
If he has been following Ozone,

133
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,446
Dream might have seen something.

134
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,440
Okay. Call her.

135
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:03,920
Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be connected at this time.

136
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,273
There’s no reception.

137
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,346
Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be connected at this time.

138
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:20,973
Found them!

139
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Who’s that?

140
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,586
Yes.

141
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:48,193
That’s the man who went to my house.

142
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,773
I can’t see his face clearly,

143
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,646
but I’m sure it’s him from his appearance and his walk.

144
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,706
Sir, can you give me the footage?

145
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,413
I’ll hand it to the police.

146
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,480
Of course.

147
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:01,993
A moment, please.

148
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,013
Thank you.

149
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,966
I’ve got an update.

150
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,960
I have to go.

151
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,029
I’ll trust you to handle things here.

152
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:08,573
Yeah.

153
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,893
Call me if you need anything.

154
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,293
Hello, Dream?

155
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,610
Hello?

156
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:29,453
Hello?

157
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:30,593
Dream, what’s happened?

158
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Hello?

159
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,346
I’m at the fire exit.

160
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,366
Hello?

161
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,340
I’m at the fire exit.

162
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,813
Hold on.

163
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,840
I’ll be right back.

164
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,660
Sorry, the number you’ve dialed...

165
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,053
Dream!

166
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Dream!

167
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,706
Is there anyone there?

168
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,500
Can you please open the door?

169
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,060
Excuse me!

170
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:13,693
Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream!

171
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,760
Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream!

172
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,130
Dream!

173
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,113
No.

174
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:30,933
No.

175
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,706
No.

176
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,733
No.

177
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,613
No.

178
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,553
No.

179
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
No.

180
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Day.

181
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:37,713
Day.

182
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,060
No connection again.

183
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,660
Hey.

184
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,613
You coming?

185
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,693
I need a minute.

186
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,040
You keep making me pull over.

187
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,380
I ain’t got time for this.

188
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,353
I’ll give you an extra 200.

189
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,620
Hop on.

190
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,440
Can you go a little further that way?

191
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,393
Excuse me, sir.

192
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,880
Have you seen this man around?

193
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,220
He’s autistic.

194
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:31,253
Never seen him before.

195
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,846
Please take a careful look.

196
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,093
Still no.

197
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Excuse me.

198
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,493
Have you ever seen this man?

199
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,753
We’re going further.

200
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,220
Dream!

201
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,666
What are you doing?

202
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:55,006
My girlfriend is stuck inside.

203
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,253
Is there a key that opens this door?

204
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,533
I don’t think so.

205
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,446
Can you please look for me?

206
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:01,326
- Of course.
- Thank you.

207
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,886
Dream! Dream!

208
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,540
Damn it, just open!

209
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,566
Dream!

210
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
Dream!

211
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Help!

212
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,053
Help!

213
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:52,086
Help!

214
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,566
Help!

215
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,420
Help!

216
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:55,380
Help!

217
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:56,566
Help! Help!

218
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,466
Help!

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Help!

220
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,540
Help!

221
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:11,413
Is anyone there?

222
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:12,900
Can you hear me?

223
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:13,646
Help!

224
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:14,673
Help!

225
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Help!

226
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:25,153
Is anyone out there?

227
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Dream!

228
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Dream!

229
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,730
Night?

230
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,893
Open up!

231
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:36,926
Dream!

232
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,733
- Dream!
- Night!

233
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,110
Dream!

234
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,553
Help!

235
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:47,773
Help!

236
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,113
Help!

237
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:50,266
Help!

238
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,140
Dream, Dream, Dream.

239
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,233
Dream, are you alright?

240
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:12,273
I’m okay.

241
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,966
Dream.

242
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,686
Careful.

243
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,340
Let me help.

244
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
I’m okay.

245
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,240
Night, did you find Ozone?

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,500
Worry about yourself first.

247
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Please.

248
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,173
We’re going to the infirmary.

249
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,600
You’re all bruised.

250
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,846
Dream, Dream.

251
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,133
Lean on me.

252
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Alright.

253
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,206
Careful.

254
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,020
Slowly.

255
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,053
Okay.

256
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,873
Lean on me.

257
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Let’s go.

258
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,046
I can take it.

259
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,873
It’s alright.

260
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,413
It doesn’t hurt at all.

261
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,453
I’m fine.

262
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,713
Please keep going.

263
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,080
Can you be more gentle?

264
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,180
Of course.

265
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,186
It’s alright, Night.

266
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,353
It’s nothing at all.

267
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
I can take it.

268
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,913
Alright.

269
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:47,953
All set.

270
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:48,646
You’re good to go.

271
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,433
Thank you.

272
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,133
Of course.

273
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:50,913
Thank you.

274
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:51,933
Sure.

275
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Night.

276
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,920
Did we find Ozone?

277
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,073
Dream.

278
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,260
I couldn’t bring myself to imagine

279
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,313
what would have happened

280
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,340
if I didn’t get to you in time.

281
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,900
Night.

282
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,846
But I am alright now.

283
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,893
Look.

284
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,606
I’m really alright now.

285
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,426
The thing is

286
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,733
you saved me today.

287
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Am I right?

288
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,460
Where on earth is he?

289
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,433
Crap…

290
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,140
What the hell?

291
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,186
Hey, hello.

292
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:28,306
Did you meet up with Dream?

293
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,042
Can you come here and help me?

294
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:31,293
I sent you the location.

295
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,713
I’m following the tracker on Ozone,

296
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,766
but every time I get to the location,

297
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,666
the connection was cut for some reason.

298
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,346
We have a situation on my end, too.

299
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,513
Dream just fell down the stairs.

300
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:43,040
I’ll drop her off at home,

301
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:44,673
and I’ll go to you.

302
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
What?

303
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,186
What the hell’s going on?

304
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,120
Are you two safe?

305
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,340
We’ll be fine.

306
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,473
I’m okay now.

307
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Night.

308
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,706
I really am fine now.

309
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,273
Let’s go help Day.

310
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,126
Dream, don’t fight me on this.

311
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
You know what you’ve just been through.

312
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,693
Why put yourself at risk again?

313
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,913
Even if you drop me off at home,

314
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,880
you’ll still worry about me

315
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:17,353
when I’m there all alone, won’t you?

316
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,946
If that’s the case,

317
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,506
isn’t it better to stick together?

318
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,006
The GPS says he should be around here.

319
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Careful.

320
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:51,460
Thanks.

321
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,246
Let’s go find Day.

322
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,913
Let’s go.

323
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:55,946
Right.

324
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,886
It’s another freaking dead end.

325
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,986
Damn it.

326
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:29,140
What the hell?

327
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,290
Night?

328
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,060
Are you alright, Dream?

329
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:41,086
I’m fine.

330
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,420
Look. It keeps messing up.

331
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,906
What the hell is going on?

332
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:50,420
Could it be because you guys are together?

333
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:05,773
I think he’s over there.

334
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,620
Stay close.

335
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,633
Day.

336
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:48,906
Go to Day. Go to Day.

337
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:49,666
I need to go to Day!

338
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:50,446
Day!

339
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:51,466
Day!

340
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,500
Hey, wait!

341
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Go to Day.

342
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Go to Day.

343
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,310
Go to Day.

344
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,693
Day.

345
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Day.

346
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:15,640
Ozone!

347
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,666
Ozone!

348
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,010
Day!

349
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Day.

350
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Ozone?

351
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Day.

352
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:28,546
Ozone.

353
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,726
Ozone!

354
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:30,753
Day.

355
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:34,986
Night!

356
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,873
Ozone, please listen to me.

357
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,206
I need to talk to you.

358
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,120
About Day and Night.

359
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,546
I don’t want another life lost over this again.

360
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,340
If you don’t want anyone else to die,
we need to talk.

361
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,286
I will let you go

362
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,820
after we talk.

363
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,730
I have to show you something.

364
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,160
I have so many questions to ask you.

365
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,393
All important questions.

366
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,293
But there are some things

367
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,793
I just can’t risk Day and Night knowing.

368
00:26:32,673 --> 00:26:33,900
Night, especially.

369
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,360
I don’t want anyone to die again.

370
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,426
You understand, don’t you?

371
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,893
(Truck crash kills)

372
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:05,040
(Man stabbed dead at construction site)

373
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,893
(Mass shooting kills two)

374
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,486
Hello?

375
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,580
Yes, honey?

376
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,766
I’m almost home.

377
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,986
You are?

378
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,546
I called you for nothing, then.

379
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:10,753
I was going to ask if you’d have dinner at home.

380
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
This way.

381
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:25,620
Honey, I have to go.

382
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:27,473
Excuse me.

383
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,060
Have you seen this man around?

384
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,093
No.

385
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:32,553
What’s going on?

386
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Thank you.

387
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,973
(Day)

388
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Hello?

389
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
Hello?

390
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,890
Ozone.

391
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Ozone.

392
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Ozone.

393
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,873
Your name is

394
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,166
Mr. Kittiphob Jarudej.

395
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,840
I was born on February 29.

396
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I share my Leap Day fate with Dr. Wiwat.

397
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Die…

398
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Die.

399
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,113
Die.

400
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:17,773
Die.

401
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,840
Die.

402
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:19,513
Die.

403
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:20,433
Someone is going to die.

404
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,260
Someone is going to die.

405
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:22,273
Someone is going to die.

406
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,233
Someone is going to die.

407
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:23,913
Die.

408
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:24,460
Die.

409
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:25,726
Someone is going to die.

410
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Ozone?

411
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Ozone.

412
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,113
Die.

413
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,700
We’re all going to die.

414
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,266
We’re all going to die.

415
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,993
We’re all going to die.

416
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,620
We’re all going to die.

417
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:33,480
We’re all going to die.

418
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,226
We’re all going to die.

419
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:34,920
We’re all going to die.

420
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:35,646
We’re all going to die.

421
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,426
We’re all going to die.

422
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:37,120
We’re all going to die.

423
00:30:37,146 --> 00:30:37,906
We’re all going to die.

424
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:38,693
We’re all going to die.

425
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,626
We’re all going to die.

426
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
We’re all going to die.

427
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,933
In the building.

428
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,786
In the building.

429
00:30:57,806 --> 00:30:58,553
I’m in the building!

430
00:30:58,573 --> 00:30:59,353
In the building.

431
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:00,386
In the building.

432
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:01,906
What?

433
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,273
Ozone said he’s in a building somewhere.

434
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:04,326
In the building.

435
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:05,193
In the building.

436
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,326
In the building.

437
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Over there.

438
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,166
Ozone!

439
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,620
Ozone!

440
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,740
Officer, I’m the one who just reported a kidnapping.

441
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,006
I think we found him.

442
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,073
He must be in this area.

443
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,693
Can you please send enforcement?

444
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Thank you.

445
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:58,393
Stay still.

446
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,040
I thought we’d have more time to talk.

447
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,253
But don’t worry.

448
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,286
We’ll get to talk more.

449
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,600
Tell Day what we talked about today.

450
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:57,020
Don’t forget that you must not tell Night.

451
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:58,386
Only let Day know.

452
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,380
Day.

453
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:11,313
Day.

454
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:12,070
Day.

455
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:12,873
Day. Day.

456
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,546
Day. Day.

457
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Day. Day.

458
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,090
Go to Day.

459
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Day.

460
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,990
Day.

461
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,200
Ozone.

462
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,233
Ozone.

463
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,106
Ozone.

464
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,160
Ozone.

465
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,680
Ozone.

466
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Ozone.

467
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,220
Ozone.

468
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,010
Ozone.

469
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,533
Ozone.

470
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,466
Ozone.

471
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:04,486
Ozone.

472
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,480
Day.

473
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,289
Are you sure he’s in a building around here somewhere?

474
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,720
That’s what he said.

475
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,253
Day.

476
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Day.

477
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Day.

478
00:34:29,106 --> 00:34:30,106
Day.

479
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,890
Night!

480
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Night!

481
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,790
Day.

482
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:37,520
Ozone!

483
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:38,553
Day!

484
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,810
Night!

485
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,760
Night. Night, no!

486
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,533
Night. Night, no!

487
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:46,946
No!

488
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,906
Dream!

489
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,520
Dream. Dream. Dream.

490
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:50,386
What the hell is going on?

491
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Ozone!

492
00:36:18,446 --> 00:36:19,200
Ozone, Ozone.

493
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:19,880
What’s wrong?

494
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,940
Calm down. Calm down.

495
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,106
Ozone, calm down.

496
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,260
Calm down.

497
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,573
Look at me. Look at me.

498
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,760
Calm down.

499
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:26,786
Calm down.

500
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,900
Dream, stay with me.

501
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,586
Tell me everything.

502
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,866
Tell me how you’re still alive

503
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,533
when you were born on a Leap Day, too.

504
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,666
It is all because of Dr. Wiwat

505
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,660
and how he evades Leap Day.

506
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,440
I’m sorry.

507
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,740
This is all I can do.

508
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,366
I’ll help you.

509
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,166
It’s easy.

510
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,640
I did it.

511
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:09,433
It works.

512
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:10,853
Dream will be safe.

513
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:12,780
So Wiwat knows how to outsmart Leap Day?

514
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,626
But it is cruel.

515
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,826
It’s inhumane.

516
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:17,853
No.

517
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,893
Night would never do such a thing.

518
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:22,380
After seeing Dream like that,

519
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,366
are you still sure he wouldn’t?
