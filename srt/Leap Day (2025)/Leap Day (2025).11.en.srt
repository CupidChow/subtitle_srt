1
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,079
A quarter after noon?

2
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:09,047
If the next Leap Day is coming at 12.15, like the stars said,

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:12,495
we can stop Dream and Ozone’s breathings at 12.10.

4
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:14,079
I’m never agreeing to this.

5
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:14,951
I get it.

6
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:18,007
That’s why I’m gonna try it before letting Ozone and Dream go through it.

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,843
What’s it gonna be? I KNOW YOU CAN HELP THEM, DAD.

8
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:20,903
You gonna help us or not?

9
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,183
I will.

10
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,047
If I didn’t...

11
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:25,071
No.

12
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:26,567
You’ll be fine.

13
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:28,867
I’m ready.

14
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,663
He’s still in V-fib.

15
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,279
Charge to 200 joules.

16
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,271
Stand back.

17
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:40,935
I’m standing back.

18
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:41,959
Everyone, back away.

19
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:43,437
Clear!

20
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:45,947
CPR.

21
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:59,697
Why did you stop, Professor?

22
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,197
Night.

23
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:12,587
Night.

24
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,117
Night.

25
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:18,357
Night.

26
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:19,575
Can you hear me?

27
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:20,895
Night.

28
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,627
Night.

29
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:29,751
Can you hear me?

30
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,495
Night!

31
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,707
Night.

32
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,039
Night.

33
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,015
Night!

34
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,087
Night?

35
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:03,597
Night.

36
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,187
He’s back.

37
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:08,559
His EKG is back.

38
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:15,277
Everyone.

39
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:17,551
I believe this could work.

40
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:55,695
At first,

41
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:59,327
I thought I woke up where I was.

42
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,263
But everything just seemed different.

43
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,591
It seemed that there was something

44
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,215
pulling me to a door.

45
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,799
When I walked through that door,

46
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:32,855
I saw a desert.

47
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,991
There was nothing but sand,

48
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,191
stretching endlessly.

49
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,375
In the sky,

50
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:20,239
there was the moon

51
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:22,799
and the sun.

52
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,977
At the same time?

53
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,237
Yes.

54
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,999
Did you…

55
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,471
See anyone from your family?

56
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:43,207
I hoped I might.

57
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,815
But I didn’t see anyone.

58
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:50,831
Except…

59
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:58,943
Myself.

60
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:00,607
My younger self.

61
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,543
And then my younger self walked towards me

62
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,783
and pointed at the moon.

63
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:10,607
He said…

64
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,055
You’re night.

65
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,199
Don’t stay in the sunlight

66
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:16,197
if you don’t want to disappear.

67
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:32,311
After that, the sky turned a messy color.

68
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,639
Let’s call it a day.

69
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:46,583
We can try again tomorrow.

70
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:49,397
Of course.

71
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:54,023
If you all don’t mind,

72
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,879
I’d love to give it a try, too.

73
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:05,695
Night survived it.

74
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,903
And we probably shouldn’t let him do it back-to-back.

75
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,503
If my brother has to go through with it,

76
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,007
I want to make sure he really will be okay.

77
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,417
Alright.

78
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:29,847
We’ll do it tomorrow.

79
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,217
Night.

80
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:52,399
Were you scared before you went to sleep?

81
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,079
No.

82
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,335
I was just hoping that

83
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:04,879
it wouldn’t be painful, frightening, or torturing.

84
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:09,143
Because if that was the case,

85
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,999
I would feel really awful

86
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,495
making you do it.

87
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:35,751
I’m not sleeping.

88
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,023
Oh, alright.

89
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:47,127
I don’t want you to do it tomorrow.

90
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:57,071
I’ll be able to tell you

91
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,079
what it is like there.

92
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,719
Whether it’s scary or not.

93
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,279
Well?

94
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,277
Would you rather you try it yourself tomorrow?

95
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:08,431
No.

96
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:11,991
I understand

97
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,007
that it looks scary.

98
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:17,047
But I will be just fine.

99
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,079
Believe me.

100
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,907
You have to come back.

101
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,191
Of course I will.

102
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,503
I couldn’t just abandon my big brother, could I?

103
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,799
We don’t leave each other behind.

104
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,767
We don’t.

105
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,215
We’ll do it exactly the same way.

106
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,015
Once it’s time, we’ll draw you right back.

107
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:13,151
Don’t worry.

108
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:14,655
I’ll stay safe.

109
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,159
Not funny.

110
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:11,775
You already know what to do, don’t you?

111
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:16,543
Did Night tell you?

112
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,267
No.

113
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,655
Night knows what to do.

114
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,647
What does that mean?

115
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:36,375
Go.

116
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,377
Ozone will be safe.

117
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:53,967
He’s back.

118
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:03,639
How are you?

119
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,751
I’m okay.

120
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:08,375
I’m fine.

121
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,231
It’s not scary at all.

122
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,607
Did you find anything?

123
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,671
I met my younger self.

124
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,897
I don’t know what he was trying to tell me, though.

125
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:27,759
What do you mean?

126
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:33,503
He said,

127
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:35,751
“You already know what to do.”

128
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:57,695
He said, “You already know…”

129
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:00,783
Already know what?

130
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:03,999
I wonder.

131
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:07,815
Why did you want to see us?

132
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,431
I’m teaching you how to use the defibrillator.

133
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,359
I’ll also teach you how to do CPR.

134
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:17,837
And if you’re up for it, I’m teaching you how to administer the anesthetic.

135
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:19,997
Look.

136
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:22,319
I’m not saying I won’t do it,

137
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:25,095
but what about Professor Wiwat and Kit?

138
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,399
They’ll still be there.

139
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,727
I just… don’t trust their middle-aged temperament.

140
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,911
Say, they resent us for something while Leap Day hits,

141
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,015
we’re gonna be in trouble.

142
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:39,311
This is also just in case they don’t stick to the plan.

143
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,807
Okay.

144
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:43,999
Shall we begin?

145
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,295
Alright. Let’s do it.

146
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,463
First, make sure the skin is completely dry

147
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,287
so the electrodes attach securely.

148
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,591
First of all, take this,

149
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:53,767
and secure it around the upper arm.

150
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,799
This is the anesthetic.

151
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,907
Once you sanitize the skin, you inject this.

152
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,495
This is only to keep the skin dry.

153
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,527
Is this correct?

154
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:07,743
Does this show vitals?

155
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:08,839
That’s the defibrillator.

156
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,807
But you gotta plug it in first.

157
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,997
Which one?

158
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,311
This?

159
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:15,127
And then…

160
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:15,991
Careful.

161
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:16,895
Like this?

162
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:17,783
Correct.

163
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:18,815
That’s it.

164
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:19,857
All done.

165
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:22,697
We’re done.

166
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,479
Let’s take a break for now.

167
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:25,879
You did amazing already.

168
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:26,991
You can come practice again tomorrow.

169
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,167
If you’re up for it, that is.

170
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:29,839
Okay.

171
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:32,327
Let me know if there’s anything you need my help with.

172
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:33,817
If I can do it, I will.

173
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,227
Umm.

174
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,067
Hey.

175
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,511
They’re cool, aren’t they?

176
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:53,727
They are.

177
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,759
They are.

178
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:57,207
That’s so lame.

179
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,013
Well, you watch cartoons, too, so you’re just as lame.

180
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,015
I don’t watch them all that often.

181
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,535
Leap Day, shoo-shoo!

182
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,695
Leap Day, shoo-shoo!

183
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,935
Leap Day, shoo-shoo!

184
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,319
Leap Day, shoo-shoo!

185
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,367
Are you doing anything tomorrow?

186
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,039
If not, come over and practice some more.

187
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,017
Ozone?

188
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,047
Ozone!

189
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:29,567
Ozone!

190
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:30,907
Hey!

191
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,067
Ozone!

192
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:34,767
Day, don’t do that.

193
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:35,543
Don’t do that!

194
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,175
Dream, grab me a pillow and a towel!

195
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:37,663
Hurry up!

196
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:38,703
Ozone!

197
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:39,751
Stay calm, Day.

198
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:40,791
Ozone!

199
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:42,671
Day, I know what you’re thinking.

200
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,927
But doing that will only make him choke.

201
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,391
Lift his head up.

202
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,359
Make him lay on his side.

203
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:51,495
Stay calm. Stay calm.

204
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:52,479
Call an ambulance.

205
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:53,503
Right now.

206
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:55,751
Stay calm, Day.

207
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,167
Crap!

208
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,111
What is that noise?

209
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,743
What the hell was that noise?

210
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:19,607
Ozone.

211
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:20,907
Ozone!

212
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,367
Ozone.

213
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:23,511
How are you feeling?

214
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,831
Tired.

215
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:29,239
Are you alright?

216
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:30,359
Alright.

217
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:31,239
Stay calm.

218
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,607
Let him stay on his side.

219
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:34,151
It makes it easier for him to breathe.

220
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:35,591
Don’t let him lay on his back.

221
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:37,097
We’re okay.

222
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:39,735
What do you think?

223
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:42,591
Is this Leap Day’s doing?

224
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,263
Has this ever happened to Ozone before?

225
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:51,777
No.

226
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,067
How about this?

227
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:04,023
We’re taking Ozone to Professor Wiwat tomorrow.

228
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,287
We’ll have a checkup.

229
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,295
But I believe this is no coincidence.

230
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:14,495
This is the first time the three of us could hear the stars,

231
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:18,639
and it happened right after you and I “died.”

232
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:24,783
He’s okay for now.

233
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,067
Take a breath.

234
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,151
Good.

235
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,447
Now hold your breath.

236
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:41,077
Good.

237
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,535
Exhale.

238
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,239
Thank you.

239
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,623
How is he?

240
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,887
Everything’s completely normal.

241
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,487
His blood oxygen level is excellent.

242
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,351
His heart and lungs sound normal, too.

243
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,511
He’s, in fact, very healthy.

244
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:27,671
If it worries you,

245
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,399
let him take this just in case.

246
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,671
Antiepileptics.

247
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:35,567
Thank you.

248
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:39,037
There’s nothing to worry about as long as it doesn’t happen again.

249
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:40,271
But if…

250
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:46,027
Before the next Leap Day comes,

251
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:48,999
if it happens

252
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,407
and keeps happening,

253
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:55,207
we might need to use a different anesthetic for Ozone.

254
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:00,983
What if it happens right when Leap Day hits?

255
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:05,159
That’s what I’m worrying about as well.

256
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,999
Leap Day could be waiting for this moment.

257
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:11,627
You’re right.

258
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,023
But there’s nothing we can do now

259
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:18,079
except keeping an eye on him.

260
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:21,717
But, hey.

261
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:23,815
Don’t worry.

262
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,907
We won’t let anything happen to him.

263
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:34,079
If there’s anything I can help with,

264
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,119
please let me know.

265
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:36,423
I’ll do anything.

266
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:43,279
I think we should be more vigilant for the time being.

267
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:45,407
In case Leap Day tries again.

268
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:49,103
I agree.

269
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,717
I think, even when you and Day are busy,

270
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:54,487
Dream and Ozone need someone to watch over them.

271
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:57,319
It might be better if we stick together.

272
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,375
Night.

273
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,767
Maybe…

274
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:10,007
Maybe you guys should stay at my place for a while?

275
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,037
You don’t have to be there every day.

276
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:15,227
But I think it might make us feel more at ease if we’re together.

277
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:17,871
Yes.

278
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,867
Yes. Yes. Yes.

279
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:21,157
Yes.

280
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:22,547
Okay.

281
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:24,271
If you don’t mind.

282
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,223
I don’t.

283
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,759
Well…

284
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,647
We’ll impose for a while, then.

285
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:33,767
Don’t mention it.

286
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:34,787
We’re cool.

287
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:49,639
Let’s eat.

288
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:50,839
Your drinks.

289
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:52,543
The green one is for Ozone.

290
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:53,447
Oh, sorry.

291
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:54,127
He likes that?

292
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:55,151
Yeah.

293
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,351
Ozone is gonna love this.

294
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,215
Usually I make him a simple omelette.

295
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,295
And nothing else?

296
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:12,607
We’ve been watching our diet.

297
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,183
Something on your face.

298
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:34,607
Oh?

299
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:35,927
Hold on.

300
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:38,527
One, two, three.

301
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,135
Holy crap—Stop!

302
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:44,359
Day, stop!

303
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:49,439
Oh, hey, Dream.

304
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:50,455
Come on.

305
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:55,839
Crap...

306
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:56,991
I’m hitting the brake.

307
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:57,863
And now…

308
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,319
Stop. Just stop.

309
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,295
Night’s good.

310
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:06,943
Day is better.

311
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:09,457
He learns fast.

312
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:10,575
See?

313
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,015
I’m a pro driver now.

314
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:12,815
Well, Ozone?

315
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:13,997
Am I good?

316
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,975
You alright, Day?

317
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:17,431
Night is so much cooler.

318
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:19,607
Good job, Day.

319
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:21,991
Night is the best.

320
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,671
Day is the best.

321
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:25,967
A round of applause!

322
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:29,879
Can you guys stand next to each other?

323
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,567
Move closer.

324
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,679
Twins.

325
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:33,447
They’re twins.

326
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,471
Twins.

327
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:03,943
Alright.

328
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,947
Move forward, forward, forward.

329
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:06,983
Yeah.

330
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,987
Hold on, lemme pull this trick.

331
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,983
Back up, back up, back up.

332
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,567
They’re hitting us hard.

333
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:13,831
Back it up!

334
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:14,799
Hold on. Hold on.

335
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:15,599
I’m pulling them in.

336
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:16,759
Yeah. Just like that.

337
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:18,519
Playing your mobile game?

338
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:19,207
Yeah.

339
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:21,207
Let me catch you.

340
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:22,439
I’ll pull them and you push them.

341
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:23,223
Okay?

342
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,415
Alright, handsome.

343
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:26,417
I’ll do it if you do.

344
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,927
Alright, good girl.

345
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:29,463
Alright.

346
00:25:30,147 --> 00:25:31,527
How’s that!

347
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,191
That’s a direct hit.

348
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:34,439
Keep pulling. I’ll push them in.

349
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:37,175
Just like that.

350
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:38,567
Hey, they’re coming in hot.

351
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:39,815
Back up, back up!

352
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,335
Back up, back up.

353
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,175
Just like that.

354
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,711
Keep going.

355
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,127
Alright.

356
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,951
I’m ready.

357
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:49,743
Go, go.

358
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:53,159
Hit them right there.

359
00:25:53,747 --> 00:25:54,759
Yeah!

360
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:56,295
Night.

361
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:57,247
No, keep going.

362
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:58,287
I’ll watch.

363
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:00,175
Hey, who’s that?

364
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:03,839
I’m her boyfriend.

365
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,607
Oh, the med student.

366
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,783
What’s up?

367
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,375
We’ll be done in a minute.

368
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:16,495
Actually, let’s call it a day.

369
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:18,287
Let’s play again tomorrow.

370
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:18,959
Oh?

371
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:19,999
You’re done?

372
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:21,055
Why don’t you keep playing?

373
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,839
You guys seem to be having fun.

374
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:24,215
What are you, jealous?

375
00:26:24,255 --> 00:26:26,007
I’m a sixth grader!

376
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,007
Sixth grader?

377
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:32,887
What are you doing staying up so late playing games?

378
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,255
Go to bed.

379
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:35,791
Dream.

380
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:37,423
How could you be such a bad example to a brat?

381
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:38,447
What?

382
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:40,647
Who are you calling a brat, bro?

383
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:42,367
Age is just a number.

384
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:43,991
Dream here is my student, you know?

385
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,231
He’s right, actually.

386
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:48,519
Are you sure you’re a kid?

387
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:50,247
You sound like an old man.

388
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:51,719
What language are you even speaking?

389
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:52,839
“Pull, pull, push, push.”

390
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:56,159
Go take someone’s blood pressure, why don’t you?

391
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,471
Clearly you don’t speak pro-gamer.

392
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,079
If you don’t get it, get a prescription at your local pharmacist, bro.

393
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:02,787
I’m going to sleep.

394
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,431
What a waste of time for a sixth grader.

395
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:06,967
Hold on, hold on.

396
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:08,631
Let’s play a game.

397
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:10,455
Night.

398
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:11,727
Bring it!

399
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,135
What does this button do?

400
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:19,639
That’s the attack button.

401
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:20,783
For when you find the enemy.

402
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:22,463
You attack the ones in red.

403
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,175
No, over there.

404
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:26,351
Ozone, what are you doing?

405
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:28,991
Day. Day.

406
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:29,703
Yeah?

407
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:30,735
Day.

408
00:27:32,263 --> 00:27:35,015
Do you think they will…

409
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:38,863
They will… boink-boink?

410
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,311
What?

411
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:42,987
Boink-boink?

412
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:44,055
Boink. Boink.

413
00:27:44,103 --> 00:27:46,095
You know… Mating.

414
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,127
Gosh.

415
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:49,599
What are you even saying?

416
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,319
Well, they’re in the same bed.

417
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,359
Same bed.

418
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,399
Ozone, leave them be.

419
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,767
Whatever they do is their business, okay?

420
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:00,903
I’m going to bed.

421
00:28:03,237 --> 00:28:06,663
Well, if they’re in a good mood tomorrow morning,

422
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,855
you’ll know if they boink—I mean, no!

423
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,535
Mating—Never mind!

424
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:12,015
I don’t want to know.

425
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:13,397
Day.

426
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:15,111
Let’s watch.

427
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:16,559
Watch what? No!

428
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,647
Let’s go watch.

429
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,439
Day.

430
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,535
No way.

431
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:23,479
It’s for discovery.

432
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:24,599
Day.

433
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:26,679
Where did you learn all these vocabularies?

434
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,079
Have you seen it before?

435
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:30,047
Well?

436
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,959
All animals mate.

437
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:32,975
Ugh.

438
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:34,697
Day.

439
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,111
Day, it’s for discovery.

440
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:42,951
No!

441
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:43,983
Day.

442
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,987
I’m curious.

443
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:50,639
Hey, if that one shows up...

444
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:51,775
Yeah, I know.

445
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,615
Oh, brother.

446
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,655
Go to bed.

447
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:03,335
I’m literally also doing my homework,

448
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,183
and you’re still slower than me.

449
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:06,463
Fine.

450
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,551
I’ll stop.

451
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,511
Why don’t we play again

452
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:11,903
when you lose all your baby teeth?

453
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,239
Hey, that’s...

454
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:21,303
I got beat by a kid.

455
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,583
Aww, it’s alright.

456
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,831
No more “pushing” and “pulling.”

457
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:30,295
Let’s just go to bed.

458
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,063
Alright, doctor.

459
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,295
Night.

460
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:53,007
What?

461
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,359
I just want a cuddle.

462
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:12,327
Can I… kiss you?

463
00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:32,695
That’s enough.

464
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:36,023
Or else I won’t stop.

465
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:37,807
Oh, you.

466
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:57,687
Let’s sleep?

467
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:00,639
Let’s sleep.

468
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:04,583
Hungry.

469
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:05,911
Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.

470
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:07,111
Hungry. Hungry.

471
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,783
Hungry… Hungry.

472
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,183
What do you want for breakfast?

473
00:31:12,067 --> 00:31:13,599
Dunno. Hungry.

474
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,839
I’ll go out and buy something.

475
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,199
I don’t know what to cook, either.

476
00:31:23,877 --> 00:31:25,391
Hey, just use the kitchen.

477
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:27,387
Don’t worry and just use anything in the fridge.

478
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:39,827
What?

479
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,187
Nah.

480
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:49,671
Did you… sleep well?

481
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:50,815
Ozone.

482
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,839
You?

483
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,907
No, it wasn’t me.

484
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,759
Believe it or not, Ozone started this.

485
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:03,999
Ah, I see.

486
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,759
Should we call Professor Wiwat over for your injection?

487
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:08,567
No.

488
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,667
Ozone.

489
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:13,237
He was joking.

490
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:19,799
Why don’t you guys sit down?

491
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:20,831
I’ll make breakfast.

492
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:23,719
I’ll help.

493
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:30,175
Take this.

494
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,237
Should we let Ozone help crack some eggs?

495
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:39,991
Make sure you don’t get egg shells in the mix and the yolks remain perfect.

496
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:41,423
Can you do that?

497
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:42,623
Yes.

498
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:44,687
I can. I can.

499
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:47,775
You’re all up.

500
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:48,943
What are you doing?

501
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:54,375
I didn’t know you’re a chef yourself, Ozone.

502
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:56,887
Careful, Ozone.

503
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:58,023
Can I help?

504
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:58,999
Yes.

505
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,023
Go ahead.

506
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,567
Help him out, Dream.

507
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,311
You sure you know how to fry sausages?

508
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:05,375
What? Of course I do.

509
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:06,631
I make it for Dream every morning.

510
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:07,663
She can confirm.

511
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:12,863
Let me see.

512
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,255
Ready?

513
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:41,231
One more.

514
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,455
Poke your cheek.

515
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:51,647
Nine.

516
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,231
Eight.

517
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:55,007
Seven.

518
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:56,527
Six.

519
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:59,103
Leap Day is coming next year.

520
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:00,623
Are you ready?

521
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,655
Of course not.

522
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,415
But I’m not afraid anymore.

523
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:10,327
We’re going to win this time around.

524
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:11,727
Yeah.

525
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,039
I know.

526
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:16,343
And I know we will.

527
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:29,479
- Three. Two. One. - Three. Two. One.

528
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:31,983
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

529
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,617
Ozone, Happy New Year.

530
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:45,015
- You, too, Day. - Happy New Year.

531
00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:58,591
JANUARY 1, 2024

532
00:34:58,615 --> 00:34:59,615
It’s January 1st.

533
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,983
59 days until leap day.

534
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,551
It’s not just Dream and Ozone

535
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,023
who need to take care of themselves.

536
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:09,987
Day, Night,

537
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:11,337
Kit, and I

538
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:13,999
can’t be careless, either.

539
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:16,867
We don’t know when Leap Day will hit.

540
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:20,847
Stay healthy.

541
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,567
Take your vitamins.

542
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,647
Sleep well.

543
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:25,823
Exercise.

544
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:26,871
Do some cardio.

545
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:30,615
Get rid of whatever weaknesses we have.

546
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,919
From now on, Ozone,

547
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:40,599
if you hear the stars or have a dream,

548
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:41,877
you gotta let us know.

549
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:43,767
Umm.

550
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:46,815
Don’t worry, you two.

551
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:49,575
Ozone and I will take care of you, too.

552
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:52,663
We’re not going to make this one-sided.

553
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,197
Right.

554
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:58,495
We take care of each other.

555
00:35:58,535 --> 00:35:59,535
Right?

556
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:03,991
Thanks, Dream.

557
00:36:04,507 --> 00:36:05,991
Thank you, Ozone.

558
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:14,311
Ozone.

559
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:15,823
My shoulders are sore.

560
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:16,617
I need a massage.

561
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:17,175
Where?

562
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:17,895
Where?

563
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:18,439
Where?

564
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:19,527
Right here.

565
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,759
Oh, that’s good.

566
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:23,791
Here as well.

567
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:31,399
From now on,

568
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,775
Professor Wiwat’s operating room must be ready.

569
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,319
Medical equipment.

570
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:44,719
Safety measures.

571
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:47,575
Everything needs to be in place

572
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:48,919
and ready to go.

573
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:03,423
Dream and Ozone must stay inside

574
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,271
until February 29.

575
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:10,743
See you.

576
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,607
When I’m not around,

577
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,607
Night will look after Ozone.

578
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:18,735
- Eat, eat. - It’s here.

579
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,759
And when Night is away,

580
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,591
I’ll look after Dream.

581
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:31,639
I made enough fried rice for you as well.

582
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:39,519
Thanks.

583
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:40,679
Have your fill.

584
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:44,399
You gotta stay in shape.

585
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,827
All we do now is wait.

586
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:52,815
Two more days.

587
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:55,417
Yes.

588
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:56,991
Two more days.

589
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:01,231
And we finally end this nonsense.

590
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:12,463
FEBRUARY 27, 2024

591
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,117
If we pull this off for the kids,

592
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,587
do you want your Leap Day cured, too?

593
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:27,071
I’ll help you.

594
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,997
You’ll help me cure my Leap Day?

595
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:40,447
I don’t have anyone left that I love.

596
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,359
All this time,

597
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:58,423
I spent my life holding grudges.

598
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,479
I never had time for love.

599
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:01,975
Once we’re done with this,

600
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:06,863
I’ll go back to living my life.

601
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,407
Trying to get back at me, you mean?

602
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:17,175
I stopped thinking about that.

603
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,519
You’re paying for what you did, aren’t you?

604
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,735
In the end,

605
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,791
the ones you love,

606
00:39:32,427 --> 00:39:35,623
the ones you chose to protect with your bloodied hands,

607
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:37,775
didn’t choose you.

608
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:41,311
In the end,

609
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:44,751
are we even different, you and I?

610
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:49,167
We both have no one left.

611
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,991
I’m going home, doc.

612
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:41,797
Where?

613
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:43,727
Where?

614
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,351
Where?

615
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:48,127
Kid Ozone.

616
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,367
Where is he?

617
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:53,055
He’s not here.

618
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:55,191
Ozone!

619
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:00,879
He’s not here.

620
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:05,991
Who…

621
00:41:07,237 --> 00:41:08,695
Who are you?

622
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:12,307
Ozone, it’s me, Day.

623
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,215
Where…

624
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:24,575
Where…

625
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,183
Ozone…

626
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:29,455
Ozone doesn’t exist in this world.

627
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:32,671
This is the crinkle in Leap Day’s afterlife.

628
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:35,391
It’s for people with Leap Day only.

629
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,827
Then…

630
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:39,597
Then…

631
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,455
How…

632
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:43,887
How did you get here?

633
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,511
You’re in a dream, Ozone.

634
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,311
You’re not really here.

635
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:50,911
If you really are here…

636
00:41:58,907 --> 00:41:59,935
What?

637
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:02,839
Don’t worry.

638
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,855
Day knows what to do.

639
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:05,703
Tell Day.

640
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:06,623
Tell Day.

641
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:07,359
Tell Day.

642
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,463
Please tell Day.

643
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:09,231
Tell Day.

644
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:10,199
Tell Day!

645
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:11,111
Tell Day.

646
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:11,855
Tell Day.

647
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:12,935
What is it, Ozone?

648
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:13,455
Tell Day.

649
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:14,151
What?

650
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:15,199
I– I have to…

651
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:15,807
What?

652
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:16,791
I have to tell Day.

653
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:17,615
I have to tell Day.

654
00:42:17,647 --> 00:42:18,615
I have to tell Day.

655
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:19,599
I have to tell Day.

656
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:20,751
Tell me what?

657
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,423
Day said–Day said you’ll know.

658
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:25,427
Day said you’ll know.

659
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:26,175
You’ll know.

660
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:27,215
You’ll know.

661
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:28,517
You’ll know.

662
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:29,959
Know what?

663
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:33,199
How to save me.

664
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:34,303
You know how to save me.

665
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:35,559
How to save me.

666
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,439
How to save me.

667
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,351
Do you know, Day?

668
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,119
Do you?

669
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:39,143
Ozone.

670
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:41,247
I…

671
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:44,519
I don’t know how right now.

672
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,527
But I’m trying to think about it.

673
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,975
I, I, I…

674
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,031
I’m dead.

675
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,015
I am dead.

676
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:54,855
I’m dead.

677
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,791
I’m dead.

678
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,103
- Ozone, stay calm. - I’m dead.

679
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,107
- I’m dead. - Ozone, listen.

680
00:42:59,127 --> 00:43:00,542
I’m dead.

681
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:02,547
You will be fine.

682
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:04,547
You will be safe, alright?

683
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:05,575
I’m dead.

684
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:07,959
I won’t let Leap Day hurt you.

685
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,391
I’m dead. I’m dead.

686
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:10,951
Alright?

687
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:14,383
I’m dead. Dead. Dead. Dead.

688
00:43:14,415 --> 00:43:15,855
Alright, Ozone?

689
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,839
Ozone.

690
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,367
Ozone!

691
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:27,427
Ozone!

692
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,415
Ozone!

693
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:36,347
Ozone!

694
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:37,997
Ozone!

695
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,463
You have to remember what your younger self told you.

696
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:59,463
If we love them, they die.

697
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:00,207
Start the timer.

698
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:02,015
But without us,

699
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:03,151
they’ll make it.

700
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:04,639
What are you two doing?

701
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:05,863
This is too dangerous!

702
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:07,191
I’ll be in your care, Professor.

703
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:12,799
Stay together.

704
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:15,383
Stay.
