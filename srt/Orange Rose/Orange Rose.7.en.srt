(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Oh, what the hell is going on here?

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,500
Oh, P'Nai.

3
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,360
Are you here for coffee?

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,200
Yes, I want a strong one.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,340
I'm sleepy.

6
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,820
I know you're sleepy.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,940
Come on, I'll make it for you.

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,700
Let me turn on the light for you.

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,880
Thank you so much, N'Zee.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,660
You're welcome.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,620
I don't have anything to drink with

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:50,900
coffee.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,060
Thank you so much.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,520
You're welcome, P'Nai.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,950
Hey, do you have any updates?

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,970
Here, I'll give this to P'N

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,090
ai.

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,110
I want a strong one.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,310
Hold on.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,610
I want to ask if you have any

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,050
updates.

22
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,510
About who?

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,810
Well, about P'Tonrak and N'

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,310
Sifa.

25
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,850
Shh, be quiet.

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,450
Do you want the whole office to hear

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,550
about it?

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,410
You'll be in trouble.

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,270
About P'Tonrak and N'S

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,730
ifa?

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,890
I talked to N'Sifa.

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,910
Well…

33
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,490
Well?

34
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,210
Nothing much.

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,130
What?

36
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,970
I don't get it.

37
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,870
I made coffee for you.

38
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,070
Let's go.

39
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,770
Okay, let's go.

40
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,670
Is there anything I can help you with?

41
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,750
Not right now.

42
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,310
Okay.

43
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,210
I'm done making coffee.

44
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,810
I'll go to work now.

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,010
Where are you going?

46
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,670
I'm going to work.

47
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,250
I think there's something going on.

48
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,510
What is it?

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,280
N'Nai told me that you're

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,820
a tiger.

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,080
A tiger?
