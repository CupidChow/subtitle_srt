2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,730
team.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,110
This is another team from our company.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,350
Hello.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:08,650
Hello.

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,550
My name is Nine.

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,890
I'm the leader of team 2.

8
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,550
Hi, I'm Zee.

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm the content creator.

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,030
My name is Ji.

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,470
But in the entertainment industry, my name is

12
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,230
JiJi.

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,050
So you guys have to call me P'

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:25,670
JiJi.

15
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,110
And I'm the most beautiful girl in

16
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,530
this office.

17
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,150
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,190
My name is June.

19
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,690
I'm the same position as P'Ji

20
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:36,830
Ji.

21
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,310
I'm the most beautiful girl in this

22
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:39,410
office.

23
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,270
Wow, you're so beautiful.

24
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,430
Don't listen to them.

25
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,050
My name is Milan.

26
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,590
I'm the admin.

27
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,810
And that's Ralph and I.

28
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,690
We're the graphic designers.

29
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,950
We don't have much time to talk

30
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,430
to each other.

31
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,710
What are you talking about?

32
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,130
I'm inviting everyone to have lunch together.

33
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,370
It's our welcome party.

34
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,650
Wow.

35
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,660
P'Torak, I have a document

36
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,520
for you to sign.

37
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,200
Leave it here.

38
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,940
I'll do it.

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,700
Okay.

41
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,450
Ouch.

42
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,530
Why is the last one more beautiful than

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,010
this one?

44
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,750
Why do I have to choose two?

45
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,930
Do you want to wear my shoes first?

46
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,830
Do you want to wear my shoes first?

47
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,090
Thank you.

48
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,970
But I think your work outfit and my

49
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,390
shoes won't look good together.

50
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,230
I'll wear them.

51
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,590
Thank you.

52
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,170
Are you here for the job interview?

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
I hope you'll pass.

54
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,660
Thank you.
