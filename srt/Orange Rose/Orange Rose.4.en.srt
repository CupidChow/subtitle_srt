2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,610
I have something to ask you.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,010
Sifah, I think we should fix

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,510
this.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,090
Here.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,810
I wonder…

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,590
I wonder if the client has sent the

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,270
product yet.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,670
Yes, here it is.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,630
The color, the smell.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,990
How does it work?

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,010
What does it do?

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,090
This is Lychee and Rose.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,170
It helps to reduce wrinkles.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,230
Moisturize and boost collagen to

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,590
the skin.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,750
Boost, boost.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,850
And this is Pomelo Poppy.

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,570

Are you listening?

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,050
Are you listening?

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,490
Hello, sis.

25
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,950

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,650

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,450
Okay, I'm listening.

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,810

32
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,930
% natural.

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,050
It helps to reduce oil on the skin

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,550
which is the cause of various skin problems.

35
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,290
And it has a pink color.

36
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,310
It helps to moisturize the skin.

37
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,090
And this is the last bottle.

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,770
It's Pink Salt and Organic C

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,170

And it helps to reduce the risk of

45
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,010
acne.

46
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,890
Clear?

47
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,290
Okay.

48
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,170
Okay, clear.

49
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,230
That's all, right?

50
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:46,990
Yes, that's all.

51
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,290
I have work to do.

52
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,010
I have to go.

53
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,070
Bye, teacher.

54
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,850
See you later.

55
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,590
Teacher.

56
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,390
Come here.

57
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,650
Come here.

58
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,590
I have something to tell you.

59
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,410
What is it?

60
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:06,990
What is it?

61
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,450
Well, I…

62
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,670
I think P'Pleungdak

63
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,150
and Nong Jeefah are

64
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,490
having an affair.

65
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,930
Right?

66
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,130
See?
