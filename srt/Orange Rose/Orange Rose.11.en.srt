00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:00,630
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Jealous?

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,370
No, I'm not.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:10,990
I don't think he's coming.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,950
I think he'll be here soon.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,870
Judging from the photo of P'T

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,110
oey in the Les Parc app,

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,610
he's quite good-looking.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,970
If he's going on a date, that

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,270
's crazy.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,830
I'll show you.

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,630
Come here.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,150
He's good-looking.

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,070
How is it?

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,170
This app has 3 ways to match.

15
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,890
The first one is taking a photo of

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,610
a person.

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,550
Wow.

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,470
So cute.

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,690
Everyone is cute.

20
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:39,970
True.

21
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,690
Next, I've never seen this app before.

22
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,150
It's a voice matching app.

23
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,290
How?

24
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,150
Just press the button, you'll hear the

25
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,390
voice.

26
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,730
If you like it, they'll match you.

27
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,510
Really?

28
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,490
Yes.

29
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,890
Lastly, it's so cool.

30
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,070
The app matches you.

31
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,290
Look.

32
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,230
So cute.

33
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,510
It's called Destiny.

34
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,090
It also has another function.

35
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,490
It has a game for you to play.

36
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,210
Do you want to try it?

37
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:10,950
Come here.

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:35,330
How long have you

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,510
been waiting?

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,330
Not long.

41
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,050
This is my friend.

42
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,510
Her name is Noomjai.

43
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,510
She has something to do here.

44
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,670
So she asked me to give her a

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,770
ride.

46
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,130
Have a seat.

47
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,790
You can order something to eat.

48
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,450
I'll wait for you.

49
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,290
Is there anything good here?

50
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,220
I think she has something to do.

51
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,840
Can I go out for a while?

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:00,940
Sure.

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Come here.

54
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,009
Noomjai is so cute.

55
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,410
She's Tungpok, right?

56
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,630
Noomina is Tung, but No

57
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,470
omjai is her friend.

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:16,810
Huh?

59
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,350
Why do you like her friend?

60
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,350
I don't know.

61
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,650
Am I that bad?

62
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,150
Come on.

63
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,890
Guys, help me.

64
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,650
What should we do?

65
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,730
If we help P'Toey and

66
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,230
the person she asked for a ride, will

67
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,630
we be sad?

68
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,910
I don't think so.

69
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,330
But we have the right to break up.

70
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,330
We haven't been together yet.

71
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,270
I'll do it.

72
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,430
Hey, Toey.

73
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,350
Are you here with your boyfriend?

74
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,150
No.

75
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,190
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,740
What's your name?

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,480
You're so cute.

78
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,380
My name is Noomjai.

79
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,760
I see.

80
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,760
Noomjai, do you have a

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:02:59,940
boyfriend?

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,600
No, I don't.

83
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,180
Oh, you don't have a boyfriend yet.

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm tired of hitting on you.

85
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,260
Don't be shy.

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,580
Hello, Noomjai.

87
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,140
Do you know each other?

88
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,940
Of course.

89
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,620
Of course, I do.

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,460
How do you know Minart?

91
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,440
I know him from the Lace Park

92
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,540
app.

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,480
This app?

94
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,340
Yes, this app.

95
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,200
I think Minart is cute.

96
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
I think you like him.

97
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,240
No, I don't.

98
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm single.

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
I don't have a choice.

100
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,820
You don't have a choice.

101
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,690
Let's talk outside.

102
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,490
Let's go.

103
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,330
I'll be right back.

104
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,920
What are you doing?

105
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,880
What am I doing?

106
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,100
You're doing this.

107
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,480
Are you jealous?

108
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,540
No, I'm not.

109
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm jealous.

110
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,760
But you're here with your friend.

111
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,399
Don't be nervous.

112
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,519
Why can't I be nervous?

113
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,840
Noomjai.

114
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,500
Why?

115
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,180
Are you jealous?

116
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,960
No, I'm not.

117
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,780
Are you?

118
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,340
No.

119
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,900
Are you?

120
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,300
No.

121
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,220
Are you?

122
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,820
Noomjai.
