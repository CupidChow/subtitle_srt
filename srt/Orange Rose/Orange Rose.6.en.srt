00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:20,200
1 I heard

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,730
that Team 1 is doing a promotion for

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,510
Thalupao.

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,750
P'Ben praises you a lot.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,030
You seem to be in a good mood

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,690
since this morning.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,930
I'm so jealous of Team 1.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,370
They must have a great day.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,670
That's right.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,570
I also heard that you're here to

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,510
order something, right?

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,220
Guys, I think we should celebrate.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,300
According to our agreement.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,380
If Team 1 does a good job, Team

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,680
1 will win.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,720
But this time, both teams are equal.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,820
So today, let's go to my house

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,940
party.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,800
It's on me.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,200
Um.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,240
I'll invite both of us.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,820
P'Fah and P'Ae.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,760
Let's practice singing together.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,700
Okay, P'Nine.

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,740
Don't trust me.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,900
I don't want to complain.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,360
I have a very strong throat.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,980
Don't say that I'm not good

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,080
enough.

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,220
That's right.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,840
But we're still brothers.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,410
Don't look down on us.

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,050
We're new here.

35
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,030
We're afraid of you.

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,550
You're right.

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,870
Hey.

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,890
I think we should do it at my

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:06,990
house.

40
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,990
I'll treat you tonight.

41
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,590
See you at my house at 8 p.

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:16,690
m.

43
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,550
Don't be drunk.

44
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,450
Don't go home.

45
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,850
Deal.

46
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,230
What are you wearing today?

47
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,150
Help me.

48
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,930
I'll wear…

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,040
Funny.

50
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,460
I'll wear…

51
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,120
Do you want to try it on?

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,840
It's comfortable.

53
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,440
Everyone can wear it.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,420
You can wear it for both men and

55
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,620
women.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,020
I'll try it on.

57
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
I'll do it.
