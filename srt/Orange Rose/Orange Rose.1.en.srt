00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,550
Oh my gosh, what's going on

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:16,830
?

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,790
Did the customer tell you when the product will be delivered? Today, my dear. They

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,230
should be here by noon. Okay, what about the two new employees who

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,470
are starting work today? Oh, Nong Pleng and Nong Si Fa. If they get here,

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,910
Mimi will introduce them to you.

7
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,750
Hey, Si Fa, I think I've found my soulmate.

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,630
What a pretty girl! Her

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,470
and her body smells good too

10
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,230
, I know. I

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,910
it slide. Oh, I know. I know.

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,190
Everyone, Nong Si Fa and Nong Pleng are our team's new employees.

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,630
Phi Kiew is a content creator. Phi Toey is an admin manager

14
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,390
. Phi Thara is a graphic designer. Hello, everyone

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,470
. If you have any problems, you can consult me anytime. Stop, Reta. Oh, I see girls. No

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,830
way. Before you go help her, is your work done? Then why is everyone

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,789
ganging up on me? Okay, okay. Now that we know each other a bit, let’s go our separate ways and

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,190
get to work. Submit your work today, not tomorrow. What the heck

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:29,910
?
