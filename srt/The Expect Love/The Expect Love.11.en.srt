1
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,960
Do you think it's like this? Yes.

2
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,080
you love the person in front of you.

3
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
You decided to hold her hand.

4
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
Coming.

5
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,000
Hengyu, I'm sorry.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm going back to take the exam.

7
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,800
[I'm going to tell her]

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,760
I love you.

9
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,360
It's useless.

10
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,160
This smell makes me dizzy.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,760
Your expression also distracts me.

12
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,840
It didn't work.

13
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,640
You...

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,320
This is not fun.

15
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
You're not giving me face.

16
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,560
My brother is in charge of important cases in the court.

17
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
I suspect he was murdered.

18
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,800
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
I really thought this would work.

20
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,960
So I want to try it.

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
Get some rest.

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
This is my own business.

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
Miss, where are we going?

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Just follow me.

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,560
No, Miss, let's go back.

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Madam doesn't allow us to come here.

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,320
We know each other well.

28
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,440
No, I...

29
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
Why do I feel a little cold

30
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,760
It's cold without sunlight.

31
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,920
Miss, I heard that

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,280
the cold palace is like this.

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,480
Look at this.

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,840
It can't be

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
suddenly appeared?

36
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,640
My Lady, Chun Ying is protecting you.

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,960
What weasel and rat?

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
are no match for Chun Hua.

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
I mean,

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,880
This was Jangdeo's house when he was alive.

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,920
Whatever.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,760
and a house for children.

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm...

44
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,120
A dead man's room.

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
Someone dropped something.

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,960
Go down

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,320
Get down

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,360
Don't make a fuss.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm a student

50
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
in the 21st century.

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
What am I afraid of?

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,200
I think

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,520
we can find something

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
we'll find something.

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
Chun Ying, what do you think?

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,080
I...

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
I dare not look.

58
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,040
There's nothing.

59
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
Let's go somewhere else

60
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,000
Ghost!

61
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,960
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,120
Squeak.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
What are you doing here?

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm here to investigate a case.

65
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,640
Let me tell you.

66
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
Based on my experience,

67
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,680
I'd rather come to the crime scene

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,000
why don't you come to the scene and see if there's anything missing?

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,760
I've checked many times.

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,840
No.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,960
Investigating cases is the same as reading books.

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,159
Every time you open it, you will have new feelings.

73
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,000
and new discovery.

74
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,480
What did you find?

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,080
I was inspired

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,000
and you interrupted me.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,760
Why didn't you call me?

78
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,640
I was afraid to bring up your sad past.

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,960
By the way,

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Can you show me

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
to me?

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,720
Here.

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,440
Yes.

84
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
Have you checked it? Yes.

85
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes.

86
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
No problem.

87
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,160
No.

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,720
But this small bottle is quite exquisite.

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
This bottle belongs to my brother.

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,600
He has asthma.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,280
It contains asthma.

92
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
Asthma pills.

93
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,000
Probably.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
Look, this asthma medicine is always with you.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
You can use it anytime.

96
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,320
through mouth and nose.

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,240
If your brother was really murdered,

98
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,200
it's most likely

99
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,360
is this.

100
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,320
I've checked it.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,640
No problem.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,760
No.

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,280
However,

104
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
do you know

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,160
can't be tested?

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
How can you be sure

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,280
How do you know it's poisonous?

108
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
Can your poison test technology

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,560
compared to me?

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,320
I didn't expect you can do scale.

111
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,880
There are many things you didn't expect.

112
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,240
By the way,

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,280
do you have the formula for asthma?

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,280
One coin of loquat leaves, two coins of yellow and yang leaves.

115
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Two coins of chestnut, one tael of thorn apple powder.

116
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,280
The first three herbs are leaves and fiber.

117
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Even if it turns into powder,

118
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
it takes time to sink.

119
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,159
But pollen is delicate.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
It sinks fast.

121
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
What are you doing?

122
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
I'll get the proportion of asthma.

123
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,800
Then we'll know who's more or less.

124
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
If I'm not mistaken,

125
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
this white powder

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
should be thorn pollen.

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
But its proportion is obviously different from the formula.

128
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
The one in this small potion

129
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,840
is obviously higher.

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
You mean

131
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
thorn apple pollen is poisonous?

132
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,280
Actually, it's meaningless

133
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,160
is meaningless.

134
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,400
How much dosage

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,960
is the key.

136
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
Try and you'll know.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,799
What are you doing?

138
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
It doesn't seem to be a problem.

139
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,880
Nonsense. I'll get you some water. Spit it out.

140
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
It's just a little bitter.

141
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
Ruofei, have some water.

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,920
Ruofei.

143
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,920
Ruofei.

144
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,200
Ruofei.

145
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,520
Alien.

146
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,600
Can you generate electricity?

147
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Why are your eyes so small?

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,160
Do you have a spaceship?

149
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,280
Can you take me on a spaceship?

150
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,080
Go.

151
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,600
Ruofei, this is Qiu Changhao.

152
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,240
No signal.

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,400
What a coincidence. I don't have any signal either.

154
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
What a coincidence. Let's take a spaceship.

155
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,320
Let's take a spaceship.

156
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,840
Take me to a spaceship.

157
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
Chun Ying, doctor.

158
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,320
Let's go.

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:32,920
Go!

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,680
Alien, where's your spaceship?

161
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,000
Be careful.

162
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,720
Flying ship

163
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,400
A spaceship?

164
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,360
Alien.

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,240
Alien, will your spaceship pick you up?

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,280
Stop it.

167
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Alien?

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,840
Alien?

169
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll get some water.

170
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
Alien, where's your spaceship?

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Alien, where are you going?

172
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,880
What are you doing?

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,960
Be careful.

174
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,960
Alien, where's your spaceship?

175
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
Where's your spaceship?

176
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,880
I'll get you some water.

177
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Are you thirsty?

178
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,560
Ruofei.

179
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,480
I fell in love with you

180
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
I fell in love with you.

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,720
Ruofei, I love you.

182
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,960
No.

183
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,040
Why did you tie me up?

184
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,240
Untie me.

185
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,280
You stayed up all night.

186
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,280
as if you were crazy.

187
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
I'm going crazy.

188
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Don't go if you love me.

189
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,360
If you say you don't love me,

190
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,640
why didn't you say you love me?

191
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,240
What are you doing?

192
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Alien, you have a signal again.

193
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,680
What alien?

194
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

195
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,400
Here.

196
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,080
Have some water.

197
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm your true love.

198
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,720
Your true love is me.

199
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
It's me.

200
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
What true man?

201
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Your clothes are wet.

202
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
You'll catch a cold.

203
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,880
Do you know, Ruofei?

204
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,800
Ruofei, calm down.

205
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,480
I don't know

206
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,520
Let me untie you, Ruofei.

207
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,720
Although you are an alien,

208
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
you came on a spaceship,

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,720
But you'll catch a cold, you know?

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,640
Let me tell you, Ruofei.

211
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,360
I'll get you something warm.

212
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
Ruofei.

213
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,000
Ruofei.

214
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,640
Ruofei.

215
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,640
Calm down.

216
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,680
Ruofei.

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,240
Qiu Changhao.

218
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,360
You must live a good life with Du Ruofei.

219
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,200
Do you hear me?

220
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,040
I won't accompany you.

221
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,320
I'll give you one last goodbye kiss.

222
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Go to sleep.

223
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,560
I think I lost my memory.

224
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,880
Why can't I remember anything?

225
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,280
Oh my god.

226
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,680
I lost my memory.

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,880
What happened yesterday?

228
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,240
Get me up first.

229
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
I can't breathe.

230
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
Bro I'm suffocating

231
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,000
I really can't breathe

232
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,480
I can't breathe.

233
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,960
Do you feel better now?

234
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,240
You stayed up all night.

235
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,520
until the doctor came.

236
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,840
The doctor is here.

237
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
Miss.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,560
Calm down.

239
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,040
Ruofei.

240
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Stop it.

241
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,240
Doctor, how is she?

242
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
Your Excellency, your wife is

243
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
she is poisoned.

244
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,520
Poisoned?

245
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,920
Yes.

246
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,560
Is his life in danger?

247
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,960
Judging from his pulse, he's not in danger for now.

248
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,240
It'll be fine when the medicine slowly subsides.

249
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
When will you wake up?

250
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,880
Well...

251
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
We'll have to wait until tomorrow morning.

252
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's go. Let's go.

253
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,680
Come on.

254
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,720
Hold this big toad for me.

255
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
I want a piece of fat.

256
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,440
Where's the fat?

257
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,240
I need to take it out.

258
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
It's here. It's here.

259
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,320
Over there! Over there!

260
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,000
Where are you?

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,960
Can you hold on until dawn?

262
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,520
I think I'm used to it.

263
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

264
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,560
Doctor, thank you for your hard work today.

265
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,120
Where is the fat?

266
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,640
Chun Ying, see the doctor out.

267
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,160
Yes.

268
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,800
What about fats?

269
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,400
Where is it?

270
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,280
It's here.

271
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,760
It's here.

272
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,200
This is so embarrassing.

273
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
Sorry, Changhao.

274
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
But now I'm sure

275
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,880
I really took that medicine

276
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,600
after taking that medicine.

277
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,320
Are you feeling better?

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,520
Yes.

279
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,800
Are you sure?

280
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm sure. I'm sure.

281
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
Untie me.

282
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,000
My back.

283
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,040
I can't take it anymore.

284
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,680
I'm thirsty.

285
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,480
I'm so thirsty.

286
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm alive.

287
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,440
So I went crazy last night.

288
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,880
No, I behaved abnormally.

289
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,359
It's because there's something wrong with the medicine.

290
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,319
There's a problem even if you don't take medicine.

291
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,520
Can we still talk?

292
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I mean,

293
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,960
your brother must have taken that medicine

294
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,599
so he had hallucinations.

295
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,280
He lit the coil himself.

296
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,720
The painting drawn by Hengyu

297
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,560
It makes sense.

298
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,040
thorn apple pollen.

299
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,400
The dosage was tampered with.

300
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,640
It was intentional.

301
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,600
Are you feeling better?

302
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,240
I still need company.

303
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:55,520
