1
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,000
Come on. Come on.

2
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,440
She just left.

3
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
You're already preparing a gift for her?

4
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,200
No.

5
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
What gift?

6
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,400
I don't know what you've prepared.

7
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,840
No.

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,040
Jin Shu is acting strange.

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,040
Something's wrong with her.

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Something's wrong with me.

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
She's too calm.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,640
For what happened three years ago,

13
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,120
I'll write it down lightly

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,920
in front of me.

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,440
But I always feel that

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
she's avoiding me.

17
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,600
You're studying her heart now.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,960
No.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
The point is that she's not in a good mood. She's not in a good mood. She's in a bad mood.

20
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,079
She's acting strange. She's acting strange. She's acting strange.

21
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,120
She's so unfamiliar.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
She's so determined. She's so stubborn.

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,240
It's weird.

24
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,079
You're more strange than her.

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
What do you mean?

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,960
Do you think she's pretty?

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Let me ask you.

28
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,160
She's pretty, I'm pretty.

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
I value my inner self more.

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,560
You'd better talk about your appearance first.

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,240
Smaller.

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,080
Look at this. Look at this.

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,800
What about her?

34
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,600
What about her?

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,920
She didn't ask me.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,600
Don't sleep on the bed tonight.

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Get down.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,640
Get down!

39
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
Hurry up. Let's go.

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,880
Let's go.

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,680
Come on. Come on.

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,560
It seems that

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,920
Your Ladyship still cares about me.

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Wait.

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,480
No no

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,720
Breakfast is not this way.

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,920
Where are we going?

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,760
Leave the city with me before she wakes up.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,880
Escape?

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,960
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

51
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,800
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm hungry.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,040
I will never admit

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,280
Jin Shu.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,000
I hate her arrogance.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,040
Unless she becomes Ruofei's mistress,

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,920
Or else, I'll kill her. I'll kill her. Okay.

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,680
I'll kill her.

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,360
I only recognize Ruofei as my sister-in-law.

60
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,040
I think

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,040
Jin Shu is up to no good.

62
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Which normal woman showed up in the middle of the night?

63
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Third Sister-in-law.

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,600
You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,520
You're jumping at home.

66
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
I also hate

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,560
she’s so arrogant.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,760
I’m not afraid of anyone.

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
I’m afraid of you.

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
What do you mean?

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Sorry, I'm used to it.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,760
No, no, no.

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
You're too far away.

74
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,640
By the way,

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,160
Jin Shu is his wife in name.

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
No matter how much we oppose it, it's useless.

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,840
Third Brother.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
As long as our family doesn't accept it,

79
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,200
it's useless even if she has a status.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,520
Besides, she's not married yet.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
before getting married.

82
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,040
It's useless. Let's go.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,600
I think

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,000
Jin Shu likes our family.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
She has a big family.

86
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,360
I want to share the share.

87
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,080
No, no.

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,320
I'm going to find Deyou.

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,080
Let him settle this.

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,840
Let's go.

91
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Brother

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,280
Brother

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,440
Brother

94
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,440
Brother.

95
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
Why are you in my brother's room?

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
I made a belt for my husband.

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,200
Come and measure his size.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
What are you doing?

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
The owner is not here.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,440
You don't treat yourself as an outsider.

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,600
I...

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,680
We have no choice.

103
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,880
Our family has a big family.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
Those weird people outside

105
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,920
want to share the share.

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,360
My father is a marquis,

107
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
No matter who he is,

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,680
is nothing to me.

109
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,520
If my father hadn't stationed at the border,

110
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,960
how could we let so many flies

111
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
in this house today?

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,480
Flies?

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,360
Who is the fly?

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,400
You are a fly.

115
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,440
Even if the three of us are flies,

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
we are still flies from a wealthy family.

117
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
And Ruofei said

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,520
don't fight for your father.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,760
A woman should be independent.

120
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,880
I’m half of the family.

121
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,120
More than half.

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,159
Living together

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,120
is not for outsiders.

124
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,040
If she's selfish,

125
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
she won't stay long.

126
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,520
At most one month.

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,960
It's more than a month.

128
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,680
Half a month at most.

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,560
I see.

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
You're a family.

131
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,480
Me?

132
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm just the legal wife that Qiu Changhao hasn't divorced.

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Don't look at me

134
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
to see me like this.

135
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Please leave.

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Here.

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,880
This is my husband's room.

138
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,600
This is Ruofei and Yuanhan's room.

139
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll wait for Ruofei here.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
I'll wait for my sister-in-law here.

141
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
I'll wait for my wife here.

142
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,159
Ruofei and Changhao are not back yet.

143
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
If you are willing,

144
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,640
just stay here.

145
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm going back to my room to rest.

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,040
Have some tea.

147
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Development this place into a scenic area.

148
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,040
It must be nice.

149
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,240
Your Ladyship is right.

150
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
What should we do now?

151
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Let's ask the villagers.

152
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,920
Let's go.

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,160
Hello.

154
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,920
Is this Hyecheon Village?

155
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,760
Who are you looking for?

157
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Have you seen

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,320
an injured foreigner?

159
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
fell off a cliff

160
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
and was saved by the old couple.

161
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
and lived here for a while.

162
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
There seems to be one.

163
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,520
How long has she been here?

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,039
About two years.

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,039
Do you know where she lives?

166
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,000
Can you show us?

167
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,360
It's right ahead.

168
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,240
Come with me.

169
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,720
Let's go.

170
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,559
6 Bamboos.

171
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,520
Thirty thousand.

172
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,120
Hurry up.

173
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,800
9 Bamboos.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
9 Circles.

175
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,280
Five Bamboos.

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,200
Two Bamboos.

177
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,600
One Bamboo.

178
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
Aren't you hungry?

179
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Don't you need to eat?

180
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
I'm not hungry at all.

181
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,800
Ruofei said taekwondo requires two points.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
First,

183
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
Look at the vibe.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Second,

185
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,240
Yes.

186
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Got it.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,080
First,

188
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,160
Momentum.

189
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,840
Second,

190
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,280
Correct.

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,000
Madam.

192
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,680
Don't kick my face.

193
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,280
Don't move.

194
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,520
Don't kick the face. Don't kick the face.

195
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,560
I'm very gentle.

196
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,520
Amazing.

197
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,040
Again.

198
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,720
Again.

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,440
One more time.

200
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,520
There's nothing wrong with this village.

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,880
Jin-joo has a place to live.

202
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,560
But something doesn't feel right.

203
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm just testing my doubt.

204
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,960
What do you suspect?

205
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,920
First,

206
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Huixin Village is remote,

207
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
but letters are not a problem.

208
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,320
Second,

209
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
She's been here for so long to repay her kindness.

210
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Aren't her parents worried?

211
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,640
Third,

212
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
She's been here for so long.

213
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,280
Why must she wait until the old couple dies?

214
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,200
We're thinking the same thing.

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,040
Something is wrong.

216
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,960
This is bad. Let's go. Let's go.

217
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
She's luring us away from the mountain.

218
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,360
She just wanted to lure us

219
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
to this village to verify

220
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,000
so that she can have more time to act.

221
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,800
Well...

222
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,240
Let's go home.

223
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
It's quiet outside.

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
I think they're asleep.

225
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,120
It's time.

226
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,800
Honey.

227
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,120
Why are you back so early today?

228
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,680
I'm free today.

229
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,480
I came back early.

230
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,480
Why are you holding this?

231
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,000
The study is quite dusty.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm going to clean it.

233
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,000
No need.

234
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
Brother and sister-in-law.

235
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,560
You...

236
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
Where did you go today?

237
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,520
We went to the Ministry of Justice to get the diary.

238
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,640
Ruofei, come with me.

239
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,160
No.

240
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,800
What did the three of you do?

241
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,600
You are so tired.

242
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,080
We miss you.

243
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,960
I just walked for half a day.

244
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,000
because I was afraid that someone would ruin the house.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,680
Watch out.

246
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,120
Sister-in-law.

247
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,240
You're back.

248
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm going back to take my medicine.

249
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
It's okay. Go ahead.

250
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,040
Come on.

251
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,160
Come on!

252
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Go!

253
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,720
Honey.

254
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,320
Let me help you.

255
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,800
No need.

256
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,400
I'll go to the study.

257
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,120
It's okay.

258
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,480
Just get used to it.

259
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,560
I was like this before.

260
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,240
Ruofei.

261
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360
Come here.

262
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,680
Honey.

263
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,640
I'll make you some tea.

264
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,040
Okay.

265
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,880
When we first came in,

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,280
she was about to enter the study.

267
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
So she's interested in what's in your study.

268
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,120
It's probably for my detective diary.

269
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,040
A detective diary?

270
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,720
If she really wants this,

271
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,680
I will prepare a new book

272
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,800
and change the last page to the Politician.

273
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
Then we'll know

274
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,680
who she works for.

275
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,600
Ruofei.

276
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,960
Help me stall her.

277
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,120
Okay.

278
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm here to deliver tea to Changhao.

279
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,960
Let me do it.

280
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
I know what Changhao likes.

281
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,440
It's too hot.

282
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Changhao doesn't like hot water.

283
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,760
It's okay.

284
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,400
I'll cool it down and give it to him later.

285
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,080
Let me do it.

286
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,800
You're a princess.

287
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,520
It's not appropriate.

288
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,960
Let me do it.

289
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,040
That's nothing.

290
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,320
He's my husband.

291
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,280
It's my duty to make tea for my husband.

292
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,680
I usually do these dirty work.

293
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,440
Let me do it.

294
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,640
I know.

295
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,360
I shouldn't have come here.

296
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,560
You all think I'm weird.

297
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,240
But what's my purpose?

298
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,400
I just want to live in peace.

299
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,360
No.

300
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,440
You really misunderstood me.

301
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,480
I didn't mean that.

302
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,440
Don't worry.

303
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
I have nothing to do with you.

304
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,200
If you insist on opposing me,

305
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,440
it's just a waste of time.

306
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
No.

307
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
Why would we be hostile to you?

308
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
You think too much.

309
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
We're sisters.

310
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
Be good.

311
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,400
Changhao.

312
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,360
Jin Shu is here to bring you tea.

313
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,760
Dear.

314
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,800
The tea is ready.

315
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,480
Okay.

316
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,240
Let me pour it for him.

317
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,880
Why are you so careless?

318
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,280
I didn't mean it.

320
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,000
Husband.

321
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't blame me.

322
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,440
She didn't mean it.

323
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,360
Okay.

324
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,520
It's not a big deal.

325
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,480
I'll go out first.

326
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
Okay, I'll go with you.

327
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,600
Guys.

328
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm sorry

329
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
I called you here during break time.

330
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
That's because...

331
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,880
Changhao and I have a plan.

332
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,040
We found that

333
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
Jin Shu came back

334
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
for another purpose.

335
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,680
So we decided to play along.

336
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,520
I need your cooperation.

337
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,880
Okay, go ahead.

338
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,400
Tonight, I'll tell my mother

339
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,160
I'll take Jin Shu as my mistress.

340
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,760
I'll approach Jin Shu

341
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,680
and see what she's up to.

342
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,960
What is her purpose?

343
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,360
I knew it.

344
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,160
I was right.

345
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,240
I think this is a good idea.

346
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,080
Look, Xiaowan.

347
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,560
I have nothing to worry about.

348
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,120
Ren.

349
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,320
You're the best.

350
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,960
Okay.

351
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,000
Stop showing off.

352
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Let's get down to business.

353
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,440
What exactly are we doing?

354
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,040
We need to set up a special operation team

355
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,920
to keep an eye on Jin Shu

356
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,000
and see what she's going to do.

357
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
We'll act tonight.

358
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,280
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

359
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,640
Okay.

360
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,880
I'm sorry for all these years.

361
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,079
You should have contacted me earlier.

362
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,000
so that I can pick you up.

363
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,280
Let bygones be bygones.

364
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's not talk about it.

365
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,040
I'll go to Huixin Village with you.

366
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,280
to hold a funeral for the old couple.

367
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,520
After all, they've taken care of you for so many years.

368
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,360
Thank you.

369
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,400
You don't have to come here again.

370
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,040
Changhao,

371
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,560
I’m going out with Changle.

372
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,000
Make yourself at home with Jin Shu.

373
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,160
I'll be back in the morning.

374
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,280
It's late.

375
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
in the middle of the night?

376
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,560
I haven’t gone out

377
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,480
with Changle.

378
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,000
Are you going out to play again?

379
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,040
No.

380
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,760
