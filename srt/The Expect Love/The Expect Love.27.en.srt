1
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,320
Cheers. Cheers.

2
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay.

3
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,160
We're almost done drinking

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,479
I should say it now.

5
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,800
You finally understand.

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,759
Brother, are you dilly-dallying?

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,479
I just want you to tell me

8
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,080
who you like.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
You still can't tell me.

10
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Then tell me

11
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,960
who you admire.

12
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,760
I admire

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,680
I admire.

14
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
Yuan Longping?

15
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,160
Qian Xuesen, Deng Erxian,

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,680
And Zhong Nanshan.

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,560
There are many

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,200
And

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,480
Is there Ningji

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,880
Ningji

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Who is Ningji

22
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,920
What did you invent?

23
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,600
Is there any contribution?

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,040
Ning often treats you to dinner.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
Ning.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,400
Bro.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,840
Bro.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,960
You told me

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm your buddy.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Which one is better

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
who is better?

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,240
Almost.

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
Almost.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
I'm your husband.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
You're not.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll tell you what a husband is.

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,840
My husband is the person I love and loves me.

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,840
You don't like me.

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
You're not.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
You're the one I like.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Shouldn't a couple love each other?

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,200
You're changing the concept.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,680
I don't care.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
No matter what,

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,720
don't meet Ningji in private.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,760
Every time I see you talking and laughing with him,

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,200
I feel very angry and sad.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Wait.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
Who is suffering?

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,760
Ningji is sad.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720
Why is he sad?

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
I said I'm sad.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,000
So am I.

54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,920
Can you understand me now?

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
My pain is...

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,079
I want to vomit.

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,280
Where am I?

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,480
At night,

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Are you here to see me?

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,400
Or do I have a mission?

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,320
I'll do anything

62
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,160
For you, I...

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes.

64
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,480
Help me kill Kang Lanting.

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,160
Why did you kill him?

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,840
No.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,440
No, no.

68
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,160
Change another one.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
You have a conscience.

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
Jiang Lanting.

71
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,920
You went out at night.

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,360
Impossible.

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,159
How is that possible?

74
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,200
No, no, no.

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,480
Changle.

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,200
What the hell is this?

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,960
I don't accept this ending.

78
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Stop.

79
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,560
It's just a dress.

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
You're confused when talking about me.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
How is it? Does it look like it?

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,280
Like a ghost?

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,720
You can't even compare to him.

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,600
I hate it when you say that.

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
Let's go to work.

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Come on.

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,720
Hurry up. I...

88
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Ruofei.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,920
Ruofei.

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,280
Wake up.

91
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,880
Are you okay?

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
I vomited just now, but I feel better.

93
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,200
By the way,

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
What did you say about Ningji?

95
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,440
Nothing.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
Let's go home.

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,920
My stomach hurts.

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,080
Be careful.

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
No matter what happens later,

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,600
don't leave me.

101
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
One step.

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,520
It's far away

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,000
Mo Chou

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,159
Protect Ruofei.

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,600
Okay.

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,480
Let's go. Let's go.

107
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's go. Let's go.

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,000
Wait for me downstairs.

109
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay.

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
Why is he...

111
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
Tell me, who sent you here?

112
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,600
He has poison in his mouth.

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,480
He also committed suicide.

114
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,440
Let's pretend nothing happened today.

115
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Everything will be the same tomorrow.

116
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,560
If anything happens,

117
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,000
meet me at the Ministry of Justice.

118
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,600
Changhao,

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Don't you think

120
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,640
you should praise me?

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
A great soldier.

122
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,600
You have a good foresight.

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,280
Let's go back first.

124
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,360
No.

125
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
Next time you hide behind me,

126
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
You're affecting my performance.

127
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
Otherwise, my kick...

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,520
Sorry, Changhao.

129
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,600
It's all my fault.

130
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
I hurt you.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,760
It's just a minor injury.

132
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
for putting you in danger with me.

134
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,160
No.

135
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
You're the Deputy Minister of Justice.

136
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,080
Blade and sword.

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,960
It's inevitable.

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:32,880
But...

139
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,640
why did they kill me?

140
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
You know too much.

141
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,440
They want to threaten me with you.

142
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,040
So,

143
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,640
Is that why you keep me company?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,360
Yes.

145
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm afraid they'll hurt you.

146
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
So he wants to protect me.

147
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,800
I thought

148
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,520
I misunderstood him.

149
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,440
But don't worry.

150
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
I won't let them hurt you.

151
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm not afraid.

152
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,040
I'll help you.

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,480
Why are you staring at me?

154
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,680
Why are you blushing?

155
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,520
Do you have a fever?

156
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,000
No.

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Maybe

158
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,440
It's too hot.

159
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,360
Are you too tired recently?

160
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,520
Do you want to rest early?

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
Well...

162
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,880
The pillow.

163
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,960
I'll take it.

164
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,240
Let me put it.

165
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,360
I'll sleep inside.

166
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,160
Okay.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,880
Did you sleep well?

168
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,800
I did.

169
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,640
But it's a bit hard for my neck.

170
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,480
Me too.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,760
Jang-ho.

172
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,960
I think I'm done.

173
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,960
Me too.

174
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,720
Lan Ting.

175
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,640
What's the urgent matter?

176
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,960
Lord Li of the Administrative Bureau

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,720
is looking for Gas all over the city.

178
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
to visit him.

179
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Why all of a sudden?

180
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,080
I asked Gars.

181
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,560
He said that every autumn and summer,

182
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,120
Lord Li's son

183
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,080
will have a strange disease.

184
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,920
My stomach hurts so much.

185
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,720
Poop blood.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
It's slightly blue.

187
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,000
You vomit after eating

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm hungry

189
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,840
Abnormal torture.

190
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,040
This Gas

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,920
was recommended by Lord Zhang to Lord Li.

192
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,120
Although it can't cure the root,

193
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,560
but it can relieve some symptoms.

194
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,840
It rained yesterday.

195
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,440
Mr. Li started looking for Gas.

196
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,160
How long has Gas been treating Mr. Li?

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,040
Five years.

198
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,680
Let's go. Let's go.

199
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,480
Let's go. Let's go.

200
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,040
But we need to make a good verbal statement.

201
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
In your residence,

202
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,960
in your mansion

203
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,800
It's not convenient to make it public.

204
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,120
Okay, I'll take him there.

205
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,280
When he comes back,

206
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,560
when he comes back.

207
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,880
I'll be right back.

208
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,520
Bye.

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,360
This is blue all over.

210
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,560
He's obviously poisoned.

211
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,360
Poisoned?

212
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Heavy metal poisoning.

213
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
But heavy metal

214
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,480
is a chemical.

215
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,840
It can't be synthesized with pure nature.

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,480
We need to test it.

217
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,040
Ruofei.

218
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,760
Didn't you say

219
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,000
the drug the assassin mentioned?

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
What ingredients do you need?

221
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,360
I suspect those men in black eat cyanide.

222
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,280
So,

223
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,440
you need alcoholic acid and sulfuric acid as a reagent.

224
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
As you can understand,

225
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,280
the wine and green alkali from the Western Region.

226
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,520
Okay, I'll send someone to buy it.

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,200
No need.

228
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
The people here don't know

229
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
look like.

230
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
I majored in biochemical.

231
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,560
I can buy it.

232
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
Wait for me here.

233
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
I'll come back and do magic for you.

234
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,560
I'll send someone to protect you.

235
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,360
No.

236
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,560
They dare not do anything in broad daylight.

237
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
You sent someone to follow me.

238
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,680
the target will be obvious.

239
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,520
Wait for me here.

240
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,840
Let's go. Okay.

241
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,440
Sure.

242
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,840
Here you go. Here you go. Thank you.

243
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,280
Your wine.

244
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,960
Thank you.

245
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,920
You're welcome.

246
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,600
Take care

247
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,120
Now we have wine.

248
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,480
Where can we get sulfuric acid?

249
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,680
Mr. Du.

250
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,240
Ning.

251
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
We meet again.

252
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,840
What a coincidence.

253
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes.

254
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
We always meet.

255
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,760
Are you buying wine?

256
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,840
Yes.

257
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,400
I just bought it

258
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm going to have some sugar water.

259
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,520
Let's go together.

260
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,520
Okay. Let's go.

261
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,160
Let's go.

262
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,880
Sit down.

263
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Come on.

264
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,880
Enjoy.

265
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,240
Thank you.

266
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,840
Thank you.

267
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,520
Du.

268
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,080
What did you say

269
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,280
to buy?

270
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,440
Sulfuric acid.

271
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
It's green alkaline oil.

272
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,440
But I haven't found it.

273
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,080
What's so difficult about it?

274
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,600
You know?

275
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,800
Everyone knows

276
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,440
knows little about it.

277
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,720
But I know there must be two places.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Where?

279
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Alchemy is used for alchemy.

280
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,200
So there must be elixirs.

281
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,160
But it's not easy to find.

282
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,360
There's another place.

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,760
is the blacksmith's shop.

284
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,480
The blacksmith will use it to wash the rust.

285
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,680
So the blacksmith must have it.

286
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,960
Good for you, Ning.

287
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,680
Okay, I'll buy it now.

288
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,160
Boss.

289
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
I'll put the money here.

290
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,320
See you next time.

291
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,200
So urgent

292
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,040
This is good. Okay.

293
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,600
Done.

294
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I've bought everything.

295
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,600
We can do experiments now.

296
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
What took you so long?

297
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm hungry.

298
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,280
I had a bowl of sugar water.

299
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,520
Let's do magic.

300
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,520
I'm looking forward to it.

301
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
Bring me a glove.

302
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,680
Mr. Li.

303
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,920
Young Master's symptoms are the same as before.

304
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,800
I can only use the old prescription

305
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,200
to let him vent quickly.

306
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Let him eat something light these days.

307
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,920
to see if it can relieve.

308
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,800
Gas.

309
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,160
For the past few months,

310
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,000
I've been paying attention to my son's food.

311
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,960
and even a sip of well water in the garden

312
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,480
in the garden.

313
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,440
The food is also cooked alone.

314
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,200
But why is it always like this

315
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,680
My lord.

316
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm not skilled enough.

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,040
I can only predict that it's a symptom of poisoning.

318
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,680
The cause is...

319
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,560
I don't understand.

320
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,160
Gas.

321
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,599
Other doctors can't understand it except you.

322
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,400
I can only rely on you.

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,119
Sir.

324
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
It will be fine after the rainy season.

325
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,240
We should be more careful.

326
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,960
Okay.

327
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,079
That's the only way.

328
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,760
Lord Li's family is full of weird things.

329
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
It's such a big yard and there are weeds.

330
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,160
It's gold and jade, but it's not.

331
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,040
So sad.

332
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
Not good.

333
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,640
Put the mask in, Jang-ho.

334
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,880
Okay.

335
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,400
Burn alkali.

336
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,000
How long will it take?

337
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,320
The teacher said

338
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:38,960
But I forgot.

339
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,200
Soon.

340
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,640
Look!

341
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,000
There's a blue spot.

342
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,520
This must be cyanide.

343
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Changhao, look.

344
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,560
It's cyanide.

345
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh my god.

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
I can even do it

347
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,040
I can do it.

348
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm really awesome.

349
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,560
Am I awesome?

350
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,320
Am I awesome?

351
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,080
Yes.

352
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm really awesome.
