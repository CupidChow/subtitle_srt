1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
It's hard and soft

2
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
There are many typical calligraphy and paintings.

3
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,200
Your children are so troublesome.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,280
Miss, at this speed,

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,880
we won't be able to have dinner.

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
Chun Ying.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
It's so hard for me.

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
Get me some big feathers.

9
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,000
Big feathers?

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,560
Big feather.

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,160
Got it.

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,079
Here.

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
So fast.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
That's easy.

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's do it!

16
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,280
Mother.

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:43,960
This...

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,760
Who copied this?

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,880
That Du Ruofei.

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Her handwriting

21
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,400
looks like a ghost.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
Did you give her the original text?

23
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,120
I did.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,840
I went there at seven today.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,120
She was still in bed at that time.

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,680
I told her

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,280
Mother taught us to get up early

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
to serve our husbands.

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,080
She doesn't care.

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,920
She said she didn't dare to open her eyes.

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,600
That's because she doesn't want to see me.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,200
Calm down.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Tell her

34
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
to copy again.

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
If she writes these words I don't understand,

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
I won't forgive her.

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,440
Okay.

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
I finally finished copying.

39
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm exhausted.

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,520
Thank you. Thank you.

41
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,040
Comfortable

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,120
Sister-in-law, you massage and massage your legs

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,320
You're quite happy

44
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,480
Of course I am.

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't stop. Go on.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,640
Mother said

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,360
you have to copy the Nv's Commandment ten more times.

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,240
Hand it in tomorrow morning.

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,400
No.

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,640
Why?

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:04,960
You're right.

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,120
You're right.

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
You're just an outsider.

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,880
It doesn't matter who I am.

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,040
Why should I copy it again?

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
I've already told you.

57
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
By the way, Mother also said

58
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,320
if you write wrongly again,

59
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,600
I'll copy it again.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,440
I...

61
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,040
Let's go.

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,079
This...

63
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,360
Are you educated?

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
That's not a typo.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
It's simple.

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
Chun Ying, what should I do?

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,560
Miss, I'll get you another chicken.

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,680
Come back.

69
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,760
Forget it. I'll copy it myself.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Consider it a practice of calligraphy.

71
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,400
Don't accompany me.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
If I didn't promise that piece of wood,

73
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
I wouldn't have copied it.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,680
Why is it so hard

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Why is it so hard to dream?

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,320
You didn't even review the biochemical exam

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm already a skillful copycat.

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Qiu Changhao is such a fool.

80
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,040
When will you confess to me?

81
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,080
Mr. Cheng.

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,520
You’re back.

83
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,160
Is Changle back?

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,280
Miss Changle hasn’t come back yet.

85
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Changle is getting worse.

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
Where’s Mrs. Cheng?

87
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,360
Mrs. Cheng is copying books.

88
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,960
Copy?

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,720
Go on with your work.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm not busy.

91
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,560
What did you copy?

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,400
Nu.

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
Looks like Mother hasn't let her go.

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,200
Changhao.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
I can't finish it.

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,240
I can't finish it.

97
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,520
Say, "I love you."

98
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,600
Why is she so obsessed with making me confess?

99
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Did she hide it too deeply

100
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,960
or

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
wrong about her?

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
Hand in the paper.

103
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,880
You're awake.

104
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,240
Morning, Changhao.

105
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,040
Oh no.

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,080
I haven't finished copying the journal.

107
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,280
This...

108
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,200
You...

109
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
You copied it?

110
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Dear.

111
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,799
Your handwriting is so beautiful.

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
I knew you love me the most.

113
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Du Ruofei!

114
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,360
Come out, Du Ruofei!

115
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,880
I'm here to get even with you, Du Ruofei.

116
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,920
It’s Changle.

117
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,680
Oh no.

118
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,920
What's wrong?

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,280
There's a misunderstanding between us.

120
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,040
I can't explain it to you now.

121
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,480
Pack up first. I'll deal with it outside.

122
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm here to get even with you.

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,960
Come out, Du Ruofei!

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,680
Come out!

125
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,440
Du.

126
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Qiu Changle.

127
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,200
Why are you yelling so early in the morning?

128
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,160
What happened to your forehead?

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,040
It's all Du Ruofei's fault.

130
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,040
She lied to me that night

131
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,880
I was in the alley at night.

132
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,120
I stayed there for three.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,680
Wait.

134
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,920
How many times

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,320
How many times have I told you

136
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
not to look for him again?

137
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Brother, look at me.

138
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,160
Let me finish.

139
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,680
I waited in that alley for three days and three nights.

140
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Changle must have

141
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
didn’t come to me

142
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,720
to ask me for punishment.

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,760
I was chased by a yellow dog last night.

144
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,240
I had to climb trees.

145
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,440
or I'll be bitten by a dog.

146
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,440
Look at my wound.

147
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,640
I was just about to say.

148
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Who is that silver bell-like voice?

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,840
It's me

150
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,600
A beautiful, kind and cute sister-in-law.

151
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,320
Why does he look like Jiang Lanting?

152
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Ruofei.

153
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,160
Why did you lie to Changle?

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
I didn’t lie to her.

155
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,560
No, that day I really saw

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
and rushed over.

157
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,000
That shadow

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,320
It's like...

159
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
Is that a subordinate at night?

160
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,000
That’s a dog.

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,840
Qiu Changle.

162
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,600
You’re a girl.

163
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
You keep calling me a courtier at night.

164
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,160
Can you behave like a noble lady?

165
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll just call him by his name.

166
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,560
I haven't said I'd marry him.

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,200
Nonsense!

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
You can't marry anyone.

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,560
Why?

170
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,240
All the girls in the city want to marry him.

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,600
Why can't I?

172
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
I'll find someone to set you up.

173
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,640
Then I'll die.

174
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,920
Can't I control you when you grow up?

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Leave me alone.

176
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,920
No, no, no.

177
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
You two, don't.

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,640
Listen to me.

179
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
Girls at her age are...

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,080
She...

181
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,480
She's here. She's here.

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,000
I know.

183
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
Girls at her age are in rebellious phase.

184
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
You have to follow her lead.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,360
How?

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,800
You need to comfort her first

187
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,720
before you talk to her.

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
What are you talking about?

189
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,680
Changle.

190
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
No, I just told your brother

191
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
he did something wrong.

192
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,960
Changle,

193
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,880
Actually, I suppose you like Night Officials.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,040
No.

195
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
What's wrong?

196
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,080
Come here.

197
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,040
Changle, listen.

198
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
I mean,

199
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,160
I've told your brother many times.

200
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,640
My sister has grown up.

201
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
It's her own business who she likes.

202
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,880
That's true.

203
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,560
Not only can I feel your feelings,

204
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,640
I can help you catch up with the subjects at night.

205
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,680
Really?

206
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,400
Let's talk inside.

207
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Okay.

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,400
It’s weird.

209
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,920
Changle.

210
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,640
Tea.

211
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,360
Have some tea.

212
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm so thirsty.

213
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
To be honest,

214
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,360
I really admire Night Official.

215
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,760
Really.

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
That feeling.

217
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
I want to see him every minute.

218
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to know

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
how he's doing.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,080
I prayed for him every moment.

221
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,920
Even a strand of his hair

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
is precious to me.

223
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
I knew it.

224
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,040
He is such a good man.

225
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,680
How could anyone not like him?

226
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,000
So, at night,

227
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,200
is our common idol.

228
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,360
Idol

229
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Yes.

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Is it the statue made of mud?

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
This one

232
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Idol

233
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,440
I want to be like him.

234
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,000
Like a hero who robs the rich and helps the poor.

235
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,560
Superman who saves the world.

236
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,720
Yes.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
At night, he is

238
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,360
who robs the rich and help the poor.

239
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
So,

240
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,280
I can't understand it now.

241
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,400
It's okay.

242
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
Give him some time.

243
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,920
Heroes always shine, right?

244
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,520
Yes.

245
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,760
We are good sisters now.

246
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Shouldn't we support each other

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Let's move forward and improve together.

248
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,480
Yes.

249
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
I sent something to the women in the city

250
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,840
to

251
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,720
to let you know what happened at night.

252
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,920
to find a friend with the same goal.

253
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
I didn't expect

254
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,680
the one who understands me the most

255
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
is you.

256
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,440
I scolded you this morning.

258
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I was wrong, sister-in-law.

259
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,520
Call me Ruofei.

260
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
Fei.

261
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,480
From now on,

262
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
we are best friends.

263
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,400
Although we are sisters,

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
there are some rules to be set.

265
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,080
First,

266
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,040
we can't be a burden to the ministers at night.

267
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,280
We can't affect the subjects at night.

268
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,160
We can't be his burden.

269
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,360
or affect others.

270
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,320
Yes, not others.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,840
Secondly, you can't give gifts.

272
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
You can't understand, right?

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,360
Think about it. If you like it, you should give it to her.

274
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,920
This is very likely

275
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,840
to kill him.

276
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,520
That's not good.

277
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
Understand?

278
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,800
Yes.

279
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,600
I'm ready.

280
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,640
From today onwards,

281
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,680
you’re the chairman of the fan club.

282
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,000
The chairman of the fan club.

283
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,400
Chairman of the fan club.

284
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
Chairman of the fan club.

285
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,560
Changle.

286
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,920
Are you ready?

287
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,960
Yes.

288
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,000
Follow me.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,040
The career of idols.

290
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,200
You must have a good body

291
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,320
and train harder

292
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,720
to pursue the career of idols.

293
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,280
Chun Ying.

294
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,800
Chun Ying.

295
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,880
Stand still.

296
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Lift it up.

297
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,000
Come on. Come on.

298
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,320
What are you doing?

299
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,560
Miss, you hurt yourself.

300
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,160
I'll feel sorry for you.

301
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,760
You won't get hurt. Raise it.

302
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,040
I...

303
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,080
I...

304
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,920
I forgot I was wearing a skirt.

305
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,760
How can I kick it?

306
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,520
What's wrong with her?

307
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,560
I don't know.

308
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,360
How about this?

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
The imperial court ordered a secret arrest.

310
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,520
It's just like this.

311
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,320
Every time,

312
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,120
they will send a minion.

313
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
Pretending.

314
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
You didn't catch him, did you?

315
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,760
I don't think they sent Crony this time.

316
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,160
The news is sealed.

317
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
If you hadn't gotten the internal information,

318
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,080
I wouldn't have known.

319
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,080
What are you talking about?

320
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,000
Who am I, Your Highness?

321
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,120
How do I look?

322
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,360
Is it pretty?

323
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
Am I trendy?

324
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
I'll make one for each of us.

325
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,800
No, no, no.

326
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,640
We are sisters.

327
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,440
Don't mention it.

328
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,840
No need.

329
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,400
No.

330
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,840
This is boring.

331
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,560
No no

332
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,040
This is really boring.

333
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,960
Don't move.

334
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,840
That's right.

335
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,560
Don't mention it.

336
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,800
Come closer.

337
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,920
The material is good.

338
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
and very convenient.

339
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,640
Look at me.

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,480
Do you think the officials

341
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,720
like the officials

342
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,560
or fear?

343
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,839
The officials like it, the corrupt officials.

344
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,839
That makes sense.

345
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
Well, at night, His Majesty...

346
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,040
Let's talk inside.

347
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,680
Let's go.

348
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,520
The walls have ears. Let’s go.

349
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,319
Changle, am I awesome?
