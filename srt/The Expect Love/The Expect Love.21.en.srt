1
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,080
You need to learn to do it

2
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,800
Master taught Monkey Sun meditation

3
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,840
But Monkey Sun said

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,960
he didn't learn it

5
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,039
So Master took out the ruler

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,680
He hit his head three times.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,240
and left through the back door.

8
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,280
[It's like this.]

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Do you remember

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,680
What happened?

11
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Look at this. Look at this.

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Sun Monkey.

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,200
Come to master's room at midnight

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Tell me how to do it

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Great!

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,880
Here's your reward.

17
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,360
What monkey and rat?

18
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
You can only tell useless stories.

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Look at you. You're so beautiful.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
Don't worry, madam.

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,520
Didn't she say she'll make a vote?

22
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,720
You and I have three votes.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,280
No matter how capable Du Ruofei is,

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,079
only my brother supports her.

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Ruofei.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Come with me. I have something to tell you.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,400
Let's go.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,880
What?

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,240
I'll leave Hengyu to you.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:40,960
Hurry up.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Wait, Changle.

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,400
Be careful. What’s wrong?

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,440
Hurry up.

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay, go ahead.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
So mysterious.

36
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,840
So what?

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
How do you know it's a night minister?

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,079
Do you have anything else

39
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,600
do you have anything else to do?

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
Not this time.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
This time, it’s Kang Lanting.

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,440
I think something is wrong with him.

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh my god.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,040
Did Qiu Changle know the secret of Jiang Lanting?

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
What do you think

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
What's wrong with Jiang Lanting?

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
He called me "Swordsman at Night".

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,680
This is the title given by His Majesty at night.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,600
And that day when I went down at night,

50
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,000
he reacted exactly like Kang Lanting.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
You scared me.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,240
Wait a minute.

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,800
You kissed me at night.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,200
Why don't you listen to other things?

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,560
Just listen to this.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
I mean

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,079
I look more and more like Jiang Lanting at night.

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,079
How did you kiss me at night?

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,200
You even asked?

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,960
Say it.

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
Then tell me

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Why do you think

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Jiang Lanting looks like a night minister?

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,000
I stepped on Gae Ttong and ran into his arms.

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,440
He hugged me.

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Hugging you?

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,000
How do you feel?

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,520
It feels quite relaxed.

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,840
It's over.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It’s complicated.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Changle, let me ask you.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,080
Do you think Jiang Lanting

73
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,200
we are like sisters?

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,520
No, he always bullies me.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,279
Think about it.

76
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,880
When Jiang Lanting is here,

77
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,519
is it like having a sister?

78
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,360
No.

79
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,360
No, he always argue with me.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
Think about it.

81
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,280
When Jiang Lanting was here,

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,480
do I look like a sister?

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,440
Do whatever you want.

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
But I'm used to tormenting him.

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,320
I think

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,640
you fell in love with Jiang Lanting.

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,200
How is that possible?

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,480
I hate him so much.

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
I can hear his footsteps

90
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
I can hear his footsteps.

91
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,880
He’s like a fly.

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Listen, Changle.

93
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,120
your relaxing state

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,320
is actually a sense of security.

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,280
A sense of security.

96
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,240
is your subconscious.

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,000
You trust him, rely on him,

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
and even like him.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,360
No.

100
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,320
But you shouldn't like him.

101
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
Why shouldn't I like him?

102
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,800
No.

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,680
Why would I like him?

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,200
How could I like him?

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm a heroine at night.

106
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,240
I work at night.

107
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Yes.

108
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
That's why you should like Night Official.

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,360
Yes.

110
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Jiang Lanting is good. He is good.

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
He is...

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,040
He...

113
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,040
Do you understand?

114
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,560
No.

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,200
Anyway, you two are not suitable. It's impossible.

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
Think about it.

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm going to see Hengyu.

118
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Le.

119
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
I bought you

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,280
the most popular cosmetics.

121
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
I don't like these.

122
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,640
What about my latest novel?

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,240
What?

124
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,400
The three things between me and His Majesty at night.

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
The love history of my subjects at night.

126
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,640
What did I do every night?

127
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
That night, I became a subordinate.

128
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
What is all this?

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm going to find out the writers.

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,240
Unfortunately,

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,760
I know who wrote it.

132
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,840
It took my boss a lot of effort.

133
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Third Sister-in-law.

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,600
Just give it to me. I'll get even with them.

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,159
I can give it to you, but I want to know

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,960
who do you think

137
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,480
is more suitable to raise Heng Yu?

138
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
I can't choose you anyway.

139
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,640
Well,

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
You don't have to choose me.

141
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,760
Just don't say anything.

142
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
Don't you want to know

143
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,240
who is thinking about me?

144
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,000
My Lady, are you really going to make such a fuss?

145
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
Of course.

146
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,320
It concerns Hengyu's custody.

147
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
I'm sure I'll win.

148
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,200
This family feast is a celebration in advance.

149
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,120
By the way, Jiaoxing,

150
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
you dug out the old wine

151
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,280
when I got married.

152
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:43,800
Okay.

153
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,560
Miss, you must win.

154
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,000
Where are you going in such a hurry?

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
Why didn’t you tell me she’s so good?

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,120
I heard that your grandpa is a chef.

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

158
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,520
Okay.

159
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,280
Okay. Okay.

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay. Okay. Okay.

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,240
Are you sure? Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
Can you do it?

164
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
Why not?

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,080
The kitchen knife, right?

166
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,400
The tablet, right?

167
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,720
Cut it.

168
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,600
Which one should I cut first?

169
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,400
Did you cut it?

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,120
Forget it.

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
This sauce is so authentic.

172
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,160
Miss, is this ancestral?

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,640
The late emperor liked it.

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:28,920
Serve the dishes. Okay.

175
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Here you go.

176
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,200
It's here.

177
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
Sister-in-law, you haven't finished yet?

178
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
I won't wait for you

179
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,000
Jiaoxing

180
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
Get ready to serve

181
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,520
Come on.

182
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,680
Miss,

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,120
Should I go to Guihe Restaurant to buy some vegetables?

184
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
steamed buns, noodles, ribs, steamed buns,

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,280
They are all from Guanzhong County.

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
They are all refugees.

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720
Even the crazy woman's baby

188
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,520
were abducted and sold by the refugees.

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,200
But it has been years.

190
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,520
Liang Mansion's disaster relief case has been sentenced.

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,000
All the officials have been beheaded.

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Why are there still survivors?

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,520
There's only one possibility.

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
The money from Liang Mansion's disaster relief

195
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,760
was not confiscated.

196
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,440
That's why the disaster hasn't been saved.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,640
You're right.

198
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,640
There must be something wrong with Liang Mansion's case.

199
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,480
But the Liang Mansion case

200
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,600
was done by

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,160
at the Censorate.

202
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
My brother closed the case many years ago.

203
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,560
The Supreme Court and the Ministry of Punishments

204
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,320
All the files were taken back immediately.

205
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
He died a few years later.

206
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
and something happened to my brother.

207
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,560
In that case,

208
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,680
Changxian's death

209
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,480
has something to do with Liang Mansion case.

210
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,480
I just don't know

211
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
what he did.

212
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
My brother is reverse the case.

213
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,400
Lan Ting.

214
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Did His Majesty receive any news from the Censorate?

215
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,680
No.

216
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,840
There is no one

217
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,160
in the court

218
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,080
about Lord Zhang's assassination.

219
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
as if they already knew

220
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Lord Zhang is dead.

221
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,440
Something is wrong with the Censorate.

222
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
We must lure the snake out of the hole.

223
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,960
Report in three days.

224
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
Within three days

225
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,880
The royal agent is in a hurry.

226
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,360
It's time.

227
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm going to give this gift

228
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,200
to Tony.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,080
With the hand of Tony,

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,640
to bring down the mountain behind this.

231
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
With the power of Qiu Changhao,

232
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,720
to set up a barrier to investigate the people who have been in the past.

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
Compared to those who point deer as horse,

234
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
he's much weaker.

235
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,560
Do you really expect him to dig a hole?

236
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,160
Madam, you don't know

237
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,480
Mr. Qiu Changhao was able to detain Mr. Zhang in the Ministry of Punishments.

238
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,640
and no news came out.

239
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,880
It means someone is helping him.

240
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,400
Within a day, he can transfer

241
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review

242
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
to search the streets.

243
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,520
This is not the first time.

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
Two secret letters from the Censorate are urging me

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,920
but the Imperial Administration's authority is not allowed.

246
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,360
This shows that

247
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,160
someone is very afraid of testing Qiu Changhao.

248
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,360
and to protect myself.

249
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,560
That's why I can't go against it. I can't go against it.

250
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,440
But maybe

251
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,960
Qiu Changhao really found the cause.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Well,

253
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

254
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,840
Tell the royal agent that they are safe.

255
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
Tell them to hurry up.

256
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
The one who moves

257
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,640
will show his shadow.

258
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,320
A letter from the Censorate.

259
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,560
I will also

260
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,360
as well.

261
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,840
This is the list of dismissed personnel in Lord Zhang's mansion.

262
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,360
Make a copy.

263
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,240
and submit it to the Censorate.

264
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,680
and send one to the Ministry of Justice as well.

265
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
in case they need it.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
Let's do it.

267
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,560
Yes, Lord Ning.

268
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,680
Wait.

269
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,960
I have a statement for the pork ribs.

270
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,640
Give it to Qiu Changhao too.

271
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,360
Go.

272
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,400
Okay.

273
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,600
I’ve set up the stage.

274
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,840
Tony.

275
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,840
Next, it’s up to you.

276
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,040
Today

277
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,120
is our family feast.

278
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,360
First, to celebrate Yu'er's safe return.

279
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,080
Second, thank you, ancestors.

280
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
Let's start now.

281
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,480
Let the storm come more fiercely.

282
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

283
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
I'll teach you a lesson later.

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
Ruofei, come on.

285
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Can we eat?

286
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,800
You can try my

287
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,960
My new dish.

288
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,120
I haven't cooked for a long time. My hands are a little rusty.

289
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,800
Kitchen

290
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,120
Okay. Okay.

291
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,880
The first dish is palace cabbage.

292
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,880
The second dish is spicy chicken.

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,680
The third dish is special sauce beef.

294
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
And the last dish.

295
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,800
Winter bamboo shoots and duck soup.

296
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,480
Mother, let me get you a bowl.

297
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,400
I haven't eaten Wan'er's cooking for two years.

298
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,720
Go away.

299
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
Try it, Mother. Try it, Mother. It's okay.

300
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,040
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.

301
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,800
Here you are. Here you are. Here you are.

302
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,400
[It's the first time I've seen it.] [It's the first time I've seen it.] [It's the first time I've seen it.] [It's the first time I've seen it.]

303
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,040
If Hengyu follows me,

304
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
it will be different.

305
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,520
Mother,

306
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,160
It's made of

307
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,080
Yes.

308
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,360
Let me show you.

309
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,400
This

310
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,520
is the first dish I made called vegetable wrap.

311
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,200
wrapping potato eggs and rice with vegetables

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,680
It's the first time I've wrapped it well

313
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,600
Please forgive me.

314
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,920
Lettuce leaves

315
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,440
It makes me lose my appetite

316
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,360
No appetite at all

317
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,000
This is called sashimi.

318
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,960
with my special sauce.

319
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,440
It's amazing

320
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,720
It's raw Can you eat it

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,680
It's not edible at all

322
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
Maybe we can eat it.

323
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,360
The third dish is vegetable and fruit salad.

324
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,680
and my special salad sauce.

325
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,080
It's used in many parties.

326
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,720
It can be called a greasy tool.

327
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,640
Sister-in-law, is this for the rabbit?

328
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,960
Rabbits eat better than this

329
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,680
Wait a minute.

330
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,440
I've put up with you for a long time.

331
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,360
Only you have a mouth, right?

332
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,320
You keep talking.

333
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,680
Did I just say you

334
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,280
Your preparation is cold.

335
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,000
What if so many of us

336
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,760
eat something bad?

337
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,920
Yes, mine can eat something bad.

338
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,840
Yours won't go bad, right?

339
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,520
Of course.

340
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,120
My grandpa is a chef

341
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,080
Your grandpa is a chef

342
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,040
It's none of your business.

343
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,880
All right.

344
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,600
What are you doing?

345
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm still here.

346
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
Mother, don't be angry.

347
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Let me try it first.

348
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,200
It's a baby

349
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,120
How is it?

350
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,160
It's delicious. It's delicious. It's delicious. It's delicious. It's delicious. It's delicious. It's delicious. It's delicious.

351
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,440
It's delicious.

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,920
Try it

353
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,400
It's really delicious

354
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,320
It's really good. It's really good. It's really good.

355
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,400
Mother, let's eat. Let's eat.

356
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,640
Try it.

357
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,760
Is it good?

358
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,720
Delicious.

359
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,320
Yu Cosmos.
