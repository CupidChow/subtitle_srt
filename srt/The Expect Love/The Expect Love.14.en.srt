1
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,759
You can't go empty-handed.

3
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,400
Take the pollen with you.

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
Put it into his dish when he's not careful.

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Then he will be confused.

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,440
He says whatever you ask.

7
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,479
I'm so talented.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,520
Put it on. Put it on. Put it on.

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,680
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

10
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,880
Your Highness. Your Highness.

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,919
Don't pretend to be drunk.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Here, another toast.

13
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,720
Look at the stars.

14
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
There are so many stars.

15
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,520
Have you seen the stars?

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,600
Have you seen it? Yes.

17
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,560
It's here. It's here.

18
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,640
There are so many stars.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,960
Do you see it?

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,160
Zhang Zhi Ze.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
Ma'am, you died two years ago.

22
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,800
two years ago?

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Ma'am.

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,120
I found a doctor from Xiliang

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,480
a lot of thorn apples and pollen.

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,160
And then?

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,400
And then...

28
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Lots of thorn pollen.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,320
More than

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,480
More than these stars

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
More than these stars.

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,320
He inhaled it.

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,920
He's hallucinating.

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,240
He set himself on fire.

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,960
He... He burned himself to death.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,840
Why did you do this to him?

37
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,040
He was investigating a case.

38
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,240
I wanted to ask something.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
But I didn't expect

40
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,640
he had inhaled so much pollen.

41
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,440
His mouth is still tight.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,040
I didn't get anything from him.

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,920
Luckily, he burned himself

44
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,840
burned himself to death.

45
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Or he might find out.

46
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,120
X.

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,920
What case?

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
Is this case related to you?

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,960
Ma'am, don't come over.

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,600
I didn't kill you.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,880
You set yourself on fire.

52
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,320
I didn't kill you.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,360
It's none of my business.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,279
I don't want you to die either.

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't look for me!

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,520
My lord! My lord!

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,120
My lord!

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,080
Your Excellency.

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,080
What's wrong with you?

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Have you seen many stars?

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,520
He treated you as your brother.

62
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,240
Your lord is related to an official's death.

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
I want to take him back to the Ministry of Justice.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,520
My lord is the Chief Justice.

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,040
You can't take him away.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
I will inform the Supreme Court.

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Unless it's the Minister of Justice.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,440
personally brought His Majesty's verbal instruction.

69
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,840
Otherwise, no one can do it.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,080
My lord.

71
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,640
Your lord is drunk.

72
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,440
I'll accompany him to sober up.

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,320
OK?

74
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Qiu Changhao,

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,640
I order you

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
take Lord Zhang back to the Ministry of Justice to sober up.

77
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
Help me catch the stars.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,120
Official Zhang, let's go.

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,400
Is there a star?

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
Zhang's servant said

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,080
before he was arrested,

82
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
before he was arrested.

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
I think he also mentioned the matter about the bonus presentation.

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,320
It has nothing to do with us.

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,040
Why are you panicking?

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
I heard that Qiu Changhao

87
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
is good at interrogating.

88
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,240
If Lord Zhang falls into his hands,

89
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm afraid he won't last long.

90
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,840
What if Qiu Changhao

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
and find out about the Liang Mansion case?

92
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,040
Then, let's do it.

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,040
How about...

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Lord Wang, in your opinion,

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,000
Qiu Changhao,

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,160
How dare you detain an imperial official without permission?

97
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
How dare you put me in jail!

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm going out.

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
I want to see His Majesty.

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
I want to sue you!

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,960
I'll kill your whole family.

102
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Indeed, with my position,

103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
I have no right to interrogate you.

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,920
As long as you know.

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
I know there are

106
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,680
in this case.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,200
I know you are waiting for someone behind to save you.

108
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
But Mr. Zhang,

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,600
have you ever thought about

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,840
who really cares about

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,040
who really cares about your life?

112
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,320
This case

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,520
will be handed over to other departments

114
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,080
to deal with it.

115
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,400
By then,

116
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,200
I can't control it.

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,040
So, Lord Zhang,

118
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,960
you are the safest

119
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
in my hands.

120
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Think about it.

121
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
What did you think of?

122
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,840
I need someone to tell me.

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
Let me out!

124
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,320
Let me out!

125
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,200
Let me out!

126
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Qiu Changhao, I won't forgive you!

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
Under the heavens' order, the emperor decrees

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,400
due to Zhang Zhi Ze, Minister of the Supreme Court,

129
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,920
My Lord.

130
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,560
The former Investigating Censor has been sentenced to death.

131
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,400
is now dismissed and investigated.

132
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Wu Bo’an, Minister of the Supreme Court,

133
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,240
Prime Minister Ning Ji of the Court of Judicial Review will be promoted to vice minister.

134
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Respect this.

135
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,240
Qiu Changhao, I'm here.

136
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,400
The court

137
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,880
as the minister of the Supreme Court.

138
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
Congratulations, Jilang.

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
You’re one step closer to your goal.

140
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,400
All these years,

141
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,520
all these years.

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,520
Come out with me.

143
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
Your father was seriously ill.

144
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,880
and caused you to be blamed for being unfilial.

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,480
Jilang.

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,920
I was willing

147
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
to follow you.

148
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,159
Stop talking about that.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
The snow fungus soup I made.

150
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,480
Try it.

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,520
Hurry.

153
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,160
Get in.

154
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,160
What do you want?

155
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,680
Assassin!

156
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
Guards!

157
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Assassin!

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,160
Help! Help!

159
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
Assassin!

160
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,160
I want to see Qiu Changhao.

161
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
It’s a big deal,

162
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
but you can't stay up all night.

163
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,440
Your body will collapse.

164
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
The expert said

165
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
And the liver detoxification

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,920
has to be done under sleep.

167
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,360
If you keep staying up late,

168
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
if you stay up late like this.

169
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,360
Who is the expert?

170
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,680
Staying up late is bad for your liver.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
So I made you a milk product.

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,280
It can relieve your nerves.

173
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,200
Try it.

174
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,320
Here you go.

175
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
Open your mouth.

176
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,280
Hurry up.

177
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,360
Hurry up. I can't hold it.

178
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,920
Open your mouth.

179
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
How is it? Is it sweet?

180
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,000
One more bite.

181
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,040
Try it.

182
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,040
Thank you, Madam.

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,600
How is it?

184
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,280
It's delicious.

185
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,440
Madam.

186
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,320
If Qiu Changhao can defeat Lord Zhang,

187
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,760
I think he must be able to get in the dark.

188
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,000
So as long as I keep an eye on Qiu Changhao,

189
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,480
I can definitely take advantage of this.

190
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,240
Jilang, this matter involves too much.

191
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
You must be careful.

192
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,120
Don't worry.

193
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
Everything is in my plan.

194
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,840
Take revenge.

195
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
You...

196
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,720
I will give you a status.

197
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,200
I owe you too much.

198
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,160
Jiro.

199
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't care about this title anymore.

200
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,840
I just want to stay away from troubles

201
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,440
we can stay away from troubles

202
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,000
to the end of the world

203
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,440
and live a normal life.

204
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,080
OK?

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,400
OK. OK.

206
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,800
Okay. Okay.

207
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,640
Time to eat.

208
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,960
Deliver the food

209
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Food delivery?

210
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,640
Have you informed Mr. Xun?

211
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,200
As long as you can let me out,

212
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
I'll say anything.

213
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,120
Lord Wei has informed us.

214
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,600
Please calm down.

215
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,000
Eat first.

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
I think he'll be here soon.

217
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,040
Take it.

218
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,160
Thank you, Zhang.

219
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,080
I'll reward you when I go out.

220
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,720
By the way,

221
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,560
Did Lord Zhang say anything? No.

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,880
No.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
I think

224
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
he's definitely a scapegoat.

225
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,040
He won't say anything

226
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,160
he won't say anything.

227
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,120
It's usually like this.

228
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,280
I think

229
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,080
your brain is getting better.

230
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
What do you mean?

231
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
My brain is always good, okay?

232
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,080
More, Young Master.

233
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
Wei Songquan sent a report

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,920
that something happened in the Ministry of Punishments. He has something to tell you.

235
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,760
Excuse me.

236
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,280
Matsuzumi.

237
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,120
My Lord.

238
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,400
What can I do for you?

239
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Something happened to Lord Zhang.

240
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,360
Let's go.

241
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,640
Please.

242
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,040
My lord.

243
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,520
It's done.

244
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,280
You may leave.

245
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,320
Yes, my lord.

246
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
Who sent him food?

247
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,200
Bring him here.

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,520
My Lord.

249
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,160
My apologies.

250
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,080
The delivery guy ran away.

251
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll get him back.

252
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,280
It's too late.

253
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,000
Judging from his death,

254
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,360
he was poisoned.

255
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,360
They're trying to silence us.

256
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,800
Did you see what happened?

257
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,920
I saw it.

258
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,000
He said the food was cold.

259
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,280
He drank a few times and no one agreed.

260
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
Then I poured it over there.

261
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,200
Ask him for it. He didn't give it to me.

262
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,960
He even avoided it.

263
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,240
You're lucky.

264
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,320
Or else, you're the one who died here.

265
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
What did he say before he died?

266
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,320
He just had a bite of steamed buns.

267
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,040
and kept shouting

268
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Cool

269
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,640
Over there.

270
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,400
Warden.

271
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,080
Why are the food here so bad?

272
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,600
Prison food is not delicious.

273
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,840
But at least it's warm.

274
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,160
Then why did you keep saying it was cold before your death?

275
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,160
Your Excellency, please understand.

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,600
This one. This one.

277
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,360
I don't know

278
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,680
My lord.

279
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,920
What does cold food have to do with poisoning?

280
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
He doesn't mean the food is cold.

281
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,280
He meant a person.

282
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,520
Who?

283
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,560
Lord Liang.

284
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Lord Zhang is dead.

285
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes.

286
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,680
He died in the prison of the Ministry of Justice.

287
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
It has something to do with me.

288
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
Will the Ministry of Justice blame you?

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,080
I don't care anymore.

290
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,200
Did he say anything before he died?

291
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,160
He mentioned someone.

292
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,160
Who is it?

293
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,000
It's the first case

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
as a royal inspector.

295
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,440
I found Lord Liang, the current royal agent.

296
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,600
embezzled the relief money.

297
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,920
Their whole family was executed.

298
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,240
Is there any problem?

299
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm not sure.

300
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,040
All the clues are gone.

301
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,760
We can only wait and see.

302
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,280
Be quiet.

303
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,880
We're just investigating.

304
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't be afraid.

305
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,360
Just cooperate with us.

306
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,440
Who are you?

307
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,880
What are you doing?

308
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,480
Anything?

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm just a cook.

310
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,720
I need to pee.

311
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,000
I want to go to the toilet.

312
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,120
Don't play tricks.

313
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,360
My lord.

314
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,040
Sir, this man is suspicious.

315
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,840
This is a secret letter found from him.

316
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,720
What's your name?

317
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
My name is Du Ribs.

318
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,120
Du ribs.

319
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,680
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

320
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,560
Yes.

321
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,319
You are Du Ribs? Yes.

322
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,520
I am.

323
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,720
Do you know the regular noodles, steamed buns and others?

324
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
They are my friends.

325
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,240
They have a bad relationship.

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,960
You're so strong.

327
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,359
Why is your name Du Ribs?

328
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,119
Because I like ribs.

329
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,040
What's wrong

330
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,079
Except this booklet,

331
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,640
the records that Lord Zhang doesn't like washing his feet,

332
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
what else do you know?

333
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,640
I don't know

334
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
is so busy every day.

335
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,800
He's not buying us dinner today.

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,240
He's treating us to dinner.

337
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,840
I've been busy since morning.

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,320
I only cook for him.

339
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,560
What else can I do?

340
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,720
What else can I do?

341
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,600
Every day,

342
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,400
I'm so tired.

343
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,880
Why did you run away?

344
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,760
I wanted to quit long ago.

345
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
It's so tiring.

346
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,360
You want me to cooperate with the interrogation?

347
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,200
Can I cooperate with the interrogation?

348
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,160
With my identity,

349
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,920
if I cooperate with the interrogation.

350
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Who are they?

351
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Take him away.

352
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,000
Take him down.

353
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,080
So

354
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
Du Ruofei is not a spy.

355
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,200
It seems I wronged her.
