1
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
That's right. He's a good man. He's a good man. He's a good man. He's a good man.

2
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,680
Why is His Majesty here at night?

3
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,800
Let's go inside and talk.

4
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,440
Let's go.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,280
The walls have ears. Let’s go.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,039
Changle, am I awesome?

7
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,000
Are you good?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,640
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,920
Changhao,

10
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,360
You don't trust me at all.

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,560
She's my sister-in-law.

12
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,759
How could I look at her?

13
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,720
So there's no need for you to block me.

14
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,840
It's not necessary at all.

15
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,720
What are you looking at?

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,360
What are you looking at?

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,560
Look at me. Look at me.

18
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,280
What are you looking at?

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,440
It's inappropriate to dress like this.

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Look

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm teaching them taekwondo

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,560
Go inside

23
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,200
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,079
Come on. Let's go.

25
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,240
Do you think it's appropriate?

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Jiang Lanting.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,440
Go inside.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,240
You're no ordinary person.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,920
That's...

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,560
Jiang Lanting.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,079
Ruofei, come to my room.

32
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,520
Yes.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm not going.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,920
I haven't finished yet.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,720
Come on, let's go.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,040
Miss, let's go.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,520
It's not easy for me

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,320
What are you doing?

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,880
Let's go.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,120
We have to keep practicing.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
This is my brother's daily record.

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,320
Where did you get it?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
Mr. Zhu's house.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Mr. Joo.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
The former owner of that house...

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
is the late Lord Sima.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
You're well-informed.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
My brother passed away three years ago.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
The government said it was an accident.

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,160
I had been doubtful.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,000
This record proved one thing.

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
My brother didn't die by accident.

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,280
Should we take action?

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,200
Don't alert them.

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Since they can kill Lord Zheng,

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
they won't let us

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,280
find out anything.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,720
Lord Zheng was killed just now.

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
The imperial court ordered

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,480
to arrest me secretly.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,120
What are you going to do next?

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

63
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,079
We have to find a way

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
the imperial court sent to spy on me.

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Come, Changle.

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,520
I’m going to teach you how to write the doubles.

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
I hate writing.

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,440
I won't write it.

69
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800


70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,720
Think about it.

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,680
At night, I was a hero and helped the poor.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
But people always say he's not a hero but a thief.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,959
That's because they don't know him.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
Right.

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,839
That's why we should write

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,880
a novel that is protagonized by Yamato.

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,840
Novels?

78
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,240
so that more people in Fengcheng

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,520
know how good he is.

80
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Am I right?

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,440
Smart.

82
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
Of course.

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,000
By the way, is there any way

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,760
to attract my attention?

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,920
Write a letter?

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,120
How can you be sure he received it?

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Are you done?

88
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,760
put it next to his invitation.

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,040
No, no.

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,800
People will see it.

91
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't you know to put it in the envelope?

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
Why didn't I think of that?

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
You're smart.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
You write the first one.

95
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,080
At night, I've robbed the rich and helped the poor.

96
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,000
Over there.

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,320
Ruofei.

98
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,760
Do you think His Majesty will reply?

99
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,600
Keep writing if he doesn't reply.

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
If he can't forget it, there will be a response.

101
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,160
Should we wait for him?

102
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you stupid?

103
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,680
How can he come here if we're here?

104
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,840
That's right.

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,200
Let's go.

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Let's go.

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,480
You're here. You're here.

108
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Your Majesty, you're here.

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,320
If I didn't come, you would have waited for nothing.

110
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,760
Your Majesty, you'd better plead guilty.

111
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,960
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
Watch out for the peel.

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,640
Come on.

114
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,960
Come on!

115
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,280
Backling dart!

116
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,280
You are indeed from the Supreme Court.

117
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,040
Silly girl.

118
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,720
The cloak is wrong.

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
It didn't go well.

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,240
This invitation is a bluff.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,720
The real purpose is to investigate my identity.

122
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,200
Could it be that you noticed the plan of the higher-ups?

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,680
I didn't tell anyone about this plan.

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I wouldn't know it at night.

125
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,280
Unless...

126
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,520
I'm familiar with the court at night.

127
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,760
It's quite tidy.

128
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,039
But the decoration style

129
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,760
It looks like an old cadre's office.

130
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,159
What are these?

131
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,840
So many.

132
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,720
This is all the case records.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,320
Oh no.

134
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120
Should I not come in?

135
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,600
Forget it.

136
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,640
This...

137
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,960
She's looking for something.

138
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,640
Look.

139
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,000
It must be valuable now

140
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,160
Unfortunately, she doesn't have a phone.

141
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Why is she interested in your jade pendant?

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Otherwise, she would post it on Moments.

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
How do I blow this?

144
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,560
What are you doing?

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Can't you be more careful?

146
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,080
I...

147
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,280
No, no.

148
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,440
It's your fault for walking in silence.

149
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,480
Why are you blaming me?

150
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,600
Interesting.

151
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,840
Is there a problem with this jade pendant?

152
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,640
No problem.

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,400
You like it?

154
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,000
It says in the book that the dead brother of Qiu Changhao

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,560
He's a good musician.

156
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
Is it his?

157
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
Is this from your brother?

158
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,840
How do you know?

159
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,680
I told you

160
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,600
It's written in the book.

161
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,320
You forgot?

162
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,720
What else do you know?

163
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,440
According to the book,

164
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,440
your brother was brave and cautious.

165
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
but died in a fire.

166
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,040
An accident?

167
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,520
Yes.

168
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,800
How did she know these details?

169
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,080
Of course it was an accident.

170
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,760
This is the writer's trap.

171
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,200
It's Tony's problem.

172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,200
So,

173
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
We have to investigate.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,560
I guess I was right.

175
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,600
We have to play along.

176
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,400
But I haven't seen the ending yet.

177
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,080
I don't remember the death of the Chief.

178
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's investigate together.

179
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay, let's investigate together.

180
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
Keep a low profile in investigating my brother.

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
Don't let anyone know.

182
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,400
Yes.

183
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
There must be a big conspiracy.

184
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
Where should we start?

185
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,440
I remember his son stopped talking

186
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,080
his son stopped talking.

187
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,800
Hengyu.

188
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,560
Hengyu.

189
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,280
Hengyu.

190
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,160
Do you remember me?

191
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,560
Can I play with you?

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,760
You shot so accurately.

193
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,880
You're always so close.

194
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,040
Hengyu, you really don't remember me?

195
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,880
At the ancestral hall,

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,320
you let me go.

197
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,920
Are you hungry?

198
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,120
There are many delicious food in my room.

199
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Like rose cake, osmanthus pastry

200
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Little ice cream.

201
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
There are so many left.

202
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,680
Can you stop playing?

203
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm talking to you.

204
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,560
This...

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,040
What a kid.

206
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm talking to you.

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,160
Stop playing. I'm talking to you.

208
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,680
Don't cry.

209
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,840
Let me untie this for you, okay?

210
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,240
Let me untie it for you.

211
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,120
Don't cry.

212
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,280
Don't cry.

213
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,720
Don't cry. I'll really untie it for you.

214
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,640
I...

215
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,720
Look.

216
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
You just want them to untie, right?

217
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,600
I untied it for you.

218
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,160
Since

219
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,040
I untied you,

220
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,160
can we

221
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,360
be good friends?

222
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,200
If we're good friends,

223
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,480
I'll take you to play something more fun.

224
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
Do you want to go?

225
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,640
It's more fun than this.

226
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Shall we go?

227
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,840
What are these

228
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,320
these bottles and bottles?

229
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,240
Let's go.

230
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,400
Why are you here?

231
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,400
I came back to get something.

232
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,360
Hengyu.

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
Hengyu is willing to play with you.

234
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Of course.

235
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
We are brothers.

236
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
You're his second wife.

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
It's the same. Let's go.

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
Let me show you something fun.

239
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Look.

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,160
This can't make your eyes

241
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
that can make your eyes beautiful.

242
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,320
How can this make your face white?

243
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,200
And this.

244
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,200
You...

245
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
You touched my stuff.

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
What are those?

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,640
According to you,

248
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,560
it should be called cosmetics.

249
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Why did you buy so many?

250
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,720
What do you mean by that?

251
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,320
These, these, and these

252
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,720
I made them myself.

253
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,880
I majored in biochemical.

254
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
It's a piece of cake to make these.

255
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,160
Leave me alone.

256
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,280
Go to work.

257
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,360
I'll go now.

258
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,240
Go ahead.

259
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,960
Hengyu.

260
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,520
Let me teach you how to do it.

261
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,280
First, look at the soybeans.

262
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,440
The soybeans can be crushed into powder.

263
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,120
Then

264
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
Throw it into the flour

265
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,800
stir and stir

266
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,680
It's a mask

267
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,280
And this.

268
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,160
Stop.

269
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,600
Everyone put an egg into this bowl.

270
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,600
Next,

271
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,280
is to make the skin whitening

272
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,680
with vinegar.

273
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,640
You still want to do it?

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,320
It's harder than pancakes

275
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
It's okay

276
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,080
Consider it disinfecting the table cloth

277
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,120
It's okay

278
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,040
Yes.

279
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,600
It's vinegar.

280
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,640
What?

281
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,160
I need to go to Changhao.

282
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,720
Miss, go now.

283
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
Me too.

284
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,800
What are you going to do?

285
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,040
I'll go.

286
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,360
Okay.

287
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,840
I'll send my regards to Songquan.

288
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,200
Hengyu, take your time here.

289
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,600
Go back to sleep if you're tired.

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,680
I'll bring you some toys.

291
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,920
I'll leave him to you.

292
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
Do you know who is investigating me?

293
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,360
Who?

294
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,480
The Supreme Court.

295
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,440
Supreme Court?

296
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,160
This is the evidence.

297
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,560
Since it's the Supreme Court

298
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,440
I can ask Mo Chou for help

299
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,480
Have you checked the things

300
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,080
Did you check it?

301
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,120
The files he left are still clean.

302
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,880
I can't tell who he's working for.

303
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,560
Should I...

304
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,080
No

305
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,040
Wait for news from Mo Chou

306
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't alert them

307
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,280
Changhao,

308
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,640
The gap between people is huge.

309
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,280
Some are grooms at night.

310
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,360
Some are busy at night.

311
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,280
Let's go.

312
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay.

313
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,240
My Lord.

314
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,080
Your wife is here.

315
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
Changhao. Changhao, I need to talk to you.

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,080
Songquan, go down first.

317
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,720
Okay. Okay.

318
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,160
Song Quan.

319
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,760
Chun Ying asked me to say hello to you on her behalf.

320
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,359
and ask her out for dinner.

321
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,280
Sure.

322
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Okay. Okay.

323
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,760
Yes, sir.

324
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,520
Why are you looking for me so urgently?

325
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,040
Yes.

326
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,079
I was making a facial mask.

327
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,480
I need eggs and vinegar.

328
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,560
Hengyu accidentally spilled vinegar.

329
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,119
I saw the vinegar flow.

330
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,520
Get to the point.

331
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
I remember seeing you on TV.

332
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,160
The Criminal Officer of Song.

333
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,040
What is TV?

334
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,760
It's a kind of review.

335
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,480
Books?

336
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,840
What does it have to do with the case?

337
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,800
There was also a murder case in the review.

338
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,560
Official report also died of fire

339
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,600
But the male lead Song Ci didn't believe it

340
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,200
So he used a way

341
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,240
This kind of wine vinegar autopsy method.

342
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,560
Sprinkle a small jar of rice vinegar

343
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,880
in the victim's area.

344
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,280
Then pour some wine on it.

345
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,720
You know?

346
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,360
I used it at the place where my brother passed away.

347
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,400
Yes.

348
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
Is there blood on the floor?

349
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,480
No.

350
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,480
It means your brother didn't get hurt and bleed before he died.

351
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,600
Is there ash in his mouth and nose?

352
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,040
Yes.

353
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,120
Is it sticky or dry like dust?

354
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,960
Mazy.

355
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,520
Looks like your brother

356
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,880
died in a fire.

357
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
in the fire.

358
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
She knows coroner's autopsy method.

359
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,640
She's up to no good.

360
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
But if she is a spy,

361
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,120
why is she so concerned about my brother’s case?

362
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,240
Yu Cosmos.
