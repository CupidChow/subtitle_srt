1
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,320
and you can't leave. You can't leave.

2
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,120
You can't leave either.

3
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,600
I've surrounded this place.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,720
Sir.

5
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
I've done what you asked.

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,880
We've surrounded this place.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,720
I knew you're not that simple.

8
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,080
But don't be happy too soon.

9
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,480
Ruofei.

10
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,600
Your Highness! Your Highness!

11
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,600
The truth is revealed

12
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
The truth is revealed now.

13
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,200
You can't escape.

14
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,640
Surrender now!

15
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,720
Surrender now.

16
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920
Qiu Changhao.

17
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
Are you kidding me?

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Your life

19
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
You don't want it anymore? I don't want it anymore.

20
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Don't touch her! Don't touch her!

21
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,800
Don't touch her!

22
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,840
It's me. It's me.

23
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,920
I'll kill her. I'll do it. I'll do it.

24
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
You're right.

25
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,920
Put down your weapons.

26
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
In your dreams!

27
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,600
Let go! Let go!

28
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Put it down. Put it down.

29
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,200
Come on. Let's go.

30
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

31
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,519
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Okay. Okay.

33
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Let's go. Let's go.

34
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,440
Go.

35
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Qiu Changhao!

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,720
Come here.

37
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't dodge it. Don't dodge it.

38
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Don't listen to him.

39
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,120
It's just a dream.

40
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,120
I won't die.

41
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,240
Let's go! Let's go!

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Ruofei.

43
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,040
You're saying something I don't understand again.

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,880
But this time,

45
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,920
I can't gamble.

46
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

47
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,720
Look! Look! Look! Look!

48
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,800
Changhao.

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,240
Jang-ho!

50
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,400
I won't let you get hurt.

51
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,680
Changhao.

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Ruofei.

53
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
From the first day you married me,

54
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,840
I can't understand what you're talking about.

55
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
But it's okay.

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
I believe you no matter what you say.

57
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,320
Ruofei,

58
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
You made this family lively.

59
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,080
You made Hengyu feel love.

60
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,920
It's you who made me feel joy, anger and sorrow.

61
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,200
You helped me reverse the case.

62
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
One look, one hell.

63
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Step by step, the heavens

64
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
You never flinch

65
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,600
and never give up.

66
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,440
I always want to

67
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,360
Your Ladyship.

68
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
You are a blessing from heaven, right?

69
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,000
Changhao.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,800
Go! Go!

71
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,840
Leave now! Leave me alone!

72
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,320
Leave me alone.

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,159
Leave me alone.

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,320
If I die,

75
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
I want you to remember our marriage.

76
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
I remember.

77
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,159
I remember. Don't come near me.

78
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
Don't come near me.

79
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,760
I beg you.

80
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
Don't hurt him.

81
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
You want to kill someone?

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,080
Can you kill me?

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,520
Please kill me.

84
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,960
Changhao.

85
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,560
He's dying.

86
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,840
Look at him.

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
Changhao, it's okay.

88
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,960
It's okay.

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,040
Let's go, okay?

90
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,320
I'll take you back, okay?

91
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,440
Don't worry.

92
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,080
I will get you out alive.

93
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,640
Changhao.

94
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,520
Changhao.

95
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,320
Changhao.

96
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,720
Hello. Hello.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,360
Changhao.

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,880
Let's go home, okay?

100
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,400
Everyone is waiting for us.

101
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,120
Let's go home, okay?

102
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,400
Forgive me.

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,360
I can't take you home this time.

104
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,559
Are you mad at me?

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,480
Are you mad at me

106
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,520
I always push you to others?

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,160
Are you mad at me

108
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,920
that I didn't cherish our time?

109
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,400
I know I was wrong.

110
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm really sorry.

111
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,840
Ruofei,

112
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Don't you want to hear something?

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,640
I don't want to hear it.

114
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,560
Don't say it.

115
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,720
Don't say it.

116
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't say it. Don't say it.

117
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,040
Don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it.

118
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Ruofei.

119
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,880
Don't say it.

120
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,520
Don't say it.

121
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,080
[I love you.]

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,840
love

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,880
[Love]

124
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,440
No!

125
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Changhao!

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,560
Changhao.

127
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,200
Changhao.

128
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,520
Changhao.

129
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,560
Changhao.

130
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,440
Changhao.

131
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,600
My goodness.

132
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,000
You're awake.

133
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,360
Chun Ying.

134
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,160
Are you crazy?

135
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm Fatty.

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,760
Not Chun Ying.

137
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
Don't you think you're arrogant?

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,160
You can even fall into a well while walking.

139
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,960
There's no one else.

140
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,560
Fatty.

141
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,920
Director.

142
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,240
Du Ruofei.

143
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,400
How did you fall into the sewer?

144
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm sorry, Mother.

145
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,560
It's all my fault.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mother.

147
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
It's useless to call me mother.

148
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,440
You have to come back to take the exam for me.

149
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,240
Are you okay?

150
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,600
No.

151
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,680
Don't cry.

152
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,240
Qiwan. Changren.

153
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,520
You...

154
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
Why don't you call Changhao?

155
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,360
You know Changhao?

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
Yes.

157
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,440
You've been arguing all night.

158
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,000
the whole hospital will know.

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,600
Sister.

160
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
If you really like him,

161
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
just get him back.

162
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,120
What are you talking about?

163
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Just change another one.

164
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,560
Besides, men are all bad.

165
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,280
except me.

166
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,320
You're right.

167
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,480
Let's go out for a walk.

168
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,320
No.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,640
Are you really stupid?

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
But you do talk about

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,560
Changhao, Changren,

172
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,840
What? And Hengyu.

173
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,480
It’s not good to apply lipstick.

174
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Changle.

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,280
Jiang Lanting?

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,080
Mr. Wang, she...

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,400
She actually woke up.

178
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
This is a miracle in medical history.

179
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
You're so great.

180
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
When did she wake up?

181
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,400
Just now.

182
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,120
That means our treatment is right.

183
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,920
And the patient's vitals

184
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,840
are stable.

185
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,160
You did a good job.

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,040
Good job.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
You take care of him.

188
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Take good care of her.

189
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:02,920
You...

190
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,840
Just listen to Mr. Wang.

191
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,880
Because every word she says is important.

192
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,520
Shut up.

193
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,400
Get lost.

194
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,760
Bye.

195
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,320
Why are you all here?

196
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,680
except him?

197
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,200
No.

198
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,480
Where are you going?

199
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,240
Hello.

200
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm from the City Project Department.

201
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,600
Is there a girl

202
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,640
who fell into the well?

203
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,360
Please wait.

204
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,440
Let me take a look.

205
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
What's her name?

206
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,400
It should be Du Ruofei.

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,760
Okay.

208
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm Du Ruofei.

209
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,560
Hello.

210
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,160
I’m a patrol of the City Engineer, Qiu Changhao.

211
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,200
Qiu Changhao.

212
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,600
I’m here to know

213
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,280
about your situation.

214
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,040
[Is it because...]

215
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,640
No.

216
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,120
You're very formal.

217
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,040
You're surrounded.

218
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I fell into the well to take a shortcut.

219
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
You have no problem.

220
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,080
Understand, Qiu Changhao?

221
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,000
You are fine.

222
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,240
It's good that you're fine.

223
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,040
I think we might

224
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,120
we may change the soft covers into hard covers.

225
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,680
No need.

226
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,520
You're good now.

227
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:56,920
Really.

228
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,720
Keep the status quo

229
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,800
Don't change because of me.

230
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,240
It's great to see you.

231
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,280
Did we

232
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,600
know each other?

233
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
Not just that.

234
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
I mean

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,600
you are the same name

236
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,040
in the novel I'm chasing.

237
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,960
The heroine of my novel

238
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,280
is the same name.

239
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,360
Wait.

240
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll write some novels

241
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
I'll write some novels in my spare time

242
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
in my spare time.

243
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,080
You mean

244
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,600
the author is you?

245
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,680
Wait a minute.

246
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,600
I have a question.

247
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,520
Why did you write Qiu Changhao to death?

248
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,760
You made Du Ruofei so upset.

249
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,360
Actually, I'm not very satisfied with this ending.

250
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
But I haven't decided.

251
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
I'm thinking

252
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,680
Let me help you.

253
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,800
I want to uphold justice

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
for Du Ruofei and the netizens.

255
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
I think this is the ending.

256
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,560
You need this pose.

257
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,640
How long do you want to watch it?

258
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,680
Not enough.

259
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,520
I haven't seen you

260
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,320
for 520 seconds.

261
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,600
I miss you so much.

262
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,040
Where did you go?

263
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,920
Don't disappear like this again.

264
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,080
I...

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,000
sent a knife to the scriptwriter.

266
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,840
Look how good it is now.

267
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
The boss is gone.

268
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,760
The family is reunited.

269
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,040
No one can disturb us anymore.

270
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,960
Now,

271
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,560
kiss, hug, lift up high.

272
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,320
Ruofei.

273
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,600
After that time,

274
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
I thought I'd never see you again.

275
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,960
for making you take risks with me.

277
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm so happy

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
to see you again.

279
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,560
From now on,

280
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,280
as long as I'm alive,

281
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
I will never leave you.

282
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,840
Now,

283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
I just want to be with you.

284
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,480
Wait.

285
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,680
I suddenly realized that

286
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,080
I chased you for 36 episodes.

287
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,520
You never

288
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,920
formally proposed to me.

289
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,480
You just got married.

290
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,760
Life after marriage is still so hard.

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,760
What a loss.

292
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,440
Propose!

293
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,680
Propose?

294
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,760
Propose.

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,079
Now. Hurry up.

296
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,359
Ruofei.

297
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,880
[To live or die,]

298
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
Tell Ja-sung

299
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
to hold your hand

300
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,720
and grow old together.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,640
Will you

302
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,560
I...

303
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,160
I...

304
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,880
You want to fool her with just a few words?

305
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,840
It's too easy for you.

306
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,640
I want a sense of ritual.

307
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,880
A sense of ritual?

308
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
I want a special ending.

309
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,400
Is this enough?

310
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,440
Yes.

311
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
The Xun Mansion

312
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,720
is so beautiful.

313
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,320
So beautiful.

314
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,680
Yes, you are.

315
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,080
But you haven't answered my question.

316
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,320
Question?

317
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,880
[I think someone has three words left.]

318
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,200
I love you.

319
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,320
I do.
