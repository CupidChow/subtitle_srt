1
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Try it.

2
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Get up and try.

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
What's wrong?

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,520
No.

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
Don't pour it. Get up.

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,160
Where are you touching?

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,039
You...

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,600
Get up. Get up.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,759
Get up.

10
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Hold on.

11
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,040
Hold on. I'll get out.

12
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,760
Don't move.

13
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,800
I can't breathe.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
Hurry up. You go out.

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Come on.

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,479
So intense?

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Are you okay?

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Don't come over. I'm fine.

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Let me help you.

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
Don't move.

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Are you really okay?

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm fine.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,120
Really

25
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,160
Okay. Okay.

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
I see.

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,480
The aphrodisiac will stimulate the central nerves.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Pain stimulates secretion of adrenaline.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
endorphin and acetamine.

30
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,800
and stimulate further biochemical process.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Combine with magnesium to detoxify it.

32
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:54,760
So...

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,880
Are you really okay?

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,480
I'm fine.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,040
Okay, that's good.

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,840
I'll go to bed now.

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
I'm really tired.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Where do you sleep?

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,440
Do you need to ask? Sleep on the bed.

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,520
I...

41
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,880
Mother has chosen a lot.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,480
I thought she was an honest girl,

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
but she's a gold digger.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,800
I'll tell her

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,760
to her tomorrow.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,520
This useless thing.

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,720
You can't study or have children.

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
Your fart stinks.

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,640
This loser.

50
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,640
The composition of nucleic acid.

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,640
Ammonia acid, Ammonia acid in winter.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,120
Miss. Miss.

53
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,399
Get up.

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
Miss.

55
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
Madam will scold you later.

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
Madam.

57
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,160
Madam.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,920
Madam is scolding me.

59
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Chun Ying.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Why am I still here?

61
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,360
Miss.

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
Are you sleeping?

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
I heard you said it was sour.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,360
so I brought you a bowl of syrup of plum.

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Try it.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,200
No.

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,720
No.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,159
How can this dream be so long?

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
I've been sleeping for a while.

70
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,680
What time is it now?

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,280
Three quarter past seven.

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,920
It's 7:45 a.m.

73
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,520
The exam is in five days.

74
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,920
I can't believe I'm still here.

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,160
But no matter how slow my dream is,

76
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
I have to wake up.

77
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Miss.

78
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you sleeping?

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
I often fall asleep too.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,520
Flower arrangement?

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
Clean your teeth, Miss.

82
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,640
You guys

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
Brushing teeth is too simple and rude.

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,159
Where is Qiu Changhao? Where is he?

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,640
Young Master went to the Ministry of Justice.

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,040
Gou Jae Guo often appears in Fengcheng.

87
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,000
Why?

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Sir.

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,840
What is it?

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Next,

91
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
we caught a spy named Gou Jae-gook.

92
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,000
but he's not a big shot.

93
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you going to interrogate him yourself?

94
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,080
I'll do it.

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,240
I'll arrange it.

96
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,160
Wait.

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,200
Get Matchmaker Wang here.

98
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
Who are you matchmaking for?

99
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,400
It's personal.

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,080
It's obvious.

101
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,400
I can't ask him for help.

102
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,680
I have to figure it out myself.

103
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,960
Let me think about

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,160
in those dramas?

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,320
Miss, what are you doing?

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,000
Calm down.

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,080
Come down, Miss.

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,280
Madam will be unhappy if she sees this.

109
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm learning how to draw lightning.

110
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,840
What?

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,360
Franklyn, Thunder.

112
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,040
You want to draw the Thunder God and Lightning Goddess?

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,680
No.

114
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
You can't just hold a stick.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,760
You have to perform the prayer dance.

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,760
You don't understand.

117
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,840
What if a cloud has thunder?

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,200
Come down, Miss.

119
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,720
It looks scary.

120
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,400
Gosh.

121
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,520
Coming.

122
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Chun Ying.

123
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I can't keep you company.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Go. No.

126
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
Miss.

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,560
You look like a shrink in our village.

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
A psychic?

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,480
You have good luck in love recently.

130
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,360
I curse you.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
You'll be cursed.

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
Yes.

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,360
That brother

134
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,159
told me something and I fell into the well.

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,680
Do you have a well here?

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
Well.

137
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,280
It's a well-known one. It's a well-known one.

138
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
The well is a well? Yes.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,920
Yes, miss.

140
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,159
Forget it.

141
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
As long as I can wake up.

142
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,159
I... I'm...

143
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,800
Miss.

144
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,400
What did you eat so hard?

145
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,080
I just ate a roasted chicken.

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Wait, Miss.

147
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,360
What happened last night?

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,440
Did Young Master bully you?

149
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I’ll beat him up now.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,680
No, no.

151
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,000
I need to go back.

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Go back?

153
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,760
Go home?

154
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,840
Let's go home now.

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,680
No.

156
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,880
I need to wake up.

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,200
Wake up, do you understand?

158
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,640
Wake up.

159
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Aren't you awake now?

160
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Come on, fortune teller.

161
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,360
I knew you wouldn't understand.

162
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,720
How can I explain this to you?

163
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,679
Anyway, before this,

164
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,120
Fortune-telling. Fortune-telling.

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,039
Fortune-telling.

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
Fortune-telling!

167
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,880
Wait.

168
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
He knows astronomy and geography.

169
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
Why does he look like that big brother?

170
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,360
He knows people and people well.

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,640
Fortune telling.

172
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,680
Fortune-telling!

173
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,280
It's really you.

174
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,960
Master, please save me.

175
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
I regretted not listening to you.

176
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,160
I can't wake up now.

177
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,360
Can you calculate for me?

178
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
Let me calculate it for you.

179
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,800
Then...

180
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,840
Yes.

181
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,760
I see.

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
Master,

183
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,200
I have no money here.

184
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,160
I'll give you a big red packet.

185
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,080
Tell me

186
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,680
when will he wake up?

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,240
Oh, right.

188
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,360
I remember now.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,440
You're destined to be in love.

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
Yes.

191
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
You said I was fierce.

192
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,440
No.

193
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
You turned calamity into good.

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,120
No.

195
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,720
Then I'm still in my dream.

196
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,840
I can't wake up.

197
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,760
The exam is in five days.

198
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,800
What if I fail?

199
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,920
Are you still asleep?

200
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,440
Yes.

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,240
No.

202
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
Don't you remember?

203
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,760
You told me on the street that day

204
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I didn't believe you.

205
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,520
Do you understand?

206
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,960
Yes.

207
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,840
Well,

208
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,240
You draw first.

209
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,200
My goodness.

210
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,880
Spirit.

211
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,920
This is it.

212
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,600
It's hot in summer

213
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Happy enemies are supporting Cai Lian

214
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,080
The lights are falling and the stars are conveying hatred.

215
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,840
Alright, Eunhan.

216
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,800
Stop reading.

217
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
What does it mean?

218
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
This means

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,240
It means

220
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,560
Kind and gentle.

221
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,480
[Gentle]

222
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,040
[Love]

223
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
A crush?

224
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,840
In other words,

225
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
I may be his wife,

226
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
but he has someone

227
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,720
You...

228
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,360
I see.

229
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
It means

230
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,280
I replaced Qiu Changhao as his wife.

231
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,120
His true love is not me.

232
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
So I need to help him find the true man.

233
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,840
and let Tony tell his true love

234
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
to his true love,

235
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,160
I can wake up, right?

236
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,360
That's right.

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,760
You're right.

238
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
You really are a master.

239
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you so much.

240
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,840
When I wake up,

241
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,480
when I wake up.

242
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Chun Ying, let's go.

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,080
Don't bring her here again.

244
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,680
Miss.

246
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
Now I want to know

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
who this man is.

248
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
Then let them confess their love.

249
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
In that case,

250
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,120
But who is

251
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
is actually?

252
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,600
Chun...

253
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,360
Chun Ying.

254
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,720
What are you doing?

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,400
Really.

256
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,400
We met him in person. Great.

257
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,080
What are you looking at?

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm watching the show at night.

259
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,080
I don't know what to look at.

260
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,480
if I can see him.

261
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,080
I will come to your mansion tonight.

262
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,640
Your Majesty.

263
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,120
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

264
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,600
My lady. My lady.

265
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Who am I?

266
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
The book says that

267
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,600
is a man who robs the rich and helps the poor.

268
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
and mysterious.

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
Isn't this written by the Thief Kid?

270
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,240
What?

271
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
You won't know even if I tell you.

272
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,760
Excuse me.

273
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,960
Excuse me.

274
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,120
Are you okay?

275
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
Who reported it?

276
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
I... I...

277
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,840
My lord.

278
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,840
I reported it.

279
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,040
Where is the criminal?

280
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,320
Here, here, here.

281
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,920
It's late at night.

282
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,520
Yes, my lord.

283
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
I came from another city

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,040
I bought this house.

285
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,120
They haven't moved in yet.

286
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,720
I just moved something and the door...

287
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,640
You scared me.

288
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,560
Don't worry.

289
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,320
As long as he doesn't do anything wrong,

290
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,600
he won't do anything stupid.

291
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,440
Of course.

292
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,880
Otherwise, we will bring him to justice.

293
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,720
Thank you, sir.

294
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,120
All right.

295
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,400
Starting tonight,

296
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,080
Strengthen patrol here.

297
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,360
Dismiss

298
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,360
Dismiss

299
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,320
Go away

300
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
Your soul is gone too.

301
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
No.

302
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,440
I just feel a little dizzy.

303
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,040
Go home and feel dizzy.

304
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,920
I have something to do.

305
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,320
Let's go.

306
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,280
No, I...

307
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,480
You're really cheerful when you're happy.

308
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,320
My lord, today

309
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
you look gorgeous today.

310
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,880
I didn't sleep all night.

311
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,680
but you said I look radiant.

312
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,560
On our wedding night,

313
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
Of course I don't want to sleep.

314
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:12,920
Besides,

315
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,400
Madam is so beautiful.

316
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,000
Can you sleep?

317
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,240
Granny Wang.

318
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,640
When you came to my mansion to talk about matchmaking,

319
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,280
you told me that Du Ruofei is handsome, intelligent,

320
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,680
and virtuous.

321
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,000
That's right.

322
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,440
Although she's the village head's daughter,

323
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,840
she's still an official's daughter.

324
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,200
Her words and actions are quite appropriate.

325
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,040
You're quite polite.

326
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,720
Your family

327
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,080
From Madam Chu and Third Mistress Qi Wan,

328
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,400
and Huang, the guard.

329
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,360
I'm the one who said the matchmaker.

330
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Also,

331
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,960
I watched you grow up.

332
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm here

333
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,120
to introduce a wife to you.

334
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,680
I know that.

335
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,560
But let me ask you.

336
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,680
Are you sure she's a healthy person?

337
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,880
It can't be a problem.

338
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,560
Of course.

339
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,280
Maybe she doesn't know much about the world.

340
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,720
I don't think she's like you said.

341
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,880
gentle, virtuous and quiet.

342
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
Are you lying to me?

343
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,920
My Lord! My Lord!

344
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,880
My lord.

345
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
She probably hasn't learned

346
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
how to serve her husband.

347
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,640
In the future,

348
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,520
in the future.

349
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,200
I have never lied to you.

350
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,920
I just don’t know

351
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,920
about Miss Du.

352
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
You don't even know her background.

353
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
How dare you say that you're my wife?

354
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,280
Underground?

355
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,240
She's the only daughter of the village head.

356
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
What background?

357
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
It's just that she's not married yet.

358
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,880
My lord, you...

359
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Please listen to me.

360
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,200
Newlyweds have a period of adjustment.

361
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,840
Look at our city.

362
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,640
At your age,

363
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,640
are all children's fathers.

364
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,360
Besides,

365
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,480
Mrs. Chu is waiting to have a grandson.

366
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,720
All right, you can leave now.

367
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,640
Yes, I’m leaving.

368
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,920
To help Qiu Changhao find his lover,

369
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,080
we need to know where Princess Jin Shu is.

370
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,840
Mrs. Chu must know where she is.

371
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
They are superstitious.

372
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,000
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

373
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,800
Hello, Director. Hello.

374
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,520
Greetings, Mother.

375
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,640
Greetings, Mother.

376
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,840
Rise.

377
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
Mother.

378
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,720
Mother.

379
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,079
I had a dream last night.

380
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,520
a woman wore a red wedding dress

381
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,280
She came to me and told me

382
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,680
why you slept on my bed

383
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
and take my place?

384
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,320
You're talking nonsense.

385
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,200
I remember

386
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,240
she said she was a princess.

387
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,360
Hi Music
