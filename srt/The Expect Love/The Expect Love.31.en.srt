1
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
What took you so long?

2
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,920
Miss Gu has always been crispy.

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,520
Why are you so slow today?

4
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
I miss the canteen.

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,920
I miss the classroom.

6
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
I'll miss you too.

7
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,840
I hope I wake up again when I open my eyes.

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,880
Hey, hey, hey!

9
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing?

10
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
What are you doing by the lake?

11
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
Nothing.

12
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,600
What if you fall down

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,320
Let's take a wheelchair.

14
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,200
wheelchair.

15
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,760
You can talk to Miss Gu.

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,000
So you really understand?

17
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,360
Yes, I do.

18
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
Do it now. Do it now.

19
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm about to

20
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,440
to the one I love.

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm here. I'm here.

22
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,840
She's here. She's here.

23
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,000
Your Highness. Your Highness.

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,480
Don't worry.

25
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,880
I have an idea.

26
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,640
Princess Jin Shu was abducted before getting married.

27
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,480
We haven't heard from her for so many years.

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,760
Why did he suddenly pop out today?

29
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
I was wondering too.

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,560
What should we do? What should we do?

31
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,600
What can we do?

32
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
She's a princess.

33
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,680
Princess Jin Shu is here.

34
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,480
Mother.

35
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

36
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm finally home.

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Come back. Come back.

38
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
That's good.

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
I have a question.

40
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,159
Where have you been

41
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,840
where have you been?

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,800
I sent someone to look for him.

43
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
but I couldn't find him.

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

45
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,520
Mother,

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,280
I was robbed by a villain

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,240
She jumped out of the carriage to protect herself.

48
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,080
I fell off a cliff

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
and broke my legs.

50
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,080
Luckily, an old couple saved me.

51
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
In order to repay their kindness,

52
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I stayed to take care of them.

53
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,760
I've been away for years.

54
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,520
I failed to fulfill my filial duty to you.

55
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,520
Please forgive me.

56
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,520
After today,

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,960
you can enjoy your remaining years.

58
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
I'll take care of everything.

59
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,720
No way.

60
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm the one

61
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,080
in the mansion.

62
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,480
You're the daughter of a marquis family. How could you lose yourself?

63
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
It's just a small matter.

64
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
to bother you.

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,960
This is Qiwan, right?

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,120
My sister-in-law's family is famous in the Guanzhong Prefecture.

67
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
He's used to competing.

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,840
He must be good at managing money.

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Keep managing the family.

70
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,800
I can trust you.

71
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,520
Mother.

72
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,120
You have a daughter now.

73
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,680
Don't talk if you can't speak.

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,960
This is my beautiful and clever aunt Changle, right?

75
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Hello, aunt.

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,320
Since I married into the Qiu family,

77
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm a member of the Qiu family.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Of course you should be as responsible as your daughter.

79
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,120
You have to do better than your own daughter.

80
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
You'll know when you get married.

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,960
A wife is a wife

82
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
It's different from being a daughter

83
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,520
A daughter

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,600
You can do whatever you want.

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,240
As a wife, you have to follow her.

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,760
Follow the dog.

87
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm Mrs. Cheng, an official wife of the Qiu family.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
I didn't mean to be robbed.

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,520
I came back today

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
to come back today.

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,640
I just want to go back to the Qiu family to carry on my original identity.

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,600
Mother.

93
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,360
Is that wrong?

94
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,800
Mother.

95
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,080
That's right.

96
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,480
You are the daughter-in-law of our family.

97
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,880
I can tolerate you.

98
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
I can't accept it.

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,920
I can't tolerate you either.

100
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Mother.

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,160
Are you looking for me?

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,000
No.

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you doing here?

104
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

105
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,480
Jin Shu.

106
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
You've been away for so many years.

107
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,920
Let me explain it to you.

108
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,320
No need.

109
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,800
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,520
I know.

111
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,840
You must be the rumored Du Ruofei.

112
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,360
I heard about your story with Changhao.

113
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,920
Now that I see you,

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,640
It's really different.

115
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm not here these years.

116
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,520
Thank you for taking care of Changhao for me.

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,560
OK.

118
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,159
Don't be so dramatic.

119
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,480
Mother.

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Sister-in-law.

121
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,200
Changle.

122
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
Since they are married officially,

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,840
we have no reason to refuse.

124
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
You are our guest.

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,280
As the host,

126
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,640
we should be generous.

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
Okay.

128
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,360
My sister

129
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,000
Although I married into the Qiu family,

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
this is my first time here.

131
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,160
It's my fault.

132
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,720
But I...

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,320
still want to see Changhao.

134
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,760
Yes.

135
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,840
Sure.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,760
Please put in a good word for me.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,200
Okay.

138
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm going to put in a good word.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
Go to bed early.

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,480
Ruofei.

141
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Mother.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,720
Well,

143
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go back first.

144
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

145
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
Why should we bow to her?

146
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,720
Miss, you're back.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
What happened to your face?

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,040
Nothing.

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
Young Master is waiting for you.

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,200
You guys talk.

151
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
I'll keep watch for you.

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:10,840
Come on.

153
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,640
This...

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,840
Chun Ying is like the God of Gate.

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
What's wrong with her?

156
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,360
She's probably going on a date with Songquan.

157
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm afraid Song Quan will be in danger.

158
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,520
Did you see Jin Shu?

159
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
Are you curious?

160
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
Go check it out yourself.

161
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,600
They are waiting for you to get married.

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,640
What do you mean?

163
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,560
I've never seen her before.

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,800
Then you should go and have a look.

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,360
She's pretty.

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
She's pretty.

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,400
When I stand next to you,

168
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
you look very rich.

169
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
I just want to ask you about her condition.

170
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
Her condition?

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
It can be said

172
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,480
arrogant of all heroes.

173
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,600
and rule the world.

174
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,960
is as stable as Mount Tai.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,000
Qi Wan and Changle can’t do anything to her.

176
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,880
Your mother can’t do anything to her.

177
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,560
What should we do?

178
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,080
Go and sleep with her.

179
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,200
I'll sleep with Chun Ying.

180
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
It's better to say goodbye than getting married.

181
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,640
It's been so many years.

182
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,520
I can't sleep with her.

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
Why not?

184
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
We didn't sleep together at first

185
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,320
Is the nature the same?

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
What's the difference?

187
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
This kind of thing

188
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,320
It's the same in nature.

189
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
In fact,

190
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,200
there's no difference.

191
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I just don't want to see her.

192
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,840
You'd better go.

193
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,600
in case you regret it later.

194
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Why should I see her?

195
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,920
She's your legal wife.

196
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,520
She's a legitimate leading actress.

197
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,400
She's actually quite pitiful.

198
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,800
She was kidnapped and fell off a cliff.

199
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
and was saved by the old couple.

200
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,360
To repay their kindness,

201
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,920
he sent him to his funeral and came back.

202
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
It's not easy.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
I'll write the divorce agreement now.

204
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Sit down.

205
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,680
Sit down.

206
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,120
What divorce letter?

207
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
I didn't see you writing when he lost it.

208
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Now she's back.

209
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
You want to write a divorce agreement?

210
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,080
What's going on?

211
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,720
You want a divorce before you figure it out.

212
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,040
It's bad for her reputation.

213
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,640
and you'll be cursed.

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,680
You don't know how scary

215
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,400
you don't know.

216
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,520
I'll go

217
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,680
Tell her clearly. Okay.

218
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,640
Yes.

219
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,440
Say it calmly.

220
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,480
Say it properly.

221
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,760
Go. Go.

222
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,480
Face the wind!

223
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,880
I'll go now!

224
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,520
Dear.

225
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
You're Jin Shu?

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,520
Yes.

227
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
She's your wife.

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,840
He's your husband.

229
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,640
Take your time.

230
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm leaving.

231
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,920
It's okay.

232
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,680
Let's go. Let's go.

233
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Yes, sister.

234
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,680
We are a family.

235
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,280
What's the matter?

236
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,280
Honey.

237
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,880
This is the new clothes I made for you.

238
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
Try it on.

239
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,120
The clothes are beautiful.

240
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,560
The new clothes are indeed better.

241
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,520
Not like old friends.

242
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,600
Sister,

243
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,520
You really

244
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,360
it's my fault.

245
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,240
It's not like that. It's not like that.

246
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,880
You misunderstood me.

247
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,960
That's not what I meant.

248
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,480
No need.

249
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,400
I usually wear official clothes.

250
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,280
I just want to thank you

251
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,360
for not forgetting me.

252
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
so that I can step into the Xun Mansion.

253
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Let me do it.

254
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,240
Thank you.

255
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,160
You're welcome.

256
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,440
You've been working hard.

257
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,280
I also made a sleeping sachet.

258
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,560
No need.

259
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,480
I slept well.

260
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,760
I just wanted to thank you.

261
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,600
I have no other intention.

262
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,880
You don't have to. Take it.

263
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Just take it.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Take it.

265
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,120
Hurry up.

266
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,960
It's not appropriate for a girl

267
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,520
It's inappropriate.

268
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
I know

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
when I come back this time.

270
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,120
But I can wait.

271
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,720
until you accept me.

272
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
my husband is willing to accept me.

273
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,440
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

274
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,680
My dear husband.

275
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,560
I have something

276
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,920
I want to tell you in private.

277
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,920
I'll wait for you in the garden.

278
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,480
Are you crazy?

279
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,600
You're in love, aren't you?

280
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,360
Do you regret it?

281
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,920
I feel

282
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,760
something is wrong.

283
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Yes.

284
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,880
It's weird for men to see pretty girls.

285
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,440
I'll go meet her.

286
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
She doesn't respect me, the copywriter.

287
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,600
Sit down.

288
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,320
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,080
You can't wear a sachet.

290
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,360
But I appreciate your kindness.

291
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,040
I was thoughtless.

292
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,960
All these years,

293
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,600
all these years?

294
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,040
[Living in Hyecheon Village]

295
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,800
Hyecheon Village.

296
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,880
What happened on the way?

297
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,400
On the way.

298
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
I was robbed

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,120
I jumped off the carriage to protect myself.

300
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,240
But I broke my legs.

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Your leg was broken.

302
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,400
I hope you don't mind.

303
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,800
Let me take a look.

304
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,240
It's done. It's done.

305
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,120
It's done. It's done.

306
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,160
That scumbag.

307
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,400
You can't help touching me.

308
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,280
I'll let you do it.

309
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,160
Wait a minute.

310
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Why am I so nervous?

311
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm leaving.

312
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
If you don't like it,

313
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,400
please give me a few days.

314
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll go to the border to seek refuge with my father.

315
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
I will never bother you again.

316
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,600
If

317
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,240
accept

318
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
who has no choice.

319
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm willing to be

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
to serve my husband and Ruofei.

321
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,440
As long as I have food to eat.

322
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
I won't kick you out.

323
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,880
or dislike you.

324
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,440
My father and Marquis Jin are like brothers.

325
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,760
Since Fengcheng moved to the border,

326
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I entrusted you to me.

327
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,120
I didn't take good care of you.

328
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,200
But you came back today.

329
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,040
is a good thing.

330
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,800
Take it as I have a sister.

331
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,760
Changle has a sister.

332
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,280
Mother has a daughter.

333
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,720
Don't blame yourself.

334
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
Dear.

335
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,119
You don't accept me?

336
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,520
That's not what I meant.

337
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,280
I mean,

338
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,880
After all, it's been so long.

339
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,599
I need to think about it.

340
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,200
Things have changed.

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,680
You don't have to make it difficult for me.

342
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,440
If you can't accept me,

343
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,640
please give me three to five days.

344
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,280
When I find a suitable place,

345
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,400
I will leave quietly.

346
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,600
For my sake,

347
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,480
and for me.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Please keep it a secret.

349
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,000
This is also my consideration for coming back late at night.

350
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,040
Okay.

351
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,520
I've asked someone to clean up the guest room.

352
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,680
You can stay here quietly.

353
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,760
Okay.

354
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,360
No one will disturb you.

355
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,280
It's getting late.

356
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Go back and rest.
