1
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
I heard you were attacked again yesterday.

2
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,039
Yes.

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,880
So I took Ruofei and Chun Ying

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
to stay in the Ministry of Punishments for a few days.

5
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,200
That's good.

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,440
It's more convenient for me to find you.

7
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
I'll come to you in a few days.

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,520
I'll ask Song Quan to make room for you.

9
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,320
You live here too?

10
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Let's talk about something.

11
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,080
Okay. Okay.

12
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,520
Ruofei.

13
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,680
The Ministry of Punishments is simple.

14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,120
I'm sorry for the past few days.

15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
No.

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,920
The bed here

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,320
is similar to ours.

18
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,039
My lord.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
I've brought Chun Ying to the kitchen of the Ministry of Punishments.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,800
I've told you everything.

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, Young Master.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,080
The kitchen is big.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
It's very convenient to play.

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,720
You and Songquan are convenient too.

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
In order to relieve your pressure,

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,600
I apply to stay in the Ministry of Justice too.

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,400
Okay. Thank you.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,040
Thank you, my lord.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,400
Chuntou.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
Let me show you around.

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,240
Okay, Lord Wei.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,320
I say,

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,400
we might as well

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
into a marriage agency.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,440
Marriage agency?

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
This is... This is...

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,040
It doesn't matter.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,880
Ask Deputy Minister of Penalty, Qiu Changhao

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,440
to hand Zhang Zhi Ze's case

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
to the Censorate.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,400
Due to the special nature of the case,

42
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
It's not appropriate to announce it.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I never mentioned

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,960
What is Lord Jang's case?

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,600
The Censorate is certain that it has something to do with many officials.

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,880
The Censorate has confirmed it.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
I checked

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,680
some old cases of local officials.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,480
They found a small case

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,760
there was a small case of smuggling fruit production.

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,720
They said all the fruits from the Ministry of Revenue

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
were taken away by the officials of the Ministry of Revenue.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,040
and paid the harvest to the commoners.

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,960
After that,

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
Lord Zhang punished him for embezzlement.

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
for embezzlement.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,160
and was beheaded by the Censorate.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Almond.

59
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,000
During the drought,

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
in the drought.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
So little.

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
It's meaningless for the Ministry of Revenue to take it away.

63
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,400
I've never heard of any supplements in the palace.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,400
I haven't heard from them since.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,760
I already know where these fruits are.

66
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,960
The cyanide of the assassin in black

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,120
should be from there.

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
In that case,

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,720
the Ministry of Revenue is involved too?

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
and the Administrative Bureau.

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,160
This is not something the Ministry of Justice can face.

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,560
It's necessary to report to His Majesty.

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,079
It's not appropriate now.

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,640
The most important thing now is to find the evidence

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,200
to frame Liang Mansion for embezzlement.

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,840
But the relevant files have been cleaned up.

77
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,240
They either died or disappeared.

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,280
We have no evidence.

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,200
Three million taels of silver

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,120
has not been distributed to the market

81
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
It must be hidden somewhere.

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
Qiu Changhao and I

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,760
talked like this.

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,800
I found that

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
he has never

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
talk so much

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,240
other than Gu Mochou.

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Their tacit understanding

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
Their way of communication

90
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
Yes.

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
I should have thought of it.

92
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,279
What?

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,680
This...

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
The Censorate can't do anything.

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Why don't we find the prince?

96
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
I thought so too.

97
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,200
But...

98
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,840
you're worried about the prince's safety.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm worried that if something goes wrong,

100
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,800
his safety will be in danger.

101
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
How dare you move?

102
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,400
Do you think the person behind this is very powerful?

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,880
That's why

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,280
I told you to move to the Ministry of Justice.

105
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
I found

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,280
you two have a tacit understanding.

107
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,120
We've been working together for years.

108
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,080
Of course.

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,360
Miss Gu,

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,520
You can cook so many dishes?

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,520
I was in a hurry.

112
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,840
I don't know if you like it.

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,480
Yes. Yes.

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,720
I love mutton.

115
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,200
Here, try it.

116
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,560
Brother Zhanghao doesn't like it.

117
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
He can't eat mutton.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
I didn't know

119
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
I didn't have time to tell you

120
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
But Mo Chou likes mutton more

121
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,000
Except this

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,440
these are all his favourites.

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,120
Miss Gu,

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
You really know Changhao.

125
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,760
Eat up.

126
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,280
Eight.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,960
They both chewed eight times.

128
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,200
They are so tacit.

129
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,200
Gu Mochou knows him very well.

130
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,159
He can fight with others

131
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,880
and wash hands and make soup.

132
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,720
It seems that

133
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,920
is probably her.

134
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
They've been together for too long.

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
I don't even know.

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:42,960
No.

137
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,080
I need to check it out.

138
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
Eat, Ruofei.

139
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
What are you thinking?

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,360
Let's eat.

141
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,320
Eat this.

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,280
They look like a couple.

143
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,159
I look like

144
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,040
They're kids.

145
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,080
No.

146
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,440
Why am I demoted

147
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,200
Mo Chou

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,880
How are things going in the Supreme Court?

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
The Supreme Court...

150
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes.

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,680
I suddenly remembered

152
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,040
I have some clothes at home.

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,800
I'll go back first.

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Take your time.

155
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,720
No.

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,240
Ruofei is...

157
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
She went to see Ningji again.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,680
Ning,

159
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,520
I finally understand.

160
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
Mr. Xun's case has been solved.

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,880
No.

162
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
I finally know

163
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,280
who Qiu Changhao likes.

164
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Of course it's you.

165
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Let me tell you seriously.

166
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,080
Don't be scared by me.

167
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,280
Qiu Changhao likes

168
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
Gu Mochou.

169
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
It's a poem. It's a poem. It's a poem.

170
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,480
Look at them.

171
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
When they are together,

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,520
when they are together.

173
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
He talks so much.

174
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,480
You don't know anything from me.

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,520
Besides,

176
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,080
after talking,

177
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,680
Miss Gu can answer the next line.

178
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,120
Qiu Changhao said,

179
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Miss Gu is like this.

180
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
That’s what Qiu Changhao said.

181
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,480
Miss Gu is like that.

182
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Isn’t this a typical lover’s state?

183
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
As far as I know,

184
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,160
They are...

185
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,760
I know.

186
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
We're childhood friends.

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,640
Can you do me a favor?

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,360
Gu Mochou is your subordinate.

189
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
Find out

190
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,800
what she likes.

191
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,320
Who does she have?

192
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Everything about her.

193
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,560
Tell me everything.

194
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,880
This...

195
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,320
My lord.

196
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,040
Mr. Li, the Administrator of Administration, your illness is indeed strange.

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
and it has been years.

198
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,920
This has nothing to do with Lord Zhang's case.

199
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,960
If you allow me,

200
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,640
I want to stay there for a few days.

201
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,159
and seek the root of my illness.

202
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
to help Mr. Li.

203
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,159
and improved my medical skills.

204
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm afraid Lord Li has something to do with this.

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,040
You must be careful.

206
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,960
I feel sorry for him.

207
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,320
Gars.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Stop belittling yourself.

209
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,360
If you can save his life,

210
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,240
to save his life.

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,120
Don't blame yourself.

212
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,160
Have some.

213
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Doctor Gas.

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Long time no see.

215
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
You came to the Ministry of Justice to see a doctor?

216
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Hello, Mrs. Xun.

217
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,160
I came to ask Mr. Xun something.

218
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
What is it?

219
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Big news.

220
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,160
Tell me about it.

221
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,200
You can talk to someone else.

222
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,720
Get out of the way!

223
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,400
What's wrong?

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,040
What's wrong with you?

225
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
He's so mysterious every day.

226
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
It's Doctor Gas who is suffering from difficult diseases.

227
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
He wants to stay at Lord Lee's house for deep treatment.

228
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,000
What disease?

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Tell me.

230
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,520
Maybe I can help you.

231
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,600
It's Lord Li's 11-year-old son.

232
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,880
He's blue all over.

233
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
Blood after diarrhea.

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
I can't eat.

235
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,960
Blue all over.

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
It's like heavy metal poisoning.

237
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,840
What poison?

238
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,000
I guess it was silver poisoning.

239
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,400
She ate too much money.

240
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,760
Sister-in-law

241
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't joke at a serious time.

242
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,520
How can you eat too much money?

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,280
It's steamed

244
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,360
It's cooking

245
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
Dip it in chili noodles

246
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,400
Go go

247
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
You don't understand.

248
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,760
To be specific,

249
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,280
It's nitrate silver poisoning.

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,520
But

251
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,440
there's no way

252
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,280
can't be synthesized.

253
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,680
Mrs. Xun.

254
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,880
The silver has the effect of drug testing.

255
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
Poisoning

256
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
The silver I said is silver

257
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
is not the same thing.

258
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,320
Like this.

259
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,760
Try my way.

260
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,320
Pour a glass of water.

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
Five spoons of salt.

262
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,520
After drinking this

263
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,320
after drinking this.

264
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,920
He only drinks milk for three meals a day.

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,600
About two days.

266
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,320
Look at the effect.

267
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,480
Which medical book is this?

268
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,960
I heard it in class.

269
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
I'll do my best anyway.

270
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,000
Try it.

271
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
What do you think?

272
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,440
Yes.

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,920
It really looks like him.

274
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,880
What do you mean?

275
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,440
It's exactly the same.

276
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,080
Okay.

277
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm talking about this outfit.

278
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,280
I'll go then.

279
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Don't.

280
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,440
I don't know if I can hide it from my mother.

281
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
Stop it.

282
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,600
Mrs. Chu has never seen my face at night.

283
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,040
This is already very grand.

284
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,760
You're right.

285
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,160
I really haven't figured out

286
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,080
after this.

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,480
I'll take care of

288
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,120
in the future.

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,680
Let's knock on the door.

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,760
Let's go.

291
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,880
Slow down.

292
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,320
Mother.

293
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,040
I brought the subjects here.

294
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,200
Coward.

295
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,240
Hello, auntie.

296
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,400
You're the subordinate at night?

297
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,720
Yes, I am.

298
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,160
My daughter has admired you for a long time.

299
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,720
Is she okay?

300
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,520
No.

301
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,320
I have admired Miss Changle for a long time.

302
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
I came empty-handed.

303
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,720
You don't have a good family

304
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,880
No, this is...

305
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
Why didn't you bring anything?

306
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,920
What?

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
A gift.

308
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,760
Yes.

309
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,960
Hurry up.

310
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,960
Ma'am.

311
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
It's a toy.

312
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,120
It's really a small thing.

313
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I can't even see it.

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,520
Mother.

315
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,560
I'll give you a gift. Thank you. Thank you.

316
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,600
Here you go. Thank you.

317
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Well,

318
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,280
I’ll take it on behalf of Changle.

319
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,680
Saya.

320
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
Where are you from?

321
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
Fengcheng.

322
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,560
What do your parents do?

323
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,560
I work for my uncle.

324
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,000
How many siblings?

325
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,520
Just me.

326
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
How much do you earn a year?

327
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,560
Not yet.

328
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Do you have a house?

329
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,000
Only one.

330
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
Any real estate?

331
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
I haven't counted yet.

332
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,640
Then

333
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,200
like our Changle?

334
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,280
I like her.

335
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,840
Beautiful, gentle,

336
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,560
gentle, generous and considerate.

337
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,400
and optimistic.

338
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Simple.

339
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,080
You're fooled by her, aren't you? You're lying to me, aren't you?

340
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,280
No.

341
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,680
I often see Miss Changle

342
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
at night alone on the beam.

343
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,320
To be with the stars

344
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,960
Lower your voice to the bright moon

345
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,200
Her lonely back hurts me.

346
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
She was too full to sleep.

347
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,200
No.

348
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,600
I also saw her dancing

349
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,760
She's heroic and positive.

350
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,400
She's on a diet.

351
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,400
Nonsense.

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,760
By the way,

353
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,920
[She's cheering for me.]

354
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,920
Come on.

355
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm not angry if you don't say this.

356
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
I wasted so many lanterns.

357
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
Actually, we agreed

358
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,880
she would accompany me

359
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,400
and help the poor with me.

360
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,160
and help the weak.

361
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
Let me put it this way.

362
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Saya.

363
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,400
My daughter

364
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,120
is very lazy.

365
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,640
You sleep during the day and go crazy at night.

366
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,240
Think carefully.

367
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,040
Auntie.

368
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
Actually...

369
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
we're already close.

370
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,200
A few slaps doesn't count.

371
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
She's pregnant.

372
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,680
She's pregnant.

373
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,680
Come here.

374
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,720
I know my daughter well.

375
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,080
It’s just that she’s pregnant.

376
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,760
Mrs. Xun! Mrs. Xun!

377
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,120
It works. It works.

378
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,840
Mrs. Xun.

379
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,520
Your prescription is effective.

380
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
Young Master,

381
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,000
He vomited and pulled after using your prescription.

382
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:40,920
Previously,

383
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,520
I regretted listening to you.

384
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,400
But after two hours,

385
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,080
the symptoms are reduced and the skin color has improved.

386
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,760
Mrs. Xun, you are

387
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Amazing.

388
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
It's nothing.

389
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
It's just salt water to wash the stomach

390
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
And then vomit and diarrhea

391
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,520
to make him

392
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,800
more quickly.

393
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,640
This is the quickest way

394
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,200
to cure nitric acid poisoning.

395
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,080
What is this silver?

396
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
If you explain it in a chemical way

397
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,880
It's AGNO3

398
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,800
Where does this nitric acid silver have?

399
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,400
Chemical plant?

400
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,240
But it's not right.

401
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,320
You can't synthesize it.

402
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,800
That's strange.

403
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,640
It's organic.

404
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
And there's something even weirder.

405
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,360
Only his son was poisoned.

406
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,920
You want to say someone poisoned him?

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,080
You can't synthesize it.

408
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,760
If you say it's natural,

409
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,240
It's not like he's the only one who got poisoned.

410
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,000
That's strange.

411
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
How about this, Dr. Gas?

412
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,400
go to their house

413
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,960
some river water, well water, washing clothes,

414
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
and food.

415
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,240
I'll do a test.

416
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,080
Okay, I'll be right there.

417
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,160
Okay.

418
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,480
Okay.

419
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,280
We've played.

420
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,720
and made a scene.

421
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,200
I've been with you for so long.

422
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,880
I'm leaving.

423
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,280
Ma'am, please sit down.

424
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm not done yet.

425
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,760
Stop it.

426
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,200
I...

427
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,800
I'll sit down.

428
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,000
Go ahead.

429
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Actually,

430
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,760
I’ve been thinking

431
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,080
why Changle is so attractive to me.

432
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
Until today, I understand

433
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
why I only like to pee and mud with Changle.

434
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,120
Why do I always

435
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,160
at the gate of the Xun Mansion?

436
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,760
Why do I always want to see Changle’s back?

437
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,360
I miss

438
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,080
I miss the afternoon when we woke up together when we were kids.

439
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,520
I really want to see it every day when I wake up.

440
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,400
she smiles at me with two braids.

441
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,840
She has a lot of love and sympathy.

442
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,040
She has a strong heart

443
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,640
but she needs to be protected.

444
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,760
She's the cutest

445
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,320
I've ever seen.

446
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Are you crazy?

447
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,040
Kang Lanting.

448
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:01,920
Ma'am.

449
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,800
He...

450
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,599
I grew up in the palace.

451
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,240
Everyone around me is afraid of me.

452
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,240
respect me and use me.

453
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,920
No one has ever been sincere to me.

454
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,400
and no one wants to be my friend.

455
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
As time passed,

456
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,640
I've learned

457
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,079
to hide myself by being disrespectful.

458
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,520
Gradually, I felt

459
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,200
being a foolish prince

460
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,280
to be a foolish prince.

461
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,160
Until that day,

462
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,000
Changle was right about what I’ve been avoiding.

463
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,320
She made me dare to face myself.

464
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm sorry, ma'am.

465
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
I spread the rumours

466
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,760
was spread by me.

467
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
No one dared to propose marriage.

468
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,720
It's also my fault.

469
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
I only did this for one purpose.

470
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,840
I want you to marry Changle to me.

471
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,240
I can’t guarantee

472
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,720
I will give Changle happiness.

473
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,480
But I can promise you.

474
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
As long as Changle likes it,

475
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,800
I can be her servant forever.

476
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,640
Please grant my wish.

477
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,560
Did you memorize

478
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
Did you memorize the lines in advance?

479
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,160
I mean it only for you

480
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't cry.

481
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,120
Don't cry

482
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,520
