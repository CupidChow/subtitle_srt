1
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,400
Are you feeling better?

2
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,039
I need company.

3
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,120
Let's go out and get some sun. I'll accompany you.

4
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,280
Okay, let's go to the pharmacy and ask.

5
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,680
Are you okay?

6
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Yes.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,960
Take care. Thank you. Thank you.

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

9
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,640
Take care.

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Ma'am, do you have asthma pills?

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
Yes, madam. Please wait a moment.

12
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
Madam, the thorn apple pollen is gone.

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,160
Why not?

14
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,200
This medicine is very effective for asthma.

15
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,320
That's why it's expensive.

16
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
They are sold in Western Liang.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,160
We don't sell them here.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Not many people can afford it.

19
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you remember the face of the Xiliang people?

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,520
They all look the same.

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,040
If you want to buy them,

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,120
you can go to the city and find the people from Western Liang.

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,440
The Xiliang people?

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,720
Let's go back quickly.

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,960
Gather our men

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,400
to see which people from Western Liang

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,320
thorn apple pollen.

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,040
Our brothers

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
The Ministry of Justice?

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,920
Isn't he your brother?

31
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,200
Your brother is my brother.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,320
You are my wife.

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,200
They are my subordinates.

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,120
How can you mix them up?

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,840
How about colleagues?

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,800
Anyway, gather them.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
the Ministry of Justice can't get involved.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,760
Why? The more, the stronger.

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
This is my own business.

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
I can only investigate in secret.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,600
Changhao, why are you so stubborn?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
People from Western Liang all look the same.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,040
They're all bearded.

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,120
When will you go there?

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,880
Maybe someone can help.

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,079
Who is it?

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Follow me.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,360
Lord Gu, Mr. Xun wants to see you at Guihe Restaurant.

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,160
to discuss something.

50
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,600
What is it?

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,400
I don't know the details.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
Please come over if you have time.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,280
OK.

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
Qiu Changhao's men?

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
He's in the inner city?

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Is there a clinic opened by the Xiliang people in the inner city?

57
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
I always go shopping with Qiu Changle.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,120
I didn’t find it.

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Let's go to this address.

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,000
I've been to this address.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,840
It's not a clinic. It's a house.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,840
Isn't this the same

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
the commercial on the pole?

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,080
I mean

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,279
It can cure anything.

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,120
It can't cure anything.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
It costs money to cure anything.

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
That's not true.

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,519
The doctor is not unfamiliar to him.

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,880
He seems to be here for fame.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
They are all poor people.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,440
He treated patients as usual.

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,760
and asked people to buy medicine on credit.

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,520
Miss Gu, you’re really considerate.

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
No wonder he trusts you so much.

76
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,600
It's nothing.

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,920
You used to help me.

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,520
Now I finally have a chance to help him.

79
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,840
Of course it's more detailed.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
How did you find out?

81
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,360
I met Lord Ning

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,120
in Xiliang Town.

83
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,080
He said some other officials

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,240
went to see him.

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,080
Lord Ning.

86
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,040
What is he doing in Xiliang? He went to buy lamb.

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
To buy lamb.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,680
He's a foodie.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,680
Did he go out in the morning and afternoon?

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,120
As far as I know, only in the morning.

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,960
I have to go out in the afternoon to buy medicine.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,440
I have to go there myself.

93
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,800
Okay, I'll go there tomorrow morning.

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
to get some asthma medicine.

95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,480
and see if there is thorn pollen in it.

96
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,680
I'll go with my wife tomorrow.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Okay, I'll do as you say.

98
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,560
I...

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,120
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
It's my idea.

101
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,840
Why am I so unnecessary?

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,080
The relationship line is so obvious.

103
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
How can I live?

104
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Doctor, this is my sister.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
I came to visit her last time.

106
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,760
Let me check your pulse.

107
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,440
A pulse?

108
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course.

109
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,160
Do you really have asthma?

110
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm already like this.

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,120
Isn't it obvious enough?

112
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,400
I used to

113
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,120
I took a kind of

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
from Jifeng Pharmacy.

115
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,600
Then it's done.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
But it suddenly stopped selling.

117
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,640
Do you have any?

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
No.

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,360
This can't be.

120
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,800
My aunt's cousin

121
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,280
married a minister.

122
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,240
Her coughs and asthma

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,640
was cured by this medicine.

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
It was also given by a doctor from Xiliang.

125
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,280
I thought it was you.

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Who told you I can cure asthma?

127
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,040
Dr. Gas, we don't mean anything else.

128
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,440
I just want to ask

129
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,520
if you have thorn apple pollen.

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,520
I heard it's good for breathing.

131
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,280
My sister needs it urgently.

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,960
I heard that

133
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,640
it has other effects.

134
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know.

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
If you want medicine, go to the pharmacy.

136
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
In my opinion,

137
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,960
you don't have asthma.

138
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,560
Don't waste my time.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,920
Let's go.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
I don't have one?

141
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm really sorry.

142
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,440
Let's go.

143
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,440
What's going on?

144
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
He said I'm not sick.

145
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,240
We just asked

146
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,440
the thorn apple pollen

147
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,840
was invited out.

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
It means he knows it.

149
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,840
In my opinion,

150
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,800
take him back to the Ministry of Justice for trial.

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,680
Or you can bring someone in and search.

152
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,960
This is not about the Ministry of Justice.

153
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Go back first.

154
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll keep an eye on him.

155
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,920
Or change the question.

156
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,120
Let me think.

157
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Ruofei, let's go back first.

158
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,840
Trust Brother Changhao.

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,120
Let's go.

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,200
You are really here.

161
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,240
Qiu Changhao,

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
If you can bring down the Supreme Court,

163
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,800
you'll be atoning for

164
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
for my 32 family.

165
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,480
You keep calling me brother Zhanghao.

166
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,640
Qiu Changhao, are you blind?

167
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I can’t tell that Miss Gu likes you.

168
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
But how can I

169
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
be a professional woman?

170
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
This is too difficult.

171
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,120
Should I put on some makeup before I go?

172
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,240
Put on a high nose.

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,200
and make an anti-fan base.

174
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,760
People from Xiliang.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
What are you doing here?

176
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,520
It's like dried fish.

177
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,200
Wait.

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,000
She looks like someone from Xiliang.

179
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Hi, sister-in-law.

180
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm just passing by.

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,480
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Yes.

183
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
There's something I can't say.

184
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,880
Why don't you chat with me?

185
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,200
I'll say yes reluctantly.

186
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,000
Please.

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

188
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
There's a suspicious person

189
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,920
asked Gas for thorn pollen.

190
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,440
Who is she?

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
A woman.

192
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,360
looks heroic.

193
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
Then he brought a woman.

194
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,920
She seems to have dementia.

195
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,120
Okay, you can go.

196
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Keep an eye on him.

197
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,280
Report to me if anything happens.

198
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,960
Yes, my lord.

199
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,160
What can I do for you?

200
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Send some men to keep an eye on him.

201
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,520
If anyone asks about thorn pollen again,

202
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,440
just get rid of Gas.

203
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,160
I heard from Changhao that

204
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,240
you've always wanted to take over Hengyu, right?

205
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,440
I...

206
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Yes, Hengyu is quite pitiful.

207
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,120
I always wanted to take good care of him.

208
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,640
After all, he's the only descendant of our family.

209
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,320
I don’t want someone to lead him astray.

210
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,960
Do you really want

211
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
have your own baby?

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,280
If it weren't for Changren,

213
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,920
we would have left behind the Qiu family.

214
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,720
Changren.

215
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,320
Changren likes to play walnuts, right?

216
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,480
and bugs.

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
Those are his

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,560
his hobby.

219
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,800
Sister-in-law

220
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
But Madam's hobby

221
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,280
is having children.

222
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,360
If you can get pregnant,

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
you'll be Madam's grandson.

224
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
Hengyu has a companion now.

225
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,960
Then you must

226
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,360
you must walk horizontally.

227
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes, it's right. It's right. It's right.

228
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,880
I heard that

229
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,520
there is a thing called Dozi Pill.

230
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,280
Two at a time.

231
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
Multi-meatballs.

232
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
Really?

233
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,880
Because

234
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,040
there is something called

235
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,080
is called thorn apple pollen.

236
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,680
If the flower has seeds,

237
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
There are many of them.

238
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
So when people eat it,

239
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,000
after eating it.

240
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,080
Yes.

241
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
You have a point.

242
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,000
What broken gong?

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,680
thorn apple pollen.

244
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,320
But

245
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,320
it's only made in Xiliang.

246
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,040
It's difficult.

247
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,440
And it's expensive.

248
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Ordinary people can't get it.

249
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,760
It's expensive.

250
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm not short of money.

251
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,160
My family has two counties.

252
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,000
Just tell me.

253
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,000
Where can I buy it? Where can I buy it?

254
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,920
It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me.

255
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,520
Who is it?

256
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,680
Doctor, I'm here to see a doctor.

257
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,760
Please come early tomorrow.

258
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,120
No, I can't tell anyone about my illness.

259
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
Please make an exception.

260
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,040
Come in.

261
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,240
Thank you.

262
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,280
Your wife is sick.

263
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Are you from Western Liang?

264
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Yes, I am from Western Liang.

265
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,360
Doctor, here is the thing.

266
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,200
I'll come to Fengcheng.

267
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,520
for two years.

268
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,600
I just want a baby.

269
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,920
But I couldn't get pregnant.

270
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,640
I've seen many hospitals but they're useless.

271
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
I heard that

272
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
your medical skills are excellent.

273
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,080
Let me check your pulse.

274
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,440
From the pulse,

275
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
there's no problem.

276
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,680
The internal heat is weak, but it doesn't matter.

277
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,920
She can't get pregnant.

278
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
Doctor.

279
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
Do you have extra meatballs?

280
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,680
Multiple Pill.

281
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,280
It's the kind of medicine that gives birth a lot.

282
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,360
It's for animals.

283
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,400
It's not an animal.

284
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
It's that...

285
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,880
steamed bun, carrot and pollen.

286
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,080
Do you have steamed bun, carrot and pollen?

287
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
thorn apple pollen.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,960
Yes.

289
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,720
This is it.

290
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,520
You have it, right?

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,680
My goodness.

292
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,280
Let's go.

293
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,160
Let's go.

294
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,280
This way.

295
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,040
Here

296
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,840
This way.

297
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,520
Listen to me.

298
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
Stay back!

299
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,360
I'm good.

300
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Go!

301
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,600
Don't come over!

302
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,520
I haven't given birth yet.

303
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,680
Who will affect me?

304
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:38,960
I...

305
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,320
I'll kill you all!

306
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,320
Who are you?

307
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Don't be afraid.

308
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm Qiu Changhao, Deputy Minister of Justice.

309
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Come with me.

310
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,400
Let's go! Let's go!

311
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,760
Useless!

312
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,600
Useless losers.

313
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,640
Did you see who saved him?

314
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,840
My lord, the rescuer is too fast.

315
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,400
We didn't see it clearly.

316
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,440
Go ahead.

317
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,319
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,440
Find him!

319
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
Even if you turn the city upside down,

320
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,720
find him.

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,079
Yes, sir.

322
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,839
Wait.

323
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,280
What can I do for you?

324
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,400
This child

325
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,360
knows too much.

326
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,480
I understand.

327
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,800
The masked man who tried to kill me

328
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,360
was working for Lord Zhang.

329
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,440
How did you know?

330
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,160
You opened his veil.

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
I know him.

332
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,600
Why did he kill you?

333
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,240
Maybe because of thorn apple pollen.

334
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
thorn pollen.

335
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,160
