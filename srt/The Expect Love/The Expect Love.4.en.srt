1
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Mother

2
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,720
This is braised pork specially made for you in the kitchen

3
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,360
Try it

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,039
It's been so many years.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,039
I only like this one.

6
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,720
Wait a minute.

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,600
You can't eat it. You can't eat it.

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,000
One hundred grams of braised pork.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,680
is about 529 calories.

10
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,960
It's about a bowl of rice.

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,800
It takes 30 minutes to run.

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,039
No, you can't eat it.

13
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,400
What are you talking about?

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,360
Mother.

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Have some vegetarian meat.

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,880
I like meat.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
Madam, I can't.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,920
It's bad for the cardiovascular and blood vessels.

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,880
Especially for middle-aged people like you.

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,560
Be careful. Be careful.

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
Talk to her. Okay. Okay.

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,200
Du Ruofei.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,560
Your husband is very busy.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,040
As his wife,

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
be more considerate.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,880
About that

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,560
in that aspect.

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,760
Don't let him work too hard.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,520
Do you understand?

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Your son is young and young.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,160
Especially when it comes to

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
a young and beautiful wife like me.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
I think he's very willing to work.

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,040
Right?

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,360
And it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.

36
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,840
Confucius said

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,120
"A man and a woman should eat the food." "A man and a woman should eat the food."

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
[A man's greatest desire to exist.]

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,800
It's normal

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,840
is normal.

41
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,280
You shouldn't always talk about the bride.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,080
Sister-in-law.

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,640
It's only been a few days.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,440
How could you talk to your mother like that?

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Well, I'm right.

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,760
Hello, ma'am.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Song Quan, what is it?

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
I have something to report to you.

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,079
Mother.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,079
I'll be right back.

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,280
Bye.

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,000
Sir.

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,920
I found the owner of the handkerchief.

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
As you said,

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
is the spy's lover.

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Let's go.

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,160
That's enough.

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,200
She's gone.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,360
Mother.

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,079
Let's continue eating.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
You can still eat?

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm full.

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,960
Du Ruofei.

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,920
You were backing me up

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,840
to support you.

66
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
How dare you talk back to your mother?

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,160
Kowtow and apologize.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,720
Kowtow?

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,960
We're not giving red packets during Chinese New Year.

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
As a wife,

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,560
is to be reasonable.

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,960
Besides, in name,

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,720
you're not Second Brother's legal wife.

74
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,480
Why would our family

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,200
marry a small family like you?

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,440
That's why I want to continue the marriage.

77
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,720
No.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
In your mouth,

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,320
in your mouth.

80
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,480
and a string on the right.

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
You're pointing at me.

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Who is it?

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,200
Du Ruofei.

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,560
Don't compare yourself to your mother.

85
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Although she's a sequel,

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,760
She was not as good as you before.

87
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
But mother is different.

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,760
Mother is on the right side now.

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,600
Don't pull me.

90
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,880
Mother.

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,720
That's not what I meant.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,960
Du Ruofei.

93
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
It's your fault.

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Kowtow and apologize.

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,320
No.

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,520
Are you out of your mind?

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you blaming me again?

98
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Why do you kowtow to me?

99
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
Qi Wan,

100
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
you are a woman.

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,520
How can you build an old society?

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,760
in the old society?

103
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
are so deep-rooted.

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,880
We can solve the problem.

105
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,880
We respect him as his elder.

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,080
But he always kowtows and apologizes.

107
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,280
Is this courtesy

108
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,040
This is called slave. This is oppression.

109
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,720
Change it.

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,640
Why can't I understand

111
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,240
what you said?

112
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,080
Changren.

113
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,920
Do you think I understand?

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
All right.

115
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
You two are useless.

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,560
Du Ruofei.

117
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,360
You're now the daughter-in-law of the Qiu family.

118
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Can you stop mentioning the past?

119
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,320
Yes.

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,760
Don't mention it again.

121
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,080
You have to follow the rules in the future.

122
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,720
Wan'er.

123
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,280
Take her to the Ancient Hall.

124
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,920
Yes.

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Taigu Tang

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
You still have Sanli Village here.

127
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,320
Go in.

128
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,200
This...

129
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,560
Is this the ancient hall you mentioned?

130
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,280
Yes.

131
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,320
Get on your knees.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,640
On your knees. On your knees.

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
Of course.

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
This is not a mother.

135
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,080
but our ancestors.

136
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,320
If you are a good wife,

137
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,480
you can put your memorial tablet on it.

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,240
Now kneel and reflect on your mistakes.

139
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,280
No.

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,800
No.

141
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Explain yourself.

142
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Lock the door!

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Do you have humanity?

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
Why is this

145
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
It's creepy.

146
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,320
Is something coming out?

147
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,159
There are so many ancestors in this family.

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,480
They don't mind standing in a row

149
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,120
They even put me up.

150
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,840
I don't want to do that. I don't want to.

151
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,360
Oh my god.

152
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Is there a ghost here?

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,520
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,480
It's all my fault.

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,200
It's all my fault.

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,920
It's my fault.

158
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,560
Don't scare me.

159
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,120
Don't scare me.

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
I said something wrong.

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,200
Don't scare me.

162
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,120
Don't scare me. Don't scare me.

163
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,440
Who are you?

164
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,240
No.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,680
Can you tell me

166
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
how you got in?

167
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,880
Look.

168
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,920
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

169
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,080
Kid.

170
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,680
I was caught by bad guys.

171
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,160
You must be a man.

172
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,080
You want to help the righteous side, right?

173
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,280
Tell me.

174
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
How did you get in here?

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
What do you mean?

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Hey, kid.

177
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,360
Where are you going?

178
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,320
Where are you going? Come back!

179
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
There's a hole here.

180
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,560
I...

181
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,280
I...

182
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,440
I can't get in.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Oh no

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
Oh no.

185
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
We finally met a living person.

186
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,920
but he ran away.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
What should we do?

188
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,520
Who is it?

189
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,400
What's that sound?

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,760
Who's outside?

191
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
You really opened the door.

192
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
You're really my little ancestor.

193
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,760
Thank you.

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,080
Goodbye, guys.

195
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,080
Why didn't you eat?

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Don't think I don't know

197
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,880
you poisoned the food.

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Is it still poisonous?

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,120
Even if it's not poisonous,

200
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,160
I won't eat it.

201
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
I'd rather starve to death.

202
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
But if you die,

203
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
what about Miss Xiao Lian?

204
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,520
Xiao Lian!

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,480
You...

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,840
Don't do anything stupid.

207
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll take the responsibility.

208
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,800
This has nothing to do with Xiao Lian.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,480
I can't do anything

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
I can't do it.

211
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,120
I know

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,360
you wanted to raise money to redeem Miss Xiao Lian.

213
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,160
so you had no choice but to be a spy.

214
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Xiao Lian asked me to give you this letter.

215
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,880
I admire you.

216
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
You're a loyal man.

217
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
If you can cooperate with me,

218
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,680
I'll transfer Xiao Lian

219
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
to a safe place.

220
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,880
Xiao Lian promised you

221
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
to wait for you to get out of here.

222
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,440
My lord. What are you doing here?

223
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,720
Tell me.

224
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,080
What do you want me to do?

225
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,800
It's simple.

226
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
Tell me how many spies you have.

227
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,040
What's your purpose?

228
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Who is your leader?

229
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,200
And what's your contact code?

230
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
People like us who work for others

231
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,680
just to make people

232
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
to live a good life.

233
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,880
Fine.

234
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
Sir, let me tell you.

235
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
I don't know how many people we have.

236
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,280
I don't know where they are.

237
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,760
I don't know

238
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
I don't know.

239
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
What do you know?

240
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,840
Our secret code is a poem.

241
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,080
What poem?

242
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,080
When an expert makes a move,

243
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,200
we'll know if there is.

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
Is this a poem?

245
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,040
Of course it's called poem.

246
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
It's so luxurious.

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,160
Okay.

248
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,400
My lord.

249
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
You can't break your promise.

250
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
I will keep my promise

251
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,200
I will keep my promise.

252
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,240
Who is it? It's me.

253
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,200
Catch the thief!

254
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,920
If he catches me,

255
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,960
I will be killed by a broom.

256
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,600
The best strategy is to leave.

257
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,160
Let's go first.

258
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,760
Du Ruofei.

259
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
You're amazing.

260
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,160
You can even climb a wall.

261
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
What else can't you do?

262
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,880
At night,

263
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm here at night.

264
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,880
Who are you?

265
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
What are you doing on the wall in the middle of the night?

266
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,480
It doesn't matter who I am.

267
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,680
It's cool on your wall.

268
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,080
I came up to get some air.

269
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
I thought it was a night minister.

270
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,200
Wait a minute.

271
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,400
The minister at night?

272
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
the one

273
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,840
who always wears black?

274
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,560
And he walks fast.

275
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,240
Yes.

276
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,360
You met him?

277
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,360
I saw him.

278
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,200
He went that way.

279
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,160
A dark shadow.

280
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,880
Take a look.

281
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040
Okay, thank you.

282
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,200
You're welcome.

283
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
But how can I get down?

284
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,400
Should I jump

285
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,920
or jump?

286
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,480
Let's go down first.

287
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
I...

288
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,320
Stop shouting.

289
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,360
Why is it different

290
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,040
in idol drama?

291
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
This is so awkward.

292
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
What are you doing?

293
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,960
This...

294
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,480
I'll pick you up from work.

295
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,560
Come pick me up like this.

296
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
Something happened.

297
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,640
you picked me up.

298
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,800
But it's not a big problem.

299
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,440
No.

300
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,120
The plot is progressing too slowly.

301
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,800
I have to find a way

302
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,360
to tell him I love you as soon as possible.

303
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,760
Go home.

304
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I sprained my ankle.

305
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
It hurts.

306
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
Let me see which foot.

307
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,840
Is it here?

308
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,120
It hurts.

309
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,320
And I haven't eaten yet.

310
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm hungry.

311
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
Do you not like the food?

312
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,160
Did your old lady trick you to the ancestral hall again?

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,640
Did you say something they don't understand again?

314
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,400
Probably.

315
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,600
Mother is not a mean person. She's not a mean person.

316
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,600
I hope

317
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,760
try not to upset her.

318
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,920
I don't think I'm asking for it.

319
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,960
Okay.

320
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,600
Let's go. Let's go.

321
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,440
It hurts.

322
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,280
It hurts.

323
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,880
Gosh.

324
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,520
I've been single for so many years.

325
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,120
I've never been hugged by a princess.

326
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,920
Long Yue.

327
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,000
Sister-in-law.

328
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,080
Where are you going?

329
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,200
Where are you going?

330
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
From the Tang Dynasty to the west.

331
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,440
Ruofei.

332
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,880
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,120
I'm taking my husband home.

334
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,560
Afu.

335
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,280
Please go to the main hall.

336
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,920
Okay.

337
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,440
Why did she go to the main hall?

338
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,240
Long Yue.

339
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,840
Sister-in-law spoke rudely at dinner today.

340
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
Mother punished her to reflect on her mistakes.

341
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,080
But she came out without permission.

342
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,120
I didn't.

343
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,560
I'm just hungry.

344
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,680
I came out to get some food.

345
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
She hurt her leg.

346
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,640
Maybe another day.

347
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,880
But brother,

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,520
Mother is still waiting in the main hall.

349
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Should I go there?

350
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,920
I'll go with you.

351
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,920
Okay.

352
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,880
There has never been

353
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,760
in our family.

354
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,440
It's fine if he has no manners at the banquet.

355
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
How dare you

356
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,800
are still so presumptuous.

357
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,160
According to the family rules,

358
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
must be punished severely.

359
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,960
Why am I so unlucky in my dream?

360
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,400
I should be the most miserable heroine in the dream.

361
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,760
How can I let Qiu Changhao say I love you?

362
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,840
I don't have to suffer here.

363
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Mother,

364
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
If Ruofei said something wrong,

365
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,120
I apologize to you for her.

366
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
She's just married.

367
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,920
She doesn't know many rules.

368
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,520
Because she's your newly married wife,

369
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
I punished her to reflect on her mistakes.

370
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,560
But she ran away.

371
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,080
I didn't want to.

372
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
I'm just hungry, so I came out to get some food.

373
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,200
Look at her.

374
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,839
She's still talking. She's still here. She's here. She's here.

375
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,760
Come here! Hurry up! Hurry up!

376
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,319
Mother.

377
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,880
Tomorrow is the day of peace.

378
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,480
If outsiders find out that your new wife's foot is injured,

379
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,720
if they find out

380
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm afraid it'll ruin the reputation of the Qiu family.

381
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,920
Mother, please think twice.

382
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,599
Mrs. Cheng.

383
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,040
You’d better tell her

384
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,760
You'd better tell her

385
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
If she does it again,

386
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,160
I'll punish her to kneel for ten days.

387
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,960
Thank you for your forgiveness.

388
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,280
I apologize on behalf of Ruofei.

389
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,600
No.

390
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,480
He knelt down and pleaded for me.
