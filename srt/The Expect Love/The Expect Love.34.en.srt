1
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,960
She's over there.

2
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,640
Isn't that a man?

3
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
Jin Shu has a mole on her right face.

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,240
Many people have a mole.

5
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,120
Wait a minute.

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
You remember clearly.

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,880
Do you know where I have a mole?

8
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm asking you.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,840
We're going to lose him.

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,240
Let's go. I'm asking you.

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,040
Who are you looking for?

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
Please inform Lord Ning Jiening.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,560
I have something important to see you.

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,600
Do you have an appointment?

15
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,199
Give this to him.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,440
He'll see.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,480
Wait here.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
What is she doing in the Supreme Court?

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,120
Report you.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,720
I should go to the Censorate.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
She must be in the Supreme Court.

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,360
Who could it be?

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Let's go. Okay.

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,600
Let’s go.

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Mr. Xun.

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,560
Is that person looking for you?

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
She's looking for Lord Ning? Yes.

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,960
Let's go. Let's go.

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,280
Let's go. Let's go.

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,720
It's here. It's here.

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
Is it really Ningji?

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,320
I never thought

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,120
Jin Shu has something to do with Ningji

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,160
She pointed her name to Ning Ji

36
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,040
Ningji must be her contact

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,640
So Ning Ji

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,960
for another purpose

39
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,560
Of course.

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,480
Do you think he'll treat you as a friend for no reason?

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Does he

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
he wants to learn about your case through me

43
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Ever since Mo Chou told me

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,360
the secret letter from Ningji

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,720
I've been suspecting him.

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,440
But he just became the minister of the Supreme Court.

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,079
How is it related to the Liang family case?

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,560
Who is he working for?

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,960
The Censor's Office, the Politician's Office

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,840
and the Ministry of Revenue

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,120
It's clear that

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,760
has started to attack us.

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,280
There's no need to beat around the bush.

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,600
to steal my detective diary.

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,040
Unless

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,960
They're not on the same side. They're on the same side. Let's go. Let's go.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
A few years ago,

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,680
Ningji came to the royal agent's office

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,240
with the recommendation letter from the Marquis Mansion.

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Later, I came to the Supreme Court

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
to the Supreme Court.

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,160
It's very simple.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,120
No background at all.

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,040
Now that I think about it,

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
I didn't know Lord Ning's residence

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,080
After he was promoted,

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
he didn't move out.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
What does he want my detective diary for?

69
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,360
Jin Shu must have seen him.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,760
It must be him.

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Zhanghao,

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,240
If you think Ningji is so important,

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,840
I'll go back to the Supreme Court.

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,480
No need.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,040
He'll come out by himself.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
He might be the last one.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,240
related to the Liang Mansion case.

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,680
If Jin Shu really gave the diary to Ningji,

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,480
Ningji will definitely kill Lord Li tonight.

80
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,760
As for whether it's him or not,

81
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Let's wait and see. Okay.

82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,880
Changhao.

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,159
Do you think Jin Shu will come back today?

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
If her purpose is the investigation diary,

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,159
she wouldn't have come back.

86
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,960
Then...

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
What if she comes back?

88
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,360
She's back?

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,600
That means she has ulterior motives.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,280
Honey.

91
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
You're here too.

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
Let me help you.

93
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
It's okay.

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,120
I really don't know Fengcheng well.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,920
I've been looking for a clinic for a long time.

96
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
But the doctor said he's fine.

97
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
Just eat something good.

98
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,000
Jin Shu.

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,640
I didn't take good care of you.

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,880
and let you go to the hospital alone.

101
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
I said

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
with my husband.

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
I bought a lot of food.

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,520
Let me help you.

105
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,159
Sister.

106
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Why don't you join us?

107
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,440
I...

108
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,880
Ruofei.

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
You may leave.

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,920
Okay.

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,960
Dear.

112
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
Looking back,

113
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
I was wrong.

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,080
I shouldn't have let people talk about me.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,040
[I shouldn't have ignored the fact that you were hurt by the public.]

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,280
even if I write a letter,

117
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm sure

118
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
you won't ignore me.

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,159
I was narrow-minded.

120
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,360
I'll drink a cup of wine for you.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So today,

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,600
to serve my wife.

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,760
to serve my husband to sleep.

124
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
If you have work to do,

125
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,400
I'll put it on my ear.

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,720
Shots off and grind ink

127
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,800
To serve you

128
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
No matter what happens,

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,920
I'm not leaving.

130
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,480
Don't you want to drink?

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
We don't know whether Jin Shu is a friend or foe.

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
She brought the food and wine back.

133
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Even if she drank, it doesn't mean anything.

134
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,760
Maybe she already took the antidote.

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,560
I don't want to drink it.

136
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,440
Wait.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
What does this mean?

138
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
What's your relationship with Ningji?

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,040
Since you've got the diary

140
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,800
and gave it to Ningji,

141
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,480
Why did you come back?

142
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,840
I don't know what you're talking about, honey.

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
You stole the diary.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
and went to the hospital to get medicine.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
That suit suits you well.

146
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,840
Honey.

147
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,080
Why am I wearing a man's dress?

148
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
You must be mistaken.

149
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,159
I don't think the guards of the Supreme Court are mistaken.

150
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll go find him now

151
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,560
to see if he can recognize you.

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,520
No need.

153
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,960
It's me.

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Since you know,

155
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I won't hide it from you anymore.

156
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,800
Back then,

157
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
I left with Jilang willingly.

158
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,800
We love each other.

159
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,440
Get to the point.

160
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
What does Ningji want to do?

161
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,800
Since young, we moved to the Imperial City.

162
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
Before Father conferred the title of Marquis,

163
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
I knew Ning Ji.

164
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,240
He is modest and elegant.

165
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,680
We fell in love at first sight.

166
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,160
He dotes on me a lot.

167
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
I look forward to it.

168
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,360
When you get married,

169
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,720
I'll marry you. I'll marry you. I'll marry you. I'll marry you. I'll marry you.

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,640
[But...]

171
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,280
Liang Mansion was murdered.

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
and let his whole family be executed.

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
You mean Ning Ji is the descendant of Liang family?

174
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
He was hidden by the firewood workers

175
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,920
That's how he survived.

176
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,880
That's why I'm here.

177
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,080
[named Ning Ji.]

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,960
His real name

179
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,920
Liang Chen.

180
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,280
Liang Chen.

181
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,440
[I understand.]

182
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
He wants revenge.

183
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
He took me away from picking me up.

184
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,400
and took care of me.

185
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,920
If you hadn't reversed the case for your brother,

186
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,240
he always thought

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,280
it was Qiu who framed the Liang family.

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,760
I should thank you.

189
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,560
for letting Liang Chen find the target.

190
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,800
Ningji?

191
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
Did he go to Li Residence? Yes.

192
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,960
My lord.

193
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,240
Please stay.

194
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Let's wait for the result.

195
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,920
Ruofei.

196
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,880
It's here. It's here.

197
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,840
Look! Look! Look! Look!

198
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,880
Look for him. Look for him.

199
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,680
Ningji

200
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
What's wrong?

201
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
Don't scare me

202
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,240
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,280
What's wrong?

204
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,320
Let me see.

205
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,240
Your lips are white.

206
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,120
You're hurting your breath.

207
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,120
No, you are poisoned.

208
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,160
I'll get the antidote from her.

209
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
I knew it was you.

210
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
Give me the antidote!

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,080
Give me the antidote!

212
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,320
There's no antidote!

213
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,840
There is no antidote.

214
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
There is no antidote.

215
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,560
Where is the antidote?

216
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,640
Give me the antidote!

217
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,240
Give it to me!

218
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,480
Don't waste your energy.

219
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you.

220
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,120
You...

221
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
You're poisoned too.

222
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Are you crazy?

223
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,960
Do you want to die?

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Fine.

225
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,640
I'm a student.

226
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,640
I believe I can cure it.

227
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,160
It's not poisonous.

228
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
How could it be?

229
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,280
Why?

230
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,760
Tell me.

231
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Where did you hide the antidote?

232
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
Where did you hide it? Tell me.

233
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,080
Let me tell you.

234
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,960
There is no antidote at all.

235
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,600
No.

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Did you bring anything else? Yes, I did. I brought some food and drinks. I brought some food and drinks. I brought some for you.

237
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,760
You brought it? Yes.

238
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,920
This smell...

239
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,680
It's so familiar

240
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,520
It smells like smoke. It smells like smoke.

241
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,000
This is...

242
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,240
Creep.

243
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,840
No way.

244
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,560
You're crazy. You're crazy.

245
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,000
Move! Move! Move!

246
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,760
Hang in there.

247
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,440
I'll take you to detoxify the poison.

248
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,000
Chuntou.

249
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840
Come on. Come on.

250
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,440
Move! Move! Move!

251
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,480
You're like this. You're like this.

252
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
Are you feeling better? Yes.

253
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,360
Changhao.

254
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,520
Feel it.

255
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,040
You'll feel better this way.

256
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,480
Are you feeling better?

257
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,720
Much better.

258
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,360
Let me have a look.

259
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Let me add some warm water for you.

260
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,280
Is it hot?

261
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,480
Let's go. Let's go. Okay.

262
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,160
Okay.

263
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,160
It's not hot enough.

264
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,280
No.

265
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,960
You're sweating too slowly.

266
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,200
I need ginger slices.

267
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,200
Raise your hand.

268
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,120
Let me tell you.

269
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,760
It worked. It worked.

270
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,920
When I went to the foot massage room,

271
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,520
when I went to the soccer clinic,

272
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
they rubbed me with this.

273
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
It's sweating fast.

274
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Amazing.

275
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,960
This can make you sweat quickly.

276
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,040
When you sweat,

277
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,200
your poison will spread faster.

278
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,840
If your poison spreads faster,

279
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,280
I'll be very happy.

280
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Feel it.

281
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,560
It should be very useful.

282
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Do you feel better now?

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,760
You...

284
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,080
I didn't want to kill Qiu Changhao.

285
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,840
I know.

286
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960
I know you suspect me.

287
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,080
Then why did you come back?

288
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,320
I must come back.

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
I must stall Qiu Changhao.

290
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,119
I can't let him ruin Jilang's plan.

291
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,880
If he doesn't avenge his family,

292
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,760
he won't be willing

293
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,160
to live a peaceful life with me?

294
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
What is your plan?

295
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,560
to poison you to faint?

296
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
Aren't you afraid that you won't be able to get out?

297
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,160
I'm not afraid.

298
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,000
You and Qiu Changhao

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,240
won't kill anyone easily.

300
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
If I'm right,

301
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,760
you used hemp oil

302
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
because you didn't want to kill anyone.

303
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,280
You actually

304
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
hate Changhao,

305
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,400
right?

306
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Jilang

307
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,480
has been avenged.

308
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,480
As long as you are here,

309
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,520
I'll do everything I can.

310
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
You're so silly, Jin Shu.

311
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,160
There's more than one murderer.

312
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,960
The diary you showed Ningji

313
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
was actually made by us

314
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,160
It's fake.

315
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,680
Of course it's fake

316
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,760
We just want to help Ningji

317
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,720
If you don't go,

318
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,400
it'll be too late.

319
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,760
Will you

320
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,440
are willing to help me.

321
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,200
Do you think Changhao and I are not trustworthy?

322
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,480
Fine.

323
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
We'll do it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
