1
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,039
Lord Zhang pointed out Lord Liang before he died

2
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,039
There are only few cases

3
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,240
in the Ministry of Punishments.

4
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,840
I searched it more than once.

5
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,960
but nothing was wrong.

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,400
Then only the records

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
and the Court of Judicial Review.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,920
Logically speaking,

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
the Liang family's embezzlement of disaster relief money

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,560
is a big case.

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
How can the Ministry of Punishments not have a case?

12
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,560
Maybe it's because the case is big,

13
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,800
because of the big case.

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
to supervise it directly.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,080
No.

16
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,320
The Court of Judicial Review should have the document.

17
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,520
Yes.

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,320
If the Court of Judicial Review doesn't have it, then it means there's something wrong. There's nothing wrong.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,560
there must be something wrong.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,800
That's easy.

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
Gu Mochou is here

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,160
No.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
We don't know yet

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,880
We can't let Mo Chou get into trouble.

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,280
Besides, Ning Ji is the minister of the Supreme Court.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,640
We can't avoid him.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
You have to investigate.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Let me do it.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
It's inappropriate.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
Who am I?

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm the prince who enjoys himself.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
I suddenly want to investigate

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
a big case five years ago.

34
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,760
people would think

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
it's either my uncle

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,760
or

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,560
It's the first time I'm drunk. Let's go. Let's go.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Okay.

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,840
Think about it.

40
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm going home.

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
Why are you leaving so soon?

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
You're late and leaving early.

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm going to visit my uncle

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
to complain about you.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm worried about Ruofei.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,960
Is it better this way?

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,360
Get lost.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
I remember now.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,840
You must tell Changle

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
to Changle.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
Don’t let her continue.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,600
You're the Deputy Minister of Punishments, not the Chief of Internal Affairs.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
You don't understand women.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Let me ask you something.

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,079
Sit down.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,760
It’s about

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
As for Changle,

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,720
she has to work at night.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,920
Because without me,

60
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,960
Qiu Changle might

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,160
something wrong.

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,560
So,

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,640
I want to ask Du Ruofei.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,640
I don't know much about stomachache.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,600
I used to think of her as a spy.

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,320
It's all because of you.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
I found that I wronged her.

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I already apologized to her.

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
but she doesn't appreciate my kindness.

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,120
What should I do?

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
Does she know

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
she's a spy?

73
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,560
I don't think so.

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,800
That's it.

75
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,480
It's all because of your guilt

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,600
and your guilt.

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,160
Actually, I'm fine.

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,560
You just need to

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
your guilt.

80
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,560
and be nice to her.

81
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,840
What should I do?

82
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,280
Yes, how can I be nice to her?

83
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,720
It's hard.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,160
Whose book dropped on the floor?

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,720
This book

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,959
All men in the city have one.

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,880
I'll leave this with you.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,880
Your life is not over yet.

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,800
Zhanghao, people who argue

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,440
don't deserve love.

91
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,760
Take a good look.

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,560
If you need a concubine in the future,

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Who told you that?

94
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,159
So I didn't

95
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,159
pick it up for you.

96
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,159
I won't look at it.

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,360
I’m leaving.

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
About Changle,

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
about Changle.

100
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
I will find a way

101
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
the Supreme Court.

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,960
Talk more cheesy words to others.

103
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,880
and force them to give gifts.

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
Let's talk about stars.

105
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,160
and look at the moon.

106
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
We're married.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,680
Why do you want to date now?

108
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,320
Go.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,040
The iron tree is blossoming.

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,560
I trust you. You can do it.

111
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,040
Miss, are you feeling better?

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,920
Changhao applied it for me.

113
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:37,920
Much better.

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,320
Something is wrong.

115
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,520
Young Master, how do you know Granny Tang?

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,159
Why are you back?

117
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,200
Aren't you at work?

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,840
You must be hungry.

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
I bought you your favorite snack.

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you want to try it?

121
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll go get some.

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,360
Why are you back all of a sudden?

123
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
I want to care about you.

124
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,600
You're worried that I'll talk nonsense.

125
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
Does your stomach still hurt?

126
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,280
Much better.

127
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,040
Doctor Gas told me

128
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,840
ginger tea is good for relieving pain.

129
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,240
I'll get it for you.

130
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,600
No need.

131
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Chun Ying has cooked it for me.

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,880
You weren't like this before.

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Was your image as a straight man

134
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,520
are all fake?

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,560
Straightforward.

136
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Confucius said, "Revenge your grievance with a straight answer."

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,360
I did have doubts before.

138
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,560
So...

139
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
Okay, I'm unlucky.

140
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
It's a waste of time.

141
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,040
But don't worry.

142
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,040
I won't threaten you with this.

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
About you and Jiang Lanting,

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
is not a big deal.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,320
I just hope

146
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
you can find someone you love

147
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,200
and confess to him sincerely.

148
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,960
I'll be your witness.

149
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
Then I can leave in peace.

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,320
About me and Kang Lanting.

151
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,080
Go back. Where are you going?

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,360
I'll teach you how to say it.

153
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
Talk carefully.

154
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
I'll think about it.

155
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Think about it.

156
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,800
I have something for you.

157
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,280
My lady.

158
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,880
Your Excellency, why are you

159
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,280
something is wrong with Matsuquan.

160
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,640
I think so too. It's really creepy.

161
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,880
Can you make some sound when you walk?

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,800
Okay.

163
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,200
You want it? Yes.

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
What I want?

165
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Isn't this the hairpin I want?

166
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Chun Ying.

167
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,480
Put it on for me.

168
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Is it nice?

169
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,520
Nice. Nice.

170
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,560
It’s better than a straight man.

171
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,080
I heard from Qiu Changle

172
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,200
this is your favorite.

173
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,160
I bought it for you.

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,680
It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice.

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
It's a nice day.

176
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,400
Let's go see the moon together

177
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,520
Now?

178
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,280
It's not dark yet.

179
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

180
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,240
Come on.

181
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
It's scary.

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,400
Are you practicing?

183
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,360
Are you enjoying the moon?

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,280
Watching the moon?

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,520
All right, stop accompanying me.

186
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,600
Get back to work.

187
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,120
Look how sad you are. Me too.

188
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,720
How? Let me help you.

189
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
You can't help me.

190
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,600
We don't even have toiletries.

191
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
According to Jiang Lanting’s method,

192
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
it doesn't work.

193
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,200
It's troublesome to have no sanitary products.

194
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
You can't even take a step.

195
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,960
I need to think of a way.

196
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,760
Lord Ning.

197
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,680
What's the matter?

199
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
Lord Zhang died in the Ministry of Justice.

200
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,400
I was ordered to check some details.

201
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,800
My lord is having a meeting in the study.

202
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,720
Please wait.

203
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,640
I'll get the interrogation records ready.

204
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Okay. Thank you.

205
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,000
I've checked it.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
Liang Mansion case is not in the Supreme Court.

207
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,760
There must be something fishy about this case.

208
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,040
My brother's death must be related to Liang Mansion's case.

209
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,040
What about Lord Zhang's death?

210
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,480
Let them know. Let them know.

211
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

212
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,160
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

213
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,080
I have a stomachache.

214
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
It must be an old illness.

215
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,920
I’ll visit you next time.

216
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,320
This interrogation record...

217
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,720
Thank you.

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,720
Here you are.

219
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
Miss.

220
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,080
Why did you buy these?

221
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,080
You'll need them in the future.

222
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
You'll know then.

223
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,560
But we came out

224
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,840
to buy something for Hengyu.

225
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,480
I've been shopping for over two hours

226
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,720
I couldn't find it.

227
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,520
Try it on.

228
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,000
Here you go. Here you go.

229
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,600
Here you go. Here you go.

230
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
I want some cakes.

231
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,280
Miss

232
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,720
Boss, give me more of this.

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,240
Okay.

234
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Come on. Come on.

235
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,200
Here you go.

236
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,840
Here you go.

237
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,760
Here you are.

238
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,520
Lord Ning.

239
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Mrs. Xun, what a coincidence.

240
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,400
Here.

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Here you go.

242
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Thank you.

243
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,480
We meet again.

244
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes.

245
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,520
Where is Mr. Xun?

246
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
He is in the Ministry of Justice.

247
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,640
I came out to buy snacks.

248
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,880
I didn't expect to see you here again.

249
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,040
Yeah.

250
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,560
We met here for the first time.

251
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,320
we met here.

252
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,760
Speaking of which, you helped me.

253
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,080
I haven't had time to thank you.

254
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,480
Are you free later?

255
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
I'll treat you to a meal.

256
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,320
Sure.

257
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
We can't let Her Ladyship invite us.

258
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,400
My mom said

259
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
You have to pay when you need to.

260
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,960
Don't spend money on men.

261
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,760
Chun Ying.

262
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,640
Take this and this

263
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,440
and this.

264
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,120
I'll go back by myself.

265
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,120
Miss,

266
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,840
Hurry up.

267
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't let Madam ask.

268
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,920
I know. Go ahead.

269
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:00,920
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

270
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:01,920
Come on.

271
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,680
Come on. Come on.

272
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,520
Come on.

273
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,720
Cheers.

274
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,480
A toast to you too.

275
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
Is there anything here?

276
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,320
But next time,

277
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,800
next time.

278
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
You're welcome.

279
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,320
It’s my honor

280
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
to meet you.

281
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,680
Don’t call me Mrs. Qiu.

282
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,960
Just call me Du Ruofei.

283
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:27,880
OK.

284
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,720
Mr. Xun is so lucky.

285
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
to marry a elegant

286
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,720
and generous wife like you.

287
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,880
I wish he could think like you.

288
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,560
It's a pity that he's not smart.

289
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,840
No way.

290
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,640
When I saw you two together last time,

291
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,760
when you were together.

292
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Not bad. Have some vegetables.

293
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,840
Okay.

294
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,720
You're so smart.

295
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,440
I’m sure you can help

296
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
in work.

297
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,800
Of course. Let me tell you.

298
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,360
I know a lot of things that I haven't used yet.

299
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,920
Can you tell me?

300
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,560
Let me tell you.

301
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,160
he was bothered

302
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,760
by an unknown poison.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,480
Let me help him with the test.

304
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,720
to test the poison.

305
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,400
Only then did I know there was something wrong with the medicine.

306
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
The food in this restaurant is really good.

307
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
Did you pack the food you didn't finish?

308
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,680
Miss, it's all packed.

309
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,480
By then,

310
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,160
You're so bold, madam.

311
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,600
That's right.

312
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I admire you. You're a lady. You're a lady.

313
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,120
Miss, isn't that...

314
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
Yes, that's Du Ruofei.

315
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,720
The one next to her.

316
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
Of course, she's a adulterer.

317
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,120
I knew this little fox

318
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
will be in trouble.

319
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,520
But this time I can take revenge.

320
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,160
Madam.

321
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,640
Cheers.

322
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,000
Bottoms up. Help yourself.

323
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,800
Try this. This dish is delicious.

324
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,960
Looks like I can learn a lot through her.

325
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,080
Mother, bad news!

326
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,440
Why are you yelling?

327
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,840
My heart suddenly...

328
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,520
Mother.

329
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,840
we might have to

330
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
be criticized again.

331
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,760
That's not necessary

332
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,880
My daughter-in-law is so embarrassed watching that scene.

333
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
So exciting.

334
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
I saw Du Ruofei

335
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,840
and a wild man

336
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,320
drinking, eating and drinking.

337
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,720
I can't stand it.

338
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,840
Really?

339
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

340
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,600
Mrs. Xun.

341
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,200
I had a great chat with you today.

342
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
I’ll treat you

343
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,840
to have a drink with Mr. Xun.

344
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,920
Sure, make an appointment anytime.

345
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
I’m leaving.

346
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Goodbye.

347
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
My lady. My lady.

348
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,320
What's wrong?

349
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,680
Miss.

350
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
Madam is looking for you.

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,600
Me? Why?

352
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,480
I don't know.

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,240
But it's definitely not a good thing.

354
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,760
I think so too. Go get Jang-ho.

355
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,000
Got it.

356
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

357
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,080
Okay.

358
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
Here's the thing.

359
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
Today, I happened to meet

360
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Lord Ning Jiening.

361
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
He beat up a gangster for me last time.

362
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,200
I said I'd buy him dinner.

363
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,920
I ran into him today.

364
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,880
We just had a drink.

365
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,480
That's it.

366
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Mother, am I right?

367
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,400
There was a man and drank.

368
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,000
Du Ruofei.

369
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
How dare you!

370
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
How dare you be so unruly!

371
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:04,880
I...

372
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,480
[I'm not your mother.] [I'm your mother.]

373
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,119
Although it's a feudal society,

374
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,839
this is a feudal society,

375
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,680
But do you have to

376
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,000
to be so upfront?

377
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm just having a meal and chatting with them.

378
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,520
Why do you

379
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,880
to you?

380
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,880
Say it again if you dare.

381
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720
Okay, I'll tell you again.

382
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,640
Well,

383
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,280
Although this place is

384
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,440
is a feudal society, right?

385
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,079
But

386
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,920
you don't have to

387
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
to be so upfront.

388
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,480
I just went to have a meal.

389
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,320
and chatted.

390
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,040
Why do you

391
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,360
become a disloyal woman?

392
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,880
Why not?

393
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,280
I saw it.

394
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,240
You talk happily and smile sweetly.

395
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Isn't eating happy?

396
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
Well,

397
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,360
I can't close my mouth when I smile.

398
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,000
Sorry

399
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,720
Is this what you should do

400
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,160
Is this what a daughter-in-law of the Xun family should do?

401
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,440
Should I, Hai?

402
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Shut up!

403
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:08,960
Hi Music
