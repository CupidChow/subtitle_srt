1
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:38,600
Here you are. Thank you.

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,080
Here you are.

3
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,400
Here you are. Here you are.

4
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:49,960
Have some water. Okay.

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,880
Have some water.

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,920
Give it to me. Give it to me.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,759
He's not thirsty.

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,440
Well...

9
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,920
Do you want to see the flowers?

10
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,120
Chun Ying.

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,760
Your eggs are not fresh.

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
I don’t want you to have diarrhoea.

13
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it.

14
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,920
What are you doing?

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
What are you doing?

16
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,000
Move! Move!

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,160
Here you go. Here you go.

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Come on. Have some water.

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Here you go.

20
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,560
Here you are.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,079
Le,

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,640
A young lady at your age

23
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,880
have children.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,320
They're all puppets.

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,640
Anyway,

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
there's no room for discussion.

27
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,680
You go to me every night.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,080
You're like a crazy girl.

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
He is the best at night.

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,800
I want to marry the best one.

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
She's a tough girl.

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,040
We have to find a way.

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Le.

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,880
Did you play with him again last night?

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,000
So what?

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,320
It's good.

37
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,040
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,440
How about this?

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,760
Take Xiaoye home

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,200
bring Xiaoya home.

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
How about we have dinner together?

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
He only eats midnight snacks.

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
Okay.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,280
I'll wait.

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,400
You just need to bring him back.

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,840
If I bring him back,

47
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,560
you won't force me to get married?

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,280
That's not true.

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,720
You have to be my son-in-law.

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
I have to.

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
I have to take a look.

52
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,080
What do you want?

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Can you stop forcing me?

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
If you keep pushing me, I'll...

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,560
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

56
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,760
elope with me.

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,360
Can you run away from your brother?

58
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,400
All right.

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,480
Le,

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,600
you are my precious daughter.

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,400
If you want to find a man,

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
should I

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,960
see what he looks like?

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,320
Fine.

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Do you know what he looks like?

66
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
Don't force me to get married.

67
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,400
Deal.

68
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,280
Let’s go. Let’s go.

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,080
Let's go. Let's go.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,240
It's good. It's good. It's good.

71
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
Does it work?

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,960
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,600
As long as she brings her back, I'll agree.

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,040
Mother.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,320
"Your Majesty, you're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the king of the king."

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right.

77
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,440
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

78
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,080
Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

79
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,840
Yes.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
Today, I've reported to the Censorate

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
to the Royal Censorate in accordance with the official documents.

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
and report to the Supreme Court and Ministry of Personnel.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,680
and release the posts to find out the identity of the assassin.

84
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
Make it public.

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,159
Song Quan.

86
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,440
Don't you have anything to report to me?

87
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,880
For example, Chun Ying.

88
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,520
Madam,

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,000
I can receive

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,680
every day.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm not used to

92
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not used to it anymore. Let's go. Let's go.

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,760
Of course.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,320
Chun Ying is much better than the Ministry of Justice.

95
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,200
After all, I brought her here.

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,840
Yes

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,400
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
Miss Gu

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
Sister-in-law, what are you doing?

100
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
According to someone's request,

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
to stay close to him.

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,800
Lord Ning asked me

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
whether the case of Lord Zhang

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,840
to investigate Lord Zhang's death case?

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,480
Yes.

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,120
But we have to wait for the royal agent's official document to release it.

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
I will review

108
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,680
all the files of Lord Zhang's death.

109
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,920
We need the Supreme Court's help.

110
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,680
Do you want the royal agent's army

111
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,240
to see what they can bring out.

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
But I'm a little worried.

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,400
that Lord Zhang was assassinated.

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,640
has spread throughout the city.

115
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,880
The Censorate must move.

116
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,320
If the other three officials plan secretly,

117
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
the Censorate might have more defence chips.

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm afraid they won't move.

119
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Who is it?

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
It’s not confirmed yet. It’s not confirmed yet.

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,080
So,

122
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,000
Be careful these days.

123
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
Let's split up.

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,120
See you.

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,159
If you want me to work with you,

126
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,920
you'd better tell me the details.

127
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,880
Five W, you know?

128
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
Five W

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,960
Who did you do

130
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,080
Why? What should I do?

131
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,200
instead of watching you two here.

132
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,360
flirting with each other.

133
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,480
What are you talking about?

134
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,960
The Ministry of Revenue

135
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
and send it to the county village.

136
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,320
A royal agent doctor inspected the distribution of money.

137
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,080
This case involves some important people.

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,480
Without their help,

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,400
the case of the Censorate

140
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
is meaningless.

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
So we have to force them to do it first.

142
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Got it?

143
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
Yes. Yes.

144
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,320
It's just embezzlement.

145
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,640
I've seen the name of the people.

146
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,280
What do you have for lunch?

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
You can eat at home.

148
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
No.

149
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Since I'm paid by the Ministry of Justice,

150
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,960
I have to eat here.

151
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,760
I'll just sit here for one day.

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,640
and check the reports.

153
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,400
I'll do a lot of patrol.

154
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,480
Check the cases. Okay. Okay.

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I'll patrol the area. Okay. Okay.

156
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,280
No.

157
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
You have to be within one step.

158
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Why?

159
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
I'm not your pet.

160
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,800
Besides,

161
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,640
don't you think I'm a spy?

162
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,000
I’m a spy.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,160
You'll be worried.

164
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,320
So for your safety,

165
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,320
I'll get going.

166
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,440
Songquan.

167
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,000
Follow her.

168
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Don't let her solve the case. Okay. Okay.

169
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,280
Let's go. Let's go.

170
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,720
Hello. Hello.

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,640
She’s here. She’s here.

172
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,200
Where is Ruofei?

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,160
Miss and Young Master went out early in the morning.

174
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,160
They went out?

175
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,000
Miss Changle.

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Can I ask you something?

177
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,480
Sit down. Okay.

178
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,520
That's right.

179
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
How can we make the old madam

180
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,520
the matchmaker?

181
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,640
No.

182
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,360
Miss, what's wrong?

183
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,480
Did I say something wrong?

184
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
Don't cry.

185
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,400
Chun Ying.

186
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,880
Let's love freely.

187
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,040
It's harmful.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,880
It's harmful.

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
I know. I know.

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,000
Song Quan and I

191
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,680
fell in love at first sight.

192
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,560
Did my mom send you to mock me?

193
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
Miss.

194
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,200
I just want you

195
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,680
to set me up with Song Quan.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,080
It's easy.

197
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,160
Go to Ruofei.

198
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,600
Let me help you.

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
That's it?

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,760
It's my problem.

201
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,960
It's hard.

202
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,040
What's wrong?

203
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,680
My mother wants to see me at night.

204
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
Then let's meet at night.

205
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,880
Look at his face.

206
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,880
Look at the face

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
That's good.

208
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
This is what all the girls in the city look forward to.

209
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,240
Is my face for people to see?

210
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,320
What should I do?

211
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
Miss Changle,

212
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I think

213
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,520
you should discuss it with me.

214
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,680
After all, ugly son-in-law needs to see his mother-in-law.

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm not ugly at night.

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,440
Have you seen his face?

217
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,960
No.

218
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
That's it.

219
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,960
No one has seen his face.

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,040
Yes.

221
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,840
No one has seen his face.

222
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,520
Then I just need someone to fake him.

223
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,720
You're so smart.

224
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,720
What are you doing?

225
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,880
Can't you see I'm patrolling?

226
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,520
Go away! Go away!

227
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,680
Come on. Come on.

228
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,520
Your hand is here.

229
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
What are you doing?

230
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,760
A kite.

231
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,920
What kite?

232
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,320
Your kite is broken. Why are you still selling it?

233
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
How could you say that?

234
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
This pot is broken too.

235
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,880
And this

236
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,400
It's all broken.

237
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,120
What the hell is this place?

238
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,920
Mrs. Xun.

239
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Ning.

240
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
It’s a coincidence. It’s a coincidence.

241
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes, what a coincidence.

242
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,760
Mrs. Xun.

243
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,520
I didn’t have dinner last time.

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I don't know if you'll come this time.

245
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,440
Sure.

246
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

247
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's go. Let's go.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Let's go.

249
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,800
How is it?

250
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,480
Look how good it is.

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,680
Come on. Come on.

252
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,400
Let's go. Let's go.

253
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,320
Let's go. Let's go.

254
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Let's buy a kite.

255
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,640
Sir.

256
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
Your Excellency, your dishes.

257
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,520
Mrs. Xun.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,920
I thought

259
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,160
to treat you to dinner.

260
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,320
I told you last time.

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,440
Don't call me Mrs. Xun.

262
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,720
Just call me Du Ruofei.

263
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,400
Or Du.

264
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,840
I’ll take the liberty.

265
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,720
Mr. Du.

266
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,800
Hello. Hello.

267
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,960
You are so kind.

268
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,560
Mrs. Xun.

269
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
We are really destined to meet.

270
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,960
We always meet.

271
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
Exactly.

272
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,080
But if I didn't go to work with Tony today,

273
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,520
I wouldn’t go out.

274
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,800
You went to the Ministry of Penalty with Mr. Qiu today.

275
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
He can’t leave me now.

276
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,080
You know what?

277
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,880
the key evidence chain

278
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,160
and Mr. Zhang's death chain

279
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,280
was created by me.

280
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,800
It's a piece of paper. It's a piece of paper. It's a piece of paper. It's a piece of paper.

281
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,360
The fingerprints. It's from the bottle. It's from the bottle.

282
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,480
I found a fingerprint

283
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,760
from the pill bottle.

284
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,600
I brought it here

285
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,720
and compared it with your fingerprint.

286
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
It's the same.

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
It means that

288
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
Lord Jang was the last person

289
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,680
Lord Zhang was the last person who approached him.

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,720
Yes.

291
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,400
He wipes the bottle every day.

292
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,000
You're smart.

293
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,920
Of course.

294
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
When can Du teach me?

295
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,920
It’s easy.

296
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
But when I

297
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,080
I'll teach you

298
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,000
I can teach you.

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,640
How about adding some food?

300
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,400
Let's have a drink.

301
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,600
No, Ning.

302
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,720
Now,

303
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm a constable officer.

304
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,480
You'll get paid. Okay.

305
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
Be disciplined.

306
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Don't drink during working hours.

307
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,720
Come on. Come on.

308
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,640
You can't drink it. You can't drink it. You can't drink it.

309
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,400
I want a pot of tea.

310
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,520
It’s OK. Let’s meet next time.

311
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,880
I have to go back and keep an eye on Qiu Changhao.

312
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
in case he makes trouble again.

313
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

314
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,880
Well...

315
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,920
See you. Bye.

316
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,280
Bye, Ning.

317
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,000
It seems that

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,480
really found someone.

319
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,080
A temporary male artist? Yes.

320
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,160
Reward.

321
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,400
Why are you everywhere?

322
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,800
He can be here, but I can't.

323
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,680
Go.

324
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,720
Go play in Guilan Fang.

325
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,360
Don't get in my way.

326
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,960
Do you think I'm in a good mood today?

327
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
I didn't hit you.

328
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
That's what I thought.

329
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,280
You're already looking for a man on the street.

330
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,080
You don't have time to beat me.

331
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
Tell me, what's going on?

332
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
My mother wants to see me at night.

333
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,600
And then?

334
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
I have to find someone to go home with me.

335
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,160
My goodness.

336
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
There's no kernel inside.

337
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
What else can I do?

338
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,440
My mother said she would agree

339
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,560
she agreed to our relationship.

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,360
Although it's empty inside,

341
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,240
I still hope you can use it.

342
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Your mother obviously wants you to give up.

343
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,480
That's what I think.

344
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,440
Since my mother has said everything,

345
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,960
to this point,

346
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,480
I'll just do it.

347
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,560
She has nothing else to say.

348
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,880
Moreover,

349
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,920
my mother has never seen me at night.

350
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,280
Just find someone to pretend to be her.

351
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,400
Absolutely not.

352
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
Who am I at night?

353
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,640
He's handsome and handsome.

354
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,920
You're a great man.

355
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,640
You can't just

356
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,240
on the street?

357
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,360
It's really strange today.

358
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,280
Why do you sound so pleasant?

359
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,200
It seems that

360
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
I can only do it myself.

361
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,040
You?

362
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,800
Be normal.

363
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,800
This is too fake.

364
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,400
If my mother knew

365
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,200
I spread the rumor,

366
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll do it myself.

367
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,440
My lord.

368
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
Madam said

369
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
she'll be back soon.

370
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,280
Didn't you follow her?

371
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,760
She went to eat.

372
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,520
It is

373
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,600
It's from Guihe Restaurant

374
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,960
Is it two people again?

375
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,320
Yes

376
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,280
It's Huening Ji again

377
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Maybe the dishes here are really delicious

378
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,200
I've never seen the world.

379
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,440
I remember

380
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,840
I still have a lot of work to do.

381
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,920
I have to go now.

382
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,520
What happened to your face?

383
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,080
It's fine.

384
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,760
It's okay. Let's go. Let's go.

385
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,720
Okay. Let's go. Okay. Okay.

386
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.

387
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,640
Everything is fine on the street.

388
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,840
The Ministry of Justice is quite relaxed in handling cases.

389
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Did you come back from eating?

390
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,720
Yes.

391
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,480
I didn't eat anything this morning.

392
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,400
I ate something on the street.

393
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,800
Did you eat it yourself?

394
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,240
I'll make up for it.

395
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,880
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

396
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,079
to make up for your mistake.

397
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,280
Can you make up for your mistake?

398
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,800
can't be solved by a meal.

399
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,200
How can you forgive me?

400
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
I already apologized.

401
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,000
Is that an apology?

402
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,800
I can forgive you.

403
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,160
Tell me the truth.

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,320
Take this chance

405
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,640
Back to your positions.

406
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,000
Return to your places.

407
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,160
You should be a good husband.

408
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,440
or a good husband?

409
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,960
I...

410
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Go back to your class.

411
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Back to normal.

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Got it?

413
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
Ready. Ready.

414
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,200
OK. Go ahead.

415
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
It's not easy to ask here.

416
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
You should treat me to dinner.

417
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,640
Let's talk about it tonight.

418
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
Gui He Restaurant again?

419
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,080
Okay, let's drink together.

420
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,560
Let's have a good drink tonight.

421
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,120
Let's have a good chat.
