1
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,800
Mother.

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,840
I had a dream last night.

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,400
a woman wore a red wedding dress

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,160
She came to me and told me

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,560
"Why did you sleep on my bed?"

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
You took my seat.

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,200
That's nonsense.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,080
I remember

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,120
She said she's a princess. A princess?

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,160
Princess?

11
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,240
Do you think Princess Jin Shu and Changhao

12
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,440
between Princess Jin Shu and Changhao?

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,840
Ruofei.

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,120
Ruofei.

15
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,079
Ruofei.

16
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
don't care about what others say.

17
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
Since you're married to Changhao,

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
you have to

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
a good life.

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,120
No, I want to know

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,520
You don't need to know.

22
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,240
It's all rumours outside.

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,320
What do you want to know?

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,079
You need to know. You need to know.

25
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,640
You're right.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,880
What mother would tell her son's love history

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
to an outsider?

28
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,960
Be hasty.

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,040
I was careless.

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,840
What's your name?

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,960
Cut the crap.

32
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,000
Just kill me if you want.

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
I didn't expect you to have guts.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,240
This is the secret book found from him.

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,960
It records the information of different people.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
They are all notes.

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,640
Ready. Ready.

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,440
It's a symbol of

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
This is about you.

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
What's written on it?

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Read it now.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,320
I haven't had time to read it yet.

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm a decent person.

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Read it. Read it. Read it.

45
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,840
Yes.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Qiu Changhao.

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,040
The descendants of the founding of the country are loyal and loyal.

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,440
The current Deputy Minister of Justice

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,640
lives in Wanliu Alley, Fengcheng.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,680
This man is upright and perceptive.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,400
But the God of Matchmaking is hard to hold without Hong Luan.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
She's born to bring bad luck to her wife.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,079
Her first wife, Princess Jin Shu,

54
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,960
went missing on her wedding day.

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,240
The women in the city are afraid of her.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
Nonsense.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
My lord just got married yesterday.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
What else? Go on.

59
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,680
Jiang Lanting

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,880
is the sister-in-law

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,440
of His Majesty's third uncle.

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
and his cousin.

63
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,760
This man is insensitive and obsessed with beauty.

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,680
Every time he goes out, he's always surrounded by people.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
and showy.

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
It's true.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,440
Where is it?

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,480
Come on

69
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,880
Come in and play

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,680
Right

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on. Come on.

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,400
Manager Hu.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
They're usually supporting us.

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
What's going on today?

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,960
I recharged it every year.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
But the chairman asked me to pay alone today.

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,840
I haven't had time

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,440
Girls,

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,840
Who do you admire the most?

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
At night,

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Who is your favorite?

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
Your Majesty.

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
I brought you

85
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,480
is my item.

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
Do you want it?

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,880
Yes.

88
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
But I have to tell you first.

89
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
I don’t want your money.

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,480
I just hope you can run and tell me

91
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,600
and spread my glory

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,720
to every corner of Fengcheng.

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,440
Understand?

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,920
Yes.

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,280
Come on, shout with me at night.

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,040
In the evening, in the evening.

97
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,680
Louder!

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm here at night.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Here we are.

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,480
At night, I'm at night.

101
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Don't fight with me later.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,520
You never know.

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,400
Supervisor Hu. Tell them that you're here. Tell them that you're here.

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
Tell them

105
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,120
I'll pay ten times more for each of them.

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,200
to hold a welcoming ceremony

107
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,680
in Guilan Fang.

108
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,040
Let those

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,680
who have never seen the world.

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,000
Buy more books for me.

111
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,280
Got it. Go.

112
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Okay.

113
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,040
At night, I will

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I won't be their spy.

115
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,200
What are the features of these spies?

116
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
They said

117
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,520
the spies they sent

118
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,800
All men are brave and powerful.

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,440
This woman's spy is better.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,040
All of them have fair skin and beautiful long legs.

121
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,520
They can sing and dance.

122
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,680
and charming.

123
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
Even the nail cover

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,440
are all red and delicate.

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,280
Even her personality

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,800
changed and confused.

127
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,600
You idiots

128
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,360
can't be defenced.

129
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
She's fair and beautiful.

130
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,840
and charming.

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,280
She's confused.

132
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,520
It's so rare.

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,360
It melted my heart.

134
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
He looks like Du Ruofei.

135
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,760
Who else can I ask?

136
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
Isn't this sister-in-law?

137
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,200
Where are you rushing to?

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,159
They should know about the princess.

139
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
It's Third Brother and Third Sister-in-law.

140
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,280
It's a nice day

141
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,360
I'm out for a walk

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,080
Walking?

143
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
The garden of our family is big.

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Don’t get lost.

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
You're not far from here.

146
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
It's not as big as our playground.

147
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,800
Playground.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,960
I have a question.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
My husband and his wife.

150
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
How is their relationship?

151
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
Princess?

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,640
It happened years ago.

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,800
Sister, stop asking.

154
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,560
That's right.

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,880
It's useless to ask.

156
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,400
If the princess didn't disappear

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,160
on the wedding day,

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
It's none of your business.

159
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,880
Am I wrong?

160
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,520
Come on.

161
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,400
Just a kiss.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,640
How could a living person

163
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
in front of me.

164
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,600
Madam.

165
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It's my fault.

166
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,840
It's not your fault.

167
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,040
Wait.

168
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,640
You mean

169
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,560
they didn't consummate?

170
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
What do you mean?

171
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
We didn't even meet

172
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
I didn't even see her.

173
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,480
Isn't it her?

174
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,920
Second brother is good,

175
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,040
but he's not as popular

176
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,600
you're not as good as me.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm not popular with women.

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,400
What are you talking about?

179
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
Make it clear today.

180
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,560
No.

181
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,200
Are you seeing someone else?

182
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
No, no.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
Madam, you are so fair and beautiful.

184
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,520
and lovely.

185
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,840
You are enough for me.

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,560
Of course.

187
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,040
My family has two counties.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
My followers are lined up to Fengcheng.

189
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,400
Yes.

190
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,320
If it weren't for you,

191
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
tall and handsome,

192
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
and manly.

193
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
I won't marry you.

194
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
When were you blind?

195
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,680
Sister-in-law.

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,799
Where is she?

197
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,919
What is she doing?

198
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,799
No.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,280
We have to give birth quickly.

200
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,320
We can't let her take the lead.

201
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,120
No, madam.

202
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,560
Is it appropriate in broad daylight?

203
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,600
What's wrong with daytime?

204
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,880
Songquan.

205
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,200
What are you doing?

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,720
Don't move.

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
What are you doing?

208
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,920
Give it back!

209
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,720
My lord.

210
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
Give it back!

211
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,520
Guards!

212
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,600
Put him in jail first.

213
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
Give it back to me.

214
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,640
You bastard!

215
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,000
You...

216
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Go!

217
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,560
Let go of me!

218
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,240
Let go of me!

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,640
Stay still!

220
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,800
Let go of me!

221
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,520
This is a woman's handkerchief.

222
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
Check her background.

223
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,520
Yes.

224
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,520
Du Ruofei.

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
A spy?

226
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
She's fair and beautiful.

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Something is wrong with Du Ruofei.

228
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,560
The people in the Qiu family seem abnormal.

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,360
But if this person

230
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,560
has stayed in the Xun Mansion for long enough,

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,520
you should be able to find out something.

232
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Greetings, Mrs. Cheng.

233
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,720
Have you always been like this?

234
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,280
Yes.

235
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay.

236
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
I just want to ask you something.

237
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,760
Afu is a tight-lipped person.

238
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
It seems that his IQ is a bit...

239
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
In that case,

240
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,520
we're all from the Qiu family.

241
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
Are we friends?

242
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,880
Good friends

243
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,960
should help each other?

244
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,480
Should you answer

245
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
should you answer them?

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:37,920
"Yes, you should." "Yes, you should." "Yes, you should." That's right.

247
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
Come on. Come on.

248
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Okay. Okay.

249
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,040
Let me ask you.

250
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,720
Which woman is Young Master Yue close to?

251
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,840
There was such a woman.

252
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,720
Who?

253
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,240
She is

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,320
a heroine in the world.

255
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,640
All the good things in the world

256
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
are linked to her.

257
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,040
of the Supreme Court.

258
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,560
Lord Gu Mochou

259
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,200
OK.

260
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,720
What kind of official is Si Zhi?

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
Now that you mention it,

262
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,480
she's really amazing.

263
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,680
Not only that,

264
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,840
but also chivalrous.

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
He often does things that he shouldn't do.

266
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,360
You two...

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,160
What are you doing?

268
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
Catch the thief! Catch the thief!

269
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,760
Amazing!

270
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Yes!

271
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,600
Afu.

272
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
Is this the heroine you mentioned?

273
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,960
I guess

274
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,920
you must be Brother Changhao's wife.

275
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,040
Yes.

276
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm Du Ruofei.

277
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Hello, Mrs. Du.

278
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,840
It was your wedding yesterday.

279
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,120
I was away on a case. I couldn't come.

280
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm really sorry.

281
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm here to send you a wedding gift.

282
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,440
I wish you and Brother Changhao a long and happy marriage.

283
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,520
and have a baby soon.

284
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,880
You're welcome, Lord Gu.

285
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Just call me Mo Chou.

286
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
Do you want to come to my place?

287
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,640
I have work to do.

288
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,480
I won't go in.

289
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,720
Let's get together some other day.

290
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,400
Okay.

291
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,320
Bye.

292
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,120
So handsome.

293
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,480
If I were a man, I would marry her.

294
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
She doesn't like you.

295
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,600
Go sweep the floor.

296
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,560
Honey, you're back.

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,080
What are you doing?

298
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,400
You don't have energy or water milk here.

299
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,040
I can only use this instead.

300
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,760
Do you want to try it?

301
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,760
No.

302
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,720
Wait a minute.

303
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
You've been busy all day.

304
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
Let me help you get changed.

305
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,680
No.

306
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,960
Are you thirsty?

307
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,120
Why don't you sit down and have some tea?

308
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,040
You must be tired.

309
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,920
Let me give you a massage.

310
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,320
Why are you so nervous?

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,640
I'll pretend to cooperate.

312
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
to see what tricks she can pull.

313
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,360
Who's nervous?

314
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,680
Press it.

315
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,880
Your muscles are so powerful.

316
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
It feels so good.

317
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,600
Well...

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
Is it okay?

319
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,440
Yes.

320
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Dear,

321
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,760
I have a question for you.

322
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,800
She can't help trying to trick me.

323
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,880
Ask her.

324
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,640
Is your wife

325
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,640
is Princess Jin Shu.

326
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,880
How is your relationship?

327
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,920
Feelings.

328
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,720
No feelings.

329
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,840
When you're about to propose, you'll be able to see each other. When you're about to get married, you'll see each other.

330
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,080
He wasn't home on the wedding day.

331
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,400
The person who opened the curtain is gone.

332
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,480
It seems that Jin Shu is not Qiu Changhao's true love.

333
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Let me stretch your bones.

334
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,080
Honey,

335
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,720
how many girls

336
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
since you were little?

337
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,880
Why would a spy care about such things?

338
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,440
No one.

339
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,160
None.

340
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,400
Have you never liked

341
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
professional women?

342
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,640
Pro woman?

343
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes.

344
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,440
Just like that.

345
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,840
who is cold on the outside and warm on the inside.

346
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,320
And he's very skilled.

347
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,640
Gu Mochou?

348
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,360
Yes, that's her.

349
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,000
What do you think? Do you like her?

350
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,120
No.

351
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,160
I won't be jealous.

352
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
Just tell me.

353
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm just asking.

354
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
No.

355
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,520
We're just colleagues.

356
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,440
My heart...

357
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,320
Why am I so angry?

358
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I didn't mean it.

359
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,960
Let go!

360
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,400
Miss. Young Master.

361
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,000
What is it?

362
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,720
Madam asked me to inform you

363
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,360
to have dinner in the main hall tonight.

364
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,320
Got it.

365
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Mr. Chu.

366
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,080
Mrs. Chu.

367
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
I need some fresh air. Okay.

368
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,040
Miss.

369
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,680
Something is wrong.

370
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,360
It is.

371
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,160
You mean that Qiu Changhao?

372
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,920
doesn't like his ex

373
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,840
and no other girl.

374
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,000
Who is he?

375
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,200
What are you talking about?

376
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,480
Young Master’s true love must be you.

377
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,440
I...

378
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Look.

379
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,720
He's your husband.

380
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,240
You are his wife.

381
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,560
He listened to you all night.

382
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
Then you must be the one he truly loves.

383
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,880
Yes.

384
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,680
This is my dream.

385
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,280
Of course I'm the female lead.

386
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,640
What kind of brain am I?

387
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,560
You're smart.

388
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,200
Here.

389
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,960
Today is my son's wedding.

390
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,640
Let's wish him a happy wedding.

391
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,000
Here.

392
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,240
Thank you, Mother.

393
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,680
Mother.

394
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,839
Where is Hengyu?

395
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,640
Yuanyu is here.

396
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,319
Hengyu wants to eat in her own room.

397
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,440
I've asked the kitchen to prepare one for you.

398
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,800
Thank you.

399
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,359
Mother

400
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,359
This is braised pork specially made for you in the kitchen.

401
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,079
Try it

402
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
All these years,

403
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
I only like this.

404
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,360
Wait.

405
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,240
You can't eat this.
