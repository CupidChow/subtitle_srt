1
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,840
Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Mother.

2
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,160
I apologize on behalf of Ruofei.

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,479
No.

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,360
He knelt down and pleaded for me.

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,800
Ruofei, you should apologize to mother too.

6
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
Rise.

7
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
Thank you, Mother.

8
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,360
Rest early, Mother.

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
Ruofei and I will go back first.

10
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,200
Mother.

11
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,200
What's wrong

12
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,200
Your hands were smooth just now.

13
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,800
My mother is old.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
You should always follow her lead.

15
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,280
Don't do this again.

16
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
I already apologized to her.

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,680
Changhao.

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,079
I suddenly felt that

19
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,120
Are you hungry?

20
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,680
[It's "love."] ["Love."]

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,000
[Love.] [Love.]

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,760
Love.

23
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,320
It's called "love". It's called "love".

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,960
Look.

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Just now,

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
when you kneeled for me,

27
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,760
I suddenly showed up.

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,840
What do couples call each other?

29
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,079
Love.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,240
What do you do for someone you love?

31
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,360
Love.

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
Then kneel down and prove for me?

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
Prove that you love me.

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,120
Right?

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll kneel down to my stepmother.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,480
You deserve it. You deserve it.

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Still denying it?

38
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,600
Why are you looking at me secretly?

39
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,160
To see if you're sincere.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
No.

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
I clearly saw you love me

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
from your eyes.

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,600
Now,

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,320
What did you see in my eyes?

45
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,800
Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

46
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
If you don't tell me,

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,920
when I can go back?

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,400
Where are you going?

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,440
Just say you love me.

50
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,520
Say you love me.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,040
Say it. Say it.

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,320
Just say something.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,400
You'll be exhausted.

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880
What do you want?

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,080
It means you love me.

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,880
That is,

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
you want to be with me forever.

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,519
for the rest of your life.

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,640
No.

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,880
Okay.

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
Take it as a summary.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,840
That's all, right?

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,080
I'll go home tomorrow.

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,280
Your home is far away.

65
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,320
Rest early.

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,120
I...

67
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,520
You...

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,920
I've never pursued a man like this.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,920
It hurts.

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
It hurts.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
It hurts.

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,840
What's wrong?

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
My feet are starting to hurt again.

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,840
Can you help me?

75
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,159
Is it here?

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,360
Yes.

77
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,400
It's here.

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,960
Ouch!

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,520
I can't walk.

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
Does it hurt?

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
It hurts here too.

82
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,520
Here. Why don't you carry me?

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,320
Get up.

84
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,080
Hurry up.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,080
Let's go.

86
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,480
Madam.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
You suffered today.

88
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
It's all my fault.

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,200
I made you worry.

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,840
Do you

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,960
Do you love me?

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,920
Of course I love you.

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,320
Can you do it?

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,960
Just three words.

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760
Are you that reluctant to say it?

96
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,720
What are you doing?

97
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,320
The Ministry of Justice

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
often deals with corpses and bones.

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080
Let me check your wound.

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
That's an excuse.

101
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,440
He wants to...

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,280
It hurts.

103
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,000
It hurts.

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,640
She has fair skin and long legs.

105
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,400
His personality is changeable.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
He's quite gentle.

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,360
He's fine.

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,880
You seem to feel much better after pressing it.

109
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,600
I remember the spy once said

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
the toenails are all delicate and fluffy.

111
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,520
I need to verify.

112
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
You must be tired today.

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
I'll get you some water to wash your feet.

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,680
Why does he suddenly change?

115
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,360
Du Ruofei

116
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,440
fits the testimony of the spy.

117
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Except for the red of the big toe,

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,120
It could be a spy

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,680
by Gou Jae-kook.

120
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,120
What are you doing?

121
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,960
Relax.

122
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,440
Okay.

123
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,840
What's wrong with you?

124
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
The nail polish is off.

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,080
I haven't had time to fix it.

126
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,520
Is this half red

127
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,480
is the trait of a spy?

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,280
I'll be back tomorrow.

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,720
I can check it. Okay.

130
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,400
This is so embarrassing.

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,320
What are you reading?

132
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,280
Poetry collection.

133
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,800
I don't quite understand some words.

134
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,040
Why don't you take a look?

135
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,520
Okay.

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,000
This sentence

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,120
"I love you, I don't care."

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,960
What does it mean?

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,040
It means

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,920
The emotions of love are overflowing

141
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,400
It's too far to tell

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,120
What's the summary of three words?

143
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,320
The road is too far.

144
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,040
It's about people.

145
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,480
What emotions?

146
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,080
What kind of state?

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,240
Three words. What?

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,880
It's urgent.

149
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,080
What's the third word of the fifth line?

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,960
I...

151
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh word. The seventh line is "love".

152
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:46,880
Love.

153
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
The third line, the fourth word.

154
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440
You don't even know such a simple word.

155
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,640
This poem book doesn't suit you.

156
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,760
Let's play a game.

157
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
Truth or Dare?

158
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,080
What does it mean?

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

160
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
The winner has to make the loser do something

161
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,120
or tell the truth.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

163
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,520
Watch carefully

164
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,840
Rock, paper, scissors.

165
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
Rock wins.

166
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

167
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,480
Paper wins against rock.

168
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,120
Understand?

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Rock, paper, scissors.

170
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,440
This one doesn't count.

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,080
Again.

172
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

173
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,080
Go ahead.

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,720
Your name?

175
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,840
Du Ruofei.

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,280
What's wrong with your brain?

177
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,720
Again.

178
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

179
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
Your address.

180
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
In the west of the construction site.

181
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
Yongfeng Village next to the road.

182
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
Aren't we going to my house now?

183
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,880
Let's do it again.

184
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,320
Rock, paper, scissors.

185
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,840
It's my turn.

186
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,480
Now I want you to tell me that you love me.

187
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
What if I don't tell you?

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,520
Then I'll curse you for failing the exam.

189
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,000
The package is shifting the blame. Have you eaten?

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
If you can't find a wife before 30,

191
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
Aren't you my wife?

192
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,560
You...

193
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,200
You're cheating.

194
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,720
This game is too childish.

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,360
I quit.

196
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Save your energy.

197
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Go home and talk to your parents.

198
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,880
So all boys are idiots.

199
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,920
I can see you're happy.

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm so happy.

201
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,400
Young Master is here.

202
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,120
Master, Madam.

203
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,920
Dad, Mom.

204
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,520
Daughter.

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,480
I miss you so much. I miss you so much.

206
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,440
Mother-in-law.

207
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,760
Father-in-law.

208
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,120
Young Master, you must be tired.

209
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,200
Are you tired? No.

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
This unlucky girl.

211
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,000
How can you let Mr. Xun take things himself?

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,640
Come on.

213
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,080
Please come in.

214
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,640
Please come in.

215
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Chun Ying, get some water.

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,600
and wash them up.

217
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
Yes, madam, parents.

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Take care.

219
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
Here, have some tea.

220
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Thank you, Father-in-law.

221
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,200
Thank you, Dad.

222
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,160
My son-in-law.

223
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,920
You're busy with your important job.

224
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,760
Did I ever trouble you?

225
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,800
No.

226
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm glad you're here. I'm here. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

227
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
I've been married for three days, but I'm still a lady. I've been married for three days.

228
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,720
but after seeing you today,

229
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
has really impressed us.

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,280
Looks like this family is really extraordinary.

231
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,920
Yes.

232
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,920
It's not normal.

233
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,600
It's only been a few days.

234
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,440
I can't even recognize you.

235
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,360
Did it change that much?

236
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,280
Yes.

237
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,480
Change?

238
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,840
You've lost weight.

239
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,360
I've gained weight.

240
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,200
No, I...

241
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,000
White.

242
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,080
It's round and smooth.

243
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Run what?

244
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
You have no idea how much I've suffered these days.

245
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,240
Not only did you ask me to kneel,

246
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,080
but also let me sit.

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
Father-in-law, let's have some tea.

248
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,160
Have some tea.

249
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,240
Look at this kid.

250
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,320
It’s better to be fat.

251
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,400
A little chubby can give birth to a grandchild for the Qiu family.

252
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,200
Mom, you value men over daughters.

253
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,160
The UN said

254
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,160
that women are important to the future of the nation.

255
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,360
UN?

256
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,080
Are they working with the Western Liang State?

257
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,800
Dongdu State?

258
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,840
It's different to marry into the Xun family.

259
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,400
I don't understand what you're saying.

260
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,480
With such a high-ranking official like you, I'm so proud of you.

261
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm impressed.

262
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,600
I need to go to the toilet.

263
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,280
It's the toilet. I need to pee. Pull.

264
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,200
This...

265
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Come on. Let's go.

266
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,200
Go.

267
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,040
Young Master, have some tea.

268
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,040
Have some tea.

269
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,400
He's not usually like this.

270
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,240
Yes.

271
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,640
Lower your voice.

272
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,120
Slow and quiet.

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,120
He doesn't go out or leave the house.

274
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
reserved and shy.

275
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,240
He never talks to men.

276
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,720
Yes.

277
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
I know all of that.

278
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,800
As you said,

279
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,480
gentle and shy.

280
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Yes.

281
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Mom, the toilet is out of paper.

282
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Miss, I'm here.

283
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,920
This is your favorite fish soup.

284
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,760
Try it.

285
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,440
Great!

286
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,280
I've been thinking about your fish soup for a long time.

287
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,400
Life details can't lie.

288
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,720
She'll give herself away sooner or later.

289
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,480
What do you think?

290
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
It's a little fishy.

291
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
You need to put some pepper.

292
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,400
Pepper

293
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,200
How can we afford pepper

294
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,760
Madam, I brought pepper for my parents-in-law.

295
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,400
But the fish soup is a little light

296
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
Can I add some salt?

297
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,880
Salt?

298
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,600
You really don't know the environment.

299
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,800
I'll get it.

300
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,160
Ruofei doesn't go into the kitchen.

301
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
I know where it is.

302
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,320
My good son-in-law, come on.

303
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,360
Let's drink.

304
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,360
Madam, we're running out of wine.

305
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,000
Wine.

306
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Here you are.

307
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,040
Come on. Come on.

308
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,720
Come on. Cheers.

309
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,800
Ruofei, these plants at home...

310
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,560
were planted by her father and me.

311
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Yes.

312
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,640
They must have practiced this meal.

313
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,280
My good son-in-law.

314
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,080
Here.

315
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,480
Father-in-law.

316
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,800
What's Ruofei's hobby?

317
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
She has no hobbies.

318
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,360
I only have one hobby now.

319
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,440
What hobby?

320
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,800
Love you.

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,720
Come on.

322
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Cheers

323
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,160
Dad, mom, don't you smell anything?

324
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,120
No.

325
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,720
No.

326
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,880
Jang-ho, you didn't smell it either?

327
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,560
No.

328
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,560
My love for you is burning.

329
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,040
It's burning.

330
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,119
Why do I feel a little nauseous?

331
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,960
Young Master, enjoy your drink.

332
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,040
I'll take Ruofei to clean up the room.

333
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,839
Okay.

334
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay.

335
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,119
Hurry up.

336
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,880
Let's go.

337
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,640
My good son-in-law.

338
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
Let me give you a spin.

339
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,440
Spin it.

340
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,560
Let me ask you.

341
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,320
Did you

342
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,320
Confess?

343
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,800
Not confession.

344
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,600
Your father and I

345
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,320
gave you the Yin and Yang and Hehe Pill.

346
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,360
Did you put it in?

347
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,800
It's useless.

348
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,360
Your cheesy lines

349
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,040
is quite tiring.

350
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,560
You have to control him.

351
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,520
Hold him.

352
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,680
Just like your mother once controlled your father.

353
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,120
That's why you're here.

354
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,480
So you mean

355
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,960
I can use some beauty tricks

356
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,360
to make him lose control.

357
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
Smart, quick-witted.
