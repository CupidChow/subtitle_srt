1
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,640
Get him! Get him! Get him!

2
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,640
Ning Ji!

3
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,480
Don't move

4
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,880
Let's go! Let's go!

5
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,640
Calm down.

6
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
I will help you retrial the case.

7
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,640
Don't make a big mistake.

8
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,320
This has nothing to do with you.

9
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Ning Ji.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,200
How is my dart thrown? It's fine.

11
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,079
Your Highness.

12
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,880
I should have known it was you.

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,800
Ning Ji.

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,040
Lord Ning! Lord Ning!

15
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,720
Please spare my life.

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,600
I don't have any grudge against you.

17
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,240
Why did you kill me?

18
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Why did you kill me?

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
Why did you kill me?

20
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,760
Lord Li,

21
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
I'll kill you

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
I'll let you die.

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm the only descendant of the Liang family.

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,560
Liang Chen.

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,960
I've endured it for many years.

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,680
for today.

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Only by killing you

28
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,040
can I comfort my parents and the Liang family.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,200
of my parents and my Liang family.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,280
Ningji.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,320
And you.

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,560
Qiu Changhao.

33
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,600
You don't have to talk to me.

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
Thank you for helping me find my enemy.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
In return,

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,320
I'll give you a secret too.

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
On the day your brother's house was on fire,

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
I saw it all the way.

39
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,440
I can't be saved.

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,079
I went there to set fire.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,360
I know I wronged your brother.

43
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,320
But with him,

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
I'll kill him.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
Ask him to apologize to your brother for me.

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,720
Listen to me.

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,560
The family who framed Liang

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,480
who framed Liang Mansion.

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,880
The Ministry of Revenue, the Censorate, and the royal agent.

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
He's the lowest official among them.

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
If you kill him,

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,200
How can you convict others? That's right.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,920
Yes.

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,280
Here's the evidence. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you.

55
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,560
I'll give them to you.

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
to convict them.

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,520
Punish them!

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Qiu Changhao.

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
You are too naive.

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
Let me ask you.

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Is my mother guilty?

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,079
Is my father guilty?

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
Is my 32 family guilty?

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
I don't care who can convict them.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,600
I only care if I can kill them.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,520
Kill them today.

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Kill one tomorrow.

68
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
Think about it.

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
Liang Chen.

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Don't kill him!

71
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,680
Ning Ji!

72
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,400
Can you stop being so selfish?

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,720
Have you considered Jin Shu?

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
She ran away from your marriage

75
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,440
and concealed your identity for so many years.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
I've been living a miserable life.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,520
For you,

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
for you,

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,880
You even got yourself poisoned.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
for your revenge.

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
Have you considered her?

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
You killed someone today. You killed her?

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay.

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,960
You'll be the number one wanted tomorrow.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
What do you want Jin Shu to do?

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
to run away with you?

87
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,800
[Liang Chen, are you going to run away with me?]

88
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
Didn't you say

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,960
we would live a normal life?

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,440
Have you forgotten?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,159
You and Zhanghao have the same goal.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,360
You are seeking justice for your family.

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,440
He will help you.

94
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,000
Why do you have to

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,960
do this alone?

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,280
I... I can report them.

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,640
Lord Ning.

98
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,159
I can take out

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,800
all the evidence.

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,400
I know everything.

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,680
Lord Ning, I can help you get revenge.

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,720
Mr. Xun.

103
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
I can help you.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,960
Liang Chen.

105
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
Don't worry.

106
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
Leave him to me.

107
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,840
Mr. Li stopped talking after entering the Ministry of Justice.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
How can he be so shameless?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
But this proves our speculation.

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,320
But even if we did,

111
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,600
we still can't find the money.

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
Among these people,

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,960
the most powerful person

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,680
is Imperial Censor Doctor Wang.

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,880
Maybe...

116
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,960
I need to go out.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,520
Where are you going?

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,360
Don't follow me.

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
Are you going alone?

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,640
Yes

121
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,560
I can't involve Lan Ting, Mo Chou

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,120
And you

123
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
Promise me

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,080
come back safely.

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Don't worry.

126
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
I will come back safely.

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,800
My Lord.

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
Lord Wang of the Censorate is here.

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
He is here.

130
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,720
Lord Wang.

131
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,640
The tea is cold.

132
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,960
You handed the file to the royal agent's office early in the morning.

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
to find you.

134
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
I've handed over

135
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,360
of Mr. Zhang.

136
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Yes.

137
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,400
What about the evidence?

138
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,919
I have

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,320
I have it.

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,600
Qiu Changhao,

141
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,400
don't ruin your future

142
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,200
your future and family.

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,720
In order to embezzle the relief money,

144
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,480
you forged evidence of corruption

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,520
for Imperial Censor Liang.

146
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,800
Let my brother

147
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,200
to solve this case.

148
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Because Lord Liang is fair and fair

149
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,760
you didn't get any money.

150
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
So you ordered Lord Zhang of the Supreme Court

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
to kill local officials and ministers to confiscate 3 million taels

152
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,960
and frame them for the evidence of Lord Liang's corruption.

153
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,840
and accepted it with Minister Zhao of Ministry of Revenue.

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,280
and ordered Minister Li

155
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
to distribute new relief funds.

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
to lure the new Investigating Censor.

157
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,840
You're deceiving the public.

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,120
and embezzled 3 million taels of disaster relief money.

159
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,680
When my brother found something and was about to reverse the case,

160
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,720
you made it look like you committed suicide.

161
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,760
Is that all? Yes.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,280
These are

163
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,520
in the case?

164
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
It's written in the heart of every refugee.

165
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
in the hands of the dead.

166
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,920
will be written on your evidence.

167
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
After all,

168
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,640
you still have no evidence.

169
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,480
You like making up stories.

170
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,560
Then keep making up.

171
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,320
Done.

172
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,960
It's going to be a big success.

173
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,640
If you can't make it up,

174
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,000
I won't give you another chance.

175
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
I have never

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,920
I never rely on opportunities.

177
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,080
If you still have a chance,

178
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,920
if you still have a chance.

179
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,760
Three million taels

180
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
This is 3 million taels

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,280
How can we place it in such a big place?

182
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,000
Where can he put it?

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
Three million taels.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,760
Sister-in-law

185
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,320
Where is he?

186
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
He went out all night.

187
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
He hasn't come back yet.

188
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,960
Did he go alone?

189
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
How could he not take me with him?

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,720
Don't go.

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
Changhao doesn't want to get us into trouble.

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,680
No.

193
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm a prince.

194
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
who can get me into trouble?

195
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,200
we can't just sit and do nothing.

196
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,160
We have to

197
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,720
Jiang Lanting

198
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,680
How big do you think

199
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,320
to hide three million taels of silver?

200
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,120
Mr. Li doesn't have a big house.

201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,680
His house is the biggest

202
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
They didn't buy any.

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,360
The fur is all dried grass.

204
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm so embarrassed of my uncle.

205
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,800
No taste at all.

206
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,320
Wait.

207
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,400
Mr. Li's yard has a wilted grass.

208
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,320
It's so big.

209
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,720
If it can cause the son of the Politician

210
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,800
acid silver poisoning,

211
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,680
That means there must be

212
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,960
under the well.

213
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,640
In this situation,

214
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,160
there is no withered grass.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Unless it's human-made.

216
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,880
It means it's made of silver. It means it's made of silver. It's made of silver.

217
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,160
Money?

218
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,240
I’ll go with you.

219
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,920
I'll go with you.

220
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,360
Sister-in-law.

221
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,400
You can't go.

222
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,320
If Changhao can't find you when he comes back,

223
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,280
he'll be worried.

224
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,720
Let's go. Okay.

225
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,280
Don't worry.

226
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,600
Be careful.

227
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
Who asked you to dig?

228
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,720
Stop!

229
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,200
The Supreme Court is investigating a case.

230
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
Song Quan. Song Quan.

231
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,800
Where's Jang-ho?

232
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,360
Why are you alone?

233
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,160
Where's Changhao?

234
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
He...

235
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
The royal agent took him.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,080
Arrested?

237
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,160
I'm going to look for him.

238
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
Madam! Miss!

239
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
You can't go anywhere.

240
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
My lord told me to keep an eye on you

241
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
to keep an eye on you.

242
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,200
Catch him!

243
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,640
Miss! Madam!

244
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,200
Madam, you can't go.

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Song Quan.

246
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Let's go back to bandage the wound.

247
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,040
We'll go find Miss later.

248
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,560
Let's go.

249
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,440
The Censorate has ordered

250
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
No one is allowed to enter.

251
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,280
Don't you know who I am?

252
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,960
Royal Prince.

253
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
Jiang Lanting!

254
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,880
Get out of my way!

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,880
The royal agent's order!

256
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,880
Get out of here! Get out of here!

257
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,760
Let go!

258
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,640
Let go!

259
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,160
Let go!

260
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,880
My lord!

261
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,680
This woman is shouting outside.

262
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,360
She said she wanted to see the criminal, Qiu Changhao.

263
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
My husband is the Deputy Minister of Justice.

264
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,320
He did nothing wrong.

265
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
You abused your power. Is there justice?

266
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,680
This is the prison.

267
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,520
What Assistant Minister of Justice?

268
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,600
Doesn't she want to see her husband?

269
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,800
Lock this crazy woman up.

270
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,480
Lock them up!

271
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,760
Take him away!

272
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,760
Let go! Let go!

273
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,120
Let go! Let go!

274
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,200
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

275
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,800
Go! Go!

276
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,680
Go! Go! Go!

277
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,240
Go! Go!

278
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,280
Come on. Let's go.

279
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,080
Changhao.

280
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,040
What are you doing here?

281
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,040
What happened?

282
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,440
Why are you locked up?

283
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,840
Did they hit you?

284
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,840
Are you hurt?

285
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,400
Let me see.

286
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,920
Ruofei. I'm fine.

287
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm fine.

288
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,360
I'm glad you're okay.

289
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm really worried about you.

290
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,280
Don't worry.

291
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,480
I'll be fine.

292
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,840
By the way,

293
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,000
I know where the money is.

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Where is it?

295
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Under Lord Li's yard

296
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,040
Lanting and Mo Chou have gone to dig

297
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,360
Once they dig out the money

298
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,480
you will have evidence.

299
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,400
If you have evidence, you can do it.

300
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,960
No.

301
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,440
This is a trap.

302
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,080
The Censorate has been watching us

303
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm afraid Lanting and Mo Chou have fallen into the trap

304
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,280
This...

305
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,440
Isn't Jiang Lanting the prince?

306
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,800
How dare they move?

307
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,680
They are already like this.

308
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,240
They can do anything.

309
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,640
No.

310
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,080
We have to find a way to save them.

311
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,680
Mr. Xun.

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Don’t be nervous.

313
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,680
I'm here to save you.

314
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,520
Changhao!

315
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,640
Who is he?

316
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,480
You're the prince.

317
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,640
to come here, right?

318
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Yes, sir. Hurry.

319
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,840
Move!

320
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,280
Let's go. Let's go.

321
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,640
Changhao.

322
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,600
Ruofei.

323
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,160
Take your family and leave Fengcheng.

324
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,440
as far as possible.

325
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,240
Qiu Changhao, listen.

326
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,200
Don't try to leave me.

327
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,160
It's useless no matter what you say today.

328
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm not leaving.

329
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,280
Ruofei.

330
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,280
This is my own grudge.

331
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,920
I can't get you involved.

332
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,680
What do you mean?

333
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
I'm your wife.

334
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,920
I'll be wherever you are.

335
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
I'm not leaving anyway.

336
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,119
I won't let you get hurt.

337
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:11,960
Let's go.

338
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,720
This way.

339
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
Are you really going to kill the prince?

340
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
A prince like him

341
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,200
is ignorant,

342
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
and willful.

343
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,800
It's okay to kill him.

344
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,400
Do it!

345
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,120
Lord Wang.

346
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,880
You killed the little prince.

347
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,680
Can you do it?

348
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,480
As a royal agent's doctor,

349
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,160
you embezzled the relief money

350
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,360
and framed the Liang family.

351
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,760
He should be executed.

352
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,120
You should pay with your life. Your Majesty.

353
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Ning Ji!

354
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,760
Are you okay?

355
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,800
Why are you here?

356
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,280
Du Ruofei is right.

357
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,440
We have a common goal.

358
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,600
What about Changhao?

359
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,760
I've sent someone to save him.

360
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,160
He should be able to meet us soon.

361
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,760
Okay

362
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,200
Here we go. Here we go.

363
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,760
You're here, after all.

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,160
We haven't avenged yet.

365
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,000
Why don't you give it a go?

366
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,160
You have to be capable to take revenge.

367
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,720
Wang, you bastard!

368
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,000
Everyone is here.

369
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,360
It saves me a lot of trouble.

370
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,880
Today,

371
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
none of you can leave.
