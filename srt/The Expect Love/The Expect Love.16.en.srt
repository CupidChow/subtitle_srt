1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
Can we sleep now?

2
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,800
It's not good for a couple to sleep separately.

3
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,720
What are you doing?

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,120
My blanket.

5
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,440
The blanket. The blanket.

6
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,280
What happened to the blanket?

7
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,880
I spilled it.

8
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,080
Sleep on the other side.

9
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:15,920
Good night.

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
She's mad at me.

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
I should make it up to her.

12
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,560
Every time I have to give birth,

13
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,240
every time you have a baby.

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,720
I can see that

15
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,960
you just don't want it.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't worry, Madam.

17
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,800
I'll adjust my vomit.

18
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,960
Besides,

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
should we divide it into

20
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,079
One, three, five, two, four, six.

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,520
Or once every seven days.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,000
If you can't give birth,

23
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,000
you can't always exploit me.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,079
Do you know

25
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,960
to have a child?

26
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,480
I risked my life for this.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
Why did you risk your life?

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
It's Du Ruofei.

29
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
told me that she had many meatballs.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,160
He's at Physician Xiliang's place.

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,760
I went to him.

32
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,640
But many people chased me with swords.

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
Don't cry.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,640
What are these meatballs?

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
I was talking about a knife

36
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,079
I heard it.

37
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
So what is Dozi Pill?

38
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,280
Multiple meatballs

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
a lot of babies.

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,880
That means you don't need me.

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,440
You can't do it anymore.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,079
You don't want to take the last step.

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,480
You can't give birth just by eating that.

44
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,920
I thought

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,040
play with your walnuts.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,800
Go play with birds.

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,079
I'll have my own baby.

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,640
No.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,400
Madam.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Isn't there

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
in our mansion?

52
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,360
Ask him if you can't.

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,560
Doctor Xiliang.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,560
melon.

55
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
Yes, Gas.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,080
In our family,

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,440
Don't let Du Ruofei laugh at me.

59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,480
Find her now.

60
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,640
Jiaoxing, melon please

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Please come in. Let's go.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,839
Third Madam.

63
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
You don't need to check your pulse.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,680
If you can be the director of Wulin,

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,560
why can't I get pregnant?

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm pregnant.

67
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,960
Be happy.

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,600
Be happy.

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,040
The more I miss you, the more nervous I am.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,520
When you have something on your mind, your body will be weak.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,800
You have to make yourself happy.

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
Yeah, just be happy.

73
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,320
When I see Du Ruofei,

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
when I see Du Ruofei.

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
When I think that she might

76
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
get pregnant before me,

77
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,960
I was even more unhappy.

78
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,920
When I saw her playing with Hengyu, I...

79
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,360
If it's through, it won't hurt.

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
You have to put it down.

81
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
Put it down.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,800
Put it down and get rid of the embarrassment.

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,440
I guess

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
you'll get pregnant.

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,920
Why are you here?

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,240
Someone is following me. I'm here to hide.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,040
You're exposed.

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
That's impossible.

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,040
Then why did he follow you?

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,480
How dare you ask me?

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,760
How dare you ask me?

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
If Lord Zhang

93
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,520
died in the Ministry of Justice,

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,200
I wouldn't have begged my uncle.

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
All afternoon,

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm so eloquent.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,960
Cherry's mouth

98
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,159
Finally, my uncle

99
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,360
to calm down.

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,640
Take off your clothes first.

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,520
It's inappropriate to wear it here.

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Help me.

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm a prince after all.

104
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
How can I take off my clothes?

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,720
It's stuck.

106
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,360
I told you not to add anything.

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720
This is my taste as a prince.

108
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
What do you know?

109
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,840
Don't move.

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,280
Here.

111
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Yes.

112
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,160
Push harder.

113
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,640
Don't move.

114
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,160
Push harder, okay?

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,640
Push harder.

116
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,320
I am.

117
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Changhao, I can even get my monthly allowance.

118
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,000
Sister-in-law.

119
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,080
Well...

120
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,520
Excuse me.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,480
Sister-in-law.

122
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,880
Why are you holding my back?

123
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
I can't let her know about me.

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,080
That's right.

125
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Come on. Come on.

126
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,640
Come on.

127
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,800
Take it off yourself.

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
You're really... You're...

129
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,440
Oh my.

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,200
I tried so hard

131
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,159
Did you have any reaction?

132
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,680
It turns out that the strength is crooked.

133
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,920
What a bolt on a sunny day.

134
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,160
Sister-in-law, I'll go back to work.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Goodbye.

136
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,000
He’s here. He’s here.

137
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,400
He's looking for me.

138
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,840
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,720
I didn't mean to barge in.

140
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,360
It's okay.

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
I didn't expect

142
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
this would happen.

143
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
You saw it?

144
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Don’t blame Lan Ting.

145
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,680
He did it to cooperate with me.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,360
I understand.

147
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
We don't want others to know

148
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,280
our identities.

149
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,080
It will cause more trouble.

150
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,240
I know.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,080
We always do this secretly.

152
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,080
in secret.

153
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm afraid that if I'm not careful,

154
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,920
if you're not careful.

155
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
I understand.

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,480
So, can you

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
keep the secret for us?

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,160
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

159
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
Thank you.

160
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,000
You're welcome.

161
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
Should I sleep on the bed?

162
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,000
It's not easy to deal with a handsome guy.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
After all that,

164
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
He doesn't know who he really is.

165
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
Change the way.

166
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
Let him learn how to confess first.

167
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,200
As long as I can go back.

168
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,360
If you can't be a husband, be my bestie.

169
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
You can't sleep, right?

170
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,160
Are you stimulated?

171
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Do you want me to chat with you?

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,600
Okay.

173
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Let’s talk about Kang Lanting.

174
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,760
How did you two meet?

175
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,080
When I was five years old,

176
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,560
when I was five.

177
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,400
and learned martial arts from the same master.

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,280
Was he like this when he was young?

179
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,360
He seems to be carefree,

180
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,800
but he has a sense of justice.

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,800
He doesn't look like a prince.

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
He likes to practice martial arts and slack off.

183
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,920
He likes to play with Changle.

184
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
I often help him with his homework.

185
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
and get punished for him.

186
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,200
I treat him like a brother.

187
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
We grew up together.

188
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,880
He treats me

189
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
as his brother.

190
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Gosh.

191
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,840
What an enviable brotherhood.

192
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
Unfortunately, there's a gap in EQ.

193
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,040
As long as I can teach him

194
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,280
how to express I love you,

195
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
it's done.

196
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,640
Poor Heng Yu.

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,640
No one will take care of him after I leave.

198
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,640
Just remember

199
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,280
talk to Jiang Lanting.

200
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
I will help you.

201
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,560
I'll take good care of Hengyu.

202
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,000
Hengyu.

203
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll show you something fun today.

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Miss.

205
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,240
The soap is ready.

206
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,040
Great Look carefully

207
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,120
Throw the soap in first

208
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,520
Then stir it like this.

209
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,200
Okay give me the sugars

210
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,160
Okay.

211
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,680
Okay. Okay.

212
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,400
Put some sugars on it.

213
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,200
Fei.

214
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,840
Why did you put sugar?

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,160
Because sugars

216
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,760
can increase the stickiness of bubbles.

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,920
so the bubbles won't be easily blown.

218
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,840
Bubble.

219
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,840
Like this.

220
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,520
Chun Ying.

221
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,440
Help me

222
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,480
into these bottles.

223
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
Here you are.

224
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
This is yours.

225
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,760
Okay. Blow it.

226
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,560
Miss.

227
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,160
What should I do?

228
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,400
Watch me.

229
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Come and play.

230
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
Hengyu, come here.

231
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,480
Miss, have fun.

232
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
Turn around, Miss.

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,360
How is it going over there?

234
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,720
We had a long talk last night.

235
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,240
with Ruofei last night.

236
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,160
Well,

237
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,720
Does Changle know?

238
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,920
I don’t think Ruofei will.

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,800
That's good.

240
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,840
I was in Lord Zhang's mansion last night.

241
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
for half a night.

242
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
No one is here.

243
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
I think the clue is broken.

244
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,240
The news of Lord Zhang's death is still blocked.

245
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
We must find a way

246
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
to lure the others out.

247
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
That makes sense. That one.

248
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,400
When two handsome guys are together,

249
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,960
It's good for your eyes.

250
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:07,920
Sweet

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,520
Sweet

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,320
You know a lot.

253
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,960
Oh no.

254
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,600
You two have fun.

255
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm leaving.

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,240
Miss.

257
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
I'll play with you.

258
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,000
What's wrong?

259
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,320
Where are you going?

260
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,760
How can I forget

261
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,040
a woman's eternal calamity?

262
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,920
My stomach hurts.

263
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,160
Why are you...

264
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,520
What is this?

265
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
This is Granny Tang.

266
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
When women have menstruations,

267
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,600
they all need this.

268
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,640
I didn't expect you to know this.

269
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,320
Besties know women better than straight men.

270
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,600
This is round.

271
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
Let me help you.

272
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,400
You...

273
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,600
It's hot.

274
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,480
Is it hot?

275
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,120
Aren't you afraid of the heat?

276
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,160
It's better to be hot.

277
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
Do you feel better now?

278
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,920
It still hurts.

279
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,520
What are you doing?

280
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't move.

281
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,720
Do you feel better?

282
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,720
Much better.

283
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,320
Get out.

284
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,760
Go on.

285
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm leaving.

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
Let's go.

287
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,800
Hurry up!

288
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,600
Hengyu.

289
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm going to take an exam.

290
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,040
Where are you going?

291
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Exam.

292
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,280
Exam!

293
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,160
My Lord! My Lord!

294
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,760
Doctor Gas.

295
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,560
How have you been these days?

296
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,440
I’m fine.

297
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,560
Sorry to trouble you.

298
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,800
You’re welcome.

299
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,920
I have something to tell you.

300
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,360
Please go ahead.

301
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It's about Lord Zhang.

302
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,640
Lord Zhang...

303
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,599
Is there any way to stop the pain?

304
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,599
You mean Lord Zhang is here?

305
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,480
Not Lord Zhang.

306
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,240
It's my wife. The pain is unbearable.

307
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,200
Add ginger slices with brown sugar.

308
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,240
Take it while it's hot.

309
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,119
It's good for circulation of meridians.

310
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,760
It can relieve pain.

311
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,160
And massage along the cord

312
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,960
It will be better.

313
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,200
If it doesn't work,

314
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,920
we can only prescribe some anesthesia.

315
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,560
Got it.

316
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,440
Or about Lord Zhang?

317
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,080
Go ahead.

318
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,400
Is this painkiller

319
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
hurt your body?

320
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,920
Yes.

321
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,840
I don't recommend you to take it.

322
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,560
But my wife has been in pain for days.

323
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
can't be relieved.

324
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,400
What should we do?

325
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
My lord, this is how the moon letter is.

326
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,920
can only be relieved in three or five days.

327
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,080
Unless after giving birth,

328
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,640
it may relieve the pain once and for all.

329
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,320
You'll have to take care of her until she gives birth.

330
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,440
and accompany her.

331
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,400
to distract her.

332
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,080
Don't always leave her alone.

333
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
If that's the case,

334
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,560
I'll finish my work as soon as possible

335
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
and come back to keep her company.

336
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,840
That's right.

337
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,160
Thank you, Doctor Gas.

338
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,440
Aren't you talking about Lord Zhang?

339
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,240
Let's talk another day.

340
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,840
Goodbye.

341
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Take care of him.

342
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,160
and company.
