1
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Your Highness. Your Highness.

2
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,920
You've suffered a lot. You've suffered a lot.

3
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
It's all my fault.

4
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

5
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,080
My love for you

6
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,199
I love you.

7
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I love you.

8
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,360
This is my imagination.

9
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
My name is Du Ruofei.

10
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm a third year majoring in biochemical major.

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,640
I’m in love recently.

12
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,800
His name is Qiu Changhao.

13
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,200
He's my favorite male lead in novels.

14
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
But what makes me angry is

15
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,400
such a handsome and handsome man

16
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,640
was passed on to his wife.

17
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
I want to leave a message to the author boss.

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,240
and ask him to

19
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,800
a brave, smart and beautiful wife.

20
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Her name is

21
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,960
Du Ruofei.

22
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,960
The author hasn't replied yet.

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,840
I was on my way to the secret room to escape.

24
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,160
I met a psychic.

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
He not only wanted to cheat me of money,

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
but also cursed me.

27
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,240
I fell into the city hall.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,040
Help!

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,400
When I woke up,

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,040
I found myself in a strange place.

31
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
wearing an ancient wedding gown.

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
There's a handsome guy lying on the bed next to him.

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,840
The secret room has started since then.

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,240
Miss, what's wrong?

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
Fatty!

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
Miss, I'm Chun Ying.

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,720
What's ridiculous is

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Our department director is here too.

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,360
She's a drama queen.

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
She asked me to kneel down.

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,440
Kneel.

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,720
When I was about to use the killing skill,

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,640
I heard a familiar name.

44
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Leave me alone.

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,760
Look at Changhao.

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Wait a minute.

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,360
What's wrong?

48
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,600
Let's go. Let's go.

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,760
Yes.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
You are Qiu Changren? Yes.

51
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,160
Yes.

52
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
Are you Chu Zilin?

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
What else?

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,280
So you are Qi Wan?

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,480
Of course.

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,680
Move.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,240
Mother.

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,080
Qiu Changhao, it's really you.

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
You are my prince charming.

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Son, you're awake.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,880
What else do you want?

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
Nothing.

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
I'm just too excited to see you.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
Are you okay now?

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,400
Are you really okay?

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
This secret room is not decent.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,920
It's colourful.

68
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,840
I like it very much.

69
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,640
Son, are you okay?

70
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
Mother, I'm fine.

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Let me take a look.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,840
Mother, don't come over.

73
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,320
I'm fine.

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,760
Mother.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,600
Yinqi. Yinqi.

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,520
Sorry for disturbing you on my wedding night.

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm really sorry.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,360
Go back and rest.

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,000
But I'm worried.

80
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,840
Mother.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Mother!

82
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't worry.

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,280
He just ate

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,240
a thousand-year ginseng.

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,320
It's too nutritious.

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,200
Mother, I'm really fine.

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
Go back and rest.

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll ask Ruofei to see you off.

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,960
Ruofei.

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,240
Mom.

91
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,040
Mother.

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,280
Whatever.

93
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,240
Please.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,480
Brother.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,760
Take care.

96
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
Goodbye, Mother.

97
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
My goodness.

98
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,600
This...

99
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,200
Is this a secret room?

100
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,640
He's so rich.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
Miss.

102
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,920
This is your house.

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,120
Du Ruofei.

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Come here.

105
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,280
I have something

106
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,440
to tell you

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,360
tomorrow.

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,440
But I think it's necessary

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
to tell you right away.

110
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,080
Tell me.

111
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,120
Now that you're married,

112
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,120
taking care of Changhao is your responsibility.

113
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,920
Understand?

114
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
I know

115
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,040
I know.

116
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Yes, Madam.

117
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,800
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Did I ask you?

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,600
Okay, okay.

120
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,760
The most important thing for you now

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,960
to let our family have children.

122
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,360
I understand.

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
I will. I will.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
I can make him bloom.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,560
My goodness.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,160
I was wrong.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
Miss.

128
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,840
Are you okay?

129
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
He's gone.

130
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Why are you still acting?

131
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,560
No, I didn't.

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,880
I really didn't.

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,120
I...

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
I...

135
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,480
She doesn't look like she's acting.

136
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,080
Besides,

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
this yard

138
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,960
doesn't look like

139
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,200
in a secret room.

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,920
I see.

141
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,720
It's a dream.

142
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,720
I miss you day and night.

143
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,560
So I miss Qiu Changhao so much

144
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,880
I dreamed of entering his story.

145
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
I really am a fan of Qiu Changhao.

146
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,600
Miss.

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,240
Are you okay?

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
Are you scared to death?

149
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
You're the fool.

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,200
Look how much I love you.

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,560
I'll bring you along even in my dreams.

152
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
Be good to me.

153
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,840
By the way,

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,360
You mean I married Qiu Changhao?

155
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh, my God.

156
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
Oh my god!

157
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,760
I married Qiu Changhao.

158
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,200
Did you drink

159
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
the wine with medicine?

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Mother.

161
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
Sister-in-law is quite strange.

162
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,480
It's really different from the matchmaker.

163
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,480
Do you think she knows that Changhao brings bad luck to her wife

164
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
she doesn't want to marry into the Xun family?

165
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Yes.

166
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
Maybe she wants to climb up to you.

167
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
and afraid that the rumor is true.

168
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320
That's why we should strike first.

169
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,560
No, no, no.

170
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
She wouldn't dare.

171
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,080
She's just a village head's daughter.

172
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,640
That's right.

173
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,600
Hadn't Changhao been passed on to his wife,

174
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,760
would it be her turn?

175
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,720
That's right.

176
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,960
With the title of Deputy Minister of Justice,

177
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,960
if he didn't insist on marrying an official woman,

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,040
I have a matchmaker in my family.

179
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,640
Wan'er.

180
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
In name, she's your sister-in-law.

181
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
But you came here a few years earlier than her.

182
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
And you're older than her.

183
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Keep an eye on her.

184
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes, I will.

185
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,240
Where is Changle?

186
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,960
He went to see a minister or a minister.

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,240
That's ridiculous.

188
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,480
Find her.

189
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
Take care, Mother.

190
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
You should take the exam for me too.

191
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,600
Or I'll poison you.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm reading it.

193
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,160
Jiaoxing.

194
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Go find Changle.

195
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,360
Who can mess with that lady?

196
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,320
Miss, I...

197
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,080
I'll climb up the ladder when others are taking a cold.

198
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
Let me see where I am.

199
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,320
My lady.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,400
Miss Leng!

201
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,760
It's too dangerous up there.

202
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,400
Madam wants you to go back.

203
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
Keep your voice down.

204
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,720
You scared me away at night.

205
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
Don't ruin my lifelong happiness.

206
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,160
What are you doing? Let's go.

207
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,360
But Madam...

208
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,000
Are you leaving or not?

209
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
I'm leaving.

210
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,720
I'll leave.

211
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,040
No one can ruin my lifelong happiness.

212
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
What are you looking at?

213
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,080
I can't believe this.

214
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
The nose

215
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
And the eyelashes.

216
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,280
Look at the muscles.

217
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,040
Why are you looking so carefully?

218
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm appreciating my work.

219
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,240
Your work?

220
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes.

221
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
You're my masterpiece.

222
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,040
You don't know

223
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,560
you are

224
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,040
is my favorite idol.

225
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,840
Is the rumor about me

226
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,960
into a book?

227
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,320
Why are you so adorable?

228
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,400
You don't know how much I like you.

229
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,280
Now when you see a living person,

230
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,840
she's even more emotional.

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
This woman's speech is weird.

232
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,720
She's far from what you said.

233
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Something's wrong.

234
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,800
Oh no.

235
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,640
[She's a fox after all.]

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,720
No.

237
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,240
I can't let her have a baby more than my husband.

238
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
So we're sleeping together.

239
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,000
Then my mission is done.

240
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,960
We're all brothers.

241
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,960
Why am I always the one who works hard?

242
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,760
Don't you think

243
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,440
is a bit too creepy?

244
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,880
At night,

245
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,760
Why is she everywhere?

246
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Let's go.

247
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
What are you doing on the roof?

248
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,200
At night,

249
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,800
I've been waiting for you.

250
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,680
Miss.

251
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,160
Behave yourself.

252
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
Don’t get me wrong.

253
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,560
My name is Qiu Changle.

254
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,440
I like you the most in Fengcheng.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,520
Can I see your face?

256
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,600
Just one glance.

257
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,440
I promise I won't tell anyone.

258
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,600
Miss.

259
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
You should know

260
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,640
my identity concerns

261
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,360
the safety of the people of Fengcheng.

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,280
the safety of the people of Fengcheng?

263
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
I have something to do. See you.

264
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,120
Night.

265
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
Why is this medicine getting worse?

266
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,440
I can't hold it anymore.

267
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
What are you doing?

268
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
I just want to touch your face.

269
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Don't do anything stupid.

270
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,480
I've been single for 20 years.

271
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,000
I haven't even held hands and hugged.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm warning you. Don't do anything stupid.

273
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,080
Oh my god.

274
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,440
I finally know why so many girls

275
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,680
like to go to the gym.

276
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,240
Here's the bonus.

277
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,040
Changhao.

278
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
Are you sweating to relieve your pain?

279
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,240
Yes.

280
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,760
You can't do this.

281
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,960
You need to do aerobic exercise.

282
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,560
It's itchy.

283
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,560
It's not itchy.

284
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,400
I mean this.

285
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,000
What are you doing?

286
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,200
Don't move.

287
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,360
I mean...

288
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,240
Look carefully.

289
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,480
See?

290
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,640
I mean jumping rope.

291
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,440
Try it.

292
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,040
No.

293
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
Young Master said I’m not itchy.

294
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,839
She said it would be better if it itches.

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Try it.

296
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,839
Get up and try.

297
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
What's wrong?
