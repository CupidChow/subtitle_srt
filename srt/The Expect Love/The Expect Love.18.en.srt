1
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,680
Is this what you should do

2
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,120
Is this what a daughter-in-law of the Qiu family should do?

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,520
Should I?

4
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Shut up!

5
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,920
I did promise Changhao

6
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,080
I won't make you angry.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,039
But if you're so unreasonable,

8
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,880
I...

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,200
don't care about the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
I really...

11
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,400
You want to hit me again?

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,640
I... Wan'er.

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,280
Du Ruofei.

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,800
You came at the right time.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,640
Qi Wan, I was about to talk about you.

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
Look at you.

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,440
every day.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,680
Are you done?

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,160
I'll pick a fight with you.

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
What's the benefit of our divorce?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,400
What's in it for you?

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,639
I won't fight with you.

23
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,440
and I won't fight with you.

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,039
You're always messing around.

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,720
Are you asking for a beating?

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,640
Brother, your wife wants to beat me.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,880
Changhao.

28
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,760
Changhao.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
Your wife wants to beat me.

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,760
Alright, stop acting.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Wait for me at home.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't worry. I'm not finished.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
It's wrong to hit someone.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,880
But you and you

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,640
Is it right to blame me?

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,680
We are all reasonable people, right?

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,480
You can't do this.

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,400
Go back.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,200
Okay.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,880
But I have one more thing.

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,840
Although we just had a fight,

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,440
I still have some etiquette.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,120
Goodbye, Granny.

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
She's being polite.

45
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,680
Mother.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
Don't talk to me.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
Are you going to say sorry to me?

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Are you going to say sorry to me?

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,920
Whenever she makes me angry,

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
you said sorry to me.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
How many times

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
for her?

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,640
Mother.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,040
I can't stay in this house anymore.

55
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,520
After getting married,

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,880
You can abandon your mother when you're married.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,960
Yes.

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,560
I'm not your biological mother.

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,480
You don't have to worry about me.

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,920
I can go now.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,280
I can go back to my hometown.

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,920
I think we should break up.

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
No, no, no.

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,480
Let's break up.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
No, you can't leave.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
I won't split up.

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,160
Mother.

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
You are always the mother of this family.

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
I will accompany you until you die.

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,480
Ruofei lost her temper today.

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,079
I will ask her

72
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,600
sincerely apologize to you tomorrow.

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,760
She had dinner with Ningji

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,960
I know that too.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,800
I believe Ruofei.

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,840
You heard it.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
It's not your fault.

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
I just want to fight.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,079
They will punish you.

80
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,160
I'll be careful next time.

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Remember to tell me in advance next time.

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,920
Got it.

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
I don't think you understand.

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,280
If I call you,

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,840
if I call you, right?

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
Call me and pay the bill.

88
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,040
Not bad. You're a good friend.

89
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,960
By the way,

90
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,440
I was going to invite Kang Lanting

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,600
to have a drink with you.

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,040
Just the two of us?

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Two?

94
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,320
You think I'm a hindrance.

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,640
Cheapskate.

96
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,960
Are you in a bad mood today?

97
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,240
Did something happen?

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,600
The Dao is where

99
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Although thousands of people are gone,

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,560
Qiu Changhao is so frank.

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,040
Did I really wrong the Qiu family?

102
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

103
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
the Liang family is long gone.

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Jilang, you have to be cautious.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,760
Since Qiu Changhao wants to investigate,

106
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
I'll do as he says.

107
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
I want to be closer to him.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
This album

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,160
is related to the cause of his death.

110
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Send him to the Imperial Censor's Office. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,520
Keep this in mind.

112
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
to the royal agent.

113
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes, I will do it myself.

114
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
By the way, my lord,

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,520
Lord Ning came to ask for

116
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,800
Lord Zhang's interrogation records.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,880
But what I gave

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,159
are official records.

119
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,360
Okay, I got it.

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,080
Tell Lan Ting

121
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,440
to the Censorate.

122
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,520
Next, we'll wait for the fish to take the bait.

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,560
It's clear.

124
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Is it comfortable?

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,880
Your cooking

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
is getting better.

127
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
Thank you, Mother.

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,440
As long as you like it, I'll massage it for you every day.

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,280
Tell me.

130
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
What do you want me to do?

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,440
Mother,

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
I haven't got pregnant yet.

133
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,080
Changren and I

134
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
has been too lonely.

135
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,000
Look.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,720
Hengyu.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Can you leave it to me and Changren?

138
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
Mother.

139
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Not now.

140
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Why?

141
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
Your sister-in-law

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,159
just asked Yu'er to speak,

143
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,280
you said to go to your yard.

144
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,600
Can she get used to it?

145
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,760
I can talk to Hengyu too.

146
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,440
And it's time for sister-in-law to have a baby.

147
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
She's with Hengyu every day.

148
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
What if she doesn't want to give birth?

149
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,960
Let's talk about it later.

150
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,640
Mother.

151
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,520
I have nothing.

152
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
Look at you.

153
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
All you think about

154
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,280
how to steal Yu'er.

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,600
What can be in your belly?

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,880
The doctor said

157
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm as strong as a cow.

158
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,480
I'm sure I can have a baby.

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Mother.

160
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
What do you think is the problem?

161
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,280
Hengyu, be careful.

162
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,000
Hengyu.

163
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
Hengyu, I'm here to see you.

164
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,880
Third Mistress.

165
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,600
Hengyu, greet your aunt.

166
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
No need.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,880
Nanny.

168
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,280
I heard your mother's birthday is coming up.

169
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
I specially prepared some tonics

170
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
for her.

171
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,520
Thank you.

172
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,000
You're welcome.

173
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,159
By the way,

174
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,600
who will take Hengyu these days?

175
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,799
This...

176
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
It depends on

177
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,880
and Young Master.

178
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,320
Third Mistress,

179
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,920
I will find a way

180
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,800
to get close to Hengyu.

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Hengyu.

182
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
Let me help you.

183
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,440
Hengyu. Hengyu.

184
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
I've prepared

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
for you.

186
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,320
Hengyu.

187
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,440
Look at you, you're sweating.

188
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,400
Let me wipe it for you.

189
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,200
My heart aches.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,240
It's blocked.

191
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Block!

192
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,480
Hengyu, where are you going?

193
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,800
You and Wenjun...

194
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Hengyu, don't go.

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,720
Where are you going today?

196
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,800
Hengyu, I'm sorry.

197
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,920
I'll buy you something better and bigger.

198
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,800
More expensive?

199
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,880
Don't cry. I'll take it.

200
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,480
Hengyu.

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm going to find Feifei.

202
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,120
I...

203
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,760
Third Mistress.

204
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,320
I'll coax the young master first.

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,520
Hengyu. Hengyu.

206
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Why did I lose again?

207
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,000
15, 25.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,560
No.

209
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,680
Mrs. Cheng.

210
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,960
Hengyu.

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,480
Hengyu, what's wrong?

212
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
Why are you unhappy?

213
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,640
The magnifier is broken.

214
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
Zoom in.

215
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,560
Young Master just played with Third Mistress.

216
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
He accidentally...

217
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,880
It's okay.

218
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,480
Later,

219
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
I'll make you something more interesting.

220
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,880
Something that can see the stars, okay?

221
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Really?

222
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Of course.

223
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
When did Fei lie to you?

224
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,080
Mrs. Cheng, I’m going back to my hometown for two days.

225
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Please

226
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,640
take care of him.

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Okay, it's fine.

228
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,560
Go ahead.

229
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
Does Old Madam know?

230
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
Old Madam wanted to

231
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,680
Hengyu with her.

232
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,760
But she's not feeling well these days.

233
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
So she asked me

234
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,840
to Mrs. Cheng.

235
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,560
Great.

236
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,760
Then we can play together.

237
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,840
Are you ready?

238
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,240
Let's go.

239
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,920
It's flying!

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
It's flying!

241
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,800
Hengyu, look!

242
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,480
Feifei, good job!

243
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,520
Miss, you're great.

244
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,880
Fei, you’re great.

245
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,280
You're amazing.

246
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,800
Of course.

247
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
Hengyu, do you want to learn?

248
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,720
Yes.

249
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Take this.

250
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,080
Take this here.

251
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,280
Okay.

252
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,960
Be careful.

253
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:16,960
Hengyu.

254
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,120
Miss, slow down.

255
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,840
Slow down.

256
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,040
Miss.

257
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
The less I want to see,

258
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
the more he wanders around me.

259
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,960
Stop reading.

260
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,080
The priority now is to have children.

261
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
They don't fly the kite well.

262
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,120
What are you talking about?

263
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
I told you to tell Mother

264
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
to let me raise Hengyu.

265
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
What did you say?

266
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
It's not the right time

267
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,320
Is it good now?

268
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,480
The Second Master took the lead.

269
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,240
No, Madam.

270
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,400
Don't be mad at me.

271
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,080
The nanny is going back for a few days.

272
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,400
Just let her take care of her.

273
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
You know nothing.

274
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
It's two days now.

275
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe I'll keep it with me.

276
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,960
Slow down, Hengyu.

277
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
Be careful not to fall.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,920
Slow down. Slow down.

279
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,640
Slow down.

280
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,840
Fei, the kite is hanging on the tree.

281
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,800
Don't worry.

282
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,560
Let me think of a way.

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,640
This...

284
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,560
Why can't I pull it down?

285
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,360
I want a kite. I want a kite.

286
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,520
I know. I'll give it to you.

287
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,680
Hengyu.

288
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,240
Come on.

289
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,520
Look at him. Look at him.

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,040
Let me do it.

291
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,840
I...

292
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,200
You deserve it.

293
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,760
I knew the kite would hang on the tree.

294
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,520
Look, what should she do?

295
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,760
That's why

296
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,960
it's good for me not to take care of the child, right?

297
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,840
How about

298
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,520
we can climb trees and get kites.

299
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,320
Are you stupid?

300
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,320
Can't you ask a servant to get it?

301
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,560
Ning Ji, the young minister of the Supreme Court,

302
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,280
I need you to investigate in secret.

303
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
If anyone in your mansion

304
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,760
If anyone is imprisoned by the Ministry of Justice,

305
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
please identify the details of the testimony.

306
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
A single-line presentation.

307
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,080
Did I wake you?

308
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,160
Playing all day is too tiring.

309
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,120
Hengyu.

310
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,840
Uncle.

311
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,920
Are you happy today?

312
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,680
Yes.

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,760
If my brother knows that I have a daughter like you,

314
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,240
he would be very happy.

315
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
Of course.

316
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm good at playing with Hengyu, right?

317
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,200
Jiang Lanting.

318
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,360
Do you want to die?

319
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,120
Come on.

320
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
What's the rush?

321
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,280
I saw you have nothing to do.

322
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,040
I just have nothing to do.

323
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,120
Why do I have nothing to do?

324
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,320
What did you do?

325
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm writing my communication.

326
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,600
That means you have nothing to do.

327
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
Look at you.

328
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,920
You look like this every day.

329
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,000
If someone sees you at night, you have to hide.

330
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,880
You know what?

331
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,000
Get lost.

332
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Look at you.

333
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,800
I'll stay here and wait for me at night.

334
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,320
All right?

335
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,560
Are you crazy?

336
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm on a date with Yamato.

337
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
Why are you standing there?

338
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,800
It's for your own good.

339
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,160
If you get too excited when you see him,

340
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,200
grinding your teeth, farting, hiccupping,

341
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,560
Who cares?

342
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,960
Let me cover you.

343
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,400
I think you just want to get beaten.

344
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,960
You want a beating?

345
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,600
Changle,

346
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,800
I’m afraid I’ll lie to you at night.

347
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,560
You have nothing to do today

348
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,240
to torture me, right?

349
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,200
Again?

350
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,520
Right?

351
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,880
Stop it.

352
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,360
I want to get hit. My butt hurts.

353
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:18,960
Right?

354
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,480
Stop.

355
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,080
I know Night Minister.

356
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,560
You know nothing.

357
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,520
Stop talking nonsense.

358
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
I really know him. I'm not pretending.

359
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,800
Someone is coming.

360
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
Did you hear

361
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,880
Changle is talking to a man?

362
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,400
A man?

363
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,160
I didn't hear it.

364
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,800
Let's take a look.

365
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,360
Take a look.

366
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,360
Why do I feel so secure

367
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,320
This feels so strange.

368
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,720
Why does it smell so familiar?

369
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,560
It tastes the same

370
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,960
No, no.

371
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,560
I…

372
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,560
Qiu Changle.

373
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,760
Qiu Changle, can’t you change?

374
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,599
What do you want to eat?

375
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,040
What do you want to eat? I'll eat it. I'll eat it. It's good. It's good.

376
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,119
What do you want to eat?

377
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,920
What do you eat?

378
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,960
Qiu Changle.

379
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,119
Don’t go too far.

380
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,120
Are you trying to scare me?

381
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,360
