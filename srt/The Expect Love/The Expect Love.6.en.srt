1
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,479
Here you go. Here you go.

2
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
This is the best wine in the village.

3
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,920
The best wine in our village.

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,960
Good wine.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
Li's pigsty has been buried for three years.

6
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,720
It tastes good.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,880
It's been three years.

8
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,040
We have to drink slowly.

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,680
There are plenty.

10
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,440
Father-in-law.

11
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,840
Let me spin it for you.

12
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Rolling this.

13
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Is this suit my mom gave me useful?

14
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,440
Are you flirting?

15
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,920
Lie down.

16
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Lie down.

17
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,600
Lie down.

18
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,600
What are you doing?

19
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm waiting for you.

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,240
I'll sleep on the floor tonight.

21
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,920
You need a blanket too.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,480
Here, the quilt is here.

23
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,640
Husband

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,160
We're husband and wife, not roommates.

25
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Don't sleep on the floor today.

26
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,200
Sleep on the bed.

27
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
Sleep on the floor.

28
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,440
Madam.

29
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,800
That night,

30
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,520
than today.

31
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
I drank too much today.

32
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
My body is hot and the floor is cool.

33
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,360
Good.

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll fan you on the bed.

35
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,560
No need.

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,800
Young Master said I’m not itchy.

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,080
Miss said it would be better if it itches.

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll give you a horse killer.

39
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,000
Horse killer.

40
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,960
It's just a massage.

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
My lady said I can't breathe.

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,959
Young Master said it hurts.

43
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,600
It hurts.

44
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,600
It hurts. I'll be gentle.

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,480
It still hurts.

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,760
Really.

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,720
Why did Young Master cry for pain?

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
You’ll know later. Let’s go.

49
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,920
Let me tell you a story.

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,880
There was.

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
I heard it all.

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,360
Qiu Changhao, what do you want?

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm already like this.

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,200
I've never been so nice to a man.

55
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,000
Actually,

56
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,560
you are good.

57
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,200
I think

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,600
we should get to know each other first.

59
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,840
Men need sense of security too.

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,200
Then I...

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,400
Changhao.

62
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,960
I know in your eyes,

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
in your eyes.

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,680
That's because

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,520
you don't know my world.

66
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm real.

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,960
I have flesh and blood.

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,080
If it weren't for the exam,

69
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
who would wake up from a dream?

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,440
I've never been in a relationship.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
I usually watch web fiction and web dramas.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,120
I just want you to say I love you.

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,920
Is it that hard?

74
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,920
Qiu Changhao,

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
Although I like you very much,

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,440
but

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm a person who can tell what's important and what's urgent.

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,400
You can date later.

79
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,480
But I don't want to make up for the exam.

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,360
Do you understand?

81
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
She's saying something I don't understand again.

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
What is she trying to do to me?

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,280
Don't just stand there.

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I don't eat humans. Can you sit down?

85
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,520
Let's talk calmly.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,480
Look.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
Say "I love you".

88
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,880
I won't lose anything

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,720
or any loss.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
And then?

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
this matter can be solved safely.

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Isn't that good?

93
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,440
Well,

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
can you be more reserved?

95
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,920
I just want to fulfill this wish.

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,280
Maybe there's a problem with the way.

97
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,440
I...

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
Forget it. Go to sleep.

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,760
Why do I think she's not a spy?

100
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
It's best.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,280
She's not a spy.

102
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Dad, mom.

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,960
I'm going back.

104
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
I'll find time to visit you.

105
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,160
Don't come back if there's nothing else.

106
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,360
Don't come back if anything happens.

107
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
Am I still your daughter?

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
I want to be a magistrate.

109
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,520
I want to play with my child.

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
I...

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Father-in-law.

112
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,800
Young Master.

113
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,600
Sorry for disturbing you yesterday.

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,720
Thank you.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,080
Don't mention it.

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,080
Not at all.

117
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,200
We're happy

118
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,440
to have you here.

119
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,120
Yes, we're happy.

120
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,640
It's okay.

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
Come back often.

122
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,320
Yeah.

123
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,760
go home often.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,320
so that we won't miss you.

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll come back often.

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,000
Alright.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,159
Stop acting.

128
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,760
Let's go.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,640
Let’s go.

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Young Master.

131
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,760
Come back often.

132
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,480
I'll be back

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,440
Let's go Crying like a donkey

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh no.

135
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,040
I forgot to bring the wine from the pigsty.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,160
The best rouge and powder in the shop in the south of the city.

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,640
Let's go.

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,560
Why are you staring at me?

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
I finally met my family.

140
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,360
But they only care about you.

141
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
They can't see me at all.

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,919
Father-in-law is a generous and a good drinker.

143
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,600
I'll miss him.

144
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,520
I can't stand it anymore.

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,960
I want to go down for a walk.

146
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,360
Chun Ying.

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,600
Here.

148
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,400
Chun Ying, go back first.

149
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,440
Let's go.

150
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,920
We're almost home.

151
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,400
It's time to bring a letter to Madam.

152
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,440
There are so many people here.

153
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
It looks delicious.

154
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
Let's buy this.

155
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,320
Yes.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
How about this? I'll line this up.

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
Go over there

158
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,960
if there's anything better.

159
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,080
I'll ask Songquan to queue up to buy them.

160
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,280
Don't use power for personal gain.

161
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,400
As an official, you should set an example.

162
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,840
Line up.

163
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,800
Go. Go.

164
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
Why did you jump the line?

165
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,760
No.

166
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,080
Didn't you see that everyone is queuing up?

167
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
Please stand in the back.

168
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
Who saw me jump the queue?

169
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,800
Hey, let me tell you.

170
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't think I'm afraid of you

171
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,320
I'm afraid of you.

172
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm in taekwondo a few times.

173
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,440
If you do this again,

174
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
I... I'll hit you.

175
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,280
Try it.

176
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Are you provoking me?

177
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,400
Just try.

178
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,520
I'll kick you.

179
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
You cut the line first. How rude!

180
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,000
None of your business.

181
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,840
Apologize to this lady.

182
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,480
Line up at the back.

183
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,840
Otherwise, you will suffer.

184
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,520
I want to see

185
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,120
who will suffer today.

186
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,760
Don't you know your place?

187
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,000
Report to the Ministry of Justice tomorrow and punish yourself.

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,160
If you don't go,

189
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
you won't be able to stay in Feng City.

190
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
Mr. Qiu, you're good.

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
A single blow.

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
You're indeed the Deputy Minister of Justice.

193
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,160
Thank you, Lord Ning.

194
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,560
The Ministry of Punishments always work hard.

195
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
Mr. Xun, you are too modest.

196
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,080
Please teach me more martial arts in the future.

197
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,680
Okay.

198
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,120
You know each other?

199
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
This is the Chief Justice,

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,080
Lord Ning Ji Ning.

201
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
Good job, Lord Ning.

202
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,400
Thank you for helping my wife.

203
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,800
It's Mrs. Xun.

204
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,600
You’re welcome.

205
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
I'm going to the Supreme Court.

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,760
I’m leaving.

207
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,320
Okay.

208
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,800
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

209
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
What's wrong?

210
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,680
Your hands were smooth just now.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,760
Don't think too much.

212
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm trying to block everyone's gossip.

213
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,800
And...

214
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm here.

215
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,560
Are you jealous?

216
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,800
No.

217
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
Lord Ning is quite handsome.

218
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
There is a phrase.

219
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,200
A gentleman is gentle and kind.

220
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,560
That's him.

221
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,000
Are you done?

222
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,560
But you're the best.

223
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,480
So many people are watching.

224
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,760
Do you want to take this opportunity

225
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
to break the rumor about your bad luck?

226
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,560
Line up.

227
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,440
Lord Zhang.

228
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,360
You're here.

229
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
I called you here

230
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
because the court

231
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,520
to the Supreme Court.

232
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Just tell me.

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,600
At night, I provoked and harassed the people.

234
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,000
and threaten the officials.

235
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,720
People in Fengcheng are in panic.

236
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,600
The imperial court ordered

237
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
to arrest me secretly.

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,480
Be quick.

239
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,760
Yes.

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
Miss. Miss. Third Mistress is here.

241
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,960
Which yogurt?

242
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,520
It's grandma, not yogurt. Miss.

243
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,800
It's me.

244
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,520
Sister-in-law,

245
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,200
The sun is already up.

246
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,160
Why are you still meeting Duke Zhou in a daze?

247
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,920
I have to open my eyes every day.

248
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,880
What do you mean?

249
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,880
You don't have to open your eyes. Just listen to me.

250
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Mother asked me to inform you.

251
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,440
Lady-in-waiting Ban of Donghan is talented and talented.

252
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
She is a role model for women.

253
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,880
The women of our Qiu family have to copy them regularly.

254
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,440
It’s written by Ban Zhao

255
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
from Ban Zhao.

256
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Today is the day of copying.

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,400
Remember to send ten times

258
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,360
before dinner.

259
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Copy the legacy.

260
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,440
Repeat ten times?

261
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,160
No.

262
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,840
Why do we have to copy the legacy?

263
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,080
So what?

264
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,640
The culprit of the feudal etiquette

265
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,640
Feudal etiquette has a mental shackle for women.

266
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,640
What else can't you copy?

267
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,960
Why must you copy the legacy?

268
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,560
I've already told you.

269
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
Jiaoxing, let’s go

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,320
Yes.

271
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,280
Miss.

272
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,560
Let's do it.

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,280
I won't.

274
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,840
No.

275
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,120
My lord.

276
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,520
His Highness asked me to send you a letter.

277
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,000
The imperial court has ordered

278
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,760
to arrest me secretly.

279
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
Anything else?

280
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,280
Sir, we caught three more spies.

281
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,960
This is the list.

282
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,640
Du ribs.

283
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,840
He's the only one who didn't catch him.

284
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,760
Did anyone else interrogate him?

285
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

286
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
They specially inquired about the officials.

287
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,320
Investigating officials?

288
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,120
All high-ranking officials are involved.

289
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,720
Take them to the hall.

290
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,560
The other officers are not allowed to come in.

291
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Sure.

292
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,200
Pork ribs.

293
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,080
Du Ruofei.

294
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
Are you Baozi Yuan?

295
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,160
It's me.

296
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
You're a regular noodles.

297
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,000
It's me.

298
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
You're White Man Tou.

299
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,880
I won't change my name.

300
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm White Man Tou.

301
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,360
There's another man named Du Ribs.

302
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,680
Where is he?

303
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,520
Don't ask.

304
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,960
I won't tell you.

305
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,640
I never

306
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,480
I never do it.

307
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,040
He won't tell you.

308
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,920
Me too.

309
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
You think I don't know

310
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,640
if you don't tell me?

311
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,760
Du ribs are your boss.

312
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
She entered the city earlier than you.

313
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,800
She's hiding in an official house.

314
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,359
How do you know?

315
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,720
I also know your contact code.

316
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,520
Once the experts do it,

317
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,880
you'll know.

318
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,480
How do you know?

319
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,079
I also know

320
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,160
of your boss.

321
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,720
What?

322
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,840
I...

323
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,760
love

324
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,160
You...
