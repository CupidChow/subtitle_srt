1
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,800
Don’t go too far.

2
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,240
Don’t go too far.

3
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,400
Who are you trying to scare?

4
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,080
You...

5
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
My belongings at night.

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,360
Why is it with you?

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,560
It...

8
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm a prince, right?

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,800
I said I know him.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,080
Your brother told you not to chase him.

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,479
Let me help you.

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,880
I won't bring any accessories tomorrow.

13
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,960
so that I won't be able to

14
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,240
when I go to heaven and earth.

15
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,800
Let's go to heaven and earth.

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,760
Yes.

17
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,040
It's like climbing trees with Hengyu and drilling the grass.

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,920
It's indeed a physical work.

19
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,160
Yeah.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,320
What else do you think?

21
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,800
Let me tell you.

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,040
it's troublesome for women to take care of their children.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,040
Those men

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,079
It feels like it's simple

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
It's strange

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,320
It's not easy to raise kids.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,040
I didn't expect you to be so considerate.

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
It's getting late. Get some rest.

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,840
I was

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm tired today. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired.

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
But

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,440
when I saw Hengyu

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,080
from his arms,

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
I don't feel tired anymore.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,840
By the way,

36
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,720
can you bring me some

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
for me tomorrow?

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,040
Shadow puppet play.

39
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,440
Okay.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
Is there anything else?

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,520
You don't like to be down there?

43
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,600
It's up there

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,440
You should have told me earlier.

45
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll go to bed now.

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
You can sleep here later.

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Okay.

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,560
By the way,

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,280
Pour me some water. I'm thirsty.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
Okay.

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,920
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

52
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,280
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

53
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
Let's go. Okay.

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,840
brush my teeth again?

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,840
He's weird today.

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
Jiang Lanting.

57
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Why am I not here at night?

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
If you lie to me,

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll beat you to death.

60
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,960
Didn't we agree

61
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,560
I brought you here because you won't hit me again?

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
Be patient.

63
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,120
He'll come. He'll come.

64
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,320
But...

65
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,520
I have a question before he comes.

66
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,920
You like him so much.

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,840
When he comes,

68
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
What do you want to do with him?

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,520
I'll beat you to death.

70
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,000
Good job.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
You do this. I'm leaving.

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,440
Come back.

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,720
I just want to be with him.

74
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
with him.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,440
Flying around in the sky.

76
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,560
Forget it, Qiu Changle.

77
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,840
I know you.

78
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,320
You like to go out at night so much.

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,240
If you really meet him, you will...

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,440
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,520
He's working at night.

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,920
He's not as nasty as you.

83
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,200
He's a hero.

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,400
He doesn't see any other woman.

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,320
Except for me.

86
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,840
It's like this.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,159
It's like this. It's like this.

88
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,159
When he's cold, he'll be like this.

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,360
I’ll hold him in my arms.

90
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,840
Qiu Changle, you and I...

91
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,280
If he cries,

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,480
I’ll wipe his tears.

93
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,040
I’m talking, Qiu Changle.

94
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,760
I need to know how he feels every day.

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,880
Qiu Changle.

96
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,320
I want him to be happy every day.

97
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,360
Yes.

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,400
It's here. It's here.

99
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,440
you can pick it up.

100
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,840
Right?

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,240
How did you know?

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,680
Your brother told me.

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
Why did he tell you everything?

104
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,960
He's so annoying.

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,760
What else do you know?

106
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,040
I...

107
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,159
What else do you know?

108
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,240
I... I also know that I have a stomachache.

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
I have a stomachache.

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,400
I want to take a walk around

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,720
and see if I'm here at night.

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,760
Get lost.

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
I have something to tell you.

114
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
to tell you.

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Tell me.

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,920
In this situation,

117
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
you have to face your heart.

118
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,320
Look into my heart.

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Don't be sneaky.

120
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
Sometimes I think

121
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
when I do things.

122
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,520
Because this is your business.

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,159
Others have no right to interfere.

124
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
Take care of your own business.

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,040
You have to do so many things

126
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,640
to your partner.

127
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,800
You need to be brave and take responsibility.

128
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,480
First, take care of him.

129
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,960
Out?

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,240
How do I explain this to you?

131
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,360
But it meant the cabinet.

132
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,680
You go out first

133
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,080
and explain it to him.

134
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,640
I'll

135
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,000
take care of the rest.

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,160
The rest?

137
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,880
Of course.

138
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,880
The next part is the highlight.

139
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
This concerns

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,440
about whether to stay or stay.

141
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
You don't have to.

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
I will use my actual action

143
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
to make you forgive me.

144
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,880
No one can control this.

145
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,760
I understand you.

146
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,000
I didn't expect to get married right away.

147
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,559
But I'm happy

148
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,440
if you can solve it now.

149
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,840
Ruofei,

150
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
I'm really

151
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,320
[I'm really sorry.]

152
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Trust me.

153
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
I'll make it up to you

154
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
to make up for

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,360
the real Du Ruofei who married him.

156
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,520
is so pitiful.

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

158
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,280
Good night.

159
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,840
Your calm way of communication

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
is worth learning in interrogation.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,920
At night,

162
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,800
I heard from Jiang Lanting that

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,280
You want to see me?

164
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
I missed you after we parted in a hurry last time.

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,760
The big scene you gave me last time

166
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
touched me.

167
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,680
But it's a waste of lanterns.

168
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,160
Don't do it again.

169
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
This is for you.

170
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,080
Okay, I won't do this again.

171
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Let's meet

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,960
under this tree.

173
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,160
Be quiet.

174
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
No one disturbs.

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,280
But Jiang Lanting knows this tree.

176
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
He'll come and disturb us.

177
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,720
Kang Lanting is my friend.

178
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,560
So he will only deliver the message for us.

179
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
He won't disturb us.

180
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,600
You know Kang Lanting?

181
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Of course.

182
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,120
He is lazy

183
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
and unreliable.

184
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,920
You...

185
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
He is actually a genius.

186
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
Although he didn't read much,

187
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,280
he still insists on writing.

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
He doesn't like sports,

189
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
he still upholds justice.

190
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,800
Don't be fooled

191
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,480
by his unruly appearance.

192
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,280
In fact, he is

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,640
a great hero.

194
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,160
You were tricked by him, weren't you?

195
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,640
You're being ungrateful.

196
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,880
Without Jiang Lanting,

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,200
how can we know each other?

198
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,080
So you should be nice to Jiang Lanting.

199
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,520
Treat him to dinner more often.

200
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,560
and spend more time with him.

201
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,920
Most importantly, don't bite him anymore.

202
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,640
I'm used to biting him.

203
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
I hate him so much.

204
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
You can solve this with meat.

205
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,680
What else did he say about me?

206
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,680
He said you're unique and independent.

207
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,320
You're a weirdo. You can do anything.

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Looks like he's quite trustworthy.

209
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
He said so much good things for me.

210
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,360
What else did he say?

211
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
He also said

212
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,160
you have a special request.

213
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,160
Okay.

214
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Okay. Okay.

215
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,880
From now on,

216
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,960
I'll take you with me.

217
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,040
You are my companion at night.

218
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Your name is Flying at Night.

219
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,520
It's at night. It's at night.

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,240
Great. Great.

221
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
Do you think I'll cover my face?

222
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,880
cover my face or my lower half face?

223
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,240
And look at my clothes.

224
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,760
Your mask.

225
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
Which one do you think is better?

226
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,880
I think tight ones will look better.

227
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,680
And the length.

228
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,400
It's a little shorter.

229
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
It's more convenient

230
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,560
The heels should be fine.

231
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
Qiu Changle, and my skirt.

232
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,760
You need to eat well.

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,520
Sleep well and rest well.

234
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
and hide your identity.

235
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
Don't let anyone know.

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,720
Got it.

237
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,480
Don't expose yourself.

238
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,680
If you need anything,

239
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,520
contact me through Kang Lanting.

240
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,080
Why can't I contact you myself?

241
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,520
It’s safer to go through Kang Lanting.

242
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
Remember your principle.

243
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
Swordswoman at night.

244
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,960
Swordswoman at night.

245
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,440
Okay.

246
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,280
I have to go now.

247
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,760
You should go home too.

248
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,120
Don't stay up all night. It's not safe.

249
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,800
And don't always climb high. You'll catch a cold.

250
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,400
She kissed me.

251
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,680
Wait, she kissed me at night.

252
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,160
How could you do this?

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,560
You’ve gone too far, Qiu Changle.

254
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,120
Sorry.

255
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,240
I was too excited to control myself.

256
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,040
I won't do it again.

257
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,840
I won't do it again.

258
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,120
I...

259
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,680
I won't.

260
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:07,960
You...

261
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
You are a heroine at night.

262
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,200
You have to keep your principles.

263
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
Okay.

264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,040
I kissed him.

265
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,920
I kissed him.

266
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,840
Take a break.

267
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,200
Hengyu, are you tired?

268
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,040
No.

269
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,200
Not tired?

270
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,600
What else do you want to play?

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,520
Anything.

272
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,640
Okay.

273
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,440
Let me think about it.

274
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,400
Let's go play on the street.

275
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,720
What's wrong?

276
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,120
Miss, Madam doesn't allow Young Master to go out.

277
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,080
Let's just take a walk on the street.

278
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,560
If someone asks later,

279
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,000
Just tell them we're sleeping inside.

280
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,520
Hengyu, do you want to go?

281
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Let's go.

282
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,760
I'll leave it to you.

283
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,360
No.

284
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll leave it to you.

285
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,080
Miss.

286
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
Come back early.

287
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,400
OK.

288
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
She’s very strange.

289
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,280
It’s extremely dangerous.

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,720
Am I terminally ill?

291
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,840
No.

292
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,680
What's wrong?

293
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
What happened?

294
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,760
According to the data statistics,

295
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,400
the idle disease has become

296
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,560
the best killer

297
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,400
of the young people.

298
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,320
What's wrong?

299
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,000
Do you have severe asthma when you work?

300
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,320
Massage your hands.

301
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,720
Right.

302
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,120
My eyes are attracted to birds.

303
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,760
These are the main symptoms of wandering around.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
If not treated in time,

305
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,440
the people around you will be confused

306
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,440
until you can't take care of yourself.

307
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,120
That's not right.

308
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,680
It's short of breath. Hold walnuts in your hand.

309
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,560
You like watching birds?

310
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,360
Bingo! You got it all!

311
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,280
The cause is you.

312
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,880
What?

313
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Bingo.

314
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,480
You are the cause of her illness.

315
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,400
What are you talking about?

316
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,240
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

317
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,320
You must take them later.

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,280
Why did I take medicine?

319
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,360
Just take it. Stop talking.

320
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,080
I...

321
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
Doctor.

322
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,600
I'll wait for you in the kitchen.

323
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,760
No.

324
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,040
Doctor, what is the effect of this medicine?

325
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,680
I dare not say anything else.

326
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,720
At least you won't get hit. Okay.

327
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,440
I won't get beaten.

328
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,120
Doctor, what is this?

329
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,560
No.

330
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,400
What is this?

331
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,200
How is it? Is it fun?

332
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Candied haws!

333
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,640
Hengyu, let me buy you candied haws.

334
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,280
This is delicious.

335
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
Fei, I want to play that.

336
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,080
A trap.

337
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Wait for me here.

338
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,280
Let me ask him.

339
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,840
Okay.

340
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,600
Let's go. Let's go.

341
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,360
Boss.

342
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
Give me ten traps.

343
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,800
Okay.

344
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
Here, ten coins.

345
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
Okay. Here.

346
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,720
Okay.

347
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,360
Thank you.

348
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm good at this.

349
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,040
At least two.

350
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,160
You're quite arrogant.

351
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,560
You should give it a try.

352
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay, I'll bring someone here.

353
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,520
Okay.

354
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,640
Hengyu.

355
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,320
Hengyu!

356
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,160
It's a trap.

357
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,760
Hengyu!

358
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,600
Hengyu!

359
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,720
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

360
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,720
Hengyu!

361
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,119
Hengyu.

362
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,640
Hengyu, where are you?

363
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,079
Hengyu.

364
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Hengyu, where are you?

365
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,720
Hengyu! Hengyu!

366
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,480
Hengyu.

367
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,040
Hengyu!

368
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,079
Hengyu!

369
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:19,839
Hengyu!

370
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,280
Hengyu!

371
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Hengyu

372
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:46,560
