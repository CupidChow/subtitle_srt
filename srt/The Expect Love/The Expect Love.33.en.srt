1
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,680
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,120
Okay.

3
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,200
Let's go. Let's go.

4
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,080
Can you see it?

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
Why are you here?

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,280
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

7
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,640
We forgot the time.

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,920
So we came in advance.

9
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
It won't go wrong.

10
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
Okay.

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Today's mission

12
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
is to see if she takes the diary or not.

13
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,400
Where are you going?

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,480
Move. Move. Move.

15
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,079
Move! Move! Move!

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,560
Sister-in-law

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,280
Don't you worry that I can't control myself?

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,240
No way.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,240
Turn around. Turn around.

20
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,680
I can't hear you.

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Listen to a hammer.

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Go back and take your medicine.

23
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,320
Don't.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,040
If he can't control himself,

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,800
he can't control himself.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,120
I have to stop him.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Can he really hold it?

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,840
Let me help you.

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
I can do it myself.

30
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,800
Here you go.

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,480
Okay. Okay.

32
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll get you some tea. Okay.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,880
Okay.

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
Let's go. Let's go.

35
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,440
Get him! Get him!

36
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
Put the poison.

37
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,000
It's poisoned.

38
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
Is it spring potion

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
It's so exciting.

40
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,959
I found it.

41
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,720
Wait.

42
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,800
Didn't I ask you to go back and take your medicine?

43
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
Why are you still here?

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,320
No.

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,160
It's her! It's her! It's her! It's her!

46
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,520
She's poisoned! She's poisoned!

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
It's drugged.

48
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,120
Let's go. Let's go.

49
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,680
Let's go.

50
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,520
Honey, have some tranquilizing tea.

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,159
It helps with sleep.

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,480
Okay. Drink up.

53
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,640
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

54
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's get married today.

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,720
I won't let you suffer anymore.

56
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
I feel dizzy.

57
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,240
Lie down.

58
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,240
Lie down.

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,200
Okay. Okay.

60
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,320
Okay.

61
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320
Go! Go! Go!

62
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,440
Oh my God! Oh my God!

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh, my. Oh, my.

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,200
Why are you lying down?

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,720
Why are you lying down?

66
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,840
Come on. Come on.

67
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,520
Oh no.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,040
Let's go in and fight her.

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,080
No.

70
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,040
What should we do?

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,840
We can't do it.

72
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,400
Why are you panicking?

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm not in a hurry.

74
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,240
No hurry.

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,560
Take your time.

76
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,200
Are you feeling better?

77
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,720
Are you feeling better?

78
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,120
Much better.

79
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I need to go to the bathroom.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
OK. Go.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
The medicine is missing.

82
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
Why isn't it working?

83
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,560
Why are you all here?

84
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm here to join the fun.

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
I just had a cup of tea.

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
The tea must have been drugged.

87
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,360
Is it spring potion?

88
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
It's not spring potion

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,280
When I get close to her,

90
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,560
she turned me down.

91
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,760
Why are you still approaching her?

92
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,080
What's wrong with you?

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,920
I believe you.

94
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Come on. Come on.

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,560
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

96
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
I believe you. I believe you.

97
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,600
I believe you.

98
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,520
I don't believe you.

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,600
Go in!

100
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Go in!

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,040
Let go of me! I'm going in!

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,800
Go!

103
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's go. Let's go.

104
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,360
Take a rest.

105
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,400
Okay. Okay.

106
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
There's no movement. Okay.

107
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,320
This medicine doesn't work.

108
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,120
It looks like my medicine is good.

109
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's see.

110
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,039
Honey.

111
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,960
Honey!

112
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,520
Come out. Let's go.

113
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's go.

114
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
Did you get caught?

115
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,520
I don't think so.

116
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,520
She's moving.

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,880
Follow her.

118
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,960
What is she doing?

119
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,720
What is in Long Yue's room?

120
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,920
She's looking for Zhanghao's detective diary.

121
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,200
The jar. The blanket.

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,960
It's a paper. It's a stone. It's a stone. It's a stone.

123
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
It's a diary. It's a diary.

124
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
It's a small notebook.

125
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,480
If she gets it,

126
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,360
You can just give it to her.

127
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,760
She needs to find it herself to believe it.

128
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,560
What's in that notebook?

129
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,600
Let me see.

130
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
The murderer of Liang Mansion is...

131
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,360
It's over.

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:14,920
It's here. It's here.

133
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,480
I took the wrong one.

134
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,920
It's mine inside.

135
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,160
This is for her.

136
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,880
Look at you.

137
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,560
My legs are numb.

138
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,920
Oh, no.

139
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,800
I have to think of a way.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,320
Like this.

141
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
I'll go in and stall her.

142
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,600
You play it by ear.

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,160
Wait, how do we delay it?

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,720
Let's see. Okay.

145
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,480
Let's go. Let's go.

146
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,280
Who is it? It's me.

147
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,920
Who is it?

148
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,680
She's here. She's here. She's here.

149
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,600
Hello. Hello.

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,320
It's me.

151
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,880
Why are you here?

152
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Is Jang-ho asleep?

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,400
Jang-ho is asleep.

154
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,960
Well,

155
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,920
Let me tell you his sleeping habits.

156
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,040
He doesn't like cold water.

157
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,280
He likes hot water.

158
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
He also likes to put the pillow higher.

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,760
He...

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

161
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,920
I can do it myself.

162
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
You are a princess.

163
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,240
How can you make yourself think about these things?

164
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
What's that sound?

165
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,800
No sound.

166
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,320
Maybe there's sound outside.

167
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,800
No.

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,320
Sister-in-law.

169
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,240
I've prepared some lily soup for you.

170
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
You must drink it tonight.

171
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
This is good

172
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
It's a pity if you don't drink it

173
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,480
Have a seat.

174
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,800
Come on.

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,600
Sister-in-law.

176
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,000
What are you doing?

177
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
This is the tradition of our family.

178
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Ruofei and I drank it.

179
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes.

180
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
Both of you don't have children, right?

181
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,760
We just don't have one for now.

182
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,280
Okay, I'll drink it.

183
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Sister-in-law.

184
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,440
Madam specifically told us to drink it while it's hot.

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,080
It won't work if it's cold.

186
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,600
Okay.

187
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,080
Sister.

188
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,400
We won't disturb you then.

189
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,240
You and Jang-ho, good luck.

190
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,240
Come on.

191
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,600
You...

192
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,440
go to bed early.

193
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,920
Good night.

194
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,480
What's going on?

195
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,840
What’s up? What’s up?

196
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,600
Changle.

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,040
You did a great job.

198
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,720
The three of us are perfect together.

199
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,120
What should we do next?

200
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,600
Wait.

201
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,440
Wait.

202
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,280
See who she meets.

203
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,920
How?

204
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,120
We'll keep an eye on her.

205
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,400
Okay.

206
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,160
Okay.

207
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,640
You guys...

208
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,400
Why are you all here?

209
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,360
Changle.

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,280
Why are you here?

211
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,720
She's never slept in the same room.

212
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,280
Let's go. Let's go.

213
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

214
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,360
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

215
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
Let's go. Let's go.

216
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,280
Come on. Come on.

217
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

218
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,240
I...

219
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,840
I'll get some tea.

220
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,400
In case Changhao gets thirsty at night.

221
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,640
Tea.

222
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,840
Tea.

223
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,560
I'll get it. Okay.

224
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,040
I'll get it. Okay.

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,600
I'll go.

226
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,560
I'll go.

227
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll go.

228
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,800
Qiu Changhao,

229
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,640
Just live your life.

230
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,360
I, Jin Shu,

231
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,920
I won't bother you again.

232
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,720
Get out.

233
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,680
Morning.

234
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,360
I've prepared some lily soup for you.

235
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,240
Have some.

236
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll drink when I'm back.

237
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,320
Let's go.

238
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Good morning.

239
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Where are you going?

240
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,720
Morning, sister.

241
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,440
I didn't feel well this morning.

242
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,840
Maybe my life has been poor

243
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,240
and too weak.

244
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,560
We need to ask Changhao

245
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
to take you to the hospital.

246
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,120
Changhao was too tired last night.

247
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,280
He's still resting.

248
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,840
I'll go by myself.

249
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll get some medicine.

250
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,040
Okay. Okay.

251
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,120
OK.

252
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
Qiu Changhao.

253
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,920
What's wrong?

254
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,760
I'll tell you when I get back.

255
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,400
Come out!

256
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,480
Qiu Changhao!

257
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,400
Where is Jin Shu?

258
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,440
Good for you.

259
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,200
All you think about is Jin Shu, right?

260
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Is he already out?

261
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,160
Yes.

262
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,880
Let's talk on the way

263
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,120
Let's talk on the way.

264
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,680
You go first.

265
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,480
Tell me clearly.

266
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,920
You... All you think about is Jin Shu, right?

267
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,560
Let me tell you.

268
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,840
You go first. You have two women in your heart.

269
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,720
You're a scumbag.

270
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,920
You scumbag! Let go! Let go!

271
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,560
Let go! Let go!

272
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,480
I'm so mad.

273
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,680
Why did you sleep so well?

274
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,280
You didn't know he ran away.

275
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
You fell into the trap so easily.

276
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,560
I didn't fall into the trap.

277
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,120
I've forced her out with my neigong.

278
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,880
I pretended to sleep when she left.

279
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,800
So cunning.

280
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,040
What are you doing? Let's go. Let's go.

281
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,880
I'm afraid she'll find out.

282
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,720
It's so wide here. Let's go.

283
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,760
You go there

284
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,480
I...

285
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,440
She's gone.

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Why do you sound like I'm taking advantage of him?

287
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,560
Wait for me.

288
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,760
Where is she?

289
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,520
She should know we're following her.

290
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,200
It's all your fault.

291
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,360
Hurry up.

292
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,400
You have long legs for nothing.

293
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,120
Because you hugged me

294
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
because you hugged me.

295
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,080
Who wants to hug you?

296
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,160
I think I hugged you.

297
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Look, he's gone.

298
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,760
What should I do?

299
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
Say something. I'm asking you.

300
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,920
She's nearby.

301
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,680
What else can we do?

302
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
Go home and sleep.

303
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm so sleepy.

304
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,080
Let's go.

305
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,160
I'm exhausted.

306
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,720
I'll go back to sleep.

307
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,680
She's there.
