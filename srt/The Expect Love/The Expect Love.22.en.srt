1
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
It's... It's...

2
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,520
What's wrong with you?

3
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,960
This is the first day

4
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
to take Hengyu separately.

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
You can't sit still so soon?

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Although it's only dozens of meters apart,

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,960
if I really send Hengyu out,

8
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,640
I'll still feel upset.

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's go inside.

10
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,560
My lady. It's here.

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
This is

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
set by the old madam.

13
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,680
It's not appropriate to go now.

14
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,920
But as the saying goes,

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,480
If I bring a gift,

16
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,000
She can't turn me down, can she?

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,800
Yes. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you.

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,160
Miss,

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,160
our monthly gift can afford

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,760
I don’t think she’ll like it.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,120
I have an idea.

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
Hengyu,

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,440
I'll teach you how to read today.

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,800
Turn around. Look.

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,200
Hengyu, look.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,360
I'll read a sentence. Say something.

27
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,200
People are naturally kind.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,240
People are born with good nature.

29
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,840
It's not you.

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Heng Yu, read it.

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,840
People are naturally kind.

32
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
Louder.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,440
People are good in nature.

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,440
Bigger.

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
People are good in nature.

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,440
They have similar personalities and have good taste.

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,000
Sanniang, I don't miss you anymore.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,640
Why don't you study?

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,160
Study is for your own good.

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,360
How can you shine without studying?

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
I don't miss

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,280
I just don’t miss it.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,480
You're so naughty.

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
All right, Hengyu, read it for a while.

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
Miss, Du Ruofei seems

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,480
to give you.

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,360
She's already at the door.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,200
She's in trouble. I...

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,079
Changren.

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,240
Keep an eye on Hengyu. Don't let him cry.

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,520
Keep an eye on him.

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll go meet Du Ruofei

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,480
Jiaoxing, let's go.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,720
Don't cry

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,760
I... I...

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,720
Sister Wan.

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480
Sister Wan is so beautiful today.

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,400
I look so pretty every day.

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,040
Yes. Look at my mouth.

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
Sister Wan is pretty every day.

61
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Right, Chun Ying?

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,640
Yes.

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,920
Are you going to...

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Heng Yu wants to see flowers?

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
I'll pick one for him.

66
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,040
I'll go with you.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,880
No need.

68
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,040
I'll do it myself.

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
Hengyu needs

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,560
a quiet creation environment.

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,560
Chuntou.

72
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,279
I specially prepared this

73
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,480
for Wan.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
are all natural.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,520
Sister Wan, you can try it.

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Leave it. I'm not hungry yet.

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
Third Grandma, this is lipstick.

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,600
My lady made it herself.

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,800
It's just lipstick.

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
I thought it was something else.

81
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,920
This is a lipstick.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,159
You can use this brush

83
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,120
on your mouth.

84
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,920
I can make many colors later.

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,360
Like strawberry pink, maple red,

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,880
and rose purple.

87
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,640
All right.

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,720
It's just one mouth. There's no need to make it so complicated.

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
I'll go inside and give it a try.

90
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,159
I think the pavilion is good

91
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
It's sunny and ventilated.

92
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
Jiaoxing, take the mirror

93
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,400
Okay

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,200
Good.

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,480
Let's go.

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
Miss, this is so beautiful.

97
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,000
This is red.

98
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,080
I can give it to you later.

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
Try the roses.

100
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,520
I think it's still a little sticky.

101
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,160
This is the texture of lipstick.

102
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,280
That's why it's moisturizing.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,800
Elizabeth Taylor once said

104
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,000
the first cosmetics women have

105
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,200
should be lipstick.

106
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Taylor, which village are you from?

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,360
I've never heard of this person

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
I've never heard of this person.

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,560
It doesn't matter. Anyway,

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
This can improve your complexion.

111
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
It can also reduce lip wrinkles.

112
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,120
I added some

113
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,520
some shell powder.

114
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
It can make your mouth

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
shine brightly.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,240
Okay.

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,200
I'll accept it reluctantly.

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
Can I go

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,640
to play with Hengyu?

120
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,920
Jiaoxing.

121
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,360
What is Hengyu doing?

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,760
Young Master is sleeping.

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,720
Listen.

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
Hengyu is sleeping.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't disturb him.

126
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,520
If he misses you,

127
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,320
I'll call you over.

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,320
I'll take a look at the door.

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,440
Just one look?

130
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,280
I'll bring him to you when he wakes up.

131
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Go back.

132
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,200
Okay.

133
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,880
give him these toys.

134
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,560
They were his favorite.

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,760
I know. Don’t worry.

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,560
Jiaoxing, let’s go

137
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,560
Let's go. Let's go.

138
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,560
Okay

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,480
Are you all done eating?

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
You should know

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,640
You should know what it means.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,920
We just want to discuss

143
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,480
Yu'er's custody.

144
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,440
should be given to?

145
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
I choose Ruofei.

146
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
I choose Wan'er, unconditionally.

147
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,160
Sorry, Third Sister-in-law. I choose Ruofei.

148
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,640
Qiu Changle, I…

149
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
I think

150
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,040
the custody

151
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,600
to give Wan'er the custody.

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,560
Mother.

153
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,159
The votes are two to two now.

154
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,560
Who will raise Hengyu?

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,440
We have to settle the score today.

156
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,040
Here we go.

157
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,120
Madam.

158
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
Why is everyone here today?

159
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,080
I came at the right time.

160
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Why is everyone so serious?

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Did I come at the wrong time?

162
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
You came at the right time.

163
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,040
We are discussing

164
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,280
whether the second branch

165
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,320
or the third branch?

166
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,760
You vote.

167
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,360
Your vote

168
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
It's a big deal. It's not a big deal.

169
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,720
I knew it.

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,040
I came at the wrong time.

171
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,080
Ma'am, I'll visit you again.

172
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,960
Come back. Sit down.

173
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,600
Vote.

174
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,600
This is a serious question.

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,480
Sister-in-law.

176
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,039
Sister-in-law, it's you. Sister-in-law.

177
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Mother.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
So the votes are two to three.

179
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,920
Ruofei will take care of Hengyu.

180
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,200
That's it.

181
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,840
Wait a minute.

182
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,080
I choose Sister Wan.

183
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
You're crazy. You're crazy.

184
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,640
Ruofei.

185
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,480
Don't worry.

186
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,680
Sister Wan.

187
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm not trying to steal Heng Yu from you.

188
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm destined to...

189
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
Anyway, I don't have time

190
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
to accompany Hengyu grow up.

191
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
But Hengyu

192
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,200
is different from other kids.

193
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,240
He has to learn from the best.

194
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
I can see

195
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
you are a kind

196
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
and responsible.

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
So...

198
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,040
Cheers.

199
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,840
Okay, I'll drink with you.

200
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,240
That's it then.

201
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,600
Yu'er's custody

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
to Yu'er.

203
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
Sister, here's to you too.

204
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
None of your business.

205
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,040
Let me propose a toast.

206
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,200
Let's have a toast.

207
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay.

208
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:07,960
How is it?

209
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,040
Let's be happy

210
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
Be happy.

211
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,160
Hengyu. Hengyu.

212
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,920
Don't leave me alone.

213
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,840
Don't leave me alone.

214
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,080
You said you can drink.

215
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,320
Don't act tough.

216
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
My toy dog.

217
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
Toy dog.

218
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,400
My toy dog is so comfortable.

219
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,600
Hengyu.

220
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Brother Changhao.

221
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Mochou

222
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Come in

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,720
Tell me about it.

224
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,360
There is a secret order

225
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
there is a secret order from the Censorate.

226
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,120
to investigate Lord Zhang.

227
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,320
The royal agent's court's discipline officials.

228
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,720
Secretly ordered the Supreme Court to investigate.

229
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,520
It's normal.

230
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,720
The Censorate gave a secret order

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
after the investigation.

232
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
No case has been set up.

233
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,240
Lord Jang's case

234
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,280
to the Censorate.

235
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,280
Then where did this letter come from?

236
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,760
It's not normal.

237
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
Besides, if I burn it,

238
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,640
I wouldn't have seen it.

239
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,880
How could it just burn the edge

240
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,720
and keep the main content?

241
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,800
I also saw

242
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,120
The official paper is thick.

243
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
It happens when it burns endlessly.

244
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
But two days ago,

245
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,560
I saw some smoke

246
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
in Lord Ning's fire.

247
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,520
The ashes that remains warm

248
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,880
And he scrubbed the ashes with his fingers.

249
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,000
That means he's very cautious.

250
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,800
But why

251
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,480
were so strict that they burned the ashes.

252
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,480
But this letter is like a child's play.

253
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,880
Why did he

254
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,800
show it to me on purpose?

255
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,200
No, it should be for me.

256
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,440
Ningji knows about our relationship.

257
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,560
He wants to tell me through you.

258
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,760
the Censorate is watching me.

259
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Is Ning Ji

260
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
is the enemy or friend?

261
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,160
This letter is fake.

262
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,360
But what he wanted to tell me

263
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,920
is true.

264
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,800
Ruofei.

265
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,840
My head hurts.

266
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
I drank too much on impulse.

267
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
I made you hangover soup.

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,760
Get up and drink.

269
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,880
Don't you like Hengyu?

270
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,880
Why did you give up in the end?

271
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,200
Because I will wake up sooner or later.

272
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,960
Because I know

273
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
Qi Wan has a good heart.

274
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,040
But the way is not right.

275
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,920
Thank you.

276
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,840
For what?

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,600
Thank you for changing Heng Yu.

278
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,560
We're family.

279
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,880
Don't say that.

280
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,040
Family.

281
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,080
How did I come back?

282
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
I carried you back.

283
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,760
And then?

284
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,320
Then...

285
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,160
I feel like someone is here.

286
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,440
I think there's someone else.

287
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,600
It seems to be a woman.

288
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,720
It looks like...

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What a mess!

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,880
You're still drunk.

291
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,320
Drink more.

292
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,560
How is it?

293
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,440
A little sour.

294
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,520
Changhao.

295
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,800
You're here.

296
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,880
What's wrong?

297
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,640
Why did you

298
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,120
why did you ask me to come here?

299
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,400
We can't talk about home.

300
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,160
We're not suitable at home.

301
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,000
I quarreled with my sister-in-law.

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,960
On the contrary, we are very harmonious.

303
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,360
Why do you think we are so harmonious?

304
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,920
Has she forgiven me?

305
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,080
Isn't harmonious a good thing?

306
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
I always feel that

307
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,960
to her husband.

308
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,640
That's...

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
We're brothers.

310
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,839
She called me best friend

311
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,200
and called me bestie.

312
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,000
Best friend?

313
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,720
What does that mean?

314
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
Like siblings.

315
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
She can scold me calmly

316
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,040
and give me advice.

317
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
When I found Hengyu,

318
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,760
she could hold me and laugh.

319
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
But I feel like

320
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,560
she doesn't treat me as her husband.

321
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,320
She even treats me

322
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,560
friends and friends.

323
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,560
I always feel that

324
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,200
you think too much.

325
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,720
You were talking about a couple.

326
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,840
No.

327
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,800
It's a feeling.

328
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,560
A feeling.

329
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,360
Got it.

330
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,760
Brothers, love and friends, right?

331
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,480
This feeling is very complicated.

332
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,040
How about you take her

333
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,160
to Guilan Fang?

334
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,400
When you go there,

335
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,560
you will find

336
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,200
this is a bad idea.

337
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,840
I just think

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,000
you are always

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,920
too serious,

340
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
It's hard to

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,120
feel your feelings.

342
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
If she really doesn't like me,

343
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
and sees me as her brother,

344
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,840
What should I do?

345
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,560
Both of you are married.

346
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,360
Why are you still worried about this?

347
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,920
Well...

348
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,440
She won't let you touch her.

349
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Hi Music
