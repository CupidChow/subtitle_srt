1
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,440
Miss!

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Come back! Come back!

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,920
Come back.

4
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,640
Miss. Miss.

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,680
Chun Ying.

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,520
Young Master.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,680
She’s here. She’s here.

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
Miss.

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,560
Miss is sleeping with Young Master.

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,720
Why are you stuttering?

11
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,720
Why is she sleeping at this hour?

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,759
She might be sleepy.

13
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,440
I’m sleepy.

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,080
Young Master.

15
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
My Lady said no one is allowed to disturb you.

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,880
Am I an outsider?

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:08,960
Young Master.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,440
Did she take Hengyu out to play?

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,320
She...

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,079
How long has she been out?

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,320
Two hours.

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,520
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,600
He's here. He's here.

24
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,320
Hengyu, where are you? I'm here.

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Sir,

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,160
Did you see a kid

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,280
He's so tall. He's wearing blue.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,520
No.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,480
Hengyu. Hengyu.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
It's really good.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,320
Hengyu. Hengyu.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,760
What are you doing?

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,079
Robbing the child in broad daylight

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,680
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,360
Where did you come from?

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
You rascal!

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Get lost!

39
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's go, Xiaobao.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Sorry.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
Go! Go! Go!

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
Hengyu. Yes.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,720
She's here. She's here. She's here.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,640
Where's Hengyu? It's here. It's here. It's here.

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,280
Lost it?

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,120
What happened?

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,680
I took him to the trap.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,960
But when I went to buy a trap,

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,720
he disappeared.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,079
I've been looking for him.

52
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,240
but I couldn't find him.

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,120
You go east and I'll go west.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
We'll meet here before dark.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,280
Okay.

56
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:29,600
It's here. It's here.

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,920
What is it?

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Yu'er is missing.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:36,920
Mother.

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,600
I'll ask everyone in the mansion

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,920
to find Hengyu.

62
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,480
Why are you still standing here?

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,320
Hurry up.

64
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,280
Jiaoxing

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,520
Don't touch me!

66
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,120
Yu'er! Yu'er!

67
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,840
Qiu Changren.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,960
Where are you going?

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm going to play crickets with my friends. What's wrong?

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Hengyu is missing.

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go find Hengyu.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Wait.

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
What's going on? Explain to me.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Miss, so many people are looking for you.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,640
You don't have to.

76
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
What nonsense are you talking about?

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,560
We lost our child.

78
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,240
How can I not be anxious?

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,440
Let's go.

80
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,279
Wait a minute

81
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,000
Jiaoxing Jiaoxing

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Jiaoxing

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
Just wait at home.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
What if Hengyu comes back?

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,920
Okay.

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,520
Let's go.

87
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,000
Isn't it pretty?

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,320
Have you seen this child?

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
No.

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,600
Have you seen this child

91
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I think so.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,920
No. No.

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
You can’t find him like this, Qiu Changle.

94
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
What else can I do?

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
Send more men. Yes, Your Highness.

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,360
Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,159
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

98
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,560
The portrait of the child was just sent from the Xun family.

100
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Remember it.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Search every corner.

102
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,800
and find the child.

103
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,560
will be greatly rewarded.

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Give him 10,000 taels of gold.

105
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,360
Yes.

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
Hurry up.

107
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,240
Yes

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Over there too.

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Don't you need to go there? Yes.

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,640
Okay.

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Go.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm on it.

113
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
Keep looking.

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,280
Miss,

115
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,840
You've been standing here for a long time.

116
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
Are you buying or not?

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
I'll wait for Hengyu. I'll buy it for you. I'll buy it for you. I'll buy it for you. I'll buy it for you.

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,080
Do you want to buy it?

119
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
lean over here.

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,240
Don't delay my business.

121
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,240
I lost my child.

122
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,880
Can you show some sympathy?

123
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,960
What?

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Where did you lose the kid?

125
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,400
When I turned around to buy a trap,

126
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,280
He disappeared.

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,160
Did he report to the police?

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Yes.

129
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,280
Since you've reported it to the government,

130
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,360
don't wait here.

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,480
Go home and listen.

132
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,400
Miss.

133
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,120
He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

134
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
It's my fault.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
Don't cry. Don't cry.

137
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Boss.

138
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,800
Can I put it here?

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,760
Missing Person Notice?

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,720
There are many people here.

141
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Maybe he can see it.

142
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
No problem.

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,159
Thank you, boss.

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,720
Thank you, boss.

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
Let's go somewhere else.

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Maybe he can see us more.

147
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,320
Let's go.

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,320
Thank you.

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,280
Ruofei, eat something.

150
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,960
Don't worry. I'll find it.

151
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Poppet.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Stir-fried sugar-coated haws with yogurt.

153
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,840
You crazy bitch!

154
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,680
What did you say? I don't understand.

155
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,520
The baby is back. Fried yogurt.

156
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,240
Go away.

157
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
I’m doing business. Fried yogurt.

158
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
Fried yogurt, fried yogurt Tanghulu.

159
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,880
This is fried yogurt Tanghulu.

160
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,600
He'll be happy if you give it to Poppet.

161
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,880
Stir-fried candied haws with yogurt.

162
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm happy.

163
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,640
Here you go.

164
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,080
Here's the money.

165
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,480
Sugar-coated haws. Thank you.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
I'm so happy.

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,400
Come on. Come on.

168
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm happy.

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,600
Xiaobao, I'm here.

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,520
Xiaobao

171
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,680
Poppet! Poppet!

172
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
I think Hengyu must be here.

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
Hengyu! Hengyu!

174
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,600
Stop! Stop!

175
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Move! Move! Move! Move!

176
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,040
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

177
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,160
No! Get out of the way!

178
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Don't snatch! Don't snatch!

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,720
Hengyu! Hengyu!

180
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't worry, we're not bad people.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,240
Don't take my baby.

182
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
We won't take it away.

183
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,960
Don't be afraid.

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Feifei.

185
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,760
Hengyu.

186
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Hengyu! Hengyu!

187
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
It's really you, Hengyu.

188
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
Why are you tied up?

189
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

190
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
Are you hurt?

191
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
Are you hungry?

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,680
Did you sleep well and eat well?

193
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,360
Did they hit you?

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Fei, I won’t run around again.

195
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
It’s not your fault.

196
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,320
It's all my fault.

197
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,880
I didn’t take good care of you. I’m sorry.

198
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,920
Fei, I’m hungry. I want to eat fried yogurt.

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,120
I’ll cook for you.

200
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
Feifei will cook whatever you want.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,720
Let's go home.

202
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Let me see.

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,920
Let's go. Let's go.

204
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Hengyu!

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
Don't take my Xiaobao away!

206
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,200
We won't.

207
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,000
Look, Poppet.

208
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,440
I bought you delicious food.

209
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Fried yogurt.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
Fei, I want to talk to her.

211
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Hengyu.

212
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,680
I'm not hungry. Have some.

213
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Poppet gave me something delicious.

214
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Delicious food. Xiaobao gave it to me. Delicious food.

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Hengyu, you must be hungry these days.

216
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,920
I made

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,320
your favorite almond tofu.

218
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,400
Try it.

219
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
I want to eat yogurt. Okay. Okay.

220
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
Stir-fried sour? Yes.

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,640
Hengyu, have an orange.

222
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
What tangerine

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,680
Hengyu

224
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,200
I made almond tofu specially for you.

225
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
It's delicious.

226
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,920
Try it. It must be good.

227
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
I want to eat fried yogurt.

228
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
I don't know how to fry yogurt

229
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Almond tofu is also delicious, Hengyu.

230
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Hengyu. Hengyu.

231
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,400
Stir-fried yogurt. It's here. It's here. It's here.

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,920
Hengyu.

233
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
I'll cook yogurt for you. Here.

234
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,080
Fried yogurt is better.

235
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,400
I'll make it for you. I'll make it for you.

236
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,080
Wait for me.

237
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
Hengyu, let's continue.

238
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,480
Here, let me feed you.

239
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,200
It's delicious, right? It's delicious.

240
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,640
Hello. Hello.

241
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,440
Hello. Hello.

242
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,760
Have a rest.

243
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,480
Hengyu likes my fried yogurt.

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,880
I need to make more for him.

245
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Hengyu has been found.

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,280
Don't blame yourself too much.

247
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,560
Have a good rest.

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
I'll bring it to him.

249
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,520
Sorry, Changhao.

250
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,640
It's all my fault.

251
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,960
If I hadn't taken him out,

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Hengyu wouldn't have been lost.

253
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
Let's go back and rest. Okay.

254
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,120
Let's go.

255
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,120
It's here! It's here! It's here!

256
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,480
Look who's here. Yu'er.

257
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,200
Come here.

258
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,120
Yu'er.

259
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Come here.

260
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,200
Yu'er.

261
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
Let me take a good look at you.

262
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,560
Have you lost weight?

263
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
I feel so bad for Grandma.

264
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,400
Yu'er, I have

265
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,160
with sticky cakes and birds.

266
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,360
Do you want to play?

267
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
Come with me.

268
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,360
Let's go. Let's go.

269
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,040
Mother!

270
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Mother.

271
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
Have a taste.

272
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,840
What's this weird thing?

273
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm not eating it.

274
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,440
Grandma, the yogurt is delicious. Try it.

275
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Yu'er, you're so good.

276
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,720
I'm not eating.

277
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,280
Grandma, this is for you.

278
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,600
for Yu'er, okay?

279
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,720
Mother, I know I was wrong.

280
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,440
I shouldn't have taken Hengyu out secretly.

281
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,880
I almost lost it.

282
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,440
But I just want him to

283
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
with outsiders.

284
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,920
I mean no harm.

285
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,120
I won't do it again.

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
There's a next time.

287
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Mother.

288
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,800
Ruofei knows she was wrong.

289
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
She didn't sleep for two days to find Hengyu.

290
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,720
Grandma, I want to play with Feifei.

291
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
Go if you want. Go.

292
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,760
Mother.

293
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,640
Go.

294
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,640
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

295
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Let's go.

296
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,480
Let's go. Let's go.

297
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
Mother.

298
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,200
shouldn't Hengyu take him with him?

299
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,680
He is usually busy with work.

300
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,600
Sister-in-law is still a child.

301
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,600
I've been thinking about this recently.

302
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,800
Although she is reckless,

303
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,600
she has a good heart for Yu'er.

304
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
After Yu'er followed her,

305
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,360
she's willing to talk.

306
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm kind of dependent on her.

307
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,040
That makes sense.

308
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,520
But Mother,

309
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,040
Hengyu is still young.

310
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
Safety is the most important thing.

311
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,440
And I'm good at education.

312
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
You're good at it too?

313
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
Let me tell you.

314
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,000
raising a child

315
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,880
to raise a child.

316
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,840
Eat, drink, poop, and study.

317
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,440
All are knowledge

318
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
You don't believe me?

319
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,920
You can have a try.

320
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,040
Don’t say that.

321
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,280
whether Yu’Er

322
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,480
or the third house?

323
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,920
We have to vote for them.

324
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,320
Okay.

325
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,480
What mother said

326
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
are just three things.

327
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,280
Study, health and diet.

328
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,960
I can teach him. Don't worry.

329
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Don't.

330
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,080
You ancient people are teaching duck-filling.

331
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,520
I must let Hengyu feel

332
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,760
the joy of reading.

333
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,480
This health

334
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
Strengthen your body.

335
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,440
I can teach him martial arts.

336
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,240
But I can't

337
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,040
I can't cook.

338
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
Ruofei, you need to go.

339
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,280
Hengyu.

340
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,560
Hengyu! Hengyu!

341
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,840
Hengyu.

342
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,400
Hengyu.

343
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,120
Sit down.

344
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,760
Repeat the story I told you before.

345
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,120
I told you before.

346
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,000
You said it.

347
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,800
I'll reward you with milk cake.

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,160
I won't eat it.

349
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,120
Hengyu.

350
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,640
Let me tell you the story of Kong Rong and Li.

351
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,920
Okay.

352
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,240
Say something. Say something.

353
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,920
Kong Rong, your words are written. You're from Lu.

354
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,440
Confucius has 20 generations of descendants.

355
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,359
Read it.

356
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,160
Kong Rong. Lift. Lu. Lift.

357
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,800
Fei.

358
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
She’s here. She’s here. She’s here.

359
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,440
Why is she here?

360
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,480
She's studying so early.

361
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,240
What are you learning?

362
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,840
Kong Rong, let's go.

363
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,400
I've asked around.

364
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,360
The children of a wealthy family in Fengcheng

365
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,320
all read this.

366
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
Your books

367
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
are useless to children.

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,680
Think about it.

369
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
The younger brother got it

370
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,440
to get the pear.

371
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
But Kong Rong kept giving in.

372
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,320
Has anyone ever cared

373
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,920
Does a younger brother need pears or not?

374
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,480
Has anyone ever cared

375
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,160
whether Kong Rong is happy or not?

376
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
And you let him learn these.

377
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,680
When he meets something he likes,

378
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,840
when he meets something he likes.

379
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,480
But he's a boy.

380
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,640
When he meets something he likes,

381
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,240
you should fight for it bravely.

382
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,160
Am I right, Hengyu?

383
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,640
Good girl.

384
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,640
Du Ruofei.

385
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,520
Are you questioning the teacher?

386
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,480
That's right. You can't teach them well.

387
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Don't disturb others.

388
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,160
That's right.

389
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,920
Don't talk about the teacher.

390
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,000
I mean

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,040
He can’t listen now. Understand?

392
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,520
I want to play with Feifei.

393
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,800
Look at what she said.

394
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Let's see what you can teach Heng Yu.

395
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
If you can teach Hengyu,

396
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,080
you win.

397
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,040
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
