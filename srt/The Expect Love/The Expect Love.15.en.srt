1
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,880
He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

2
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,880
Hengyu.

3
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,160
Hengyu likes plants.

4
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,240
But you can't see clearly

5
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
with your eyes.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,440
I have a very good invention.

7
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Do you want to see it?

8
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,440
More water. Okay.

9
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,160
Okay.

10
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,600
Isn't it amazing?

11
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Is it bigger

12
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,520
This is called magnifying mirror.

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,480
It can magnify

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,200
Zoom in.

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Look at this. Look at this.

16
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600
Isn't it pretty

17
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,840
Am I getting bigger too

18
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,120
What's wrong, madam?

19
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,000
I heard that

20
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,079
Du Ruofei

21
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,040
is having fun with her kid.

22
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,760
And then?

23
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,880
She lied to me.

24
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,520
What did she lie to you?

25
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,920
She told me

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,040
She's still playing with her child at this hour.

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,440
It'll affect Hengyu's health.

28
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,640
Right.

29
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,480
I don't think she knows how to raise children.

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,920
She's not as good as Madam.

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,160
Changren, can you tell me

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,760
to raise Hengyu here?

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Du Ruofei looks unreliable.

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,000
Will he agree?

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
No.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
You still have a mother, right?

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,040
Madam, our family relies on Second Brother.

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,640
Even mother has to respect Second Brother.

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
How can you just let him go?

40
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,840
I'm not giving him enough face.

41
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,240
If I had a baby,

42
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I wouldn't be like this.

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Let's go to bed.

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,080
Let's go.

45
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,160
Come on. Come on.

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
I just took a break.

47
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,560
Hengyu, what are you looking at?

48
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,880
Let's take a starlight bath.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,440
Come on.

50
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
Lean comfortably.

51
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,880
Close your eyes.

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,680
Listen to Feifei, okay?

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,400
OK?

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Imagine now

55
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,880
A pair of gentle hands reached out in the starlight

56
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,480
Then it gently touched your face.

57
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
and touch your head.

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,200
Hengyu, can you feel it?

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,520
Actually, that's my hand.

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,960
Listen to me.

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
The adults told you

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,880
that my father went far away.

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,200
I wasn't lying to you.

64
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,480
Father did go far away,

65
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,200
but he never left you.

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,560
He just became a star in the sky.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,520
in a different way.

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
to protect you.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
As long as you are happy,

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
I will see you.

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,000
Although

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,920
I can't stay by your side forever.

73
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,960
But...

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,400
do you remember that you still have me?

75
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
I will love you like your father.

76
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,800
right?

77
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,960
It's like this.

78
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,240
No.

79
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,560
Why do you always show up?

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I didn't expect you to be so close

81
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
You're so close to your kid.

82
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Of course.

83
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Hengyu is kissing me now.

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Are you envious of me?

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
It's getting late.

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
Take the kid back to rest.

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
I like it, Fei.

88
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,600
Hengyu, what did you say?

89
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,240
Can you say it again?

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,360
Fei.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,240
She’s here.

92
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,960
She’s here. She’s here.

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,400
He’s here. He’s here.

94
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,040
"Er fu (sounds like)."

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,400
"Uncle", "Uncle", "Uncle", "Uncle", and "Uncle", "Uncle", "Uncle", and "Uncle", "Uncle", and "Uncle", "Uncle", and "Uncle".

96
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,600
Uncle.

97
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
Ruofei, thank you.

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,280
One more time.

99
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,280
Uncle.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,440
Thank you for your patience.

101
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
to help Hengyu get better.

102
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,280
I really like Hengyu.

103
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,600
Just one.

104
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,640
Come on. Let's go.

105
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm...

106
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,159
I...

107
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
Can't you say something

109
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,040
what an idol drama should have?

110
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,400
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm sorry again.

112
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,440
What did you do to me this time?

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,560
It's getting late.

114
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,960
Let's go back and rest.

115
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,760
It means

116
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
It's different today.

117
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,560
What's wrong with him?

118
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,960
Why didn't you lay the floor?

119
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,520
No, I have to tell her.

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,159
I have something to tell you.

121
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,080
Think before you speak.

122
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,880
Tell me honestly.

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Don't regret if you're done.

124
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
I hesitated for a long time.

125
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,720
I didn't dare to face my heart.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,040
But when I found out who you really are,

127
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,960
I realized

128
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
why I couldn't help but

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,960
I can't decide.

130
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
You finally believe me.

131
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
I trust you.

132
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,200
You know what to say now, right?

133
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
I know. Three words.

134
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,680
Oh my god.

135
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
It's finally time for this iron tree to bloom.

136
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,480
I can go back to take the exam.

137
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,760
Come on. I'm ready.

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,240
Ruofei.

139
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Oh, my God.

140
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,080
He's so formal.

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,480
What if he takes out another ring?

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,160
What should I do?

143
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,360
Can I take the ring?

144
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,280
Can you give me some time to say yes?

145
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,720
It's too sudden.

146
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,480
Sorry.

147
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,440
It's over. It's over. It's over.

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,880
That's it. That's it.

149
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,160
Just three words.

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,520
Just three words.

151
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
You've given me so much advice.

152
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
Do you know how many people

153
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,560
are watching us at double speed?

154
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,040
A tiger doesn't show its power. A tiger doesn't show its power.

155
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
You think she’s a cat?

156
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
If I don't punish her today, I won't be surnamed Du.

157
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,600
I'll kill you, Ruofei!

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
I'll kill you!

159
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,880
Ruofei!

160
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
I'll kill you.

161
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,600
More.

162
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
Ruofei.

163
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,800
Sister, you're here. Have a seat.

164
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,560
What's wrong with you?

165
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,840
The clouds you embroidered

166
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
are the same as mine now.

167
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,280
Wuyun

168
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,720
It's a mandarin duck. It's a mandarin duck. It's a mandarin duck.

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:52,920
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

170
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
You look like her. You look like her.

171
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
You do sound like her

172
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,600
You can see it if you look at it hard.

173
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,000
Forget it then.

174
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
Your second brother is a straight man.

175
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
I guess he has no imagination.

176
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,760
A straight man.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
He's a man who can't change his mind.

178
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
I think he's a straight man too.

179
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,840
Why?

180
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,720
Since we parted at Wangyue Bridge last time,

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360
he never wrote to me again.

182
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,640
or asked me out.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,960
Is he in love

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,920
someone else's girl?

185
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,680
What should I do?

186
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
No.

187
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
It's over.

188
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,320
Oh no.

189
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,680
Did I say that last time?

190
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
scared him away?

191
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,400
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
He must be busy.

193
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,600
Then you should've told me in advance.

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah.

195
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,320
Miss Changle.

196
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,360
Our Song Quan is busy.

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,480
It's normal to work at night.

198
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,560
No, Changle.

199
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,520
I think we should

200
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,280
we need to make an emergency combat plan

201
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,360
to make him curious about you again.

202
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,440
You have an idea?

203
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,640
There's a way.

204
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,360
Great. Great.

205
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,440
Let's go. Let's go.

206
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,480
Miss.

207
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
Wait for me!

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,360
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

209
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,920
Mother!

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,000
What are they doing?

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,280
The butler told me

212
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,840
Changle left all the lanterns

213
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,480
all the lanterns in the mansion.

214
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Lanterns?

215
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,480
Why does she need so many lanterns?

216
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,520
She said it was to attract

217
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,600
At night,

218
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
All the servants and maids in the mansion

219
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,120
were called there.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,720
I think

221
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
it must be Du Ruofei's idea.

222
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,440
That's ridiculous.

223
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,720
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

224
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,080
It's here. It's here.

225
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,440
This is not right.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,080
Why is that lantern there

227
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
It's almost there.

228
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,560
This one.

229
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,960
Afu, Yinqi.

230
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Take these two lanterns.

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
This is my lifelong happiness.

232
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,280
Okay.

233
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,880
Chun Ying.

234
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,400
Put them there.

235
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,040
Hurry up.

236
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,400
If my brother and my wife know about this,

237
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,000
It's bad.

238
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,120
Ruofei! What are you doing?

239
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,120
Ruofei.

240
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,040
How is it? How is it?

241
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
Almost. Almost.

242
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,840
Come up and have a look.

243
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:05,920
Okay.

244
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,560
How is it?

245
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,360
As long as I fly through the sky at night,

246
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,080
he will definitely see these words.

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,240
Ruofei is great.

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
I must wait until the night comes.

249
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
Alright, Changle.

250
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,760
Let’s rehearse.

251
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,680
Rehearse. Rehearse.

252
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,240
Come on. Come on.

253
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
You’re here. Hello.

254
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm late.

255
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,760
I'm glad you came.

256
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,320
You prepared all these for me.

257
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
I prayed day and night

258
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,480
to see you sooner.

259
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,080
You don't have to do this.

260
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Just miss me.

261
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
I'll come.

262
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,640
You're so nice.

263
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,600
It's my fault.

264
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,000
I was too busy.

265
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
I neglected your feelings.

266
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,600
I forgot to write to you.

267
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,440
I promise I won't do it again.

268
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,120
I'm glad to hear that.

269
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I’m satisfied.

270
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Qiu Changle.

271
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,920
Qiu Changle.

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
Why don’t you sleep?

273
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,720
What are you doing here?

274
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,880
I'm waiting for you here at night.

275
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,600
It's late again.

276
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,640
You're a girl.

277
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
Don’t you feel ashamed?

278
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,240
Changle.

279
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,120
And you.

280
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
What are you doing here?

281
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Wait for the reward

282
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,040
Stop right there!

283
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
Stop! Stop!

284
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,840
If you don't see me tonight,

285
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Don't run!

286
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
Come back!

287
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,560
No.

288
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,200
Changle. Mother.

289
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,760
Changle, did she yell at me just now?

290
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,320
No.

291
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,880
Changle, apologize to mother.

292
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,000
I’m mean to you.

293
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,560
She is. She is.

294
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:30,880
Changle,

295
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
Don’t yell at me.

296
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
I must teach you a lesson today.

297
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,000
Hit me!

298
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,240
Mother!

299
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,120
Mother, calm down.

300
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,280
I'm going to kill you today.

301
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,440
Shouldn't you stop her?

302
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,160
Changle, apologize to mother.

303
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,320
Come here!

304
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm going to kill you!

305
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,360
Go! Go!

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,560
Help!

307
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,240
Come on! Come on!

308
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,680
Help! Help!

309
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,120
Stop it! Stop it!

310
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,640
My son! My son!

311
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,600
Are you okay?

312
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,680
I'm fine

313
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
Let me see. Come on.

314
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,200
It's okay.

315
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,160
It's all your fault.

316
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

317
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
With your reaction speed,

318
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,240
how did you become the Deputy Minister of Justice?

319
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,040
Let me ask you.

320
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,640
Did you teach Changle’s idea?

321
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Didn’t you tell me

322
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,560
she could leave me at night?

323
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Why is she more presumptuous?

324
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,680
How come?

325
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,320
Look at him.

326
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
used to be homeless.

327
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,760
Now it's just

328
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,120
in the yard at most.

329
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,520
You've made great progress

330
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,880
That's true.

331
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Can't they break up?

332
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Even if we break up, we can't.

333
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,040
we can decide.

334
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,160
Then I'll go down at night.

335
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you sure? Yes.

336
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm sure. I'm sure.

337
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,560
I also know that

338
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,520
it’s either I’ll be killed

339
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,160
or Qiu Changle.

340
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,600
So serious?

341
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,760
Of course. All girls have this stage.

342
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,400
What about you?

343
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,120
Of course I only care about you.

344
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,119
I'm going back to take the exam.

345
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,920
It's stuck here.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,760
Where are my eggs?

347
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,800
It's like this.

348
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:19,839
This...

349
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,440
Go brush your teeth.

350
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,360
Go to bed.

351
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,960
What is this?

352
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,520
This is my new tooth powder.

353
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,840
Toothpowder.

354
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,280
It's like this.

355
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,600
with mint.

356
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,320
It can refresh your teeth.

357
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,800
Use this to brush your teeth.

358
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
You don't have to chew branches anymore.

359
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,320
How to use it?

360
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,040
Let me teach you.

361
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,760
Why do I feel so silly?

362
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
She seems to know everything.

363
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,080
What?

364
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,400
You can't brush it like this.

365
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,440
How?

366
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,600
Open your mouth.

367
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,680
Open your mouth.

368
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Open your mouth.

369
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,440
Here. Here.

370
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,320
Can we sleep now?

371
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,360
It's not good for a couple to sleep separately.
