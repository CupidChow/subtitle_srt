1
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,840
You can't even do it. You can't do it. You can do it.

2
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,039
Can't you do it well?

3
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,840
So stupid.

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
In our mansion,

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,600
in our mansion.

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,960
If you don't care, I will.

7
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,880
You're so stupid.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
What's wrong, Chun Ying?

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,080
Miss.

10
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,920
It's too hot. I forgot to put the milk in the cellar.

11
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
It's just a bucket of milk.

12
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320
There are several buckets in the cellar.

13
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,560
What are you talking about?

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
This milk is a tribute from the countries.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,680
It's expensive.

16
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
Even if our family is rich,

17
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,160
we can’t waste it.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
When I was young,

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
I wanted to drink more.

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,320
Who said I'm wasting it?

21
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,360
I didn't say I would throw it away.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
I'll keep it for myself.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
You really opened my eyes.

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,280
Fine.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,960
Then keep it for yourself.

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,200
Jiaoxing, let's go

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
I'll show you then.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,280
Miss, I'll drink it.

29
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,200
Let me see.

30
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
This might be a good thing.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,720
How about this?

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,600
Take this to Hengyu for me.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,240
See you in the kitchen.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,880
Okay.

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,880
Chun Ying.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,720
How's my fire?

37
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,440
The fire is almost put out.

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
Miss, do you want some firewood?

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,720
Let me have a look.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,760
It's okay

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,320
The production temperature of yogurt is about 40 degrees.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,160
It's similar to human temperature.

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,000
So we use the remaining heat of the stove to ferment.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,680
That's it.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,440
Miss.

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,240
Can we go back

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,960
after this?

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
Not yet.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,960
We need to add firewood every two hours.

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
You people are troublesome in ancient times.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,760
Without a heater,

52
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
we need someone to keep an eye on it.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
We have to keep watching.

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
But good food is not late.

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,360
Why isn't she here yet?

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you stalking me?

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
I have no time to play with you.

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,960
What is it?

59
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,080
Stay alert.

60
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,800
I will definitely appear here at night.

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
Listen to my whistle then.

62
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,400
Are you going to ambush me at night?

63
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,880
Come out.

64
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Stop hiding.

65
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,159
I knew it was you.

66
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,159
What?

67
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,880
A one-on-one but a gang fight?

68
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,560
You're bullying me with more people.

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,040
Despicable!

70
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
Someone molested me at night.

71
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,320
Someone molested me at night.

72
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,480
Let's go.

73
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,080
Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,440
Your Majesty.

75
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,360
Thank you for saving me.

76
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,600
It's late. Go home.

77
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,280
Okay, I'll be right back.

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,200
He told me to go home early.

79
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Hengyu, are you hurt?

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's inside?

81
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,720
Hengyu.

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Where are you going at this hour?

83
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,880
You're back.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,480
Let me see.

85
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,840
My assistant is really capable.

86
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,080
Next,

87
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,040
is the time to witness a miracle again.

88
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,120
One more.

89
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Frozen it

90
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,840
Do you like strawberries?

91
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,960
More of this.

92
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,600
Next, stir-fry.

93
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Stir-fry.

94
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,320
This might take some time.

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,480
Let's wait a moment.

96
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,800
It's frozen

97
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,919
Okay, you can cut it now.

98
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,880
Cut. Cut.

99
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Okay. Okay.

100
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Sheng.

101
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,159
Sheng.

102
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,960
It's done.

103
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,920
What are you doing?

104
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,000
You're back.

105
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,760
Good.

106
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I'll make you some new yogurt.

107
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,400
It's delicious.

108
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Try it.

109
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,760
No.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,160
No, try it.

111
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,680
I'm not hungry.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,480
Open your mouth.

113
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,360
Is this edible?

114
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,680
Yes, try it.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Come on. Open your mouth.

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,080
Open your mouth

117
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
How is it? Is it good?

118
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Isn't it cold?

119
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
Why is it so cold?

120
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,840
I forgot to tell you to take a small bite.

121
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,040
Take it easy.

122
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,240
Hengyu.

123
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,120
Here. Have a taste. It's good. It's good.

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,280
Try it. It's good. It's good. It's good.

125
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,080
Is it good?

126
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,520
I want to eat too. Feed me.

127
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
You've become bad, Hengyu.

128
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,120
I want some too.

129
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,520
Can I have a bite?

130
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,840
Thank you for taking care of Hengyu.

131
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,520
I'll take him back to rest.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,280
Okay.

133
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,080
Go.

134
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,560
Bye. Let's go.

135
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
It's good that he can get close to you.

136
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
I hope you can treat him sincerely.

137
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
What you said

138
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,760
like I'm a vicious stepmother.

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,560
Don't worry. I like Hengyu.

140
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Unfortunately, he can't speak.

141
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
He's not a mute.

142
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,280
So what? Why are you so fierce?

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,280
Hengyu wasn't like this before.

144
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Not only can he talk,

145
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,160
but also sings.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Did he become like this

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
after brother passed away?

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,800
My sister-in-law passed away when she gave birth to Hengyu.

149
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
My brother didn't renew it.

150
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
He loves Heng Yu very much.

151
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,320
That's why we dare not tell Heng Yu

152
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,240
Hengyu's death.

153
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,800
and told him that

154
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,560
his father went out to work.

155
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,040
Children's instincts are the most sensitive.

156
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,520
If you don’t tell him, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t know.

157
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,840
This is the biggest taboo of our family.

158
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,200
I hope you can keep your mouth shut in front of Hengyu.

159
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,720
I think as long as Hengyu can speak,

160
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
as long as he can speak.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,680
I've tried it.

162
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,760
It's not working. It's not working.

163
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,160
Before this,

164
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,240
I volunteered in a welfare home during summer vacation.

165
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,480
I met a few kids like him.

166
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,840
To make them cheerful,

167
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,440
I often taught them how to draw.

168
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
orphanage, volunteer,

169
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,600
It's an institution.

170
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,520
That's not the point.

171
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,960
The point is to teach them how to draw.

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
It's really useful.

173
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,640
I hope it's not in vain.

174
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Don't worry.

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,880
Du Ruofei

176
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
is really strange.

177
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,680
Who is she?

178
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,720
Hengyu, let's draw today.

179
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,360
Let me show you first.

180
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,560
This is grass.

181
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,440
This is Xiao Hua.

182
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,480
This is Haoshu.

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,080
Hengyu, do you want to try it?

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Hengyu is so good at painting?

185
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,000
It's like Picasso is alive.

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,520
Hengyu, after you finish,

187
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,520
do you want your uncle

188
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,280
send this painting to your father who's far away?

189
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,640
I...

190
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,720
I mean,

191
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
your painting is so good.

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,160
If you don't want to make your father happy, one...

193
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Hengyu, no.

194
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,520
Hengyu Hengyu

195
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,040
What is this?

196
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,360
What is this drawing?

197
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
This one

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm a child researcher.

199
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,680
You're really something.

200
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,120
Miss.

201
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Chun Ying.

202
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Can you

203
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't be so surprised.

204
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,360
You scared me to death.

205
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,200
You scared me.

206
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,080
I thought you had a nosebleed.

207
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,400
I've been looking at your nose for half a day.

208
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
I'm not a doctor.

209
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,920
This is called psychology.

210
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,840
You have blood in your heart.

211
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
She's angry.

212
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,960
Ssukssuk.

213
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,880
Go go

214
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
A five-year-old kid shouldn't be angry.

215
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,120
Fire

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,600
Yes, fire.

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,560
Chuntou, you're really talented.

218
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice to find Changhao.

219
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:50,920
Miss.

220
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I want to go to the Ministry of Justice too.

221
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,080
What are you doing there?

222
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,120
Me too.

223
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,120
The flame of love.

224
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,120
Let's go.

225
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,040
Greetings, Lord Wei.

226
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Hello, Miss Chun Ying.

227
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:11,960
You?

228
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,280
You know my name.

229
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Yes.

230
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,880
She specifically asked me

231
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
a dinner date.

232
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
Yes, a dinner date.

233
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm not talented enough.

234
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,560
I don't know what dinner is.

235
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,680
I'll cook whatever you like.

236
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,360
So I like a lot of food.

237
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,680
I've never been picky.

238
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,800
Not picky?

239
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
That's good.

240
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
But I don't know

241
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,960
if you like it.

242
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,160
Which bowl of rice?

243
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Nothing.

244
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,640
Miss Chun Hua.

245
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
I have a question for you.

246
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,320
Do you know how to cook?

247
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,760
Yes.

248
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,720
How about Beijing Roast Duck?

249
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,280
I can do it too.

250
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,000
Northeast Iron Pot.

251
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,840
Me too.

252
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,640
You're an expert. Let's talk on the way.

253
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,080
Sure

254
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
The kitchen is over there

255
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,440
Great

256
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,000
We bought chicken, fish, duck

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,520
Yes I can

258
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
What am I doing here?

259
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,760
Right, Changhao.

260
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Changhao.

261
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,040
He doesn't like to date people.

262
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
He is not close to any party.

263
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,680
He is a loner.

264
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,120
He once argued with

265
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,840
in the hall.

266
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Does he hate you because of this?

267
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Changhao!

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
Changhao. Changhao.

269
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,400
I...

270
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,040
Slow down.

271
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,360
Are you okay?

272
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Do I look okay?

273
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,840
You're always so reckless in the government office.

274
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,800
I have something important to tell you.

275
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,320
You're still scolding me even though my knees are bald.

276
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,360
Are you even human?

277
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
That's too much.

278
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,600
My leg.

279
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,280
Will it leave a scar?

280
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm so unlucky.

281
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,840
It hurts.

282
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,120
Let me apply the medicine for you.

283
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,080
Can this medicine work?

284
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,560
It hurts. It hurts.

285
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,520
It hurts.

286
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,680
Bear with it.

287
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
Why are you so careless?

288
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,080
Your threshold is like a crossing.

289
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Can you blame me?

290
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,040
You have to walk slower.

291
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,480
If you keep running like this,

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
if you run around like this.

293
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,840
Where are you from, Lord Wei?

294
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,080
My surname is Wei. I'm from Wei Village.

295
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,680
It's not far.

296
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,520
Where is your hometown?

297
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,120
I'll be wherever you are.

298
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,560
It's not far.

299
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,560
Lord Wei.

300
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,079
In order to thank you for your help,

301
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,720
I made you a sachet.

302
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,839
I wonder if you like it.

303
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,359
Miss Chun Ying is really kind and skillful.

304
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
My lord, look.

305
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,160
This pine tree represents you.

306
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,400
What about this chicken?

307
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
No, it's a bird.

308
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,320
Of course it represents me.

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,480
It's so pretty.

310
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,480
What happened to your face?

311
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,680
My face.

312
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,640
I'm fine I'm just a little dizzy

313
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,680
Sir, your face...

314
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,200
I...

315
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,320
Well...

316
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm a little dizzy too.

317
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,080
Tell me, what's the matter?

318
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,080
See for yourself.

319
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,560
Looks like something I'm worried about has happened.

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,560
Hi Music
