1
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:38,920
It's like this.

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,560
This is uncomfortable

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
What is the blue spots

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,240
This spotted is Pruslablue.

5
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,479
It can prove that the assassins

6
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,320
died after eating cyanide yesterday.

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,039
Evidence.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,720
What is cyanide?

9
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,000
A kind of poison.

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,360
Just a little bit.

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,200
Just one minute.

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,479
It's in the apple seed.

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
But only a few micrograms won't kill people.

14
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,080
Although it exists in plants,

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
but high-purity cyanide

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,039
needs artificial purification.

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,039
So?

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,919
we just need to find

19
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,240
where the artificial purification is,

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
we can find out

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
behind this man.

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Which fruit contains cyanide?

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,360
From what I know,

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
Bitter almonds. Bitter almonds.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,680
Bitter almonds.

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,360
Here you go. Thank you.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Ta-da! Ta-da!

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,680
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

29
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,640
Director of Administration

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
Let's go out later.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,000
Can I go with you?

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Ruofei.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
Lan Ting and I have other things to do.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,200
Song Quan.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,440
Send Her Ladyship back first.

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,560
Okay.

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,240
Don't eat it. Don't eat it.

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,079
Madam, let me give you a ride.

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Miss Gu and Changhao

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,840
have reached this level?

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,920
I don’t know what they are talking about.

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,040
Mr. Qiu and Lord Gu.

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,600
They're in sync now.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,280
If Lord Gu had come to the Ministry of Justice,

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
their cooperation

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,640
must be invincible.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,120
Do you know what that means?

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Make it worse.

49
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,240
What's that sound? It's over there.

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,920
It's over there. It's over there.

51
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,080
It's here. It's here. It's here.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,040
It's the almond. It's the almond. It's the almond.

53
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,000
He's here! He's here! He's here!

54
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,920
Over there! Over there! Over there! Over there!

55
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,280
Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him!

56
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,480
Hurry up!

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,200
Why isn't she here yet?

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Why are you so late?

59
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,920
Let's go back.

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,920
Run!

61
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Let's go! Let's go!

62
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Hurry up! Hurry up!

63
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,600
Go! Go! Go! Go!

64
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,360
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

65
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,600
Go! Go! Go!

66
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,080
Go! Go! Go!

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,640
Go! Go! Go!

68
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,200
Stop right there!

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,360
There are two subjects at night.

70
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
How long has it been?

71
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,640
Why isn't she back yet?

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,960
Did Kang Lanting

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,680
took him to Guilan Fang?

74
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,680
Jiang Lanting

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,720
It's me. It's me.

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,040
Who is it? It's me.

77
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,520
I saw you.

78
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,800
Don't move.

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Who is it?

80
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,520
Who is it? Who is it?

81
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm here to see you.

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,640
What are you doing?

83
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,159
Jiang Lanting.

84
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,680
Where did you come in?

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,800
I came from...

86
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,800
Come on.

87
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,080
Go! Go! Go!

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,360
No.

89
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
Are you playing tricks on me?

90
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,760
Open it.

91
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,040
What are you doing with a box at night?

92
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,080
This is a trap box.

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,560
It takes dozens of steps to open it.

94
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,360
Oh my god.

95
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,159
Hengyu must like it.

96
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,520
Can you do it?

97
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
Let me do it.

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
You can do it.

99
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,280
Why can you do everything?

100
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Of course I can.

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Sister-in-law,

102
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,600
I think you've been targeting me lately.

103
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,520
How dare I?

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
How dare I?

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,480
That's right. If you know I'm a prince,

106
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,760
there's nothing I can't do.

107
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,920
No, your lord is rich.

108
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,000
What does it have to do with you?

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,680
Let's make a bet.

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,200
It's the brain problem.

111
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,680
Let me tell you. Open it.

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,080
It's open.

113
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,240
This one.

114
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,520
Look. Is it this one?

115
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,560
Wait, let me see.

116
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
It's bitter almonds.

117
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
It's a crystal. It's a piece of cake. It's a piece of cake.

118
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,760
It's a crystal. It's a crystal. It's a crystal. It's a crystal. It's a crystal. It's a crystal. It's a crystal.

119
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
It's potassium cyanide. It's here. It's here.

120
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,160
It's here. It's here.

121
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,120
It's... It's...

122
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,440
It's... It's...

123
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,880
This should be

124
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,560
Is there a way to confirm it?

125
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,480
There is. There is.

126
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,880
Yes, there is.

127
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,640
What do you mean?

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
You know nothing.

129
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,000
It's called a sense of ritual.

130
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
A sense of ritual.

131
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
It's done! It's done! It's done!

132
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,080
Changhao.

133
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,320
Give me the wax ball. Okay.

134
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,800
Okay. Okay.

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,520
Here you go. Here you go.

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,440
Great.

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
It proves that

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,240
This is cyanide.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,920
from bitter almonds.

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,960
Kang Lanting took this back

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,080
is the raw ingredient of bitter almonds extracted from grease.

142
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
And you take this back

143
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,080
is better than mine.

144
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,200
Tell me.

145
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,240
Where did you get it?

146
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
Why did you send me away?

147
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,920
Ruofei.

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,760
I have a secret.

149
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,680
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

150
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,400
One, two. One, two.

151
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
Say it in one go.

152
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,960
Ruofei.

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,280
Hello. Hello.

154
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,200
You're...

155
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,200
Actually, I...

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
Lan Ting, protect Ruofei. Okay.

157
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:02,920
OK. OK.

158
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,400
Be careful. Be careful.

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,920
I...

160
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,760
Again and again.

161
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,120
You've gone too far.

162
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,480
Now, you're trying to harm my wife. You're trying to harm my wife?

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,560
You're trying to harm my wife? Yes, Your Highness.

164
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,440
Today,

165
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,520
Don't go! Let's go! Let's go!

166
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,720
No! Let's go!

167
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,440
Let's go! Let's go!

168
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,200
Come on. Let's go.

169
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,760
Don't go.

170
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
Changhao can play ten against one.

171
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
What if something happens?

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,000
Someone will die.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,520
You'll be killed. You'll be killed. You'll be killed.

174
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,520
He got distracted when you went there.

175
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
That's why he got hurt.

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,280
Don't go.

177
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,920
No.

178
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,200
If you don't want to go, I'll go with you. I'll go with you. I'll go with you. I'll go with you.

179
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,280
I'll go by myself.

180
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,360
Sister-in-law, please listen to me. Let's go.

181
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,560
Listen to me.

182
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,280
Did you notice his eyes just now?

183
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
That look.

184
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
One hundred more.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,720
So

186
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,400
Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.

187
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,840
I believe you.

188
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,920
I don't believe you.

189
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,480
Sister-in-law, look.

190
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
Why did you bring a chair?

191
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,040
Changhao, let me help you.

192
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,560
Go back and tell your master

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
I have the evidence of the poison.

194
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
Come at me.

195
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,200
Don't touch my wife!

196
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,640
Get out! Get out!

197
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,320
It's here. It's here.

198
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
He's here. He's here. He's here.

199
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,040
Sir.

200
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,480
I've sent someone to take care of the scene.

201
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,200
Do you need more people to protect you?

202
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,040
No need.

203
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,120
They're no match for us.

204
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Let's make it public tomorrow.

205
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Let everyone know. Yes.

206
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,240
Ready. Ready.

207
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,040
No. They are...

208
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,840
Who are those assassins?

209
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,040
They couldn't hold back

210
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,160
They can't help it.

211
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
It's a good thing for them to help.

212
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,840
I've been investigating my brother's case for years.

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,440
By the way,

214
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,920
There's a secret. It's a secret.

215
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,640
What is it?

216
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,640
Ruofei.

217
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I can't hide it from you anymore.

218
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,360
To investigate my brother's death,

219
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
to investigate my brother’s death.

220
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,320
A identity?

221
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

222
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,280
It's me! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

223
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,640
At night,

224
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,600
to the officials and nobles.

225
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
to make those guilty officials

226
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,800
have to ask the Ministry of Justice for help.

227
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,320
In the name of protecting my family,

228
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,800
in the name of protecting the house.

229
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,280
It's really you, Your Majesty.

230
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,080
No wonder.

231
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,080
No wonder Jiang Lanting said I was his friend at night.

232
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,440
No.

233
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,840
It’s like this.

234
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Here’s the thing.

235
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,880
At first, I used this identity alone.

236
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,560
But Lan Ting found out later.

237
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Jiang Lanting.

238
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,480
We shared this identity after that.

239
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,480
Sometimes he even covered for me.

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,680
No wonder.

241
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,280
No wonder everybody said

242
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Later, he suddenly became glamorous

243
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,000
He's a swagger.

244
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,120
It's him.

245
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,640
That day,

246
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,640
you saw Lanting and me

247
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
in the study.

248
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,440
You should know

249
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,320
why I don’t allow Changle to like me.

250
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
This is the secret you want to tell me.

251
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,040
I'll tell you a secret too.

252
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,520
What is it?

253
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,720
I found that

254
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,840
Changle might like Jiang Lanting.

255
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,960
Jiang Lanting.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,240
Are you a subordinate at night?

257
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,000
Qiu Changle.

258
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,440
What would you do

259
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,920
what would you do?

260
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,200
I don't want to live anymore.

261
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,760
I don't want to live anymore.

262
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
That's not true.

263
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,840
But why do you look more and more like Kang Lanting?

264
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,480
I am Kang Lanting.

265
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,160
No, I'm not. I'm not.

266
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,080
I...

267
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
Why do you have my clothes?

268
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
And you were just like him.

269
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,320
I think

270
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
because you stayed up late

271
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,080
because you stayed up late.

272
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,560
No.

273
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,320
Get up! Get up!

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,520
Get up! Get up! Get up!

275
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,280
Come on. Come on.

276
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,920
Come on. Come on.

277
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:10,920
Why?

278
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,640
Hug me when I tell you to.

279
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,440
You do smell like a subordinate.

280
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,680
No.

281
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,240
It's not right.

282
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,440
I knew it.

283
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,680
You're not the king. You're the one who's the king. You're the one who's the king.

284
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,760
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

285
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,280
No, I'm not. It's not like that. It's not like that.

286
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Anyway,

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,720
you have to dress up as a subordinate tomorrow.

288
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,680
to see my mother.

289
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
After that,

290
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,480
I won't bother you again.

291
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,600
I think after tomorrow,

292
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
after tomorrow

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,120
your own words.

294
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,320
It's none of your business.

295
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:50,840
Let's go.

296
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,880
Do well tomorrow.

297
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,720
Chun Ying.

298
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,040
Morning, Young Master.

299
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,800
Miss is still sleeping.

300
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,319
Let her sleep a little longer.

301
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,040
Chun Ying, pack up.

302
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,119
You and Ruofei will stay at the Ministry of Punishments for a few days.

303
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
The Ministry of Justice?

304
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,040
Really?

305
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,079
I’ll get ready now.

306
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,800
Thank you, Young Master.

307
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,560
Here you are. Here you are.

308
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,280
"Changren, you're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the boss."

309
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,080
Let me tell you something big.

310
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,920
What is it?

311
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,680
Where is Hengyu?

312
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,080
Jiaoxing took him out to play.

313
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,880
What is it?

314
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
Let me tell you. I'm going to the Ministry of Punishments. I'm going to the Ministry of Punishments.

315
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,160
My second brother is going to the Ministry of Justice for a case.

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,320
He took Du Ruofei and Chun Ying away.

317
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,400
Where is Changle?

318
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,280
to bring the minister back to see his parents.

319
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
What are you saying?

320
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,680
You can't speak when you see too many birds.

321
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,280
What should I say?

322
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,560
Just say something.

323
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,720
Interesting.

324
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,040
It's better than being perfunctory.

325
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,440
Interesting.

326
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,400
No, madam.

327
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,960
I'm taking medicine more frequently than eating.

328
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,160
You're being picky about me now.

329
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,520
Shouldn't you consider my feelings?

330
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,720
You took the medicine and got angry.

331
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,560
How do you feel?

332
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,480
You can't stop

333
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Don't stop. It's okay.

334
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,480
It's bitter. It's bitter.

335
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,880
Madam.

336
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,960
Can I play with crickets?

337
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,720
Just for a while.

338
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,560
Let's go.

339
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,200
Thank you.

340
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,080
Qiu Changren,

341
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll teach you a lesson today.
