1
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,800
Tell me the whole story.

2
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,720
Tell me the truth.

3
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,600
Yes, my lord.

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,520
The thorn apple pollen is not only intuitive,

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
If the dosage is too heavy, people will die.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,120
But if it is controlled properly,

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,400
The dosage is worsening. It's not working. It's not working.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,440
Why is Gas here?

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,320
It can be made into spitting medicine.

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,920
It's a spitting shot.

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
After eating it,

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
he will say

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,000
what others ask.

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,199
What does it have to do with you?

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
Because

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,640
Because of the long-term presentation, Mr. Xun.

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,120
My brother?

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,440
You mean

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,560
my brother took the spitting drug you made?

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,079
His death is related to this.

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,800
At that time, Mr. Zhang asked me to make the reagent.

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,840
I didn't know what his purpose was.

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,760
I realized that

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
I realized

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,040
it was my fault.

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,920
Look.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I should have brought him back for trial.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I would have known everything.

29
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,480
But I really don't know

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
the child beside me

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
was Lord Zhang's spy.

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
He should have been bribed long ago.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
And Lord Zhang

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,600
knows you are saved.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,920
Mr. Xun, you must save me.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I don’t want to hurt your brother.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,079
Don't worry.

38
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,240
Stay here for now.

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,480
I need you to testify for me.

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,200
and bring him to justice.

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
Why are you still staying at home?

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,560
Okay.

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,400
Actually,

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I still keep the high purity pollen

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,880
I still kept the high purity pollen.

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,280
Does Lord Zhang know?

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,600
He thought I gave him

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
to him.

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,600
Where is the pollen now?

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,880
In my pharmacy cabinet.

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,320
in my medicine cabinet.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,880
Acid dates.

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,200
This is important evidence.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
Lord Zhang

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
has sent someone to watch your house.

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,160
I have to find a way to get the evidence.

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,280
Think of a way.

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,960
Got it.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,600
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't be afraid.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
This is my wife.

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Hello.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,440
Mrs. Xun.

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,080
So the wife tonight is...

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
That’s my brother’s wife, Qi Wan.

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,840
Mr. Qiu and his family came to protect me.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,800
I’m flattered.

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,080
You stay here for now.

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,400
I’ve arranged everything for you.

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Yes, thank you, Mr. Xun.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
Thank you, Madam.

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,480
You're welcome

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,560
Let's go.

74
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,320
Rest early.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,520
Changhao.

76
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,960
I have an idea.

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,159
What is it?

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Move over.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,120
Move over.

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,160
I can pretend to be a pregnant woman

81
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,120
and steal

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,800
in the drawer.

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,360
No, it's too dangerous.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
What's dangerous?

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
No one knows me.

86
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,800
Qi Wan hasn't woken up yet.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you want to get yourself involved?

88
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,800
Should I draw a turtle

89
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,200
or a dog?

90
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
Carrot! Murder!

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,280
He's sleeping and bullying me.

92
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,960
I...

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm really talented.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,480
Who dares to stop a pregnant woman?

95
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
He has his own character.

96
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Gars, you scumbag from Xiliang!

97
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,920
You cheated on me

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
while I'm pregnant.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll kill you today.

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,960
Who are you?

101
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
How dare you touch a pregnant woman?

102
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Didn't you see my stomach saying...

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,680
Wh-What's the matter?

104
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,520
I'm Gars's wife.

105
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
It's natural for me to find him.

106
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,440
How dare you stop me?

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,760
What is she doing?

108
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,160
What about you?

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,880
No.

110
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,280
You two

111
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,159
which one of you will make a mistake with my stomach?

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Can you afford it?

113
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,440
What about you?

114
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,040
I can't afford it.

115
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
Can I go in now?

116
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Come in.

117
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
She's so smart!

118
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,640
Gars!

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
Come out!

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Come back.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,159
Don't think I can't see you.

122
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,000
Mind your own business.

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,120
But we can't afford to offend that pregnant woman.

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
So she just went in like this?

125
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,159
Fine.

126
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,840
We'll come out if we can't find him.

127
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Just wait. Let's take a break.

128
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,720
You didn't turn on the light.

129
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
What a bad luck.

130
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,640
Seriously.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
You still have to hide?

132
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,640
I'll dig it out

133
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
I'll dig it out for you.

134
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,200
Stop hiding.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Stop hiding.

136
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,480
Send some 250 to guard the door.

137
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
It's useless.

138
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Come in and I'll get one

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,680
It's useless to hide.

140
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,320
Come out!

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
Let me ask you two.

142
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
I know where he is.

143
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,320
I don't know.

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,520
Are you trying to hide it for him?

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,280
Absolutely not.

146
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,760
Then why are you standing here?

147
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,200
We...

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
We need debts.

149
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,360
That's right. You need to pay.

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

151
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,160
I would have been so fierce to you.

152
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,120
We're all victims.

153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,360
You're good at acting.

154
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,280
Do you have to add so many scenes for yourself?

155
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,960
Let me tell you, this Gas

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,280
I really can't take it.

157
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,560
Look at my stomach

158
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,040
Look.

159
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,360
My doll is pissed off.

160
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,680
Keep an eye on him.

161
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:28,960
Where is he?

162
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,720
After him!

163
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,240
Who are you?

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,280
Where are you?

165
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,240
Over there.

166
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,400
A black suit.

167
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,320
suddenly appeared to save the beauty.

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
Are you a subordinate at night?

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,800
You're fine now. Please go back.

170
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,280
Sure. Thank you, brother-in-law.

171
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,840
Brother-in-law.

172
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,840
Please tell your friend

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,440
not to disturb my work again.

174
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,400
It's impossible for me to be with her at night.

175
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,800
No.

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
Didn't you guys go on a date?

177
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,320
You even replied to her.

178
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,600
Why do you men change so much every day?

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
Just tell her.

180
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
I'm doing this for her own good.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,400
Stop!

182
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Let me tell you, Your Majesty.

183
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Changle is a…

184
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,680
I won’t allow you to bully her.

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
Say it yourself.

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,560
Don’t flirt with her.

187
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,320
Changle is my sister.

188
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Your sister?

189
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,320
What are you doing?

190
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,080
Tell me! Let go!

191
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,160
Let go of me.

192
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,000
I won't let go. Tell me clearly.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Let go of me.

194
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,280
No.

195
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,800
They're back.

196
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,640
Where?

197
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,440
This man...

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,600
What a jerk.

199
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
A fake pregnant woman?

200
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Yes, my lord.

201
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
That woman doesn't know any martial arts.

202
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Later, a shadow flashed by.

203
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
that woman suddenly disappeared.

204
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,440
Dark Shadow.

205
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Tell Yeongji to come here.

206
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, my lord.

207
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
We have evidence and witnesses.

208
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
Can we arrest Zhang now?

209
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,760
No.

210
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,400
This case has been accumulated for a long time.

211
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,440
Although there are witnesses and evidence,

212
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,600
it was indirect pointing to Mr. Zhang.

213
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
There is no direct evidence.

214
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
We can't act rashly.

215
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
Which one of you is higher?

216
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Almost the same rank.

217
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Then catch him.

218
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,960
No.

219
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,080
Why?

220
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,400
Because the Supreme Court has higher power than the Ministry of Justice.

221
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,960
The Court of Judicial Review is ranked third.

222
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,880
He's at the same level as the Deputy Minister of Justice.

223
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
You only know these useless things.

224
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,400
Qiu Changle.

225
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
I’ll be angry if you push me again.

226
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,720
Again?

227
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,800
Come on. Come on.

228
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,880
Again.

229
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,560
It’s over.

230
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Changle, Lanting,

231
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,920
I didn’t move.

232
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
What should we do now?

233
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,160
Should I keep waiting?

234
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,200
I can't wait.

235
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,280
They don't know you,

236
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,240
but pollen has something to do with Jangsei's death.

237
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,680
They must have guessed

238
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,760
it's Qiu Changhao behind the scenes.

239
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,440
You talk so much every day.

240
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
Can't you say something practical?

241
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,520
Let's ignore her.

242
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,320
Simply put,

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,440
we can only act

244
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,800
before we take action.

245
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,320
Lord Zhang.

246
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
I haven't heard anything lately.

247
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,080
Ningji.

248
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,680
I disturbed the court at night.

249
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,160
Investigating him is a task assigned by the government.

250
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,240
Why are you so careless?

251
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,800
I dare not.

252
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
I've been following him lately.

253
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,560
I found that he often disappeared near the Xun Mansion.

254
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,680
Mr. Xun.

255
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,240
At night,

256
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,840
has a close relationship with the Xun family.

257
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,040
Maybe

258
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,800
I am Qiu Changhao at night.

259
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Qiu Changhao.

260
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,920
If you can find the evidence

261
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,240
hand in the book,

262
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
I'll ask for credit for you.

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,320
I dare not act rashly.

264
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,440
This is just my guess.

265
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
The Ministry of Justice...

266
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,840
Alright.

267
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,160
You take the credit. I'll take the credit.

268
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,520
You may leave.

269
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,600
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

270
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,520
I’ll beat you.

271
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Qiu Changle, calm down.

272
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,880
Don’t run!

273
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,800
Go! Go! Go!

274
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,360
Stop!

275
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,560
Did I take the pollen for nothing?

276
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,680
Let me tell you.

277
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,400
Of course not.

278
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
With the pollen,

279
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,480
both of us are equal.

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,320
No one dares to act rashly.

281
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm a prince.

282
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,760
My Lord.

283
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
My Lord! My Lord!

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,800
My lord.

285
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,080
Lord Zhang's servants sent an invitation.

286
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,080
He said

287
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,200
tomorrow.

288
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,680
Give it to me.

289
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,080
He's in a hurry.

290
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,080
What should we do?

291
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,560
Go. We have to go for dinner.

292
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,800
No.

293
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
This is obviously a trap.

294
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,560
You must go.

295
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,840
What took you so long?

296
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,240
I need to get changed.

297
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,160
Are you ready?

298
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,760
Yes.

299
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,800
My lords.

300
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,840
My lords.

301
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,800
The dishes are ready.

302
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,680
Lord Zhang has been waiting for you.

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,920
Please come in.

304
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,760
Come on.

305
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
I didn't expect the prince

306
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,720
to come with you today.

307
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,720
Please forgive me.

308
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,400
I invited you today

309
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,840
to thank Mr. Xun.

310
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,120
for helping us a lot

311
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,400
in the Supreme Court.

312
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,040
In the future,

313
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,320
I may need to rely on you more.

314
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
You are my senior.

315
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
My achievement today

316
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,680
is all thanks to your help.

317
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,120
Not at all.

318
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,560
Mr. Xun is young and promising. He has a bright future.

319
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,360
Your Highness.

320
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,640
Your presence is an honour to my humble house.

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,280
Mr. Xun. Your Highness.

322
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,760
A toast to you. Please.

323
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,480
The things in my mansion are simple.

324
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,880
It's not as simple as yours.

325
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
Both of you are living a luxurious life.

326
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,640
You may not like them.

327
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
Please make do with it.

328
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,160
Enjoy.

329
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I also prepared a gift.

330
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,040
Enjoy your meal.

331
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,760
What are you waiting for?

332
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,200
Pour some wine for you.

333
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,080
What's wrong? Do you know how to serve?

334
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,720
Calm down, Your Highness.

335
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
You're clumsy.

336
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,120
Don't disturb the prince.

337
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,120
Get out!

338
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,160
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

339
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
How rude.

340
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,360
Your Highness, don't be angry with the servants.

341
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,320
Please.

342
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,240
Mr. Xun.

343
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
What kind of case are you investigating recently?

344
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm investigating a case that has been accumulated for two years.

345
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,720
Any clues?

346
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,280
Yes.

347
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,160
Mr. Xun has always been meticulous in investigating cases.

348
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,160
I believe

349
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,520
there is no case that can be difficult for Mr. Xun.

350
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,120
This case is indeed anxious.

351
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Mr. Xun.

352
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,840
I wonder if the Supreme Court can help.

353
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,080
I'm willing to help you.

354
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,520
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

355
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
I’ll come to you if necessary.

356
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,720
Your Highness, Lord Xun.

357
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,720
Come, let’s drink. Please.

358
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,560
Mr. Xun.

359
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,319
It’s like

360
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,880
is like a toast to you.

361
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,160
If you drink it,

362
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,560
if you drink it.

363
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,319
If you don't drink,

364
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,880
I’ll punish you later.

365
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,560
I will make Qiu Changhao drunk tonight.

366
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,680
Wait for my signal.

367
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,480
Play it by ear.

368
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,880
When the secret book is submitted,

369
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,080
we'll put the blame on him.

370
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,320
Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

371
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,240
Lord Zhang,

372
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,040
another toast to you.

373
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,720
Please.

374
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,680
I must go.

375
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,120
You can't go empty-handed.

376
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,640
Take the pollen.

377
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Put it into his dish while he's not paying attention.

378
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,120
Then he'll be confused.

379
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,920
He'll say whatever you ask.

380
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm so talented.

381
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,760
Drug again

382
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,560
Hikion Music
