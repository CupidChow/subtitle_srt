1
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,840
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,560
Oh my god

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,680
Your makeup is too thick.

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Doctor Gas.

5
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,960
Is this 30-year-old bath water?

6
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,280
It's wrong.

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,880
It should be foot wash.

8
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,919
No response

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
No reaction.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,079
It's changed. It's changed.

11
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,600
Blue green.

12
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,480
This means the silver solution

13
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,800
and copper coins.

14
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Changhao, there is nitric acid silver in it.

15
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,760
Many years ago, I suggested

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,400
to provide you

17
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,079
for Young Master.

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,160
That well water is only for Young Master.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
You mean

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,480
The well in the garden

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,040
Yes, it was a well.

22
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,640
Then Lord Lee opened a few mouths elsewhere

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Wait.

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,520
The courtiers' courtyard

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,640
in the courtiers' yard?

26
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
It's a little strange.

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,680
All the adults' mansions have dried grass.

28
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,360
Does that mean someone poisoned them?

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,280
But Ruofei said

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,320
no one can synthesize nitrate.

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,520
There is a way to synthesize it.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,480
Say it.

33
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,320
When did you

34
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,880
fell in love with her?

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,040
You're so annoying.

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,480
Do you like me

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,040
You like me the first time you see me?

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,800
Nonsense.

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,280
We were destined to be together in our previous lives.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,160
It turns out that I like the same person.

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,280
Yeah.

42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,840
We should have made it clear earlier.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Thank you.

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,040
for letting me know how responsible you are.

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
Responsibility?

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,840
Speaking of responsibility,

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
I suddenly remembered your brother.

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,840
came to see me today.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,960
Kang Lanting.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,880
You are not responsible at all.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,800
Jang-ho.

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,080
You said you had something important to tell me.

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,960
Isn't that important?

54
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,240
It's important.

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,400
Very important.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,880
Okay, okay.

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
Stop talking to each other.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Since we're here,

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
I'll start the speech.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,800
As we all know,

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,680
the air contains the most nitrogen.

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
When it thunders,

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,839
these reacts.

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,680
And these are nitrogen.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
into a chemical formula of nitric acid.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,120
A lightning calorie

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
around two billion joules.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,480
Put nitrogen and oxygen

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,159
into nitrogen oxide.

70
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,720
It melts into the rain and forms nitric acid.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
and falls on the ground.

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,640
and combine with the mineral on the ground.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,800
into nitric acid silver.

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,400
nitric acid can react to the mineral silver.

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,680
The equation is as follows.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,520
This is its chemical formula.

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,159
[This formula proves]

78
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,440
[In Ga-on's case,]

79
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,159
[The sour and silver reaction]

80
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,080
can produce more nitric acid silver.

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,720
So in the rain,

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,080
nitric acid can combine with mineral silver

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
into more nitric acid silver.

84
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,360
This is why he was poisoned.

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
You mean

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,600
this is the cause of poisoning?

87
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,560
Yes.

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,760
Why did you repeat her words?

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,800
Fine.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Think about it yourselves.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,520
I'm leaving.

92
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
Do you understand?

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
Yes.

94
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,600
Do you understand?

95
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,840
No.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,520
Nothing.

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:33,800
0. 211.0.

98
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
I think I understand now.

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,480
the rain

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,600
fell on the ground.

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,000
and the mineral silver on the ground.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,440
a strange reaction.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
So it became nitric acid silver.

104
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,760
If you say so, I understand.

105
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,800
Your Highness, what do you understand?

106
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,320
Something

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,320
It suddenly reacted.

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,280
Almost.

109
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,560
In other words, this is just a coincidence.

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
It has nothing to do with human-made.

111
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,760
I think so.

112
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
But I think there are too many coincidences.

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,400
After all the trouble,

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,280
She doesn't even want to come back.

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,680
Well,

116
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,720
why don't you

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
handle Chun Ying and Wei Song Quan?

118
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,960
lest she'll be distracted all day long.

119
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
I want to do something for someone.

120
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
Two, not one.

121
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,560
I want to talk to you about Ningji

122
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,000
Why is it him again?

123
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,840
I know

124
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,000
I know.

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,320
You... You're following me.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
I did it to protect you.

127
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,800
That's the excuse in dramas.

128
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,240
Ningji is from the Supreme Court.

129
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
How could he harm me?

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,720
Have you considered my feelings?

131
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,680
There you go again.

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,600
Don't you find trouble

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,640
if you don't make trouble?

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm having dinner and chatting with Ningji

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
What's wrong?

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm not in your way.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,560
Why are you talking like your mother?

138
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,280
Then why did you hide it from me?

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
If I tell you,

140
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,480
will you let me go?

141
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
If you tell me,

142
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
I will definitely let you go.

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
Actually, I just want to know

144
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,480
what Ningji told you.

145
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,440
Why are you guys so happy?

146
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,080
We were talking about you.

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,320
I...

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

149
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,880
Think about it.

150
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,600
Everything around me

151
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
is about you.

152
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,520
Even I did a chemical experiment

153
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,120
because of your case.

154
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,480
I just want to talk to someone else.

155
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,200
This person can only be Ningji

156
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,320
I didn't expect

157
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
he was most curious about you.

158
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
I can't tell

159
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
I can't tell for the time being.

160
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,880
Ruofei.

161
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,640
You...

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,160
You're the one

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,120
You...

164
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Why do you like to butter people up?

165
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,880
You suspected that I was a spy.

166
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Now you think Ning Ji is a bad guy.

167
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
Do you have paranoia?

168
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
Listen to me first

169
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Mo Chou once told me late at night

170
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
some behavior of Ningji

171
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
I found that Ningji

172
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,520
is not as simple as it seems

173
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,760
So you don't want me to meet him

174
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,400
or are you worried that he has other intentions?

175
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,240
Both.

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
Which one is more?

177
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,840
If you don't meet him, it's all over.

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,560
Okay.

179
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,600
I won't see him.

180
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,560
But I...

181
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,560
What do you want?

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,720
I do have a request.

183
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,520
I hope

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
who you really are.

185
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
who you really are.

186
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,760
Don't waste your time on me.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,080
Ruofei.

188
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,240
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,240
Just think of me as a stranger.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
and live your life.

191
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,680
and do what you should do.

192
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,960
and fulfill your dream.

193
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
and take care of your family.

194
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,800
I can't do that.

195
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,960
No.

196
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,680
Before I came,

197
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,000
before I came.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
Why can't you do it?

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Although

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
this person is definitely not me.

201
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
I just hope

202
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
you can find someone

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,040
to grow old together with you.

204
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,440
For the rest of my life,

205
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,720
to be with you

206
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
for the rest of my life.

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,840
I...

208
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
Think about it.

209
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,160
I'm a little stuffy.

210
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,800
I want to get some fresh air.

211
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,000
Ruofei.

212
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,400
What are you thinking?

213
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,800
It seems that Changhao's true love is Miss Gu.

214
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,160
Great.

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,040
I can finally go back.

216
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
I have an exam after all.

217
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,000
I should be happy.

218
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,880
But why do I feel

219
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
I feel so congested.

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,160
My nose is sore

221
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,400
My eyes are sore too

222
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
You must

223
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
be happy.

224
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,880
You're back.

225
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Have some fungus soup.

226
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,880
Madam.

227
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Tomorrow morning,

228
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,600
tomorrow morning.

229
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm not leaving.

230
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,760
You have to go.

231
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,400
The carriage is ready.

232
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,600
Jilang.

233
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,560
Madam.

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,960
Everything is changing.

235
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,400
You can't follow me anymore.

236
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,600
Right now,

237
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,680
Qiu Changhao has moved back to the Qiu Mansion.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,280
I don't know why Gu Mochou went to Guanzhong County.

239
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,960
and Jiang Lanting.

240
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,480
He went back to the mansion

241
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,920
he didn't leave the house.

242
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,240
I have no idea what they are doing.

243
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
So I have to be prepared.

244
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,080
to face the next storm.

245
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,080
Jiro.

246
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,280
I’m ready.

247
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,800
Don't worry about me.

248
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,640
As long as

249
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,800
can fulfill your wish.

250
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,360
I have nothing left.

251
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,400
I can't lose you anymore

252
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
Sister Mo Chou, have some tea

253
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,080
Sister-in-law

254
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,440
Something urgent?

255
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,680
It's not urgent.

256
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,200
But I think it's time.

257
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,520
What's wrong? Tell me.

258
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Is it related to Changhao?

259
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
And...

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Sister-in-law.

261
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,560
Are you...

262
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,920
Stop calling me sister-in-law.

263
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
Just call me Ruofei.

264
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,960
These days,

265
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,160
I've been working with Changhao

266
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,120
I actually feel a lot.

267
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
Especially your tacit understanding.

268
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,240
You can tell

269
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,040
with one look.

270
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,160
When he's in danger,

271
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
you will come out and stand in front of him.

272
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,240
All these touched me.

273
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
So I think

274
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,200
you are the one who accompanies him all his life.

275
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,920
Ruofei.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,240
Do you think there's something between me and Changhao?

277
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,200
You misunderstood.

278
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,360
Otherwise...

279
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Let me explain it this way.

280
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,440
To me,

281
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,080
a dream to me.

282
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,760
It's a dream.

283
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,480
you will wake up.

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,560
Even if it's real,

285
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,040
even if it's real.

286
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you understand what I mean?

287
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,920
Go ahead.

288
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
you're dreaming.

289
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
It's not real.

290
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,320
That's what it means.

291
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,000
Even if I'm not here anymore,

292
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,840
your life will continue.

293
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,080
I will remember you

294
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,960
like you do.

295
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,160
Ruofei.

296
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,440
I really don't understand what you're talking about.

297
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,760
It's okay if you don't understand now.

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Anyway, before I leave,

299
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,960
I have another wish.

300
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,840
I think

301
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
before I leave,

302
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,240
before I leave.

303
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,520
and marry you.

304
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,600
That's what you should have.

305
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,720
Just like the sculpture Hero.

306
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Then I should go to class.

307
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,280
and stop surfing the internet.

308
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,640
I think I understand what you mean.

309
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
You're leaving?

310
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,200
Before you leave, you want to set me up with Jang-ho.

311
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,680
so that you can leave in peace

312
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,800
You're really Mochou

313
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,000
But I have a question.

314
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,840
Do you think he will like me?

315
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,320
Based on my understanding,

316
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,640
he must like you.

317
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
Actually, many men don't know

318
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,520
who they really like.

319
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
For example, Jiang Lanting.

320
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,640
grew up with Qiu Changle.

321
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,360
until Changle was getting married.

322
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,600
until Changle got married.

323
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,360
So don't look at the past

324
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
or the present.

325
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,080
We need to see the future.

326
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,280
Jang Ho

327
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,200
he was on guard against me like a spy.

328
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,880
Then...

329
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,080
what do you think I should do?

330
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,120
Tell him

331
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,280
confess to him tonight.

332
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,560
If you tell him how you feel,

333
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,160
he will tell you I love you.

334
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,960
If he can't,

335
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,320
just teach him.

336
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,160
What if

337
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,240
What if he rejects me?

338
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,560
you can force him to say.

339
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,920
Don't worry.

340
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,640
I've done my homework for him.

341
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,280
I told him to think about

342
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,000
who he really is.

343
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,760
Okay.

344
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,839
I'll do as you say.

345
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,960
Let's start with the Administrative Bureau.

346
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,720
I must find the money in two days.

347
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,880
Yes, my lord.

348
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,440
Chun Ying just came.

349
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,440
She wants you to go home early.

350
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
I have something important to tell you.

351
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,520
Okay

352
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,040
Mo Chou

353
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
Where is Ruofei?

354
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,720
She asked me

355
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,080
to talk to you.

356
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
What did she ask me to talk about?

357
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,600
Talk.

358
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
Who do you really like?

359
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
Why are you messing around with her?

360
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,160
Wait.

361
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,520
You can't solve the problem even if you look for her.

362
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,800
I really have something to tell you.

363
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,000
Sit.

364
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:23,680
Hikion Music
