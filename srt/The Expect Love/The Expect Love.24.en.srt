1
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,479
Don't move! Don't move!

2
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,640
Brother, what are you doing?

3
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
I've told you many times.

4
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,360
Can you make some noise when you walk?

5
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,840
What are you doing?

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,200
There's mud inside.

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
I want to get it out for you.

8
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
Why can't you pick out such a thin bamboo stick?

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,880
How would I know?

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Give it to me. Give it to me.

11
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,840
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,400
Move! Move! Move! Move!

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,360
Move! Move!

14
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,680
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,520
It's... It's...

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,600
It's swelling. It's swelling. It's swelling. It's swelling. It's swelling. It's swelling.

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
Don't your hands swell?

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,280
My body temperature is the same as yours.

19
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,360
So my hands won't swell.

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,079
But it's cold.

21
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
So it swells.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,360
My back is a little cold.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll turn it over. Okay.

24
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
Look at this. Look at this.

25
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,880
Hello. Hello.

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,880
Lan Ting.

27
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,520
Why is everyone torturing me?

28
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Why are you ignoring me?

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,880
What is it?

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,320
There are many doubts about Liang Mansion's case.

31
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm afraid someone else is the culprit.

32
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
This is my brother's handwriting.

33
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,280
It seems

34
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,079
he knew something was wrong with Liang Mansion's case.

35
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,680
Yes.

36
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,920
I see.

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
After Lord Liang was arrested,

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,440
the Censorate didn't find any money for corruption

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,600
At that moment,

40
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,480
the Supreme Court ordered someone to kill

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,320
the corrupted officials and officials

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,280
At this moment, the royal agent announced that

43
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,880
the Censorate announced that

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,280
the stolen silver was confiscated by the Liang family.

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
All the files of the Liang family were taken back.

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,600
Even my brother's case files were changed.

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
The case files of the Supreme Court were taken back.

48
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,880
and left nothing behind.

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,240
What's the problem?

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,880
In other words,

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,920
the Liang Mansion case could be a false case.

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,320
His brother was also killed because of this.

53
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,960
As for the money

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
from those ministers

55
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,000
from those ministers.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,280
and frame the Liang family?

57
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,760
No, why did you harm the Liang family?

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,520
It's for embezzlement of three million taels of relief

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
Because Lord Liang

60
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,880
is in charge of the disaster relief funds

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,360
He's not a high official.

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,960
But he's in charge of it. He's in charge of it.

63
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,360
It's the most appropriate thing to do with him.

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
What does the Censorate do?

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
It's called "The Court of Judicial Review". It's called "The Supreme Court of Judicial Review". It's called "The Supreme Court of Judicial Review". It's called "The Supreme Court of Judicial Review of Judicial Review of Judicial Review".

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,320
He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

67
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,920
He's in charge of the case. He's in charge of the case. He's in charge of the case. He's in charge of the case. He's in charge of the case. He's in charge of the case.

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,000
They're here! They're here! They're here! They're here! They're here!

69
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
Catch the bad guys. Yes, sir.

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,840
I see.

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
It's just that you found that

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
someone took the money from other corrupted officials

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
three million taels of silver

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,120
as the relief money from the Liang family

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
on Liang Mansion's case.

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,840
and wiped out the Liang family.

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
It's exactly because my brother suspected it too.

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,360
he wanted to reverse the case.

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,760
but he didn't find any real evidence.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,560
So...

81
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,520
Lord Zhang,

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,800
put datura pollen on him

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,880
I just want him to say it himself.

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,120
what he saw.

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Then he made a fire and killed him.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
So Lord Zhang

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
is an accomplice of the Censorate?

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,640
Yes.

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,280
You're right.

90
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
But I don't think you know

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,880
what my brother actually knows.

92
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,760
So he didn't do anything in the past five years.

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,880
Is it that complicated?

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,640
One thing is for sure.

95
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,760
the Censorate definitely did something to Liang Mansion case.

96
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
So when you reported to the Censor,

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,680
Lord Zhang died in the Ministry of Justice,

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
the Censorate did nothing.

99
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
That's what I verified.

100
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,640
I wrote the second letter.

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,960
to the royal agent.

102
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,640
I've got an important information

103
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,440
from Mr. Zhang.

104
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Please report it.

105
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,080
I just want to see if the Censor wants to move.

106
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,040
How?

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,360
Who do you want to touch?

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,040
For now,

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,320
It's not moving up.

110
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,600
It should move us

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
Lord Zhang

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,680
had thorn pollen before.

113
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
and told the truth.

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,600
But he was sent to the Ministry of Justice

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
before the stamp was signed.

116
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,400
How do you prove

117
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Lord Zhang really killed Brother Changxian?

118
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
He said it was his statement.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,640
He was killed.

120
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,680
It means there's a bigger conspiracy behind it.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,480
Yes.

122
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
I see.

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
If you really want

124
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,920
to wipe out the evil,

125
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
you have to get the chain of evidence.

126
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,120
Go on.

127
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,960
What do you want to do?

128
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,840
What do you mean?

129
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,040
It's time to show real skills.

130
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,360
Jang-ho.

131
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,760
Although you're smart,

132
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,000
but in your era,

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
technology is not advanced.

134
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm going to update

135
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,960
your way of handling cases.

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
is extracting fingerprints.

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
Pull the fingerprint

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,320
It's just a thumbprint.

139
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
I thought you said something.

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,240
This is common in the Ministry of Justice.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Most people are illiterate.

142
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,680
That's why they're pressing their thumbprint.

143
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
No no

144
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
It's different.

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,400
What about fingerprints?

146
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,320
It's a pattern

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,920
on the tip of the fingers.

148
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,040
Everyone's fingerprints are unique.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,640
So there are no two in the world.

150
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,880
in the world.

151
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,880
We just need to prove that

152
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,720
Lord Zhang's fingerprints

153
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
on his personal belongings,

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
that means he is the murderer.

155
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,120
That bottle belongs to my brother.

156
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Yes, it is.

157
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,480
Get the kettle.

158
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,200
Attention.

159
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,080
Don't touch it.

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,960
Okay.

161
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,760
Jiang Lanting.

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,680
Get me a coal.

163
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Coal?

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,400
Okay.

165
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,800
Go.

166
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,040
Kang Lanting.

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,680
Is it done?

168
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,000
Is it thin enough?

169
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
Give me a little.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,560
Lift that up.

171
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,240
Raise it.

172
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,120
Come on.

173
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,679
You two...

174
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,400
I'm not.

175
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,120
Where's the honey?

176
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,960
What are you doing?

177
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,760
Let the fingerprint show.

178
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,400
Explain it to me.

179
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,160
I don't understand.

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,600
But I think it's amazing.

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,600
It's really amazing.

182
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
Not at all, OK?

183
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,280
Sorry.

184
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,960
The ink powder is too thin.

185
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
I couldn't help it.

186
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
Do you want to do it again?

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,720
Again.

188
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,920
I need to grind this.

189
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,800
You asked me to...

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,280
How about this?

191
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,800
Let me help you.

192
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,440
Lan Ting

193
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,240
It's been the whole afternoon.

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,800
It has nothing to do with you.

195
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,680
I didn't mean it. I'll help you sharpen it.

196
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,360
I don't mean to question you.

197
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
You can't go back on your word.

198
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Please.

199
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,760
As a prince,

200
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,520
I'll grind it for you all afternoon.

201
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm not questioning you.

202
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
I just thought you were great.

203
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Just grind it again.

204
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,560
No.

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,520
Is this done?

206
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,480
Let me see.

207
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,200
Great!

208
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,800
This is it.

209
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,520
This snuff pot is close to you

210
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,480
Just like toothbrush.

211
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,080
It's impossible for another person to contact.

212
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
So,

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,680
if we can prove

214
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,280
this fingerprint belongs to Lord Zhang,

215
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,200
It means

216
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
before the fire,

217
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Lord Zhang directly touched this small potion

218
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,720
and was the last person.

219
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,640
So?

220
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,920
I can see clearly

221
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,400
can be seen clearly,

222
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,520
But if it goes up to evidence level,

223
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,760
it will take a few days.

224
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,880
I see.

225
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,200
Chun Ying.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
Miss, what's wrong?

227
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,760
Bring me

228
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
I made for Hengyu.

229
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,280
Go to the Ministry of Justice

230
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,840
to print Lord Zhang's fingerprint.

231
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Keep it quiet.

232
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,080
Okay. Okay.

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,200
Follow Ruofei's method.

234
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,160
the thumb patterns are identical.

235
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,640
The fingerprints on the small medicine bottle

236
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,200
should be Lord Zhang's fingerprint.

237
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,920
Keep all these.

238
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
and put the evidence in storage.

239
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
Check it out. Okay.

240
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:11,760
Okay. Okay.

241
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,320
Wake up.

242
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,560
It's done.

243
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,720
Brother Changhao

244
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,880
Mo Chou

245
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Sister Mo Chou

246
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,360
The prince is here too

247
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,800
What's up?

248
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,080
Recently,

249
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,920
the Supreme Court suddenly invented the case vault.

250
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,480
I have no doubt

251
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
I had no doubts.

252
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,600
But I found that the person who invented the case

253
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
is not the head of the Supreme Court.

254
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
Then who is it?

255
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,240
No.

256
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,400
The case executive was asked to wait outside.

257
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,880
I'm checking the record here.

258
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
Count the record?

259
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,320
Why aren't you in there?

260
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
I don't care.

261
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
Ning Ji is the minister of the Supreme Court.

262
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,160
How did he react?

263
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,760
I didn't see you today.

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,440
I came here

265
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,080
before I left.

266
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,080
Looks like they've already taken action.

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Miss.

268
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,280
Young Master was in a rush just now.

269
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,000
What did he do?

270
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Don't mention it.

271
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,040
Do you think they have moral conscience?

272
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,760
They stole my work.

273
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,440
You treat me like a tool.

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,560
Ruofei.

275
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
How much did you drink?

276
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,720
Chun Ying.

277
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,320
Get back to work.

278
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,160
Okay.

279
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,320
What's wrong?

280
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,880
Last time you analyzed that Jiang Lanting likes me.

281
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,600
I went to talk to him.

282
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,160
and let him stop thinking about me.

283
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
I think I analyzed that you like Kang Lanting.

284
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,640
But when I finished talking to him,

285
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
he was crying.

286
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,560
I feel quite sad.

287
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,120
Yes.

288
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,560
Do you regret it now?

289
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,720
I just think

290
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,640
I hurt someone who likes me.

291
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,400
Do you think

292
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,960
I might lose him?

293
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,680
When you think about losing him,

294
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,160
I feel

295
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,880
feel a little empty?

296
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,400
No.

297
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,200
It's a little...

298
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,960
Can't I make up

299
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,560
this feeling?

300
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
I work for His Majesty at night.

301
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
I am a heroine at night.

302
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
How can I

303
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
think about two people at the same time?

304
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,240
What am I then?

305
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Qiu Changle,

306
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
Do you admit that you love two people at the same time?

307
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
You admit you like Jiang Lanting?

308
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,520
No, no, no.

309
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,160
I grew up with Kang Lanting.

310
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,880
We've been together for too long.

311
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
But when I think about not having him,

312
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,240
I feel very sad.

313
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,200
Yes.

314
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,040
Don't be stubborn.

315
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,040
Let’s see how long you can keep your mouth shut.

316
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
Changle.

317
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Do you like Jiang Lanting

318
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
or a subordinate at night?

319
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,360
One is an idol,

320
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,760
and the other is someone around me.

321
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,560
What are you mumbling about?

322
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,920
Changle’s lifelong happiness.

323
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,480
Changle.

324
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
What’s wrong with Changle?

325
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,280
Changle

326
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,200
always says he’s the official wife of a night minister.

327
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,000
and floating at night.

328
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,520
But I don't even know who I am at night.

329
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,200
This is unreliable.

330
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,240
Indeed.

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,560
And

332
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,080
I wear a mask every night.

333
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,200
What if he's ugly inside?

334
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,680
No.

335
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,440
I said,

336
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,520
why don't you talk to her?

337
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,920
You're her second brother.

338
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,560
It will work if you tell her.

339
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,320
No.

340
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,520
Changle doesn’t listen to me now.

341
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,080
I’ll go find my mother.

342
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Let's go. Let's go.

343
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,680
Mother.

344
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,200
She’s been

345
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,280
Changle is getting crazy.

346
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
He’s close to His Majesty.

347
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,200
and even wanted to marry him.

348
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,680
But who am I?

349
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,920
Where is he from?

350
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
where he came from.

351
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,080
A void person is not a good match.

352
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,280
This girl.

353
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
is getting more and more presumptuous.

354
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,880
As Changle’s elder brother,

355
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
I failed to discipline him.

356
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,560
I beg my parents

357
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,200
to marry Changle.

358
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
That’s what I’m waiting for.

359
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
You used to protect her.

360
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,840
That's why I let her be.

361
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
I didn't expect you to come around.

362
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,920
By the way,

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,400
do you have someone you like?

364
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,200
Not yet.

365
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,720
But...

366
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,360
even if it’s to restrain Changle,

367
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,000
I can’t let my sister suffer.

368
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,040
They are a match.

369
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,720
at least a fourth-rank official.

370
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,920
That's right.

371
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,080
I'll meet the matchmaker tomorrow.

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,480
Changhao.

373
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,640
Come here.

374
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,800
Lan Ting.

375
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
I have sneaked into

376
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,480
the royal agent's residence.

377
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Nothing unusual.

378
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,960
It's just that the guards are tightened.

379
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,760
The Censorate is different

380
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,720
the officials and officials who sent the invitation.

381
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,680
You must be careful.

382
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,000
Don't worry.

383
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm not as good as you,

384
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,400
but I'm smarter than you.

385
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,120
I have better taste than you.

386
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
What is this?

387
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,880
This is the matchmaker sent by the matchmaker.

388
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I’ve asked mother to arrange a matchmaking for Changle as soon as possible.

389
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
Matchmaking? Matchmaking?

390
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
To Changle.

391
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,400
To stop her from falling for me at night,

392
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,400
No.

393
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,080
I mean,

394
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,800
who will you marry her to?

395
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,840
Anyone above the fourth rank is fine.

396
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,800
Absolutely not.

397
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,280
There are eighteen officers

398
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,240
There are 18 sons in the family.

399
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,400
Only four are not married yet.

400
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
These four are all idiots.

401
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,520
I know them.

402
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,160
How could they all be idiots?

403
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,599
They are all idiots.

404
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,280
How can you not trust me?

405
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,800
Think about it.

406
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,440
Changle is a fool.

407
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,160
If you marry her to a fool,

408
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,200
if you marry her.

409
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,920
No matter what,

410
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,680
I must be a matchmaker for Changle as soon as possible.

411
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Changhao.

412
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,839
Think about it, Changhao.

413
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,560
Changhao.

414
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
My chest hurts.

415
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,880
Wait for me, Jang-ho.

416
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:47,880
Yu Cosmos.
