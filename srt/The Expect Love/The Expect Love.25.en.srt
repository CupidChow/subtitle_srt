1
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,600
Hello, Mrs. Chu.

2
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Hello, Mrs. Chu.

3
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,120
Mrs. Chu.

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,200
Lady Chu! Lady Chu!

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,000
He's here. He's here.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
This is Mr. Li. This is Mr. Li. This is Mr. Li.

7
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go. Let's go.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,680
Let's go.

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,880
Look! Look! Look! Look!

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,600
Madam, look.

11
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
It's Mr. Zhang. It's Mr. Zhang.

12
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,040
No.

13
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,960
What are you doing?

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
Hello, Madam.

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,280
My second brother complained to my mother yesterday.

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,080
I was forced to go on a blind date today.

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,039
You look handsome.

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,199
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
They are well-educated.

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Who are they?

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
He's very knowledgeable.

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,400
who asked me to marry him.

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
But this is not bad.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,200
It's a flower scout.

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Line up.

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,760
Excuse me,

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,440
How old are you?

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm 40 years old.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,320
Somebody help me

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,640
Save me.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
I was born a subordinate.

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,120
If I die, I'll be a ghost of the subjects at night.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Okay, I'll figure something out.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,040
Think of a way.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:33,920
Come here.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,720
He's 40 years old. He's still flirting.

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,720
How many years has he been scouting?

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,520
Madam. Madam.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,560
It's called late success.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,640
What do you mean?

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,560
He looks like that.

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
Show me your stomachache.

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
More pain.

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,200
That's enough.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,800
Hurry up.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
What flowers?

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,760
What are you doing?

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,880
My stomach hurts.

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Why does it hurt?

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,880
Is there something like a kid kicking?

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,520
That's right, kid.

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
No.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,040
Du Ruofei.

54
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,920
The child is not mine.

55
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,960
Qiu Changle.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,920
Mom, I can’t take it anymore.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Sister, take me to the doctor.

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Okay.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,040
No.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Come back, you two!

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,040
Madam, what's going on?

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,680
What is this?

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,360
Here you are.

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,360
Fei.

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,120
Do you think His Majesty was forced?

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
I think...

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,560
It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.

68
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,480
It's not him.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,280
I kissed him.

70
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,920
He promised to take me flying around.

71
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,120
Why do you break up with me?

72
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,680
Think about it.

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,400
Who can do anything to him?

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,079
The imperial court tried to arrest him several times.

75
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,280
he still flew around.

76
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,840
What's wrong with him?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
I don't want to marry someone else.

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,120
How about this?

79
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,880
Let me ask you.

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,400
Do you want to uphold justice

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
or marry me?

82
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,880
It's the same thing.

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,280
It's not the same.

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,240
One is you are hungry.

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,600
and you want to eat sauerkraut fish.

86
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,320
I don't understand.

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
Let me put it this way.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,920
you want to be a hero

89
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,640
and fly around.

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,400
One more thing.

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,920
If you want to make supper and wait for him to come back,

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,760
you'll have to be a hero and fly around.

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,640
How can I cook?

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,200
I see.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,040
Then you should get married.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you like this too? I'm not. I'm not.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,560
No.

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't want to live anymore.

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,080
Calm down.

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,360
I mean

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm against marriage arrangement too.

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,440
I'm the one who supports freedom of love.

103
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,159
In your case,

104
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
someone can save you.

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,000
My second brother.

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Jiang Lanting.

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,440
Him?

108
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,720
How?

109
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
Do as I say.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
and tell him everything.

111
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,960
Tell him

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,240
you don't want to marry those silly sons of adults.

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,640
Fine.

114
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
You have to make it clear

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
You don't want to marry me either.

116
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,800
What?

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,760
You go first.

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,840
Look at his reaction.

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,480
If he still smiles,

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,120
you can still be saved.

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,560
He's smiling. I can save him.

122
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,360
Why?

123
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
No, there's no reason.

124
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,120
Just go ahead.

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,440
Go.

126
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,480
Come on. Come on.

127
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
These two

128
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
depends on who breaks the window first.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Changle is a good girl.

130
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
She has a big mouth.

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,680
She has at least 20 dishes for a meal.

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,480
She eats so much.

133
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
This is nothing.

134
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,520
I think we should go to your house

135
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
Because she knows instruments.

136
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,640
When she makes a sound,

137
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,440
It's a hundred miles away but it doesn't grow at all.

138
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I...

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,960
Think about it.

140
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
Your Highness, you are so relaxed.

141
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,000
Magistrate Zhao, I was looking for you

142
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,920
Well,

143
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Changle is suitable to go to your house.

144
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,720
Because she’s strong.

145
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
She carried such a thick tree and left.

146
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,159
It fits.

147
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,000
It's perfect.

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,120
Yes

149
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
Because my family is a girl.

150
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,840
What are you doing?

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
What's going on?

152
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,440
What should we do?

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Mrs. Xun.

154
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,000
What a coincidence.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Lord Ning. Hello.

156
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,200
Have a seat.

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,560
What would you like to drink?

158
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll have the same drink as Madam.

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,480
Okay.

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,520
Thank you.

161
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,159
Lord Ning, what case are you working on?

162
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
The world is peaceful recently.

163
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm fine.

164
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,680
so I came out to patrol.

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,760
It's better to pick another day.

166
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,280
I'll treat you to a meal.

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
Consider it my treat last time.

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
Well...

169
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,760
I have to tell Changhao.

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,159
Or...

171
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,080
Why?

172
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,080
Last time.

173
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,400
Come on. Come on.

174
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,240
Go.

175
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,280
It’s OK. Forget it.

176
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,320
Did Mrs. Xun quarrel with Mr. Xun?

177
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Why?

178
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,360
He's so busy now.

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,640
I can't even see him.

180
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,280
Sometimes I go out at midnight.

181
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,320
What is Mr. Xun busy with?

182
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,400
How can he ignore his wife?

183
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,720
It's really inappropriate.

184
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,840
He didn't ignore my feelings.

185
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,920
He's busy with

186
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Jang-hyeon's death in the fire.

187
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,760
I understand.

188
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,200
Jangdeo died in the fire.

189
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,440
That was an accident.

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
I thought so too.

191
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Then I found out

192
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
it was Lord Zhang.

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
He put thorn pollen

194
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,840
to let you tell me

195
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,120
what he wants to reverse.

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,120
Solve the case?

197
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,480
Reveal the case! Reveal the case!

198
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
Liang Mansion case.

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
The money for disaster relief.

200
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,320
Liang Mansion case?

201
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
That was five years ago.

202
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,520
And I heard

203
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,440
they embezzled three million taels.

204
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,680
It shocked the court.

205
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,840
He should be killed.

206
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,400
No, no, no.

207
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,159
Actually,

208
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,080
he was wronged.

209
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,040
He's innocent!

210
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,880
No way.

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,160
I heard that

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Tell him Lord Liang is guilty.

213
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Then, I punished him.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Then he didn't find any money.

215
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,080
Then he said he killed the officials.

216
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,480
If you kill the officials, you'll have money.

217
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,040
In the end,

218
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,960
the whole family was executed.

219
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,360
It's just a complicated case.

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,240
I can't explain it.

221
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
The corruption in the government

222
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,560
people like us who don't commit crimes

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
won’t understand.

224
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
But Lord Xun,

225
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
I should have reported this to the royal agent.

226
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
I really don't understand.

227
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,880
your department.

228
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
I haven't solved my own problem yet.

229
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,720
Your problem.

230
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,080
If you need anything,

231
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,159
just let me know.

232
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
As long as I can help,

233
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,080
I will.

234
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,960
Really?

235
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,600
Really?

236
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm going to say it. Okay.

237
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,159
Go ahead.

238
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,920
Look at Gu Mochou and Changhao.

239
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,880
have a story?

240
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,000
You can ask me if you want to know anything.

241
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Changhao.

242
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Why aren’t you in the Ministry of Justice?

243
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,760
Mr. Xun.

244
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,120
Lord Ning is also on the street.

245
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,240
What a coincidence.

246
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,360
I’ll be the host.

247
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,560
have a drink with Mr. Xun and Mrs. Xun?

248
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,280
Sure.

249
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,960
Let's go to Guihe Restaurant.

250
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,440
Let's go.

251
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Let's go.

252
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Fish head soup.

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
Squirrel and cinnamon fish.

254
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,080
Are you hungry?

255
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,040
One more.

256
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,840
Yes.

257
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
Why did you order so long in Ningji

258
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,200
One more.

259
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
But since you're here,

260
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Shall we have a drink?

261
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,320
I'll get the wine.

262
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,800
Sit down.

263
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,600
The best wine here.

264
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm on duty. I can't drink.

265
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,920
Then why did you come out for a walk?

266
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,760
You come out to date Ningji alone

267
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,240
Can't I go out for a walk?

268
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,640
I don't have to go to work.

269
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,680
Fine.

270
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,120
I just took Changle out for a walk.

271
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
I ran into him.

272
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,920
What a coincidence!

273
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,880
You always meet him.

274
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,680
Let's go. Let's go.

275
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,000
Wait.

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
Are you jealous?

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,200
I didn't even have breakfast.

278
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,960
Why would I be jealous?

279
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Then why are you always picking on her?

280
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,480
Then why do you always protect Ning Ji?

281
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,960
I...

282
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,840
You...

283
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,480
No.

284
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,360
Why are you so fickle?

285
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,520
You're so unpredictable.

286
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

287
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
I just ordered a few dishes.

288
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,720
Sit.

289
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,680
Here you are. Have a seat. Thank you.

290
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,160
Thank you for your hospitality.

291
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,280
I can't eat outside today.

292
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm taking Her Ladyship home for a meeting.

293
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,160
You're leaving after the order?

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're going back together.

295
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,240
This...

296
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll invite you next time. Okay.

297
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,160
Okay.

298
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,560
Let's meet another day.

299
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,280
Bye.

300
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,560
Bye.

301
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
Qiu Changle

302
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,280
is really amazing.

303
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,440
First of all, she's very capable.

304
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,840
The tiles on the roof

305
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,880
were all changed by her.

306
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,440
Even the toad and turtle in the fish tank

307
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
were picked up by her.

308
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,800
Secondly, she is very thrifty.

309
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,600
In a year,

310
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,240
in a year.

311
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
and break over 20 pairs of shoes.

312
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,760
Throw away dozens of taels

313
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,880
But it's not a big deal

314
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,280
Right?

315
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,080
It's like this. It's like this.

316
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,600
She...

317
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Your Highness.

318
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
Such an excellent woman

319
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm not good enough for you.

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
What are you afraid of?

321
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,600
Try it.

322
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,240
No, no, no.

323
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
He's only 11 years old.

324
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,320
And he has been suffering from a strange disease.

325
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,480
Eleven is indeed a bit younger.

326
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,080
Yes.

327
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,680
What a pity.

328
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,960
Changle

329
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,160
take care of Changle.

330
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,800
Because...

331
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,080
Lord Li.

332
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,680
Your yard is so deserted.

333
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,560
Why don't you take care of it?

334
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,240
Here's the thing, Your Highness.

335
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,160
My son often practices martial arts here to strengthen his body.

336
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,320
He doesn't like crowds.

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
Just let him be.

338
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,320
Father's love is like a mountain.

339
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,040
I'll leave now, Mr. Li.

340
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,600
Goodbye.

341
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,040
Goodbye, Your Highness.

342
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm leaving.

343
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,200
Tell me.

344
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,800
What is it?

345
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,960
Ruofei said only you can do this.

346
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
What can I do?

347
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
If you can't,

348
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,120
I'll have to run away.

349
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,480
I won't go home again.

350
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,160
It's not that there's no way.

351
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,880
Come on.

352
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,000
I think

353
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,080
Mr. Qian’s fourth son is really good.

354
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,400
If the tea cup is on the head,

355
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,120
if it hits the head?

356
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,960
Tea is for drinking

357
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,280
It's actually very simple.

358
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,840
The east wind satisfies me, hoping to send Tan Lang here.

359
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
At night,

360
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
is not your destiny.

361
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,600
And those fourth-rank sons are not your ideal.

362
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,120
What about you?

363
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,320
When will you understand me?

364
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,960
When will you understand his feelings?

365
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,520
When will you understand me?

366
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,400
You...

367
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,440
The poem I wrote when I was young is still here.

368
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,480
It smells good.

369
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,080
Here. Have some tea.

370
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,480
Do you want some white tea?

371
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't like white tea.

372
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,280
I guess Ning Ji has this hobby.

373
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,640
Ningji.

374
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,200
Ning!

375
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,880
Well,

376
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,640
he really likes white tea.

377
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
As expected of the Deputy Minister of Justice.

378
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,560
You're so observant.

379
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,160
You seem busy every day.

380
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,560
You know what kind of tea he likes?

381
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,440
Am I busy?

382
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,800
I'm not busy.

383
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,440
I'm free.

384
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,480
Really?

385
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,920
Then let me handle the case.

386
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,200
I'll follow you.

387
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,760
Yes.

388
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,680
who is inseparable.

389
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,400
No, Changhao.

390
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,360
Look.

391
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,840
You always ignored me.

392
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,000
Why are you staying with me now?

393
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,320
Are you guys so fickle?

394
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,000
You are my wife.

395
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,240
Of course we should stay together.

396
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,120
Is there a problem?

397
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,800
It's here.

398
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,280
This one. This one.

399
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,520
Logically speaking,

400
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,600
there seems to be no problem.

401
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,120
Then I'm not the one you like.

402
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
Why do I have to stay by your side?

403
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,640
That's strange.

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,760
What are you talking about?

405
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,720
You mean

406
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
you want me to go to work with you?

407
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,840
Yes.

408
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,400
What does he want?

409
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
Because Ningji is jealous.

410
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm not his lover.

411
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Why should I be jealous?

412
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,200
Do you really need me?

413
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,880
I can't even remember every government office.

414
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,560
Are you getting paid?

415
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,440
Yes.

416
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,280
Do you have insurance?

417
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,680
All of us will protect you from danger.

418
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,160
Deal.

419
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,040
I won’t let you go.

420
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,640
Sign it.

421
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,560
OK.

422
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,200
I have something to tell you.

423
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,400
How do you feel about me?

424
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,240
I'm sorry.

425
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,400
Sorry.

426
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,720
Ruofei.

427
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,280
I'm sorry.

428
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,720
Wait a minute.

429
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,960
Tell me.

430
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,640
Who is it?

431
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,080
I can hold on.

432
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,720
There's something I dare not tell you.

433
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,760
I feel very guilty.

434
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,240
Don't bother.

435
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,360
Just tell me who it is.

436
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
It's him. It's him.

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,720
Who is it? It's me. It's me.

438
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Before I caught the pork ribs

439
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,120
I thought you were

440
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,760
a spy.

441
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
You think I'm a bad guy?

442
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,800
From the wedding day to Du ribs were arrested,

443
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,760
I always suspected you were a spy of Gou Jae-kook.

444
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,359
I blamed myself.

445
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,720
So I always wanted your forgiveness.

446
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,200
So I did all kinds of things.

447
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,800
I hope you...

448
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,440
Okay. Let's go.

449
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,880
After all this,

450
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,440
you've been suspecting me, right?

451
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,560
No, Ruofei.

452
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,599
I... I just hope...

453
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,960
Stop talking, Qiu Changhao.

454
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,600
You're done.

455
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,240
I'm telling you. I'm going to turn black. I'm going to turn black. Okay.

456
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,520
I'm a fan now.

457
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm not done with you.

458
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Sleep in the study.

459
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:35,960
Go.

460
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,200
Go.

461
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,160
Aren't you leaving?

462
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,240
Are you waiting for me to kick you?

463
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
Let's go.

464
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,120
Go.

465
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,080
I'm leaving.

466
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,440
Go.
