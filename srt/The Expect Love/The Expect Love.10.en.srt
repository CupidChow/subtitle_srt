1
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,759
Tell me. What's the matter? I'm here to see you.

2
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:38,920
See for yourself.

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,200
It seems that something has happened to me.

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,280
You understand.

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,680
Did you fight with Hengyu?

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
How did you

7
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,200
become the Deputy Minister of Justice?

8
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
I fought with Hengyu.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Hengyu can't beat me. He can't beat me.

10
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,800
No.

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm asking you to look at this picture.

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
The painting is torn like this.

13
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,360
Hengyu must be angry.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,919
I mentioned him before he drew.

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,680
I told you

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
not to mention him in front of Hengyu.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,960
I was just testing.

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
I asked him to send it to his father

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,880
when he finished drawing.

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
But he suddenly refused.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,120
and started to draw randomly.

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,360
I even tore the painting.

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
I still don't get it.

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,920
It's strange that you can see it clearly.

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Let me explain.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,880
Listen carefully.

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,040
First,

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Hengyu should know that my father

29
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,000
didn't go far.

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
He passed away.

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,840
Second,

32
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
It's like a flame. It's like this. It's like this. It's like this.

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,800
Fire?

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,760
I think Hengyu knows

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
that my father died in the fire.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,040
Someone must have spilled the beans.

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
I have to ask you.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,640
I've only been here for a few days.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
After Hengyu was quiet and isolated,

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,800
Nanny has been leading him.

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,960
Except you,

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,600
he has never been close to anyone.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,920
Who else?

44
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,240
That's Nanny.

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,960
Why didn't I think of that?

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
Wait a minute. Sit down.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,440
Where are you going?

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Go home and interrogate Nanny.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
If you go back like a fool,

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
you'll scare the nanny to death.

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,120
Let me go.

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Help me.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Help me.

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,120
Let's go.

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,120
Let's go. Let's go.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,720
No, no.

57
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,600
It still hurts.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,320
Carry me.

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,760
I did it to help you find clues.

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,880
You're obligated to do it, right?

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,840
Hurry up!

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Let's go. Let's go.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
It's pretty. It's pretty. It's pretty. It's pretty.

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,640
It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Look! Look! Look! Look! Look!

66
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,640
Songquan.

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
The threshold of the Ministry of Punishments is a bit high.

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Chun Ying.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,320
Don't let her wander around when you go out.

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,120
in case you get hurt.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,160
Yes, Young Master.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,600
Don’t come back too late.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,520
Don't be reluctant to spend money

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,360
How did you act in a foreign movie?

75
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,960
I think so.

76
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,640
Nanny, the weather is really bad today.

77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,160
If I hadn't hit my knees,

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
I didn't expect

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
there's something that hasn't been solved.

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
My bad memory.

81
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,120
Mrs. Cheng, it’s dark.

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
Don’t scare me.

83
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,600
Let me ask you.

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
What were you doing

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,400
What are you doing?

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm in Young Master's room.

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,680
Young Master is here too

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Yes.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,120
What is he doing?

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,400
He...

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,640
He's asleep. He's sleeping. He's sleeping. He's sleeping. He's sleeping. He's sleeping.

92
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,680
Nanny.

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,960
You should know the consequences of not telling the truth.

94
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
Young Master Yue, I'm telling the truth.

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,640
Young Master did fall asleep that night.

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,280
Don't worry. Take your time.

97
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,360
Think about it.

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
Did Hengyu see anything?

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,760
That night, when Young Master was sleeping,

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,680
he wanted to find his father.

101
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,760
I finally put him to sleep.

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,920
But...

103
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,320
[I woke up in the middle of the night, and I realized that I was in a coma.] [I realized that]

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
I suddenly found

105
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,480
Young Master is missing

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,760
Help! Fire!

107
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
Water

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
Water

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,200
Come and help

110
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,400
Hurry!

111
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
Help!

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,000
Fire! Hurry!

113
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,040
Hengyu!

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't be afraid.

115
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,880
Let's go.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,520
Why didn't you tell me? I'm going to tell you.

117
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,320
I...

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm afraid I'll blame you.

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,360
Er Ye, I was wrong.

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,360
I was afraid that Old Madam would blame me.

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I didn't take good care of Young Master.

122
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm afraid I'll lose my job.

123
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,680
Don't be nervous.

124
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
Think about it.

125
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,400
Did you see anything else?

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
Mrs. Cheng, I’ve told you everything I know.

127
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,040
After the fire that night,

128
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
I've been coaxing the young master to sleep in his room.

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
and never went out.

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,480
I don't want anyone to know what happened today.

132
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
what happened today.

133
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,040
Yes, don't worry.

134
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,320
Go down.

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Go.

136
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,600
Thank you, Mr. Cheng. Thank you, Mrs. Cheng.

137
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
That is to say,

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
Hengyu went to his room that day.

139
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,000
Then he...

140
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
saw the last thing.

141
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,800
Hengyu seems to know more

142
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,159
than we know.

143
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,400
Continue to attack Hengyu.

144
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,680
Ruofei.

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,760
Ruofei. Ruofei.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Changle is here.

147
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,200
Changle!

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Hello. Hello.

149
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,960
Hello. Hello.

150
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,640
Ruofei.

151
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,760
Hello. Hello.

152
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Come on. Let's go.

153
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Long Yue is here too.

154
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,680
Shouldn't I be here?

155
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
What were you holding?

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,960
Changhao, didn't you say you were busy?

157
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,880
I...

158
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
You said you need to go to the bathroom.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Hurry up and go.

160
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,520
Come on.

161
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
I haven't worn my shoes.

162
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,440
Come on.

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,320
Come on. Come on.

164
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
Come on. Come on.

165
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,159
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

166
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,600
Go! Go!

167
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,640
Go, go, go.

168
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,120
Get out! Get out!

169
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Get out! Get out!

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,280
What's wrong?

171
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,560
I wrote a letter to you.

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,800
You're here? Yes.

173
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Ruofei.

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
Am I dreaming?

175
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,280
A dream?

176
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,280
It hurts. It hurts.

177
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,720
Yes.

178
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
This isn't a dream.

179
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,640
Look.

180
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,440
His handwriting is so nice.

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
The paper has fragrance.

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,840
It smells like soap

183
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,840
It smells good.

184
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
He wants to meet me tonight.

185
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,560
under Wangyue Bridge in the south of the city tonight.

186
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Is it going so fast?

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
But the problem is

188
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
What should I wear?

189
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,760
I'll prepare a stunning dress for you.

190
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,800
to blink his eyes.

191
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

192
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,000
Ruofei.

193
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,120
If Hengyu doesn't want to say it, don't force him.

194
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
I don't want him to remember something unhappy.

195
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,720
Don't worry.

196
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
Call me Child Expert, Du Ruofei.

197
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Give it to me.

198
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,040
Let's go. Let's go.

199
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,880
It's a toy. It's a toy.

200
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
It’s a toy. It’s a toy. It’s a toy.

201
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,440
Hengyu.

202
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,600
Let's have a competition. Okay? Okay.

203
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,320
Hengyu.

204
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,680
Are you afraid of losing to me?

205
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,840
Okay, I'll go first.

206
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,280
Let's draw

207
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
the person we miss the most.

208
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,040
Done.

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,320
This is your uncle, right?

210
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,720
No?

211
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
I think so.

212
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,200
Isn't this Qiu Changhao?

213
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,040
Hengyu, is this

214
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,000
a food?

215
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,240
I wondered why she stopped

216
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
She used her strength on the doll.

217
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,920
This little fox is quite cunning.

218
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
It's a plant.

219
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
It's not a human. It's a human.

220
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,040
Is it a person? Yes.

221
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,680
Can you read it?

222
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
It's so obvious. Can't you understand it?

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,600
What is this?

224
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,000
Smooth.

225
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,480
What about this one?

226
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,880
It's a candlestick. It's a candlestick. It's a candlestick.

227
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,240
It's the light. It's the light. It's the light. It's the light. It's the light.

228
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,400
It's like this. It's like this. It's like this.

229
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
It's a line. It's a symbol. It's a symbol. It's a symbol.

230
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,080
It's your big brother. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,720
It's...

232
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,160
Did he...

233
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,080
He set the fire himself?

234
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,440
He committed suicide.

235
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,000
It's not impossible.

236
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Think about it.

237
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,200
A man is facing a newborn child.

238
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,560
and his wife who just died

239
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
when he just died.

240
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,040
And your brother never remarried.

241
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,920
It means he values friendship.

242
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,160
It's possible that he committed suicide.

243
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,360
No way.

244
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
My brother loves Hengyu so much.

245
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
How could he leave such a young child behind?

246
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,960
without a child?

247
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,600
Besides, even if I have no regrets,

248
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,280
he didn't have to burn a house to commit suicide.

249
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
My brother is a royal agent.

250
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,000
He has been through many major cases and important cases.

251
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,840
He's far better than me.

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,880
He won't be so weak.

253
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
No matter what book you read,

254
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,160
It's better to be careful.

255
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,840
I can't remember anything now.

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,320
In fact, from my experience,

257
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
the stronger he looks,

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,920
the more fragile he is.

259
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,920
Many depressions are like this.

260
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Depression.

261
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm unhappy.

262
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
I feel sad inside.

263
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,440
But he doesn't look happy.

264
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,240
But he's not obviously unhappy.

265
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,520
He's in good health too.

266
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
He just had asthma.

267
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
Is this all an illusion?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
It's possible.

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,440
Many patients with depression

270
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
He didn't know he had depression.

271
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,360
Do you play games with your brother?

272
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,240
No.

273
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Do you want to drink? Yes.

274
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,280
Sometimes.

275
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,000
Will you cry when you're drunk? Will you laugh?

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,560
Can you sing?

277
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,440
No.

278
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,360
What are you doing? You're drunk.

279
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,920
Let's go.

280
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,920
This...

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
He doesn't have depression.

282
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360
That's strange.

283
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,640
I don't understand

284
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,960
A middle-aged man's pain

285
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
Where is it?

286
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,480
Don't you have depression?

287
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,040
Right.

288
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
There's another way. Let's go. Okay.

289
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,120
Go ahead.

290
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
We can hypnotize Hengyu.

291
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,880
What is hypnosis?

292
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,280
Let me get ready.

293
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,520
I'll show you tonight.

294
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,920
What is she up to now?

295
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,320
You're here.

296
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,440
So handsome.

297
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Sorry, you got the wrong person.

298
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,200
Don't be embarrassed.

299
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,840
Just kidding.

300
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,280
Sorry, miss.

301
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

302
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,600
I'm grateful that

303
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
I'm already grateful.

304
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,720
I should thank you.

305
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
for saving my life last time.

306
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,600
for saving my life.

307
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,280
By the way, are your clothes

308
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,600
pretty today?

309
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,560
My sister-in-law designed it for me.

310
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,880
Very special.

311
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,920
I like it.

312
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,680
By the way, the letter you wrote to me said

313
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
you waited for me every day.

314
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,400
Yes.

315
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,920
I was chased by the yellow dog to wait for you.

316
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,360
It's all my sister-in-law's fault.

317
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,840
But thanks to her,

318
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,720
I finally got you.

319
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,720
Fool!

320
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,240
Don't do this again.

321
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,920
I... I'm willing to do it.

322
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
I can't bear to see you like this.

323
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,000
Then,

324
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,680
if he wants to see you again?

325
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
if I want to see you again?

326
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,280
[I'll write to you when I'm free.] [I'll write to you when I'm free.]

327
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,840
I'll write to you.

328
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,640
and send it to you.

329
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,880
OK. OK.

330
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,160
[You're the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one]

331
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,280
It's...

332
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,760
I...

333
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
Let me send you home.

334
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,320
Okay.

335
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,960
Let's go. Let's go.

336
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,040
Don't pull the cloak.

337
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,280
You step on it.

338
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,440
Walk slowly.

339
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,120
Go back by yourself.

340
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't run! Don't run!

341
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,680
At night, I...

342
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Now, look at this.

343
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,120
Look at it, not me.

344
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,720
Then follow the rhythm slowly.

345
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Inhale. Inhale.

346
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,880
Inhale. Inhale.

347
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,839
Close your eyes slowly.

348
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,240
Now, imagine

349
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,760
You're in a deeper and deeper sleep.

350
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,840
When you hear the sound,

351
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
open your eyes

352
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,040
Pick up the glass on your right.

353
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,040
Take a sip.

354
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,000
Do you think

355
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,120
you love the person in front of you very much?

356
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,800
You decided to hold her hand

357
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,160
Coming.

358
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,040
Hengyu, I'm sorry.

359
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,280
I'm going back to take the exam.

360
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,840
Tell her sincerely

361
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
I love you.

362
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,640
Come on. Come on.
