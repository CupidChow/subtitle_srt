1
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
You two are married.

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Why are you still worried about this?

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,640
This one.

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,160
It's like this. It's like this.

5
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,759
That's easy.

6
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,440
Push the bow to her.

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,400
Talk nicely.

8
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,039
Press it.

9
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,840
Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,840
Love her.

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,000
Speaking of love,

12
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,360
have you read the manual

13
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
I gave you?

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,760
I didn't see it. I didn't see it.

15
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
I didn't see it. I didn't see it.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,280
Luckily,

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,919
Its Sister Chasing Secret 2

18
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,440
is fresh out.

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,520
This book answered without any blind spots.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,440
all kinds of questions

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
in marriage.

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,600
In the city,

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,520
in the city.

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
You didn't even take a good look.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,400
All right. I can see

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,920
I can see that you're furious.

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,520
As the author of this book,

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
I'll cook for you.

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,440
Let's open the first chapter.

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,560
What if the girl you like

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,320
thinks of you as a brother?

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,680
The solution is as follows.

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,240
How dare you act recklessly, saying that it's only for her.

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,079
What does that mean?

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
It means

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,720
think about

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Did your wife

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,800
to make you do something ridiculous

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,600
and you don't want to do.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,400
If there is,

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,280
you can do it boldly

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
and express your love.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,840
and show that you only do it for her.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
That makes sense.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
What do you mean by that?

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
It's really interesting.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,200
Let me put it this way.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,920
Pock Wang from East Street

49
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
With my book,

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
with my book.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,040
Because of this book,

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,000
because of this book.

53
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,880
Really?

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
Of course.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,760
Let's get down to business.

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,120
Second,

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
What do you mean? Playing hard to get.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,600
What do you mean?

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,280
You did something

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
touched her.

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,320
She'll come here

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,000
and ask how you feel.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Jang-ho.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
Do you have feelings for me?

65
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,800
Do you like me?

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
You must reject her.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
Let's play hard to get.

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
When she gets confused,

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,079
she will give you an olive branch.

70
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,040
She will express her love to you.

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,000
At this time,

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,480
give her a small gift and push the boat along the way.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,280
to express your feelings.

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
will she still treat you as her brother?

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,200
No.

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,000
It does make sense.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
Right? I'm thirsty.

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,320
Let me pour it for you.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,880
Go on.

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,320
This is for free.

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,240
That's all.

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,200
My previous book costs five cents.

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,360
The price is still the same.

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,200
It's five cents.

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,240
Add it up.

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,800
Do you need ten coins?

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
I don't need money.

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,920
but value.

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,440
We scholars and molesters

90
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880
just hope that

91
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,080
has its value.

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,600
After you put in effort,

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,440
you will understand its value.

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,320
Congratulations on your love.

95
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,640
Read your book. I'm leaving.

96
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,320
Wait.

97
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,120
Since you got the money,

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,240
please help me to look into Ningji

99
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,760
Ningji's problem is a small problem

100
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Your wife's problem is the problem.

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,360
Focus on your study.

102
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,680
Hello, Qiu Changhao.

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,320
Why are you spacing out?

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
I have something to tell you.

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,960
What is it?

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,000
You're here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

107
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,200
What's wrong? What's wrong?

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,200
I found that

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,480
Changle and Jiang Lanting are in trouble.

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,600
What’s wrong with them?

111
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
I think Changle

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,840
Jiang Lanting.

113
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,480
But you and Kang Lanting are like that.

114
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
So Changle can’t

115
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,280
to Jiang Lanting?

116
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Fortunately,

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Changle hasn’t noticed it yet.

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
He seems to be a bit like Jiang Lanting.

119
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,760
I didn't understand a word.

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,720
But the manual says

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,760
you can't show what you don't understand.

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
I think I understand.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,560
Right?

124
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,240
As besties,

125
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm responsible for this sister.

126
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,840
You have to tell Kang Lanting

127
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
or you can't even be friends.

128
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
What is she talking about?

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Besties and threats.

130
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, let's play by ear.

131
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,640
Got it.

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
Ruofei, go to the kitchen and get some snacks.

133
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,040
We'll discuss this later.

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,240
Okay.

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,520
It's here. It's here. It's here.

136
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,920
Miss.

137
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
You can just ask me to come.

138
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,920
Why do you have to come in person?

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,240
You know nothing.

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,400
A wife should be gentle.

141
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,000
If I take these over,

142
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
how beautiful it would be to be a husband.

143
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,360
Miss, I know that.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
I bought some yogurt

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
to Songjun,

146
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
I wanted to feed him.

147
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,960
I brought some snacks.

148
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,320
Hello. Hello.

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,920
Where is he?

150
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,320
[Zhao Changhao]

151
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,760
Changhao.

152
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,200
Let's play a game.

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,200
I see you.

154
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,360
Stop playing. Are you going to sleep?

155
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,960
Qiu Changhao.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,840
You...

157
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,760
Here you go. Here you go.

158
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm coming out for you.

159
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,280
Why are you laughing?

160
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,120
No.

161
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,720
I have to explain.

162
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,039
This out

163
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
It means to admit that

164
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,520
you have a good intention.

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,640
Dragon? Dragon?

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,080
Dragon.

167
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,840
Long Yang broke his sleeves.

168
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,760
What?

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
Do you think I have that kind of hobby?

170
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:46,960
No.

171
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Didn't you admit it yourself?

172
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,000
You and Kang Lanting are the same?

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,400
Me and Kang Lanting?

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,040
You two are not? Yes.

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,800
Of course not.

176
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,520
I saw you in the study that day.

177
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,560
in the study that day.

178
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,800
You even took off his clothes.

179
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,040
It's because...

180
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,080
I...

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
What's wrong? Tell me.

182
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,040
Don't tell me

183
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,920
you are comparing muscles like that.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,560
Yes, we are.

185
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,000
A battle with bare arms.

186
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
Yes, a barefoot competition.

187
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
Two men

188
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,320
Like this. Like this.

189
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,080
Like what?

190
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,560
Should I make it clear?

191
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,640
We're both subjects at night.

192
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,600
I see

193
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
What do you mean

194
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,760
Of course not.

195
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,520
I'll say this for the last time.

196
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,600
We're not in that kind of relationship.

197
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,440
No.

198
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,400
It's not like that.

199
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,440
It's over.

200
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,400
It's over.

201
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,360
What's over? It's over.

202
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,720
No.

203
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
You two are just friends.

204
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
We're just friends.

205
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,920
No way.

206
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Why not?

207
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,040
Do you really want me to like a man?

208
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,440
No.

209
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,520
If Qiu Changhao's true love

210
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,680
is not Jiang Lanting,

211
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,320
It means that

212
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,720
is gone again.

213
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,200
When can I

214
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
go back?

215
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
What are you trying to say?

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,280
Who do you like?

217
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,200
I...

218
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm not the princess

219
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
nor Gu Mochou.

220
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
or Jiang Lanting

221
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Wait a minute. What's going on?

222
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
[Do you like me?] I like you.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
like me?

224
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
The book of chasing girls is right.

225
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,000
I can’t confess my love now.

226
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Let's play hard to get.

227
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,760
Come on.

228
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,000
I knew it.

229
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,280
You're looking for

230
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
again.

231
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I can't go back. I can't go back.

232
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh my god!

233
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,960
Someone help me! Help me!

234
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
Miss!

235
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,880
Miss!

236
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Here you go. Here you go.

237
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,600
It's here. It's here.

238
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,960
Let’s go. Let’s go.

239
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,280
Young Master has left.

240
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
Miss, Hengyu is here.

241
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,080
[Hengyu, where are you?] Let's go.

242
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,440
Over there! Over there!

243
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,680
It's here. It's here.

244
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,200
Good for you.

245
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
How dare you lie to me now?

246
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,760
My Lady, you woke up too late today.

247
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,120
Young Master has left.

248
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,960
It’s good that he left. I don’t want to see him either.

249
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,920
My lord.

250
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,520
What is it?

251
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
When the royal agent received the letter,

252
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,120
he said he could transfer Lord Zhang's case

253
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,080
to them.

254
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
If you agree, they will report to His Majesty.

255
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,360
Okay, I understand.

256
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,360
Sir.

257
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,800
Anything else?

258
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,240
Your mind is getting worse.

259
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,280
You should put family first.

260
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
Jiang Lanting left it here.

261
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,080
I'll return it to the prince.

262
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:46,960
No need.

263
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Tell Kang Lanting

264
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,080
Tell him to come to my house.

265
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,560
You're going back?

266
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,320
Family comes first.

267
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,720
Please

268
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
to Miss Chun Hua for me.

269
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,400
Jiang Lanting.

270
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm busy today. I don't have time for you.

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
What business can you have?

272
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,280
Do you know that wasting my time

273
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,160
is like killing the royal family?

274
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,880
Then why did you come to me every day?

275
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Do you want to die?

276
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,600
Get lost!

277
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,960
Get out! Get out!

278
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,400
Come back! Come back!

279
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,560
Are you okay?

280
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,600
If you have something to say, just say it.

281
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,640
If not,

282
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,520
I can stay longer.

283
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,160
Tell me.

284
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,560
Your clothes are dirty.

285
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,400
Kang Lanting.

286
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you like me?

287
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
I like you.

288
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
How could I?

289
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,240
How could I like you? Right?

290
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,840
Think about it.

291
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,240
You've been through every hole on this street.

292
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Which tree haven't you climbed?

293
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,440
I like you

294
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,160
I don't like you.

295
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
There's no way I like you.

296
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes, I don't like you.

297
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,320
You can't like me.

298
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,680
I work for His Majesty at night.

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,480
Since you and the subjects are friends,

300
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
you should understand

301
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,360
you can't like a friend's lover.

302
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,800
No.

303
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,800
Why didn't I know about this?

304
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,080
You don't need to know.

305
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,000
Just know

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,640
You can't come to me again.

307
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
I have my own things to do.

308
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,440
What else can you do

309
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,640
what else do you want?

310
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
None of your business.

311
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,440
I won't say a word to you anyway.

312
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,640
I won't see you again.

313
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Go away.

314
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,760
Luckily, I'm not from the ancient times.

315
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
Otherwise, if I stay in this room every day,

316
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,360
I'll be bored to death.

317
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,880
This...

318
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,400
Isn't this the jade of my brother?

319
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,240
This person is really...

320
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
He said he cherishes it so much.

321
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,720
I put it here

322
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,640
I wanted to try that day but I didn't

323
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
Let me try

324
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,840
How to blow it?

325
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Let me ask you.

326
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
What do you like about me?

327
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,800
What's so good about him?

328
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,080
You don't even know who he is.

329
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,200
You won't understand.

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,800
I don't understand.

331
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,800
At night, I don't understand.

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
You all think

333
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,040
I like him for helping the rich and helping the poor.

334
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,600
But I'm not that shallow.

335
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,360
What's so special about you?

336
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,760
You couldn't even solve the case before.

337
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,120
the girl abduction case.

338
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,120
Do you know her?

339
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,640
I heard about it.

340
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,960
I was also abducted.

341
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,560
The girls and I were abducted to the brothel.

342
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,640
I came to save us at night.

343
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
After this incident,

344
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,000
he even arranged a maidservant

345
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,760
to the embroidery workshop.

346
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,280
and gave them a livelihood.

347
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,480
He's kind and brave.

348
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
How could I not like him?

349
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,480
Is that why you like him so much?

350
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,040
Let me ask you.

351
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,560
If one day

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
when he takes off his mask,

353
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,200
he's just

354
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,840
an ordinary ugly monster.

355
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,000
will you turn around and leave?

356
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,920
Ungrateful!

357
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
I swear

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,440
whether it’s healthy or ill,

359
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,440
wealth or poverty,

360
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,960
we will both have each other

361
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,600
In the long night,

362
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,160
For the one I love

363
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,320
I will never betray you.

364
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
Are you okay?

365
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,319
Are you okay?

366
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,280
There's no sound.

367
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,640
Is it blocked?

368
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,400
Don't move.
