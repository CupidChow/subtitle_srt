1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,875
You've just joined in the drama club,

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,875
but you're fixing the script now?

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:21,792
Hey.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Are you the director?

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,125
It is not that...

6
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,583
The script you wrote,

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,583
I sympathized
with the main character in many ways,

8
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,750
so I revised just a few dialogues.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,750
It's not bad,

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:44,208
but it's actually different between
what you know and what you express.

11
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,750
So now, you're being an actor?

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,542
An actor?　-You are not, are you?

13
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,583
Just do your errands well.

14
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:55,875
What's up, Han Bit?

15
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,167
Bitibiti, Hanbiti.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,833
Hey.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,083
You guys are always late.

18
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,542
What are you guys doing?

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,750
Are you flirting with Moo Young?

20
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,458
What are you talking about?
I am not that kind of guy.

21
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,625
Then, why are you being a jerk?

22
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,708
Well, because you guys are reckless?

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,125
I hate the weaklings.

24
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,917
Hey, you are being freak again,
stop that.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,833
Let's go!

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,125
See you later, Moo Young!　-See you!

27
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,958
What's for lunch?　-Pork cutlet?

28
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:33,750
Not again! I'm tired of it.

29
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,500
Let's go!

30
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,583
My love.

31
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:50,375
I spent lots of days being foolish
and now I am here.

32
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,583
Now...

33
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,167
I can confess

34
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,375
I love...

35
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,875
Are you the director?

36
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,417
It's not bad,

37
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:24,083
but it's actually different between
what you know and what you express.

38
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,625
Just do your errands well.

39
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,208
My love!

40
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,500
I've spent a day of being foolish.

41
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:41,375
Now I can confess.

42
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,958
Han Bit...

43
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,917
To be honest...

44
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,167
To be honest...

45
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,708
I...

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,958
The closing monologue...

47
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:34,167
If it is ruined,
it would be embarrassing and shameful.

48
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,167
Han Bit.

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,625
I...

50
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,625
want to do it.

51
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,083
What!　-The main role.

52
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,167
Main...

53
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,583
It's not easy to be an actor.

54
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:00,917
Okay, everyone, sit down please.

55
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,292
-You know that tomorrow is the rehearsal?
-Yes.

56
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,167
-Did you have enough practice?
-My love!

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,583
I spent lots of days being foolish

58
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,042
-and now I am here...
-Did you really practice?

59
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,708
It seems you are
making contriving intonation.

60
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,292
Oh gosh!

61
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,417
Well, let's see tomorrow.

62
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,333
I'll be expecting from you, Han Bit.

63
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,250
Do well.

64
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,333
Goodbye.

65
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,417
You heard that, Moo Young?

66
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,708
Professor has confirmed tomorrow

67
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,917
and I've already found the main actor.

68
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:54,250
Also, your image is totally different
from the character.

69
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,667
You've got a punch.

70
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,208
Good bye, Moo Young.

71
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:05,125
By the way, Han Bit's persona...

72
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,125
has dark double eyelids, but you don't.

73
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,125
What's just happened?
Moo Young's just been turned down?

74
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you guys doing?

75
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,208
Do you want to act, Moo Young?

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Not anyone can do this.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,417
Hey, just do what you've got.

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
So then...

79
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,500
I don't have any chances
to show my acting?

80
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,125
I didn't know he was desperate to act.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,708
Everyone, listen.

82
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,500
Tomorrow is the important day,
so please enjoy in moderation.

83
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,083
Yes, cheers!　-Yes, cheers!

84
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,833
Well done, Moo Young.
It should've been heavy.

85
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,167
Good job.

86
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,083
I just thought that
the few dialogues you've revised

87
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,417
are quite good
and it also has sincerity in it.

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Sincerity?

89
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:19,708
So you knew it then.

90
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,417
What did you buy?

91
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,792
What is this?

92
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,792
Peanut?

93
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,208
Hey, that's pistachio,

94
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,500
but why did you buy the one with shells?

95
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:39,917
We should eat this with the roasted ones.

96
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,292
Hey, go and roast these.

97
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:45,542
Si Hoon, it would be good with ice-cream.

98
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,750
Oh, is it?　-Why did you buy these?

99
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,208
It's Han Bit's favorite.

100
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,708
Hey, are you flattering on him?

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,167
He won't give you
the main role with this.

102
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,458
So Mee, try this. Go on. It's good.

103
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,667
This pistachio...

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
is the typical "slow-food".

105
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:11,417
You know, right?
Taking our time enjoying the food slowly.

106
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:17,250
I like this pistachio
that it hatches by breaking the shells.

107
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,417
It's facing the world with pureness.

108
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,833
Just like a bird comes out from its egg.

109
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,792
Even though it's not soft or smooth.

110
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,167
Even though it's rough or clumsy.

111
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,250
I feel it's more attractive.

112
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,583
That's the charm.

113
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,375
Wow.

114
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,750
-That really makes me cringe.
-My fingers are already curled!

115
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,000
It's annoying.

116
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,500
Look.

117
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,833
The emotion you confess
by monologizing...

118
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,583
is like...

119
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,208
You taking off the shell.　-I know.

120
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,583
Look carefully.

121
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,792
My love.

122
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,667
I spent lots of days being foolish.

123
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,750
Now I can confess

124
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,208
that I love you.

125
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,542
I love you.　-Love you.

126
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:43,333
See?

127
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,958
A shell, what?

128
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,875
Hey, this is like gnat's piss,

129
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,417
but I can't stop eating.

130
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:58,917
I can't take my hands off of it.　-Pistachio!

131
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,125
What do you know about?

132
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,042
You don't know about my feelings? Huh?

133
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,917
No...it's just...
It doesn't suit my taste.

134
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,250
Hey guys, let go of him, let go!

135
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,875
He is just speaking the lines!

136
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,958
You've always paid attention
to their eyes.

137
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:28,542
Their eyes were the ones telling you
to behave, speak, eat and dress...

138
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,417
You only loved their eyes, right?

139
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,875
That's why I am quitting.

140
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,208
This was the very reason I came.

141
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,667
My love.

142
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:53,292
I spent lots of days being foolish
and now I am here.

143
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,417
I hid in the shade

144
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,167
as I was afraid of their eyes.

145
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,750
Now I can confess...

146
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,000
that...

147
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,000
I loved you...

148
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:17,708
brother.

149
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,500
Hey, get away from me, you jerk.

150
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:32,167
What the heck!　-Get away!

151
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,708
John!　-Yes?

152
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,750
Did something happen last night?

153
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,792
Don't you remember?

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,833
Never mind, there was nothing special.

155
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,208
It was just you got drunk
and kept begging for lines to act.

156
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,333
And you threw up to the director?

157
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,125
Bye, I should go.

158
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,958
I'm sorry, Director Han.

159
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,375
Director?

160
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,125
Last night, you said "brother".

161
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,250
What? Did I?

162
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,125
You don't remember?

163
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Sorry...

164
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,750
Last night...

165
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,333
You know...

166
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,917
Oh my gosh!

167
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:58,208
Joo Yeon... We failed it! We are ruined!

168
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,208
Fucking pistachio!

169
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,875
Hey, he only needs to show up
for a while. Why doesn't he?

170
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:28,458
He ate too much and now he's not able
to get out from that dirty toilet.

171
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,833
If we can't play it
for the professor today,

172
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,542
then everything would be useless...

173
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,875
I knew this would happen
with his dark double eyelids.

174
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,458
It's ruined and so fucked up. No way...

175
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,000
So Mee, please stop swearing.

176
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:44,333
Well, let's think of the plan B.
There should be one.

177
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,250
Where's everyone?

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,917
Did you...

179
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,375
memorize the lines?

180
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,333
What? He's not an actor, is he?

181
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,708
Where is the main actor?

182
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,750
There was a problem with...

183
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,625
Well, it depends on the director's plan.

184
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,667
Please! Hope it goes well!

185
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you know about?

186
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,458
You don't know about my feelings? Huh?

187
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,458
Their eyes were the ones telling you
to behave, speak, eat and dress...

188
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,333
You only loved their eyes, right?

189
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:13,292
Yes, I also...
I never saw myself properly.

190
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,708
What?

191
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,000
Be quiet! The drama is underway.
Just go down and be quiet.

192
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,250
That's why I am quitting.

193
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,083
This was the very reason I came.

194
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:44,875
My love.

195
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,583
I spent lots of days being foolish
and now I am here.

196
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,500
I hid in the shade

197
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
as I was afraid of their eyes.

198
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,625
I think he forgot, didn't he?　-Oh no.

199
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,875
-Now I can confess, I love you.
-I love you.

200
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,667
My love.

201
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:23,000
Now, I, confess, I, love, you!

202
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Good job.

203
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,500
Pistachio.

204
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,000
Pistachio?

205
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,125
Gosh. What is he doing?

206
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,458
You told me to take the shell off
like a pistachio.

207
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,167
You made me to
hatch the egg and come out,

208
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,042
not running away from anything.

209
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,542
Even though it's rough or clumsy.

210
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,083
Now, I stand here and confess!

211
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
That...

212
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,500
I love you!

213
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,833
Look at professor!

214
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,083
What...is...　-Professor, actually, it's...

215
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,083
What is...

216
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,042
I love it!

217
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,333
Bravo!

218
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,500
Brava!

219
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,542
It's perfect!

220
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,125
How did you know he acts well?

221
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,125
Well done, Han Bit! Well done!
