CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

Episode 6
Heartfelt Words

4
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,247
Did you know Attorney Ha
was from a wealthy family?

5
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,624
I had no idea.
I just found out from the article.

6
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,585
Seriously, I was shocked.

7
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,047
How can you be that two-faced?
It's so scary.

8
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,216
- Is he hiding how he's rich?
- That's enough.

9
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,593
Let's get to work.

10
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,970
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

11
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,903
HA, THE ELDEST SON OF HANGUK GROUP'S CEO,
DREW ATTENTION FOR...

12
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,531
STARTING HIS LEGAL CAREER
AT A SEOCHO-DONG LAW FIRM...

13
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,726
- Could I get a piece of rolled omelette?
- Sure.

14
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,237
Are those reporters?

15
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,953
Maybe it's from Hanguk Group's secretary.

16
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,246
Read the room.

17
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,457
What?

18
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,631
What?

19
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,391
HELLO ATTORNEY HA
PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL

20
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,146
Together?

21
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,402
- I've never teamed up on a case before.
- Okay, then.

22
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,489
They only have one associate.
Attorney Kang will likely handle it.

23
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,367
We have two,
so I'll ask Attorney Bae.

24
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,370
I'll just take it.

25
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,665
Our advisor, Ms. Kim,
gave us the case on the condition

26
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,293
we work with a firm from another floor.

27
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,420
I see.

28
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,799
Here he comes.

29
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,636
So you're taking the case, Attorney Ahn?

30
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,013
Am I working on it with him?

31
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,390
Yes.

32
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,272
You two know each other, right?

33
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,525
Yes.

34
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,031
Now that I see you two like this,
you look pretty good together.

35
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,074
Sorry?

36
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,286
All right.
Please take good care of Attorney Kang.

37
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,335
Don't get distracted.

38
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,013
So which side are we representing?

39
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,474
The plaintiff, Kang Changjun.

40
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,269
WRONGFUL TERMINATION SUIT

41
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,532
Hey! Say something!

42
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,660
You never listen to a damn thing!

43
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,205
How many times have I told you?
What? It hurts?

44
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,375
Now this punk's not even answering me.

45
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,045
Hey. I said answer me.

46
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,964
Answer me, you punk!

47
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,675
You little bastard!

48
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,010
You son of a...

49
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,846
Get up, you punk.

50
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,516
Get up.

51
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,776
We got a report about a fight.

52
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,278
Thank you for coming.

53
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,362
Hello, officers.

54
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,907
I heard it wasn't much of an issue though.

55
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,658
We're fine. You can go.

56
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,161
Since we received a call,
we still need to check.

57
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,913
There's no problem.
We can't have you come in like this.

58
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,251
- Were they the two fighting?
- Not at all. It's not a big deal.

59
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,218
Have you seen him hit anyone before?

60
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,596
No, it was my first time.

61
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,307
If it happened before,
I wouldn't have been shocked.

62
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,017
But he was beating the kid like a dog.

63
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,228
It didn't seem right,
so I called the cops.

64
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,274
But the kid goes and says
he was never hit.

65
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,193
And they told you
to stop coming in the next day?

66
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,278
Yes.

67
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,490
Once they heard I called the cops,
they fired me right away.

68
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,659
What was the reason they gave?

69
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,702
It probably wasn't
because you called the cops, right?

70
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,830
There was no reason.
They just said I was fired.

71
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,001
I did nothing wrong.
Why should I get fired?

72
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,797
This counts
as wrongful termination, right?

73
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,092
Aside from everything else,

74
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,136
no proper steps were taken
in the termination process.

75
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,682
If we focus on that,
it should be an easy case.

76
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,601
Under labor laws, they did skip
every step of the termination process.

77
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,852
Isn't that all we need then?

78
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,357
But before that, we have to see
if Kang Changjun counts as an employee.

79
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,236
He's a club DJ,
but do labor laws cover him?

80
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,613
His employment status.

81
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,532
You're right.

82
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,119
That needs to be recognized first.
But from what we've heard, it's iffy.

83
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,746
There's no contract, no insurance,

84
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,458
and no suitable way
to prove working hours.

85
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,752
And he didn't work every day.

86
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,755
What about pay? He must've been paid.

87
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,883
Yes, he probably was.

88
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,345
But since he didn't have
a regular five-day work week,

89
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,724
that amount likely changed every month.

90
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,642
So it wouldn't look like a fixed salary.

91
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,478
- It'll look like he just got paid per gig.
- Right.

92
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,397
Even if he's recognized as an employee,

93
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,776
Kang Changjun has been accused of filing
a false report against Lee Dongsu.

94
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,654
In the end, it might not count
as wrongful termination.

95
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:55,035
Even if this termination is deemed invalid
due to procedural issues,

96
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,871
they could just fire him again
by taking proper procedures.

97
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,665
Exactly. That's the point.

98
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,922
Then, should we go meet that guy first?

99
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,009
- Who?
- Jeong Minkyu, the person who was hit.

100
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,927
Where?

101
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,185
You came like this?

102
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,728
Look who's talking.

103
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,480
I'm here for work. What else would I wear?

104
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,232
You're not supposed to show that.

105
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,360
At least, take your tie off.

106
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,820
Geez, why would I take it off?

107
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,531
Just listen to me.

108
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,833
Let's undo just two buttons.

109
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,378
Okay, fine. I'll do it myself.

110
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,424
- Take off the jacket.
- The jacket too? It's cold.

111
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,510
- Take it off.
- Yes, ma'am.

112
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,058
That's much better.

113
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,226
Did we have to come here though?

114
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,978
Even Mr. Kang didn't have
his contact information.

115
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,022
I'm sure we would've found that out later.

116
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,400
We can't wait around for that. Let's go.

117
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,165
You said you were here for work.

118
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,071
Is Jeong Minkyu here by any chance?

119
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,366
- Who?
- Jeong Minkyu.

120
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,037
Try over there.

121
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,280
Excuse me.

122
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,740
Are you looking for the restroom?

123
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,825
Only employees can be here,
so you can't come in.

124
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,286
You're Jeong Minkyu, right?

125
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,500
- Who are you?
- You know Kang Changjun, right?

126
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,503
- Yes.
- We are his lawyers.

127
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,967
When you were assaulted,
Mr. Kang reported it and got fired for it.

128
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,093
- He got fired?
- Yes.

129
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,265
We wanted to hear your side
of what happened that day.

130
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,019
He was mistaken and filed the report.

131
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,897
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy.

132
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,484
We might be able
to help you too, Mr. Jeong.

133
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,410
I got hit because I deserved it.
It wasn't a big deal.

134
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,997
It's not serious enough to need your help.

135
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,499
Next time you come by,

136
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,127
book a table through me.

137
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,712
That's what will help me.

138
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,382
I don't know what happened,

139
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,010
but no one deserves to get hit.

140
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,931
No matter what you did,

141
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,059
Lee Dongsu had no right
to lay hands on you.

142
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,897
So if you change your mind,
please give me a call.

143
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,534
Who are you?

144
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,585
This area's for staff only.
You can't come in here.

145
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,007
I wonder where you could be from.

146
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,052
Aren't you looking for a DJ here?

147
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,429
I heard there's an opening.

148
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,807
- A DJ?
- I wasn't sure who I should talk to.

149
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,020
Both of you?

150
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,190
You don't take DJ teams?

151
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,031
"Aren't you looking for a DJ?"

152
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,699
"You don't take DJ teams?"

153
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,702
You mentioned the DJ thing first,
so I had to go along with it.

154
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,329
You could've said "manager" instead.

155
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,290
- Call you the manager?
- No, yourself.

156
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,462
Anyone would see that you'd be my manager
and I'd be the DJ.

157
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,673
You don't exactly look like a DJ either.

158
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,805
So do you think he'll call us?

159
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,226
Getting his statement won't be easy,
but let's wait and see.

160
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,286
I forgot to take this off.

161
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,672
- Give me your wrist.
- No, it's okay.

162
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,841
No...

163
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,686
You must've been to a lot of clubs.

164
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,481
- Yes. You haven't?
- I haven't.

165
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,317
And you call yourself a DJ.

166
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:58,749
24 HOURS
HANGOVER FIX

167
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,282
This is my stop.

168
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,493
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

169
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,897
Hello, Attorney Kang!

170
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,941
- Hello, sir.
- Did you just get in to work?

171
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,442
Yes. Are you going somewhere?

172
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:54,447
I just ran out of coffee this morning,
so I'm heading to the store.

173
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,574
Would you like these?

174
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,326
They're great
when coffee's a bit much for the stomach.

175
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,912
Goodness, thank you!

176
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,998
Hello.

177
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,292
How long will it take?

178
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,793
Just a moment.

179
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,213
- Sir, what's all that?
- That?

180
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,632
They're installing a base station
in our building.

181
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,259
Really?

182
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,512
I heard the rent being paid for this
is pretty sweet too.

183
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,724
So is Ms. Kim going to
give you a bonus?

184
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,518
No, nothing like that!

185
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,894
Well, go on up then.

186
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,396
All right, have a good day.

187
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,648
Thank you.

188
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,612
OPERATION BY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

189
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,253
Do you need anything else?

190
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,298
This should be enough to make a case.

191
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,759
And if it's ruled to be
wrongful termination,

192
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,638
you're entitled to back pay
for the time you weren't able to work

193
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,932
- We'll add this to your claim as well.
- No.

194
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,185
I have no reason to leave.

195
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,771
I only care about proving
I'm not at fault.

196
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,317
I don't want to get paid
for the days I missed.

197
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:17,405
This is a legal right that protects you
from wrongful termination.

198
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,823
You don't have to think that way.

199
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,161
As long as I can work again
with my head held high, that's all I need.

200
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,375
But do you really want to go back
and work there again?

201
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,669
Yes.

202
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,383
I came from the countryside and worked
so hard to make it in a Hongdae club.

203
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,260
There's no reason to stay away.

204
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,429
I did nothing wrong.

205
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,479
Okay, we'll stick to only having
the termination invalidated.

206
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,398
Thank you.

207
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,361
Hello, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

208
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,447
Yes, where are you calling from?

209
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,995
Yes?

210
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,998
A fellow alumnus from my school?

211
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,001
Okay, put him through.

212
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,671
Hello, I'm on the line.

213
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,465
<i>- Attorney Ha?</i>
- Yes, speaking.

214
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,260
<i>Hi, I'm Lee Minwoo from HR Hunting.</i>

215
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,594
<i>I'm a recruiter.</i>

216
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>You went to Gwangseong Law School, right?
I'm a graduate too.</i>

217
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,225
I see.

218
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,103
I'm sorry, but how can I help you?

219
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,815
<i>A startup that just closed
its Series C funding round</i>

220
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,317
<i>wants to bring you in as its director.</i>

221
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,944
<i>Would you be interested?</i>

222
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,822
<i>They're guaranteeing
corporate executive-level pay.</i>

223
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,948
Me?

224
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,033
<i>Yes.</i>

225
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,121
<i>They specifically asked for you,
which is why I'm reaching out.</i>

226
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,208
But I've never actually worked
in-house before.

227
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,878
Why me though?

228
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,672
<i>Well, they're looking to build ties
with Hanguk Group.</i>

229
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,302
<i>It sounds like they're hoping
you can give them some leverage.</i>

230
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,722
I'm sorry. I have to go.

231
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,392
<i>Is it okay...</i>

232
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,395
if I bring it up?

233
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,773
About what exactly?

234
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,941
That article...

235
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,069
Is it true?

236
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,697
It's not.

237
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,074
Okay.

238
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,243
Then, that's what our firm will go with.

239
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,039
- Let me know if you have any issues.
- I don't.

240
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,166
Okay.

241
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,222
It's freezing.

242
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,891
- He's here.
- Where's Sanggi?

243
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,686
He had something urgent to do
and told us to eat first.

244
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,613
All right.

245
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,908
So?

246
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,118
No one's going to mention Sanggi?

247
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,830
He wanted us to play dumb.

248
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,289
Was that what he meant?

249
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,666
Yes, it was.

250
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,001
I told you to read the room.

251
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,799
- Is yours <i>bulgogi?</i>
- Yeah.

252
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,552
- Trade with me.
- Okay.

253
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,223
But did you guys know about it?

254
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,392
We had no idea.

255
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,229
- Did you?
- No, I had no clue.

256
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,897
I was the one most in the dark.

257
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,899
Why are you so upset about that?

258
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,234
He wanted us in the dark.

259
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,612
Yeah, let's give Sanggi some time.

260
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,540
What's with you now?

261
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:57,877
Damn it.

262
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,469
- Are you leaving just now?
- Yeah.

263
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,893
You should have told me.

264
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,646
- About what?
- That my family made money

265
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,106
working under yours.

266
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,903
It must've been so laughable
every time I mentioned it.

267
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,322
It's not like that.

268
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,491
Maybe not for you.

269
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,535
But if I suddenly find out like this,

270
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,121
how could I not think that?

271
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,831
It's not what you think.

272
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,667
What is it then?

273
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,546
What's your deal?

274
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,717
You still have nothing to say to me?

275
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,720
It's not just about my family.

276
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,724
I thought we were a lot closer
than some random coworker.

277
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,560
I thought we could be honest
about everything.

278
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,898
I never talk about my family
to just anyone. I did it since it was you.

279
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,247
I guess only I thought we were friends.

280
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:31,447
The defendant has denied
the plaintiff's employment status claim,

282
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,284
and the plaintiff has submitted
materials to prove it.

283
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,369
Yes, Your Honor.

284
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,705
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Plaintiff's counsel.

285
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:44,460
Could you briefly explain the evidence?

286
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,129
Yes, Your Honor.

287
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,093
First, please refer to Exhibit 3,
the plaintiff's subway transit records.

288
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,930
He consistently clocked in and out
at the same times

289
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,267
at the club run by the defendant.

290
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,772
If you refer to the plaintiff's
cell phone records in Exhibit 4...

291
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,533
These show he was always
in Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu during work hours,

292
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,120
which is where
the defendant's club is located.

293
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,001
<i>Regardless of his performance schedule,</i>

294
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,962
he had clearly set working hours.

295
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,686
The pay received by the plaintiff
may appear to vary each month,

296
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,897
but you can see
it matches his days worked,

297
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,026
and it has nothing to do
with the number of performances.

298
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:55,864
He was paid for showing up for work,
not for performing.

299
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,367
Most importantly, the messages
between the plaintiff and defendant

300
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,077
prove that he was working

301
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,621
under the defendant's
supervision and control.

302
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,206
<i>Work the 11:00 p.m. and the 3:00 a.m.</i>

303
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,833
<i>That's why I said to get in there.</i>

304
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,502
<i>You have nothing for today.
Just go home.</i>

305
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,087
- Defense counsel.
- Yes, Your Honor?

306
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,590
Are those texts really from the defendant?

307
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,679
- Defense counsel?
- Is it true that you sent them?

308
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,517
Counsel, who are you talking to?

309
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,270
The defendant, Lee Dongsu.

310
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,899
Are you the defendant?

311
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,528
- Yes.
- Step forward, please.

312
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,411
- Defense counsel.
- Yes, Your Honor?

313
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,998
Did you know he was back there?

314
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,667
Well...

315
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,421
If you were present,
you should've sat up front.

316
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,255
Why were you back there?

317
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,757
Should I take that as a sign
you're hiding something?

318
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,175
No, it's not like that.

319
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,137
The termination process
wasn't followed, was it?

320
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,147
He wasn't an employee,
so it wasn't a termination.

321
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,773
Did you follow the procedure?

322
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,610
A club DJ isn't an employee.

323
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,862
It seems you sat back there
without listening.

324
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,032
That is exactly what we've proven.

325
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,201
Kang Changjun is an employee.

326
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,412
Plaintiff's counsel.

327
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,249
Please refrain from addressing
the other party directly.

328
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,210
Yes, Your Honor. I apologize.

329
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,392
- Nice work today.
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

330
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,810
I was curious and stopped by.

331
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,521
- You came well-prepared.
- Yes.

332
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,613
You.

333
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,532
I have proof you filed
a false police report anyway.

334
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,118
I can just fire you again for that.

335
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,579
Jeong Minkyu already testified.

336
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,166
There really was an assault,
and the report wasn't false.

337
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,380
I'm here because I kept thinking
about what you said.

338
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,631
But it just doesn't feel right.

339
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,885
If I testify, do you really think
I can keep working there?

340
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,472
Mr. Kang reported it

341
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,349
to help you, Mr. Jeong.

342
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,018
I never asked for his help.

343
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,521
Other go out of their way to help you.

344
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,691
But why won't you do the same
and take care of yourself?

345
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,777
There's no such thing
as deserving to be hit.

346
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,532
You don't have to testify for us.

347
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,743
But at the very least, protect yourself.

348
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,162
I'll help you.

349
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,124
THE DJ CALLED THE POLICE

350
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,126
LEE DONGSU SLAPPED AND STOMPED ON ME

351
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,377
STATEMENT BY JEONG MINKYU

352
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,713
That little bastard, Minkyu.

353
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,216
Jeong Minkyu
will be pressing charges soon.

354
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,728
Just leave me alone!

355
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,231
Why do you keep chasing me around
and annoying me?

356
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,907
How does Lee Dongsu know our advisor?

357
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,368
Who's your advisor?

358
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,290
You don't know her?

359
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,208
I don't.

360
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,506
Really?

361
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,092
Is she seriously that rich?

362
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,260
She owns the building.

363
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,095
- This building?
- Yeah.

364
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,264
Unbelievable.

365
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,223
Did you know that?

366
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,684
Well, I kind of figured it out.

367
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,270
It's Kim Hyungmin's Hyungmin Building.

368
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,064
You're right.

369
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,107
Did you guys know?

370
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,735
- No, I didn't.
- What about you?

371
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,528
I didn't know either.

372
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,323
I'm a little...

373
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,075
out of the loop these days.

374
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,078
What's with that reaction?

375
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,497
Since when do you stay calm
about such huge news?

376
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,459
I can't make such a fuss all the time.

377
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,169
What?

378
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,254
What's up with him?

379
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,021
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

380
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,363
<i>You'll be back in a few days anyway,</i>

381
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,907
so drop the pride.

382
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,867
You'll only hurt yourself.

383
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,955
Hello.

384
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,834
You can just go in.

385
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,958
Hello.

386
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,423
Hello, Mr. Seong.

387
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:06,193
When you wanted to switch firms
for the salary, I actually respected that.

388
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,778
You were honest.
They offered more, so going made sense.

389
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,990
Who cares
if it's right upstairs or next door?

390
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,950
Now, I see that was all a lie.

391
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,747
Just say you didn't like our firm.
Why blame it on the salary?

392
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,916
It's not like that, sir.

393
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,419
If it's because of that article,
it's a big misunderstanding.

394
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,547
Okay.

395
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,100
- It'll be a little cold.
- Okay.

396
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,250
INCHEON JUNGBU POLICE STATION
SUSPECT, KIM YUJIN

397
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,627
THIS PERSON HAS BEEN PLACED
UNDER EMERGENCY ARREST

398
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,422
FOR A DRUG-RELATED OFFENSE
UNDER THE NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT

399
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,426
She's my daughter.

400
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,720
I see.

401
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,058
I don't know where to start.

402
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,520
You can take your time.

403
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,107
Or would it be easier
if I asked you first?

404
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,359
No.

405
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,528
I'll tell you.

406
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,948
When she was younger,

407
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,367
we sent her to study in the US.

408
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,995
She was in eighth grade.

409
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,665
I think that's where I should start,

410
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,544
because that was the wrong decision.

411
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,006
Did your daughter go alone?

412
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,633
Yes, we sent her by herself.

413
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,512
Her father and I
had too much going on here.

414
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,598
We believed sending her alone

415
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,475
was the best thing for her future.

416
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,185
She's our daughter.

417
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,190
So we believed
she'd do just fine on her own.

418
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,738
And she started using drugs
while she was there?

419
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,281
Yes.

420
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,117
She said her first time was in college.

421
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,286
To be honest,

422
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,205
we were aware of it earlier.

423
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,166
We took her to therapy,

424
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,210
brought her back to Korea,

425
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,838
and even moved to the US

426
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,424
to live with her.

427
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,301
But nothing worked.

428
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,844
Then,

429
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,680
does Yujin have any prior drug charges?

430
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,766
No.

431
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,310
This was her first arrest.

432
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,021
It was an emergency arrest.

433
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,982
Do you know where it happened?

434
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,068
Incheon Airport.

435
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,612
She was arrested on landing.

436
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,947
On landing?

437
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,327
Someone must have tipped off
the authorities then.

438
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,038
- Do you know who it was?
- Yes.

439
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,875
It was me.

440
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,214
She may be our daughter,
but we had reached our limit.

441
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,799
So,

442
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,260
we told her to come home...

443
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,518
and we turned her in.

444
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,774
Still,

445
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,943
we want to get her out.

446
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,696
That's why I'm here.

447
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,574
Attorney Bae,
please do what you can for her.

448
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,157
- Going home?
- Yeah.

449
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,371
Going home?

450
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,665
Yeah.

451
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,845
What's with this tension?

452
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,139
This feels weird.

453
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,445
Hello. Are you Attorney Ha Sanggi?

454
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,739
- What?
- We're from News Off.

455
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,075
It's for a follow-up
on law school nepotism.

456
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,743
No, you have the wrong person.

457
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,912
From the list,
your background's the most privileged.

458
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:52,996
Excuse me.

459
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,832
- Stop. He said no!
- Did you earn it?

460
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,334
- Okay, we got it!
- Stop!

461
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,211
You have the wrong person.

462
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,880
Don't be like that. We know everything.
Please give us a word.

463
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,423
- I said it's not me.
- Attorney Ha.

464
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,675
- Stop.
- We know about you.

465
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,553
- Talk with me. Go on.
- Mr. Ha.

466
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,178
I said go on ahead.

467
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,429
It won't cost a thing!

468
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,514
- Mr. Ha!
- Hey!

469
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,640
Hold on...

470
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,058
I know a lot of fun stories.

471
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,143
Come on.

472
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,718

That lunatic.

Now, of all times?

485
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,990
THIS IS HA SANGGI

486
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,835
<i>Back in college,
I was nicknamed "The Spirit of Spring."</i>

487
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,463
<i>I'd vanish during the fall semester</i>

488
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,799
<i>and reappear at springtime
the next year without fail.</i>

489
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,343
<i>That's how the nickname stuck.</i>

490
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,806
<i>I had to work every fall</i>

491
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,850
<i>just to afford school in the spring.</i>

492
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,606
<i>That's why it took me
eight years to graduate.</i>

493
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,571
<i>I was born poor
and with pretty much nothing.</i>

494
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,160
<i>During a childhood
where every day was a struggle,</i>

495
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,955
<i>studying was the only thing I could do.</i>

496
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,499
<i>It felt like the only way out.</i>

497
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,925
<i>After graduating college,</i>

498
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,013
<i>I didn't have the time or means
to even think about law school.</i>

499
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,639
<i>But after working for six months,</i>

500
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,767
<i>I felt compelled to go back
and study again.</i>

501
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,896
<i>Maybe I really was The Spirit of Spring.</i>

502
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,108
<i>Without support from the school
and scholarships,</i>

503
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,319
<i>I never could've become a lawyer.</i>

504
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,031
<i>I've always been thankful
of the anonymous generosity</i>

505
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,284
<i>and aid system
for the warmth they provided.</i>

506
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:21,330
<i>Someday, I hope I can pass on
that kindness to someone else.</i>

507
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,835
<i>Modern-day nepotism?</i>

508
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,463
<i>I don't know much about that.</i>

509
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:32,675
<i>All I know is that students
are just working hard</i>

510
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,761
<i>to become good lawyers.</i>

511
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,805
<i>The person you mistook for me
because of our similar names</i>

512
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,266
<i>probably did the same.</i>

513
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,520
<i>So please,
don't point fingers at him either.</i>

514
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,024
<i>Also,</i>

515
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,443
<i>I truly hope no one else</i>

516
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,445
<i>has to ever prove their poverty</i>

517
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,407

This isn't dinner, is it?

521
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:41,179
- I had dinner hours ago.
- Then, why not just rest?

522
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,639
What are you doing here this late?

523
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:49,061
I'm fine. You're the one
who should stop working this late.

524
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,774
I have to keep working
as long as my boss still gives me shifts.

525
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,402
Sitting around only makes me ill.

526
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:00,323
Who gets ill from resting?
You get ill from overworking.

527
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,534
- More radish kimchi<i>,</i> please!
- All right.

528
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,620
Hold on.

529
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,289
Have a fried egg before you go.

530
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,162
I handled Sujeong's divorce case.

531
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,706
- What?
- What?

532
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,292
I represented the husband
in his lawsuit against her.

533
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,168
- It was settled in mediation.
- No way.

534
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,338
- No way.
- We met up afterwards and talked too.

535
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,465
No way.

536
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,598
Actually, I've been doing
prison visitations lately.

537
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:52,892
- Prison visitations?
- You know.

538
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,936
You go every day to keep them company

539
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,856
share news,
and entertain them like a butler.

540
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,565
Things you shouldn't do.

541
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,775
- You're doing that?
- Your boss made you do that?

542
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:04,863
I know. They don't even check my ID
at the front desk anymore.

543
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,282
I'm there that often.

544
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,829
Actually, I'm pregnant.

545
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,248
- What?
- What?

546
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,626
That's why I haven't taken
my allergy meds out of caution.

547
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,087
I cut out coffee
and obviously alcohol.

548
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,257
It worries me when I work all night
and even when I run.

549
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,469
Wait. Does Jiseok know about this?

550
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,264
- Since when? How long has it been?
- They said it's been six weeks.

551
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,975
I knew all of this already.

552
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,810
- What?
- What? How?

553
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,689
You kept checking your period cycle
and spitting your food out.

554
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,233
- What about Juhyeong?
- When I ran into him at family court,

555
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,110
I looked up the case number and parties.

556
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,655
- What about Changwon?
- He told me about it.

557
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,491
Wow, you're...

558
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,242
You're amazing.

559
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,705
Wasn't today supposed to be about me?

560
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,374
- Why would it be?
- Why you?

561
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,293
- What about you?
- For what?

562
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,506
I bet you didn't know this,

563
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,423
- but when I was younger...
- We know.

564
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,927
You wrote a whole essay last night.
No need to pretend.

565
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,594
You knew about it?

566
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,930
You put it out there for the world to see.

567
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,848
- You wanted us to play dumb.
- Hey, hold on.

568
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,559
- What?
- You took eight years to finish college

569
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,853
and had a job in between...

570
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,313
So you never did your military service?

571
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,898
This punk's been pretending all along!

572
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,109
I did serve, you idiot! For six months.

573
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,486
My dad's a national honoree.

574
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,865
- This won't taste good if it goes cold!
- Yes, ma'am. We'll eat right away.

575
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,034
Hurry up and eat.

576
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:57,977
Hey.

577
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,062
I...

578
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,899
I'm sorry.

579
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,985
It's all right.

580
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,154
About yesterday...

581
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,281
Thanks for that.

582
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,911
I take it back! How embarrassing.

583
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,957
I didn't mean it either, you punk!

584
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,793
I cringed before you did, you fool!

585
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,378
- Okay? Wait for me.
- He's so weird.

586
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,673
Hey, wait for me.

587
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,761
I thought you were just
asking me to play dumb.

588
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,388
But it really wasn't you?

589
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,474
That's right.

590
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,933
I told you that it wasn't me.

591
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,853
Then, why didn't you
just strongly deny it from the start?

592
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,397
Why wait until after receiving
all those insults?

593
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,483
What?

594
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,986
- Did you read all the comments?
- Well...

595
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,364
I mean, they were everywhere.

596
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,867
Was it that hard to say it wasn't you?

597
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,121
That it was just someone else
with a similar name?

598
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,416
Well, I mean...

599
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,710
I simply hoped it would pass by.

600
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,129
I just...

601
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,174
I didn't want to relive
how I grew up poor,

602
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,343
and if I denied it too loudly,

603
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,970
it'd be as if I was bashing
the real guy instead.

604
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,181
I didn't want that either.

605
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,642
I didn't know you had such a side.

606
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,895
I figured you were all about yourself.

607
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,691
Yes, it turns out I did have such a side.

608
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,404
I guess so.

609
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,287
Come in.

610
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,167
What are you doing?

611
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,585
You can't just walk in here.

612
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,129
We're still collaborating
on Kang Changjun's case.

613
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,674
That case is closed.
We're all done, so why?

614
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,010
The verdict hasn't been delivered yet.

615
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,136
- The verdict?
- Let's go.

616
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,263
Why would we go to that?

617
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,432
Don't you want to see it?
It's your first collaboration in 10 years.

618
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,059
Come on, we'll be late.

619
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,646
I told you it's nine years, not 10.

620
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,147
Fine, nine years.

621
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,691
We have to hurry.

622
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,110
Okay.

623
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:17,782
Civil case number 2024-25134.

624
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,911
Plaintiff, Kang Changjun.
Defendant, Lee Dongsu.

625
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,289
Absent, I presume?

626
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:24,957
Present.

627
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,380
Mr. Kang's side is present?

628
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,716
- Yes.
- And the plaintiff himself?

629
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:35,842
Yes, that's correct.

630
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,012
All right, here's the ruling.

631
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,556
The court declares that the termination
issued by the defendant

632
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:45,477
to the plaintiff on September 3rd, 2024

633
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,521
is hereby declared invalid.

634
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,441
Court fees are to be paid
by the defendant.

635
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,110
We rule in favor of the plaintiff.

636
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,321
Thank you.

637
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,241
Civil case number 2024-1987.

638
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,035
Plaintiff, Butino.

639
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,496
Defendant, Flip LLC.

640
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,290
Absent, I presume?

641
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,001
The court orders
that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed.

642
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,088
Court fees are to be paid
by the plaintiff.

643
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,679
So? Aren't you glad you came?

644
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,184
We didn't even do anything.
We were going to win anyways too.

645
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,372
Damn it.

646
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,198
Hey.

647
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,201
Why did you have to
introduce me to Jiseok

648
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,246
so I'd get me married and now pregnant?

649
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,084
Why are you getting angry over a blessing?

650
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,379
A blessing? Says who?
Who are you to decide that?

651
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,674
By the way, that's up to me.

652
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,218
But I haven't decided yet, so zip it.

653
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,433
Damn it.

654
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,226
Is it really tough?

655
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,562
It's tough.

656
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,898
I have so much to worry about
because of this.

657
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,820
I don't even have any maternal instincts.

658
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,281
And I doubt I ever will.

659
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,575
That's it?

660
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,744
Why do you think
you need maternal instincts?

661
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,455
Of course, you need them.

662
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,164
You have to raise a kid.

663
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,250
But you've always liked people.

664
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,170
You just have a habit of cursing a lot.

665
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,464
So you'll love your kid too.

666
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,301
Why are you so worried?
Does it have to be maternal instincts?

667
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,310
I've...

668
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,353
always liked people?

669
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,398
Yeah. Didn't you know?

670
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,697
You've been weirdly warm these days.

671
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,617
No, I haven't.

672
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:28,534
Attorney Cho, Jang Sugil is out today.

673
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,827
They said his verdict hearing is today.

674
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,330
Verdict hearing?

675
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,552
I mean, goodness.

676
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:48,762
You're back.

677
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,351
Now that I'm seeing you outside,

678
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,603
you look much better.

679
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,771
I told you I'd get out.

680
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,898
He was cleared. Innocent.

681
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,694
- I see. Congratulations.
- Thank you for these.

682
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,779
Yes, enjoy.

683
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,323
I wasn't joking the other day.

684
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,581
Come work for me. I'll take care of you.

685
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,002
I'll see you again.

686
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,088
Take this to my office.

687
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,969
What on earth is the prosecution doing?

688
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,430
They let him slip through?

689
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,226
ATTORNEY CHO CHANGWON

690
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:43,984
They do have pretty female lawyers here.
Why did they stick me with a guy?

691
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,575
What the hell's with this lowlife?

692
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,744
Do you know me?

693
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,121
Move!

694
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,083
I'm sorry.

695
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,672
What was that?

696
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:11,136
Do I really like people?

697
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,643
<i>Everyone, gather up. This one's on me.</i>

698
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,227
<i>It's a pregnancy party!</i>

699
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,871
BORING JISEOK

700
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,753
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Are you home?

701
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,256
<i>I'm on my way. I'm on the subway.
Are you at the office?</i>

702
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,217
Yeah, I'm still here.

703
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:54,179
- I might be a little late.
<i>- Okay, got it.</i>

704
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:55,972
<i>That's why you called?</i>

705
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,642
- No.
<i>- Then?</i>

706
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,814
<i>Phone's dying, so make it quick.</i>

707
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,276
<i>- What? What is it?</i>
- I'm pregnant.

708
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,034
Hello?

709
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,538
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I said I'm pregnant.

710
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,206
It's been six weeks.

711
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,753
<i>Right.</i>

712
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:33,677
That's it.

713
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,762
- They're still not here yet?
- No.

714
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,053
Munjeong.

715
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,678
Munjeong.

716
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,807
What's going on?
Why did you suddenly come?

717
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,600
It's just...

718
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,852
Earlier,

719
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,272
I was just so shocked.

720
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:10,899
I was in shock.

721
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,692
Well...

722
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:20,075
My phone. It ran out of battery and died.

723
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,618
Damn it.

724
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,038
I was worried that I startled you.

725
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,668
Are you crazy? Why are you crying?

726
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:36,715
I'm sorry. I was just in shock.

727
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,385
Did I scare you?

728
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,681
I'm so sorry.

729
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,191
So, are you happy that I'm pregnant?

730
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,775
You're happy, right?

731
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,821
What kind of question is that?
Of course, I am!

732
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,828
- You must be freezing.
- I am.

733
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,455
Let's hurry home. Come on.

734
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,169
Watch your head.

735
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,346
Your seat belt.

736
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,515
My goodness.

737
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,060
It's really cold today, isn't it?

738
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,354
So you went home and brought the car?

739
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,441
Yeah, I left in such a rush.

740
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,736
Drive safe, okay?

741
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,738
You'll get into an accident.

742
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,636
Let's eat until we burst!

743
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,763
Geez, you startled me.

744
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,264
It's a bar, not a restaurant.

745
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,936
Hey, you think we can't stuff ourselves
just because it's a bar?

746
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,604
What's wrong with you?

747
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,484
- Hello.
- Hello.

748
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,785
I guess you're heading home.

749
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,286
- Yes.
- Yes.

750
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,168
You must've had a rough time, Attorney Ha.

751
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,462
No, not at all.

752
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,431
All right, I'll see you around.

753
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,184
- Good night. Take care, ma'am.
- Good night.

754
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,162
<i>I'm sorry,
but tonight's party is canceled.</i>

755
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,873
- What?
<i>- Go home. You better not party without me.</i>

756
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,337
Geez, what's with her?

757
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,089
She said to go home.

758
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,590
I saw it too.

759
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,426
Come on.

760
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,387
I mean, we could still go
have a drink or something.

761
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,472
Where?

762
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,516
Where?

763
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,476
Are you buying?

764
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,479
Just tell me. Where are we going?

765
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,733
- Please, just be patient!
- Why should I?

766
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,151
I followed you all the way here.

767
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,485
- Hey.
- Just keep following then.

768
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,862
Everything's closed here.

769
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,531
There's one spot
that will blow your mind.

770
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,907
SEOKGO BLOOD SAUSAGE SOUP

771
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,159
What is this place?

772
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,370
What is this? Is it a hidden gem?

773
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,416
We came all the way here for <i>gukbap?</i>

774
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,877
Gosh, I'm freezing.

775
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,550
What are you doing? Say hi to my mom.

776
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,718
What?

777
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,095
Mom, say hi to my friend.

778
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,973
- Mom? Your mother?
- Yeah.

779
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,769
My goodness.

780
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,812
Ma'am, nice to meet you.

781
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,273
I'm Cho Changwon. Hello.

782
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,858
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

783
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,777
I'm Sanggi's close friend.

784
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,612
We always eat lunch together,

785
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,573
drink together,
and pretty much everything together.

786
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,741
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

787
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,493
Give us food already. It's cold.

788
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,079
Thank you, ma'am.

789
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,916
Why didn't you tell me
or give me a heads-up?

790
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,001
This place is legit.

791
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,754
It's not my mom's.
She works here part-time.

792
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:45,340
Geez.

793
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:50,677
- Just once.
- I don't want to.

794
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,180
- Let's just do it once.
- What's wrong with you?

795
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,557
- I want to do it so bad.
- Is this who you really are?

796
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,810
Hey, it's not safe. No.

797
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,854
What's not safe?
Just once before the baby gets bigger.

798
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,565
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, hold on.

799
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,276
You just be on the bottom.
I'll be on top.

800
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,530
No, you never think about
what it's like for me down there.

801
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,950
- No, please!
- I said no!

802
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,577
Just a meter, okay?

803
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,745
- Okay.
- You...

804
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,873
- Just once.
- I'm practically raising a kid.

805
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,542
- Hey, I'm getting crushed!
- Are you okay?

806
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,918
- My head!
- Are you okay?

807
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,671
- Are you okay?
- This is so high!

808
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,674
Hey, hold on tight.
I'm going to lean back.

809
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,509
- Hey, go forward.
- Don't do it!

810
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,635
- Go forward.
- Hey!

811
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,221
<i>Spider-Man, Spider-Man.</i>

812
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,557
This is crazy!

813
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:39,017
- What's so fun about this?
- This is so fun!

814
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,478
Quiet, Munjeong.
The neighbors are going to complain!

815
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,647
Okay.

816
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,983
- Hey! Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

817
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,068
Be careful.

818
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,782
It's absurd the more I think about it.

819
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:55,451
A pregnancy party?
It sounded off from the start.

820
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,620
Then,

821
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,123
let's call it
a first collaboration victory party.

822
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,877
A first collaboration victory party?

823
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,753
That's a mouthful.

824
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,298
So you've never teamed up
with anyone on a case before?

825
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,593
No, I didn't have a reason to.
I'm too good.

826
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,304
You probably won't either
for another nine years.

827
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,265
You always keep it to nine years
even though you could say 10.

828
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,475
Because it's been nine years.

829
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,654
Wasn't this the piece you played?

830
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,908
You actually remember that?

831
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,041
Shouldn't we have left a little earlier?

832
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:48,338
But that dim sum place was a must.
I didn't expect traffic to be like this.

833
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,339
But it was worth it, right?

834
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,466
Yes, it was good.

835
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,927
But you should walk faster.

836
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,137
People might think it's my part-time job.

837
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,727
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine. Let's go.

838
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:08,942
Get on my back.

839
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,988
- It's okay.
- You're filling in for your friend.

840
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:15,782
Come on.

841
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,375
There we go.

842
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,126
Hang on tight.

843
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,180
Right.

844
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,349
Thank you. I'll head in first.

845
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,102
- Okay, go on.
- Okay.

846
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,064
When did you start playing the piano?

847
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,149
When I was eight years old.

848
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:17,945
Was it always your dream to be a pianist?

849
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,367
I think so.

850
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,954
My parents really loved watching me play.

851
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,541
Seeing them smile made me so happy.

852
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,713
So their smiles made you want
to become a pianist?

853
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,216
That's right.

854
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,426
It's probably why I keep playing.

855
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:46,140
Honestly, it's not like I ever dreamed
of becoming a world-famous pianist.

856
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:47,767
What about you?

857
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,771
Have you wanted to be a lawyer
since you were a kid?

858
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,608
It was something else at first.
But it changed as I got older.

859
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,070
Why? What made you want
to become a lawyer?

860
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,366
Growing up, I was good at two things.

861
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,410
Arguing and studying.

862
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,913
So becoming a lawyer made sense.

863
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,834
So?

864
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:16,003
Do you think you'll become a good one?

865
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,047
Yes.

866
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,841
That's my dream.

867
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,885
Wait.

868
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,387
Is your ankle okay?

869
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,640
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

870
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,394
Can you sit for a second?

871
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,373
Can you put your foot up here?

872
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,626
Really, it's fine.

873
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,355
Don't you press the pedal
with your right foot?

874
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,482
I do.

875
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,608
You held up really well.

876
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,443
You don't really notice while playing.

877
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,820
You're such a professional.

878
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,532
When did you buy these?

879
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:31,329
I stepped out
right after the playing started.

880
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,584
All done.

881
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,946
This place is beautiful by the way.

882
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,032
Yeah, really beautiful.

883
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:28,761
If there's a spot...

884
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,682
like this in Seoul,
want to go together?

885
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:34,934
Where?

886
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:38,855
Gangnam Station.

887
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,651
Gangnam Station.

888
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,407
Sure.

889
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,160
Okay, then.

890
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,204
Okay.

891
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,960
But how did you end up being a lawyer?

892
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,838
I figured you'd stick with piano.

893
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,928
You don't have to say.

894
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:14,473
No, it's fine.

895
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,814
My dad was running a business back then.

896
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,067
Thanks to that,
I could comfortably go to school.

897
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,905
But then, he was hit by a huge scam.

898
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,657
It was some sort of crypto pyramid scheme.

899
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,953
My family was devastated after that.

900
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,416
Nobody smiled anymore,

901
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,960
and there was nothing I could do.

902
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,881
So I promised myself

903
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:48,507
that if anything bad

904
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,594
ever happened to my parents again,

905
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,931
I'd protect them myself.

906
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,310
It was overcome well
even though it must've been really tough.

907
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,395
Yeah.

908
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:03,688
My dad's incredibly strong.

909
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,358
No, I meant you.

910
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:07,985
Me?

911
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,323
Not everyone comes out of such things
thinking like you did.

912
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,450
You overcame it.

913
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,744
Good job.

914
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:20,539
You're right.

915
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,667
I did a good job.

916
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,755
Everything's better now.

917
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,591
I just want both of my parents

918
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,386
to stay happy.

919
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,055
That's my dream.

920
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,557
That hasn't changed in 10 years.

921
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,477
Did I tell you this 10 years ago too?

922
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,437
You really don't remember a thing.

923
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:46,272
I only remember yours.

924
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:48,192
You wanted to become a good lawyer.

925
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,487
It looks like you achieved it.

926
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,370
I didn't become a good lawyer.

927
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,497
Why not? You are a good lawyer.

928
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,834
You listen to people who are struggling

929
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,128
and help them get justice.

930
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,968
To be honest,
I don't see it as helping others.

931
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:17,555
I just get paid to fight for them

932
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,516
with what I see before me.

933
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,936
If being a good lawyer
means thinking beyond that,

934
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,022
then I'm not one.

935
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,610
Still...

936
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,741
To me,
you're a good senior lawyer.

937
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,162
And a good person.

938
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,547
Thanks.

939
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:04,226
Don't you normally take the subway to work
and the bus home?

940
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:07,104
Yes, because the subway is always on time.

941
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,066
And the bus drops me off closer to home.

942
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,903
We're headed toward the subway.
The bus stop's the other way.

943
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,863
I know.

944
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,390
You're going back tomorrow, right?

945
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,226
Yes.

946
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,066
Shall we go up?

947
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:55,778
Sure.

948
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:54,290
Law and The City

949
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:26,321
Law and The City

950
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,198
<i>The girl you met on your trip
when you were in law school.</i>

951
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,491
<i>Wait, you two were a thing?</i>

952
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,368
He's been into her since Hong Kong--

953
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,746
Hey! Munjeong is looking for you.

954
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,123
<i>Go home if you're drunk.</i>

955
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:39,250
<i>-That voice phishing case.
- He said he'd make sure</i>

956
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,752
<i>to help me out to get a loan.</i>

957
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:42,920
<i>Normal cases should be easy to represent.</i>

958
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,672
Where do you get this?

959
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,383
<i>It must be so hard for you.</i>

960
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:50,136
But do your families really ask
why you're not married?

961
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:51,304
My goodness!

962
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,931
<i>Is this your first time in Hong Kong?</i>

963
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,142
<i>-Yes.
- When was your favorite moment?</i>

964
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,936
<i>Now?</i>

965
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,614
