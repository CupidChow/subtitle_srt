CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,183
Aren't you getting up?

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,147
I'm off today.

00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,339
Episode 9
If You Ask What My Dream Is

6
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:28,315
BEST FOODS FOR PREGNANCY
SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTER

7
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,817
- I'll get you some soup.
- It's fine. I'll just eat this.

8
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,946
They say it's better
to eat warm food. Hold on.

9
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,676
What's all that?

10
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,637
They're gifts from the nurses.

11
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,472
Should we take a look?

12
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,767
Let's see. This is...

13
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,521
Baby clothes. They're so cute.

14
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,272
This is...

15
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,567
Moisturizer and stretch mark cream.

16
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,736
That's the fourth stretch mark cream now.

17
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,780
Come on. The more, the better.

18
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,657
You think I'll get stretch marks?

19
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,325
I might not.

20
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,827
Everyone's different.

21
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,330
But you might.
Because everyone's different.

22
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,917
What's this?

23
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,921
They're so cute.

24
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,298
They say the first daughter
resembles the dad.

25
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,051
- Yeah.
- She'll be super cute.

26
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,429
Let's see.

27
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,350
Did you ask about maternity leave yet?

28
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,980
Just wait a bit.

29
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,317
I'm not even sure if I can take
maternity leave in the first place.

30
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,987
What? What company doesn't allow
maternity leave these days?

31
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,947
I don't know. That's what they said.

32
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,367
Wait. So, what did you say?

33
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,662
Did you just say okay and leave?

34
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,082
Then, what was I supposed to say?

35
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,960
Was I supposed to say, "I quit"?

36
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,756
No, that's not what I meant.
Okay, don't get mad. The baby will hear.

37
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,718
When did I ever get mad?

38
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,226
This is so annoying.

39
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,480
Munjeong, your breakfast...

40
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,574
How many cases
are you handling right now?

41
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,658
About 50.

42
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,871
So what do we do? Do Attorney Ahn and I
each take 25? We already have 50 each.

43
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,832
Hiring a temp lawyer
for three or six months isn't easy.

44
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,668
You know clients hate it
when their attorneys keep changing.

45
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,961
But it's still my right.

46
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,881
Yes, I know it is.

47
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,866
What?

48
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,745
Use a new one.

49
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,337
Here.

50
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,798
I picked it up.

51
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,068
- Bye.
- Bye.

52
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,075
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

53
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,462
Yes?

54
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,507
- Attorney Ha, you have a package.
- A package?

55
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,176
It looks like the interns sent this.

56
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,179
I see. Okay, thank you.

57
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,522
<i>Attorney Ha Sanggi,</i>

58
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,609
<i>thank you for being
such a great teacher to us.</i>

59
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,111
<i>We'll keep learning
to become great lawyers.</i>

60
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,613
<i>- From Park Dohyeon...
- Kim Hana.</i>

61
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,657
<i>- Gong Minjun.
- And Yu Haeyeon.</i>

62
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,979
This won't do today?

63
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,442
- I don't know why I'm so sensitive.
- We should've eaten something else.

64
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,068
It's okay. Go ahead.

65
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,070
Hey, it must a boy.

66
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,237
My mom was the same.

67
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,615
She said morning sickness
is worse with boys.

68
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,784
But it's a girl.

69
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,826
What? It's a girl?

70
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,203
- Yeah.
- Congratulations!

71
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,955
- Thanks.
- What about maternity leave?

72
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,249
He said no.

73
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,920
I wonder what associates
in other firms do when they have babies.

74
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,338
I have no idea.

75
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,132
- I've always been by myself.
- Me too.

76
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,717
But your boss is a woman.

77
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,637
What did she do when she had her baby?

78
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,265
- She's not married.
- Really?

79
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,352
- How about yours?
- I'm not sure either.

80
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,273
Do you think a female boss
would be more understanding about it?

81
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,859
It's so harsh though.
Of course, they should allow that.

82
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,277
But you know how it is.

83
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,072
We're all small firms.
If one person's out, it makes a mess.

84
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,241
Still, at least you have Juhyeong.

85
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,910
- You two could work it out.
- Right.

86
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,164
I'm okay with it,
so do what works for you.

87
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,458
Hey, come work at our firm.
Our boss isn't like that.

88
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,168
Right?

89
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,380
If a spot opens up,
tell her to hire me first.

90
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,759
What's this?

91
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,095
That? You know...

92
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,850
You didn't get one?

93
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,017
What is this?

94
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,520
- Where did you get this?
- Never mind.

95
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,481
Never mind. It's nothing.

96
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,649
- What?
- What?

97
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,609
- It's nothing.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

98
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,029
- This is delicious.
- Why are your ears so red?

99
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,197
Come, now!

100
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,537
- Did you have lunch?
- Yes, I did.

101
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,664
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes?

102
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,669
If someone became pregnant here,
how would maternity leave work?

103
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,590
Are you getting married?

104
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,260
No, I was just curious.

105
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,387
You had me for a second.

106
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,016
Legally, I know what we're supposed to do.

107
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,061
But in reality,
it's not easy to give maternity leave.

108
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,980
There's only one associate, after all.

109
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,982
Right, that makes sense.

110
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,943
You're really not getting married?

111
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,904
No, I'm not.

112
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,449
Too bad.
I thought we had something to celebrate.

113
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,494
Take care, ma'am.

114
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,751
Attorney, Bae, I just sent you an email.

115
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,711
KoriTech's starting a new business

116
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,380
and wants us to see
if there are any legal risks.

117
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,926
- Could you write up a legal memo?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:09:55,637 --> 00:10:00,183
KORITECH'S NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVE REVIEW

119
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,232
Legal memos are so boring.

120
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,983
Where's Attorney Ahn? He's not here.

121
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,194
I'm not sure. What's the matter?

122
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,447
Well, I had a lawsuit for him to take.

123
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,117
I'll do it.

124
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,495
The client said they couldn't step out
and asked us to come in person.

125
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,456
- And?
- You were concerned yesterday.

126
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,834
Wouldn't advisory work
be easier on you than litigation now?

127
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,336
You just have to sit and write.

128
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,803
- I'm being considerate of your pregnancy.
- No, I'll do it.

129
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,013
- Okay, then.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,575
<i>Munjeong, can you come out for a second?</i>

131
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,455
- Munjeong.
- Yeah?

132
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,624
You didn't eat earlier.
I got you some bread.

133
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,002
Hey, thanks.

134
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,795
And this is decaf coffee.

135
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,131
- You're allowed to drink this, right?
- Yes.

136
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,341
This is precious coffee.

137
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,931
Want to eat some <i>tteokbokki</i> with me later?

138
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,115
- I can handle it.
- Thank goodness!

139
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,535
Gosh, I'm so thankful.

140
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,458
This is really good,
especially this sauce.

141
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,544
They say this place is super famous.

142
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,009
But not a lot of people are here today.

143
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,511
That's why we're here.

144
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,266
Did you enjoy your food?

145
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:10,647
I tried to patent this sauce before,
but it wasn't approved.

146
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,816
The review took a long time too.

147
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,280
But in the end, they said
it wasn't unique enough to be patented.

148
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,116
Did that person work here for a long time?

149
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,953
He worked here
for a little over two years.

150
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,329
- Excuse me!
- Coming!

151
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,457
<i>I originally hired him as a server.</i>

152
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,254
<i>But from the start,
he was eager to learn kitchen work.</i>

153
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,839
And a big spoonful...

154
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,217
A big spoon...

155
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,594
Put it right over here.

156
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,306
<i>So I moved him into the kitchen</i>

157
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,101
<i>and even taught him
how to make our</i> tteokbokki<i>.</i>

158
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:53,982
Then out of nowhere,
he quit and opened a place just like ours.

159
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,151
Did you go try their food?

160
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,738
I figured I'd get worked up
if I went myself,

161
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,573
so I had some takeout
that someone brought back.

162
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,451
It tastes exactly the same.

163
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,872
That's why you think
you've lost customers?

164
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,667
After they opened,

165
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,586
our sales dropped by half.

166
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,839
We always had a lot of regulars.

167
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,010
Often, folks would come
from far away just to eat here.

168
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,971
But I guess their location's better.

169
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,558
It seems people don't even bother
to come here now.

170
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,938
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES
OUR TTEOKBOKKI

171
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,108
INSTANT TTEOKBOKKI RESTAURANT

172
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,735
Thank you.

173
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,906
The patent was rejected,

174
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,951
so he left and figured
he could just use it however he wanted.

175
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,620
That's so shameless.

176
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,583
Are you full?

177
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,127
A little.

178
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,004
Let's go another round.

179
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,011
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES

180
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,143

181
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,853
Welcome!

182
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,066

OUR TTEOKBOKKI

184
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,158
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

185
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,912
It's honestly way too similar.

186
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,916
At this point,
it's pretty much a second location.

187
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,127
Hey, that must be him.

188
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,839
- One more blood sausage here, please.
- Okay, sure.

189
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,481
Can you handle it?

190
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,941
There's no reason I can't.

191
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,152
- Because it tastes the same.
- Exactly.

192
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,783
Give tips on using tableware.

193
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,201
- Okay.
- Give them more kimchi.

194
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,578
- All right.
- Okay.

195
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,961
- So, how's the food?
- Yes.

196
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,672
Take all the photos you want
and spread the word.

197
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,883
All right. This is really good.

198
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,138
I'm so full.

199
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,015
But from what I know...

200
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,352
- Yeah?
- Recipe theft lawsuits almost never win.

201
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,438
Right. Plus, the patent wasn't approved.

202
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,900
They'll obviously use that as an excuse
to say they did nothing wrong.

203
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,821
Just because the patent was rejected
doesn't mean it's okay to steal.

204
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,116
- Yeah.
- But how do you get approved?

205
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,370
I can just ask everyone for the reason.

206
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,456
Why were they rejected for patents?

216
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,524
It's so upsetting.

217
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,570
The ingredients in our pastry fillings are
totally different from the other shops.

218
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,323
Ours have whole beans in them.

219
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,785
That's what gives them
a stronger sweet flavor.

220
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,455
Our customers know that,
and that's why they come here.

221

UNDER CCTV SURVEILLANCE

222
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,993
- Ma'am.
- What brings you suddenly here?

223
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,163
Mind if I take another look
at your kitchen?

224
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:50,254
This recipe isn't protected by a patent,
so there's no issue with using it.

225
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,214
Even if a recipe isn't patented,

226
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,051
it can still be protected
if it qualifies as a trade secret.

227
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,179
Could you pull up Exhibit 4, please?

228
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,308
In most disputes over recipes,

229
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,644
the parties who had them stolen
lost their suits,

230
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:10,274
because the recipes weren't deemed
trade secrets under the law.

231
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,444
It's because they didn't meet
the requirement of confidentiality.

232
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,614
Could you pull up Exhibit 5, please?

233
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,492
For a recipe to be recognized
as a trade secret,

234
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,161
it has to be managed as one.

235
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,955
But most restaurants
don't put any protections in place.

236
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,375
But in the case of the plaintiff,
Jeong Hyeonju,

237
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,252
she installed a separate door lock
on the sauce-mixing room

238
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,840
and shared the code
only with select kitchen staff.

239
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,511
The defendant, Oh Jeongwook,
was one of those staff members,

240
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,513
which is how he learned of the recipe.

241
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,016
That's why this recipe qualifies
as a trade secret under the law.

242
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,520
Keeping it confidential doesn't allow
protections as a trade secret.

243
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,857
It also has to meet the criteria
of secrecy and economic value.

244
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,568
Secrecy is recognized
when it hasn't been disclosed anywhere,

245
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,988
and it can't be known
without going through the plaintiff.

246
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,618
With this level of control,
we can see that condition is clearly met.

247
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,994
Yes, that appears to be the case.

248
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,163
Still, there's no proven economic value.

249
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:11,543
After the defendant opened his shop,
the plaintiff's revenue was cut in half.

250
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:16,506
The defendant used this one recipe
to lure away the plaintiff's regulars.

251
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,718
That alone shows its economic value.

252
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,470
That has not been proven.

253
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,181
Plaintiff's counsel,
please submit your supporting documents.

254
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,308
Yes, Your Honor.

255
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,023
- All right, good work.
- Thank you.

256
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,654
By the way, Chairman.

257
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,533
Remember Lee Dongsu from the first cohort?

258
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,869
What is it now?

259
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,997
He's been investing
in small business owners

260
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,001
but with terms heavily in his favor.

261
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,377
When they push back later,

262
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,547
he demands the full amount back
and threatens to sue.

263
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,758
So he hasn't sued them yet, right?

264
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,843
That's right.

265
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,892
I'd like to meet them in person.

266
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,644
- The victim?
- Yes.

267
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,687
Lee Dongsu too.

268
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,398
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

269
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,361
When you opened the barbecue restaurant,
Lee Dongsu invested 100 million won,

270
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,491
and you agreed to pay him
4 million won monthly in returns?

271
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,578
Yes, I've been paying that
for over five years.

272
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,415
No matter the profit or loss
from the restaurant?

273
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,209
Yes.

274
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,963
These terms are way too unfair.

275
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,965
I've never seen
an investment like this before.

276
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,177
Things are tough lately,
so we missed a payment for the first time.

277
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,932
And now, he's threatening to sue us
unless we return the full investment.

278
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,141
If we break the contract,

279
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,896
we have to return
the full amount immediately.

280
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,235
Did he have any involvement
in running the restaurant?

281
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,987
No, not at all.

282
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,076
I know I have to return
the investment and I will.

283
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,621
But is there any way
to delay when I have to?

284
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,207
I'm at my limit. Please help me out.

285
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,295
Okay, I'll try to find
the best possible solution.

286
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,799
Thank you.

287
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,844
What about the consultation fee?

288
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm not a lawyer.

289
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,808
I know business and investing
pretty well, so I wanted to help.

290
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,603
There's no consultation fee.
Don't worry about it.

291
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,147
Thank you so much.

292
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,824
One Italian BMT
on honey oat bread, please.

293
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,996
Try what I ordered. It's good.

294
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,624
- Okay.
- Make that two, please.

295
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,003
No bell peppers, please.

296
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,675
I'll have a footlong Egg Mayo
with the recommended toppings and sauces.

297
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,262
I'll have the same.
And I'll have a cookie too.

298
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,144
I'll have everything on it.

299
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,195
- How is it? Isn't it good?
- Yes, it is.

300
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,405
I like it best with avocados.

301
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,908
Hey, Egg Mayo is the best.

302
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,951
This is when lawsuits are so fun.

303
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,538
It's when you blindside the other party

304
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,915
with something they didn't see coming.

305
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,001
But still, submitting evidence the day of?
Isn't that a bit much?

306
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,503
- That's what makes it fun.
- That's right.

307
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,713
That's a skill too.

308
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,214
- Yeah.
- Hey, Sanggi.

309
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,509
Learn a thing or two, will you?
Stop pretending to be so noble.

310
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,596
Hey, as long as
the theoretical foundation is sound,

311
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,972
you'll win every time, kid.

312
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,142
Yes, Professor. I understand. Geez...

313
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,479
Munjeong, you looked into things
so persistently.

314
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,480
I should learn from you now,

315
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,315
- not Juhyeong.
- Sure.

316
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,983
I taught her all that.

317
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,194
You can't help things you don't think of.

318
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:09,155
But if something feels off,
you should check despite the hassle.

319
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,492
I took that,
refined it further with more focus,

320
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,160
and elevated it into persistence.

321
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,245
How ungrateful.

322
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,291
Did Ms. Jeong send her sales records?

323
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,795
Yeah, I already submitted how sales
were slashed in half as evidence.

324
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,339
- Okay.
- It's over now.

325
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,925
All right, then.

326
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:32,012
Let's use this
to draft the written statement.

327
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:33,889
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,899
- Attorney Ha.
- Yes?

329
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,734
Here.

330
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,655
What's this?

331
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,906
GWANGSEONG UNIVERSITY

332
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,366
You went to Gwangseong, right?

333
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,411
They're documents for the PhD program.

334
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,664
2025 FALL GRADUATE ADMISSIONS

335
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,792
What? But why...

336
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,587
Just in case,
you should apply for the PhD program.

337
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,799
If you want to teach later on,
you'll need a doctorate.

338
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,802
No, it's okay. I...

339
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,553
I don't plan on doing that.

340
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,180
There's no harm in getting it.

341
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,018
You like debating and studying anyway.

342
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,771
If you stay with the firm,
I can even help out.

343
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,024
Think it over.

344
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,651
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

345
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,436
Don't go through with that lawsuit.

346
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,690
This is why you called me here?

347
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,152
Even if you made
a nice investment deal that favors you,

348
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,237
at this point,

349
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,490
it's better for both sides
to compromise and walk away.

350
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,577
You didn't exactly run your business
with kid gloves either.

351
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,206
I'm telling you this from experience.

352
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,291
In the end, business is about

353
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,668
working with and treating people right.

354
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,378
That will make you more successful.

355
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,631
No, that's not it.

356
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,926
Make good investments
and turn big profits.

357
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,178
That's how you succeed.

358
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,263
What right do you have to do this?

359
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,016
It's not about the right.
It's about responsibility.

360
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,603
You weren't like this
when I first met you.

361
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,146
How long are you going to live like this?

362
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,233
What does it matter to you how I live?

363
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,743
Just assign a lawyer as usual.
Don't suddenly act like you care.

364
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,711
Yes, all the past investment contracts.

365
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,338
Yes.

366
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,173
Bring whatever you find.

367
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,883
Okay, thank you.

368
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,933
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

369
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,439
SUPREME COURT RULING
DEPOSIT REFUND

370
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,610
Yes?

371
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,530
Attorney Ha, are you busy?

372
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,448
Ms. Kim, what brings you here?

373
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,658
Well...

374
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,910
I came to get your advice on something.

375
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,246
Do you have a minute?

376
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,290
I'm so sorry.

377
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,959
I just got a last-minute
detention hearing.

378
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,294
I can't help right now.

379
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,298
- Okay, then. I'll ask someone else.
- Wait.

380
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:59,386
Why don't you ask Attorney Ahn?
If he doesn't know, no one else will.

381
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,679
Okay, I will.

382
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,681
I'm sorry. I should be helping you.

383
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,934
Really, it's fine.

384
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,396
By the way,

385
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,440
are you going to apply
for the PhD program?

386
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,067
This? No, it's nothing!

387
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,653
My boss handed it to me,
and I only glanced at it.

388
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,780
I say go for it.
I'm very much for it.

389
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,115
It would suit you so well.

390
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,826
- Give it a shot.
- No, it's okay.

391
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,496
What do you mean "no"?
Professor, you got this!

392
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,428
We can't lean on Article 104
of the Civil Code, can we?

393
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,931
Claiming the contract is void
because one party exploited

394
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:48,393
the other's urgent circumstances
or lack of experience?

395
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,606
I don't think Article 104
would apply here.

396
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,024
Courts hardly ever recognize it.

397
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,403
Making an investment contract
with a principal refund isn't illegal.

398
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,240
I've been combing through it
and hoping for a solution,

399
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:03,992
but nothing seems to work.

400
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,748
I think this will be simpler
than you think.

401
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,833
How?

402
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,418
It says "investment contract" at the top.

403
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,671
But just ignore the word "investment."

404
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,715
It's an investment contract,
but ignore the word "investment"?

405
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,094
Yes. Focus only on what is
actually promised in the contract.

406
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,847
It's just lending money
and collecting interest.

407
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,266
So it's a loan?

408
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,019
Yes. This isn't an investment contract.

409
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,397
It's labeled as one,
but he loaned 100 million won

410
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,066
and took 4 million a month.

411
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,195
So, if we treat this as a loan,

412
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,865
we still need to repay what was borrowed
and give back the 100 million won.

413
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,077
If it's seen as a loan,
the Interest Limitation Act applies.

414
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,414
So legally,
interest can't exceed 20% per year.

415
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,666
Since he received
4 million monthly as interest,

416
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,252
that's way over that limit.

417
00:29:55,836 --> 00:30:00,549
Over five years, the extra interest alone
would cover the full principal and more.

418
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,883
So actually,

419
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,971
Ko Ilseop is now the one who needs
to get money from Lee Dongsu?

420
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,890
Yes. It's not Lee Dongsu
who should be suing.

421
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,937
It actually should be Ko Ilseop suing
and demanding the overpaid amount back.

422
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,402
- Wow.
- Do you need help with anything else?

423
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,655
No, this is more than enough.

424
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,334
The plaintiff has submitted
their sales records.

425
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,878
Defense counsel,

426
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,880
do you have any response?

427
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:45,760
Plaintiff's counsel claims all criteria
for a trade secret have been met.

428
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:49,055
But the condition of secrecy,
where the recipe isn't disclosed anywhere

429
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,476
and is only known through the plaintiff,
has not been satisfied.

430
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,311
As I mentioned last time,

431
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,438
that was kept under lock and key--

432
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,275
Could you pull up Exhibit 5, please?

433
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,444
This is the patent publication.

434
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,239
The plaintiff applied for a patent
but was rejected.

435
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,324
However, after 18 months,

436
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:11,827
the details of the patent application
become public.

437
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:16,249
So the plaintiff's recipe is no longer
a secret that is hidden from the public.

438
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,670
I tried to patent this sauce before,

439
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,090
but it wasn't approved.

440
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,092
The review took a long time too.

441
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,721
But in the end, they said
it wasn't unique enough to be patented.

442
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,430
You're right.

443
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,518
That means the requirement
of secrecy is not met.

444
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,647
Plaintiff, will you continue
to claim this as a trade secret?

445
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,648
We'll review it, Your Honor.

446
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:45,361
The plaintiff's recipe wasn't novel enough
to be approved as a patent.

447
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,572
Not only could it be easily learned
by anyone working there,

448
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,118
it's also been revealed,
so it's not a trade secret.

449
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,704
Plaintiff, please review this
for a proper response.

450
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,833
If there's nothing else,
we'll end the trial at the next hearing.

451
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,960
Yes, Your Honor.

452
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,892
Is it okay to work this late?

453
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,646
- It's fine. I can do it.
- Here.

454
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,275
Jiseok said to look after you.
Why did you two fight?

455
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,570
Do you two share
everything with each other?

456
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,237
Need any help?

457
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,198
- Let's do it fast and go.
- Yes. Please.

458
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,377
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES
OUR TTEOKBOKKI

459
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,088
Then, I guess the recipe
doesn't matter anymore.

460
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,675
Yeah, it's all out in the open now.

461
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,511
Is there really no way around this?

462
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,305
What would you have done?

463
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,183
I would've been pretty ticked off
if I lost all my customers

464
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,642
and my sales were cut in half.

465
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,145
I mean if you were a customer.

466
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,980
You like good food.

467
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,859
How would you feel if a place
identical to your regular spot opened?

468
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:11,572
If I were a customer, I'd never go.
Loyalty matters.

469
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,282
- You said they taste the same.
- Hey.

470
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,285
If you're a regular somewhere,
it's not just about the taste.

471
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,828
The owner's know-how,

472
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,957
the familiar interior,
and the unique vibe the place has.

473
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,627
Those kind of things put me at ease.

474
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,630
What if all of that was the same?

475
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,512
Yeah.

476
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,390
Right?

477
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,559
Hey, I...

478
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,686
I have to go.

479
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,897
Bye.

480
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,902
Applying for the patent
has actually created an obstacle.

481
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,404
You're right.

482
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:56,493
I only applied for the patent
because I just wanted to say,

483
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,371
"This taste was my creation,"

484
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,290
and be recognized for it.

485
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,045
But instead, it kept me
from getting that recognition.

486
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,340
Do you think

487
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,676
Oh Jeongwook knew
the patent had been rejected?

488
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,595
Yes. Not long after
he started working here,

489
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,138
he suddenly asked me

490
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,309
if I'd consider patenting the recipe
since it's too good not to.

491
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:26,147
So I told him I'd already tried,
but it wasn't approved.

492
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,567
He was checking
whether there was a patent or not.

493
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,947
You're saying he asked on purpose?

494
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,784
He was trying to steal
the recipe from the start?

495
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,910
He didn't just steal the recipe.

496
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,372
He stole your shop's vibe,
the interior design, and everything.

497
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,834
It's pretty clear
he planned it from the start.

498
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,296
You're right.
Even the interior designer asked me

499
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,298
if I was opening another location.

500
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,466
Do you know his interior designer?

501
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,469
He's a regular here.

502
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,555
We've never really had a fancy interior.

503
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,640
We just fix things when they break,

504
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,977
and we'd always ask him for help
whenever we made small changes.

505
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,648
I think Oh Jeongwook hired him
to design the interior for his place too.

506
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:11,735
Geez.

507
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,070
The recipe...

508
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,033
and this shop...

509
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,746
Over 20 years,

510
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,540
I slowly built up

511
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,460
everything here.

512
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,467
From these chairs

513
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,637
to those bowls...

514
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,264
For every single thing...

515
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,643
I put in

516
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,686
so much thought and care.

517
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,273
That's how I made this store.

518
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,611
But people won't know that.

519
00:35:56,446 --> 00:36:00,241
Because the taste and atmosphere
are the same anyway.

520
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,545
It used to be such a joy working here.

521
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,715
But now, it's not.

522
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,759
It makes me sad.

523
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,601
Let's get that joy back.

524
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,150
Could I get the number
of that interior designer?

525
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,363
Are you heading out now?

526
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,782
- Yeah. You too?
- Yeah.

527
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,705
- What's that? Did you visit the school?
- No. It's nothing.

528
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,126
It's just...

529
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,003
My boss suddenly asked
if I'd be interested in a PhD program.

530
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,714
She gave this to me out of nowhere.

531
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,049
I see. Are you interested?

532
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,343
Nope.

533
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,932
People keep saying it would suit me
and that I should try it.

534
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,521
But that's easier said than done.
It's not exactly cheap either.

535
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,942
Do you want to do it though?

536
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,321
Yeah, I do.

537
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,284
Nothing.

538
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,578
I want to do it.

539
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,000
Let's go, Sanggi.

540
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,183
Okay, thank you.

541
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,144
- Is it all set?
- Yes, Your Honor.

542
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,230
You may start your presentation then.

543
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,648
As you can see,

544
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:01,154
the plaintiff's and defendant's dishes
look and taste identical.

545
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,492
The style of the staff's uniforms...

546
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,091
and the interior design
of the shops is the same too.

547
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,928
Items with similar colors and designs
were used by coincidence.

548
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,807
The parts of the interior that look alike
aren't unique to the plaintiff's shop.

549
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,477
They're common, ordinary elements
you'll find in plenty of other places.

550
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,356
Yes, exactly. That's the key point.

551
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,857
As the defense previously claimed,

552
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:43,154
the plaintiff's recipe isn't patented
or legally classified as a trade secret.

553
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,489
The staff uniforms and interior design

554
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,827
have an ordinary style
that doesn't appear to be that unique.

555
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,205
This is part
of the interior design request

556
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:56,501
made by the defendant
as he prepared to open his restaurant.

557
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,586
And next to it,

558
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,631
you'll see a photo
of the plaintiff's shop.

559
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,007
The details in the defendant's request

560
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,929
describe the exact interior
of the plaintiff's shop.

561
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,849
If the interior was nothing special,
as the defense claims,

562
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,186
then why did he go to such lengths
to have it replicated precisely?

563
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,070
<i>I'm so happy a branch
opened near my place.</i>

564
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,699
<i>The main shop was great,
and this location near my house is also...</i>

565
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,701
<i>I hope more branches open.</i>

566
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,787
The taste was refined over the years
through constant research.

567
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,081
The know-how gained
from running the business

568
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,459
is seen in the staff's attitude,
their uniforms, and the atmosphere.

569
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,504
All of these elements
make up the plaintiff's shop,

570
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,676
which is the product of the significant
investment and effort put into it.

571
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,970
The defendant became an employee
at the plaintiff's shop,

572
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,305
learned that know-how,

573
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,683
and even checked
the recipe's patent status.

574
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,185
After the defendant confirmed
the patent had been rejected,

575
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,938
he earned the plaintiff's trust,
obtained the recipe,

576
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,317
and made his own shop look like
a branch location when he opened it.

577
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,069
- Pure speculation.
- It doesn't matter when the defendant

578
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,071
started planning his intentions.

579
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,033
What's clear is
without the plaintiff's restaurant,

580
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,661
the defendant's restaurant wouldn't exist.

581
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,333
Not only was there unauthorized use
of the legacy and identity

582
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,001
built by the plaintiff over years,

583
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,087
the impression of a branch
was created to profit unfairly.

584
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,465
Patent or not, trade secret or not,

585
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:30,136
this clearly violates
the Unfair Competition Prevention Act.

586
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,931
The defendant is liable for damages

587
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,060
and must be prohibited from using
the recipe and running the shop.

588
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,272
Okay.

589
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,149
Defense counsel,

590
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,944
do you have a response?

591
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,367
No, Your Honor.

592
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,289
DEFENDANT, PLAINTIFF

593
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,661
<i>You want to apply for the PhD program?</i>

594
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,622
Yes, I thought I'd give it a shot.

595
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,002
I came to ask
if you'd be willing to guide me.

596
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,463
Of course, I'd be happy to.
But why all of a sudden?

597
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,133
You graduated a while ago.

598
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,138
Well, I just wanted to study
a little bit more.

599
00:41:56,139 --> 00:42:00,393
If the opportunity arises later on,
I'd like to try teaching too.

600
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,604
Do you want to become
a professor in the future?

601
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,690
Yes. Not right away though.

602
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,568
But I want to explore that path
while studying.

603
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,028
If you start the PhD program,

604
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,530
what about your current job?

605
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,617
I plan to keep working.
I still have rent to pay.

606
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,830
That's why I'm thinking of applying
to the evening program.

HA SANGGI

608
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:36,261
If you just want to study more
and get your PhD, that's fine.

609
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,682
But if you're aiming to be a professor,
that's a bit tricky.

610
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:48,399
We give those who did their PhDs full-time
priority for teaching opportunities.

611
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,695
We think it's fairer than offering them
to people who worked while studying.

612
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,781
Right. That makes sense.

613
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:59,410
Don't you have
any money saved from working?

614
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,205
Yes, I do.

615
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,625
Okay, Professor. Goodbye, sir.

616
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,761
<i>If you're seriously considering
joining academia,</i>

617
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,305
<i>think it through carefully.</i>

618
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,976
<i>If not, studying while working
is totally fine too.</i>

620
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,334
Hi, ma'am.

621
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,085
My mom...

622
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,546
- What brings you here?
- Is she...

623
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,216
Your mom wasn't feeling well,
so I swapped shifts with her.

624
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

625
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,761
She's sick?

626
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,887
I see. Okay.

627
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,014
Okay, bye.

628
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,395
Mom.

629
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,190
Is that you, Sanggi?

630
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,194
What brings you here without any notice?

631
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,532
Mom, are you sick?

632
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,743
Sick? I'm not sick.

633
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:28,166
My head was hurting a bit,
so I just took a day to rest.

634
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,792
Your head hurts?

635
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,127
Since when?

636
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,297
That's just what happens
when you get older.

637
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,508
When was your last checkup, Mom?

638
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,594
Gosh.

639
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,554
What if they say it's something serious?

640
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,638
That's even scarier.

641
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,684
If it's serious, get it treated.
What are you talking about?

642
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,395
It's fine.

643
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,605
It's just a headache.

644
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,857
- I have money.
- I have money too.

645
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,902
- Then, get checked!
- Gosh, be quiet.

646
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:58,988
Forget it.

647
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,917
I'll go buy some porridge.
Get some rest.

648
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,851
JUST LIKE MOM MAKES
OUR TTEOKBOKKI

649
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,956
- Attorney Bae, let's go.
- Okay.

650
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,126
You've worked so hard.
Come and eat before you go.

651
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,213
I appreciate it, but I should get going.

652
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,840
That's such a shame though.

653
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,967
My goodness.

654
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,761
I'll make sure to visit next time.

655
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,681
Lines will be forming again soon.
I better visit before then.

656
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:11,351
No matter when you stop by,
there will always be a seat saved for you.

657
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,063
- Thank you.
- Gosh. I'm the thankful one.

658
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,483
Thanks to you,
I think I can work with joy again.

659
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:19,694
Because I really do

660
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,280
love my job.

661
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,201
Me too.

662
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,380
Hey. You haven't had dinner yet, right?

663
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,717
- Let's eat.
- What are these?

664
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:48,389
I noticed your feet were swelling lately,
so I got a pair that's one size larger.

665
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
They fit well.

666
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,043
I'm sorry.

667
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,088
No, why are you sorry? I'm sorry.

668
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,134
Hey...

669
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,055
Can I think about it a little more?

670
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,514
About what?

671
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,934
I love this job so much.

672
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,194
Litigation is just so much fun.

673
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,866
I'm still not sure how things will go

674
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,661
with childbirth or parenting.

675
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,292
But for now,
I'll keep thinking about it as I work.

676
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,467
Come here.

677
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,637
My goodness.

678
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,180
Munjeong.

679
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,434
Think it over all you want.

680
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,646
And do whatever feels right.

681
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,359
I'll support you no matter what.

682
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,657
Great job today.

683
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,217
Why on earth are you showing here?
I'll just see you in court.

684
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,138
I came to tell you this.

685
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,516
What you did to Ko Ilseop...

686
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,976
You called it an investment,
but in reality,

687
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,936
it's the same as a loan with interest.

688
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,481
How is it the same?
We clearly agreed it was an investment.

689
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,692
Just calling it that doesn't make it one.

690
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,194
Legally, it's a loan.

691
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,196
You lend and invest money a lot too,

692
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,450
so you know
what the Interest Limitation Act is.

693
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,494
So in that case,
you won't get your money back from Mr. Ko.

694
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,497
You'll owe him tens of thousands instead.

695
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,877
Are you a lawyer now?

696
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,755
It's pretty funny
to hear legal talk from you.

697
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,593
Is having your own office
at the firm making you...

698
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,428
a little confused?

699
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,725
Straighten up
if you don't want to see me again.

700
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,853
I won't give up
and I'll fight you to the end.

701
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,274
Gosh, I'm so damn sick of you!

702
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,575
- What do you want to eat?
- Chicken?

703
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,785
- Sure.
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

704
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,748
- You're still here?
- I should probably get going too.

705
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:05,502
Thanks to you the other day,
that case worked out fine.

706
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,629
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

707
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,131
I only said a few words.

708
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,926
Those few words saved a man's life.

709
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,261
- Get home safe.
- Goodbye.

710
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,770
- Did you help her with something?
- Just something simple.

711
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,898
The restaurant from last time?

712
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,984
No, let's have <i>gopchang</i>.
I'm suddenly craving something spicy.

713
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,361
<i>Gopchang</i> all of a sudden?

714
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,489
- You don't want it?
- No, it's okay.

715
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,826
So no matter how long
or how much I deposit,

716
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,913
I'll be able to get daily interest, right?

717
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,206
Yes, that's right.

718
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,542
Since you can deposit
and withdraw anytime,

719
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,336
it's great for saving up
a large sum of money.

720
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,463
I see.

721
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,424
I just need flexibility with deposits.

722
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,468
I won't need to spend for a while.

723
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,805
Then, would you like me to help you open
the account you mentioned?

724
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:01,057
Yes. Please transfer everything from here.

725
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,434
All right, sir.

726
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,310
Your account is all set.

727
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,770
Is it all right to go now?

728
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,605
- Just a second.
- Okay.

729
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,275
Take these plushies with you.

730
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,238
Okay.

731
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,882
<i>I'm heading to prison now.</i>

732
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,676
<i>I'll take responsibility.</i>

733
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,762
<i>Thank you, Attorney Cho.</i>

734
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,232
Were you really upset last time?

735
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,526
Well...

736
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,820
I mean, lobster and ham...

737
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,071
That's a big difference.

738
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,240
But it's okay.

739
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,700
That's not what I meant.

740
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,662
I was talking about
how I'd only given cases to others.

741
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,040
I see.

742
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,754
I reached out because there's a case
I'd like you to take.

743
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,965
Goodness. Sounds good.

744
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,343
It's about time.

745
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,137
We'll take anything.
Attorney Cho's a great worker.

746
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,598
Yes, I'll be counting on you.

747
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,308
What kind of case is it?

748
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,810
An attempted murder case.

749
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,317
Hey, come here.

750
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,277
Where are you going, you punk? Come here.

751
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,655
Hey!

752
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,158
You little bastard. You thought
it was over when you transferred?

753
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,662
You got me kicked out of school.
I have nowhere to go.

754
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,871
So what now?

755
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,207
What now?

756
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,501
Damn it.

757
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:55,088
My life is over because of you, punk.
Are you happy?

758
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,632
So what now?

759
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,771
Stab me.

760
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,356
Go ahead.

761
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,981
Do it.

762
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,275
I said stab me.

763
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,444
Stab me. Do it.

764
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,671
Damn it.

765
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,931
Chanyeong.

766
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,726
Where did you get the knife?

767
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,562
It was his.

768
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,982
Did you take it from him?

769
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,403
Does that even count
as taking it from him?

770
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,158
Just...

771
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,286
feel free to tell me
what happened that day.

772
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,957
- Attorney Cho.
- Yes?

773
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,294
Why haven't I been arrested though?

774
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,427
The facts aren't that complicated,
but it's a bit messy.

775
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:29,515
Well, we'll have to admit the charge
and push hard for leniency.

776
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,851
What? You're not going to try
for a not guilty?

777
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,311
Like, completely innocent?

778
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,562
- Yeah.
- That's a stretch.

779
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,106
He stabbed someone after all.

780
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:44,155
We have on records
that he transferred after being bullied.

781
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,200
Considering all that,
we'll ask for a very lenient sentence.

782
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,161
You could try arguing self-defense.

783
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,330
Self-defense?

784
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:54,791
You little bastard.

785
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,211
You thought it was over
when you transferred?

786
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,714
You got me kicked out of school.
I have nowhere to go.

787
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:02,798
So what now?

788
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,883
What now?

789
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,177
The bully attacked,
so he acted in self-defense.

790
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,595
It would definitely qualify.

791
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,139
Isn't it a bit ambiguous though?

792
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,433
So what now?

793
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,484
<i>Once Chanyeong picked up
the dropped knife,</i>

794
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,653
they'll obviously say
he subdued the attack.

795
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:24,988
You know the precedents.

796
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,574
Self-defense only applies
if the attack is ongoing.

797
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,910
They'll say he stabbed him
after the attack ended.

798
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,578
No, the attack didn't end.

799
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,747
He even followed him to his new school.

800
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,124
You can't say the attack
was just that one day.

801
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,544
The bullying and attack was ongoing?

802
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,712
It's worth trying.

803
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,464
- He isn't in custody yet, right?
- No.

804
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,508
Maybe they saw potential for self-defense.

805
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,093
Forget it.

806
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,970
It's better to get a reduced sentence.

807
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,766
No matter what we argue,
they'll charge and rule however they want.

808
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,853
What's with you?

809
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,691
That court-appointed
voice phishing case I did.

810
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,068
She ended up with a 10 million-won fine.

811
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,112
- What?
- She couldn't pay the fine,

812
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,948
so she went to prison today.

813
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,245
If I'd pleaded for leniency
instead of claiming innocence,

814
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,956
it would've cut a few million off.

815
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,667
But I don't think
Ms. Kim gave you the case

816
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,921
just to use extenuating circumstances
and reduce his sentence.

817
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,341
It's a student from her foundation,
so she's more invested.

818
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,261
Ms. Kim has a foundation?

819
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,598
Juhyeong and Huiji mentioned it last time.
Didn't you hear anything?

820
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,308
She really did seem to care a lot.

821
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,393
Yeah.

822
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,478
I'm sorry, but it's my case.

823
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,316
I'm not going to risk a heavy sentence
after arguing innocence.

824
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:43,942
If you want to help,

825
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,111
help me get the sentence reduced.

826
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,745
DAD

827
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,458
Hi, Dad.

828
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,797
Come and work for me now.

829
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,467
What?

830
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,927
You've done enough as a lawyer.

831
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,722
Since when was there a time limit?

832
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,932
You didn't have any big ambitions.

833
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,976
Was there a reason you became a lawyer?

834
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,021
You just kept studying
and ended up as one.

835
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,815
You used to always tell me
to become Hanguk Group's counsel.

836
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,943
That has a purpose and a reason, okay?

837
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,280
I'm doing fine on my own.

838
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,782
Don't worry about me.

839
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,950
Then, tell me.

840
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,245
Is there a reason for you
to keep doing this?

841
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,250
Exactly. So stop living like that
and help with the family business.

842
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,252
You remember you're an only child, right?

843
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,546
Geez, again with the only child stuff...

844
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,467
Join the company.
I don't want to work forever either.

845
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,651
Isn't this is a good spot
to be alone and enjoy solitude?

846
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:09,778
Hello, Ms. Kim.

847
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,782
How's Chanyeong's case going?

848
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,371
We're still reviewing it.

849
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,292
But admitting guilt and explaining
the circumstances may be our best bet.

850
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,045
I see.

851
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,798
Then, I guess there's no other way.

852
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,304
By the way,

853
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,180
is something on your mind?

854
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,349
It's nothing.

855
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,686
- Could I sit down for a second?
- Have a seat.

856
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,695
It's written all over your face though.

857
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,701
Well, could I ask...

858
00:58:58,827 --> 00:58:59,911
How did you

859
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,913
graduate from law school

860
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,207
but end up doing business?

861
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,215
I actually wanted to be a lawyer too.

862
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,514
But I kept failing the bar exam,
so I found something else.

863
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,312
Why did you want to be a lawyer
in the first place?

864
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,565
Well, I don't know.

865
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,278
I think I wanted to make a lot of money.

866
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,072
I wanted to live comfortably,

867
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,824
help people in tough situations,

868
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,495
and maybe buy a building.

869
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,581
You achieved it all.

870
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,582
I guess so.

871
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,502
I took a different path,

872
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,670
but I achieved it all.

873
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,844
By the way,

874
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,555
if I ever start a business later,

875
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,475
I'd appreciate some advice.

876
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,981
Not for free though.

877
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,362
Of course, anytime.

878
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,672
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
CLINICAL DEPRESSION

879
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,641

880
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,725
DUMBASS

881
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,727
YOU RUNNING OFF SNIFFLING WAS SO FUNNY

882
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,145
CAN I POST YOUR CRYING VIDEO?

883
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,648
CRAWLING ON ALL FOURS SUITS YOU

884
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:59,072
CAREER GOALS
NONE

885
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,301
What brings you here?

886
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,138
Can you take a look?

887
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,895
It started in his junior year.

888
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,564
Yeah, it's impressive
how he's held out this long.

889
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,775
This should be enough
for mitigation, right?

890
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,362
He's from Ms. Kim's foundation,
so he may be struggling financially too.

891
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,574
Add that too.
It counts as a mitigating factor.

892
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,284
Yeah, you're right.

893
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,829
Since he's showing remorse,

894
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,707
I better write an opinion
asking for leniency

895
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,752
based on these materials.

896
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,631
But shouldn't we ask him
if he's actually remorseful?

897
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,549
The rest are objective facts,

898
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,177
so we can ask for leniency if we want.

899
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:05,055
But you need to ask if he's remorseful.

900
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,099
We can't just claim remorse for him.

901
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,064
I'm not sorry.

902
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,402
I get where you're coming from, Chanyeong.

903
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:24,324
But if you say you're not remorseful,
the punishment could be much heavier.

904
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,827
It's not because

905
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,580
I think I did the right thing.

906
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:33,833
I did do something bad

907
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,795
with bad intentions.

908
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,256
Okay. You admit you did wrong.

909
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,469
If you say you regret it,
they'll reduce your sentence a lot.

910
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,557
If I messed up, I should be punished.

911
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,727
If saying sorry erased the crime, then...

912
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,773
he could just say sorry and get off too.

913
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,407
Why did you have those bad intentions?

914
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,952
Because...

915
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,124
I couldn't keep living like that.

916
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,505
<i>I even transferred schools
to get away from him,</i>

917
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,883
<i>but he followed me there.</i>

918
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,016
<i>So I gave up.</i>

919
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,146
I decided to be bad like him.

920
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,738
You're not like him, Chanyeong.

921
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:49,951
So don't give up.

922
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,256

ATTEMPTED MURDER

926
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,775
Let's do our best today.

927
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:47,985
Okay.

928
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:51,656
SEOUL POLICE STATION

929
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,536
Because this could be my last case.

930
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:17,557
Law and The City

931
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,385
Law and The City

932
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,470
<i>My husband is dead.</i>

933
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,472
<i>Our company isn't that overbearing.</i>

934
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,224
This could be a problem.

935
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:03,686
They're paying a much higher fee.
What can we do? We can't take both sides.

936
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:06,147
<i>Who are you to turn down cases?</i>

937
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,357
<i>He isn't innocent though.</i>

938
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,942
<i>I'll pay you a fat retainer.</i>

939
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,860
<i>It was likely the right call as a boss.</i>

940
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,613
At times like this,
just say I'm right and take my side.

941
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,115
<i>How is my wife?</i>

942
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,368
<i>It's so unfair.</i>

943
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,537
<i>You were never bothered
by this kind of stuff.</i>

944
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,165
What's different this time?
