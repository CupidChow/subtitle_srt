ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY

3
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,103
- I think it's her.
- You're right.

4
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,855
Over here!

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,121
Wait.

6
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,613
EMERGENCY ALERT

7
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,782
What? An earthquake?

8
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,203
Hi, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

9
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,080
It's been a while.

10
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,086
Do you know me?

11
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,755
What?

12
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,300
EMERGENCY ALERT

13
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,482
Nice to meet you.

14
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,234
I'm Kim Hyungmin.

15
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,450
Don't you remember me?

16
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,623
You do look familiar.

17
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,041
You seemed shocked to know her.

18
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,836
No, the subtle tremors
were what startled me.

19
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,462
What? You felt that?

20
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,756
What are you, a seismometer? So lame.

21
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,924
Please take a seat.

22
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,927
- Okay.
- Why don't you sit here instead?

23
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,138
- Thank you.
- Sure.

24
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,807
Would you like a glass of beer?

25
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,392
Yes.

26
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,066
I was in Gwangseong Law School's
13th cohort.

27
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,402
What? Seriously?

28
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,821
- Ninth cohort? I saw it on the website.
- Yes.

29
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,782
I see! Nice to meet you.

30
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,784
Thank you.

31
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,246
- Should we toast first?
- Great timing.

32
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,707
- Cheers.
- I'm all out.

33
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,251
You should've told us earlier then.

34
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,379
Have some of mine.

35
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,887
All right, then. Cheers!

36
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,306
- Cheers!
- Nice to meet you!

37
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,445
So, how do you know Juhyeong?

38
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,490
We were briefly together before.

39
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,620
- Here.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,748
You crazy bastard.
You forgot someone you dated?

41
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,750
What are you talking about?
We never dated.

42
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,420
When did I say we dated?
I said we were together.

43
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,799
We were both briefly in Hong Kong and met.

44
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,634
Gosh, you should've said that then.

45
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,678
He said he doesn't remember anyways.

46
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,014
Wait, Hong Kong?

47
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,390
When you went two years ago?

48
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,770
Honestly, if it was two years ago,
you should be able to remember that.

49
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,563
Someone this pretty
would be hard to forget.

50
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,982
Exactly.

51
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,780
This is the first time we've met.

52
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,115
I only saw your name
when I signed the lease agreement.

53
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,620
Right. I usually leave property matters
to the building manager.

54
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,705
I'm probably new to all of you,

55
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,960
but I've made sure to learn
who each of you are.

56
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,254
So you all seem familiar.

57
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,006
Us?

58
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,133
You're the tenants in my building.

59
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,637
To me, you're my clients.

60
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,849
I think this is our first time
meeting like this as well.

61
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,479
Well, we've crossed paths before,
but we've never introduced ourselves.

62
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,066
We've introduced ourselves.
Right, Director Seong?

63
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,695
Yes, we have.

64
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,282
It was because of
Attorney Ha Sanggi, right?

65
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,659
He used to work for Mr. Seong.

66
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,080
And then, he switched
to Ms. Kim's firm upstairs.

67
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,998
That's right!

68
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,417
With someone as beautiful as her,

69
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,044
you should remember
if it was just two years ago.

70
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,381
- Wait, wasn't that around then?
- You're right.

71
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,467
What? What is it?

72
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,679
Well, the reason why
he went to Hong Kong was...

73
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,516
Hey, what was her name again?

74
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,728
The blind date.

75
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,107
Diamond Kim! Right?

76
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,776
- Thank you.
- Crystal Park. Park Sujeong.

77
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,572
Right. Crystal Park is his ex-girlfriend.

78
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,449
After they broke up, he was a mess.

79
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,576
We told him to take a trip
and he went there.

80
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,203
Her name was Sujeong,
so we nicknamed her Crystal Park.

81
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,039
How did he turn that into Diamond Kim?

82
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,001
Hey! Diamond Kim, Crystal Park.
It's all the same in Korean.

83
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,254
They're totally different.
Crystal is <i>sujeong.</i>

84
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,008
And diamond is... What was it again?

85
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,385
- <i>Geum gangseok</i>.
- Thank you. Yeah, <i>geum gangseok</i>.

86
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,263
So you're saying Juhyeong's ex
was Kim Geum Gangseok?

87
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,767
I mean, Kim and <i>geum</i>
basically sound the same in Korean.

88
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,852
So it could've been Kim Gangseok.

89
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,104
Kim Gangseok?

90
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,481
What, did she sing
<i>A Letter from a Private?</i>

91
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,732
That's Kim Gwangseok.

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,318
I know that.

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,407
Did you just say her name
in front of my face?

94
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,994
Were we still
not supposed to say her name?

95
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,622
No, you said it wrong anyway,
so you're fine.

96
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,541
But seriously,
Diamond Kim was a bit ridiculous.

97
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,420
Right? Hey, Munjeong! I can't believe you.

98
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,297
How could you say her name so clearly?

99
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,299
Hey, this was your fault.

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,635
Yeah. This was your fault, Munjeong.

101
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,012
Are you serious?

102
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,639
You all brought it up...

103
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,100
What?

104
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,602
It's been over two years.
I can't even say her name?

105
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,438
Yeah. You don't even recall
Attorney Kang from two years ago.

106
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,108
No, we didn't meet then.

107
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,819
- It was 10 years ago, not two.
- What?

108
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,363
- What?
- 10 years ago?

109
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,323
You keep saving
the important bits for last.

110
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,909
Are you a storyteller or what?

111
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,246
Right. You went to Hong Kong
while in law school too.

112
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,917
Juhyeong was a law student,
and I was still an undergrad.

113
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,504
You even said
we should meet up again in Korea.

114
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,589
I said what?

115
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,967
My gosh! You two were a thing!

116
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,927
- You were a thing!
- What is this?

117
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,054
I didn't know you had
such skills back then.

118
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,474
In any case, who cares?
He doesn't even remember.

119
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,311
So, how was Hong Kong?

120
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,897
It was so beautiful back then.

121
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,153
Which part?

122
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,238
Hey, which part?

123
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,538
But are you sure
we actually agreed to meet again?

124
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,457
Geez. And here I thought he'd remembered.

125
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,751
I mean, it's just not true.
You think I'd say that?

126
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,545
- You did.
- You said you didn't even remember.

127
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,089
Or maybe he does remember.

128
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,845
No, I don't. It's because
I would've never said that.

129
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,181
Don't worry about it.

130
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,641
Want me to get you another glass?

131
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,226
Then, could I have some soju?

132
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,604
Beer upsets my stomach a bit.

133
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,856
Goodness, you should've said so earlier!

134
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,525
- One soju, please!
- Thank you.

135
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:33,907
- Still, we just met and you offered.
- Come on! I'll take that formality and...

136
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,367
I threw it out. Okay?
No need to be so formal.

137
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,162
- You can relax.
- I will.

138
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,791
So I guess you threw away
your beer on me then.

139
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,084
What?

140
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,461
- What's wrong with you?
- It's true.

141
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,546
Gosh, don't take it that way.

142
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,883
Your glass was empty, so I shared mine.

143
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,259
Come on. We go back 10 years.

144
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,221
Ten years? Says who?

145
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,522
But what did you want to meet about today?

146
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,817
Isn't this just about
getting to know each other?

147
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,985
Is this just a casual get-together?

148
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,822
No, not exactly.

149
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,325
Since you're all busy people,

150
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,660
let's get straight to the point.

151
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,537
Yes, please.

152
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,164
Your law firms

153
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,416
and law office...

154
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,837
Let's merge them into one.

155
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,144
- I take Line 2 on the subway.
- What? Me too.

156
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,062
- Which way?
- I go toward Jamsil too.

157
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,355
We're this way. You?

158
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,690
- Okay.
- That way?

159
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,942
- Yes.
- See you next time!

160
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,027
- Bye!
- Good night.

161
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,489
Which way are you going?

162
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,199
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

163
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,414
It still seems
to bother Juhyeong, doesn't it?

164
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,498
Yeah.

165
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,750
I figured it was okay
to talk about her now,

166
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,544
so I tossed it out there.

167
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,004
But I guess not.

168
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,590
I didn't expect that at all
from someone who seems so chill.

169
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,675
Right?

170
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,345
Hey, doesn't Attorney Kang
seem like a good person?

171
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,765
Yeah, she's super friendly.

172
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,560
I almost snapped at her
earlier by accident.

173
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,689
- You're getting in just now?
- Yes, you're still up?

174
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,024
I woke up in the middle.

175
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,069
- What about dinner?
- I had dinner with my friends.

176
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,153
Okay, get some rest.

177
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,572
- Okay, good night.
- All right.

178
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,669
He doesn't remember me?

179
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,138
I mean, how could you forget
someone this cute?

180
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,853
SUPREME COURT UPDATE

181
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,439
A new precedent.

182
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,108
Let's have a look.

183
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,675
Ten years, my foot.

184
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,556
COURT, PROSECUTION OFFICE,
REGISTRATION BUREAU

185
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,315
Episode 2 More Than Meets the Eye

186
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,446
It's not much, but please enjoy.

187
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,949
Gosh, you didn't have to!
Thank you. I am in your debt.

188
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,828
I should be the one saying that.
I'm the new one here.

189
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,621
I didn't even know you were a lawyer.

190
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,790
You look as young as a student!

191
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,792
What kind of student looks like this?

192
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,878
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

193
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,727
Attorney Ahn?

194
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,687
Attorney Kang told me to give this to you.

195
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,523
She wanted to thank us
getting together for her.

196
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,275
It wasn't for her though.

197
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,029
Come on, it was. What do you mean?

198
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,655
I don't drink coffee.

199
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,367
How would Attorney Kang even know that?

200
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,620
Just take it, will you?

201
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,796
If you don't want it, fine. More for me.

202
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,143
That's why I'm asking you for help.

203
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,854
Originally, you only wanted us
to draft the seizure request,

204
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,065
so we gave you a discounted rate.

205
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,070
And I'm going with you free of charge
because I understand your situation.

206
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,739
I'm also aware, but...

207
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,990
- What's going on?
- I wouldn't be asking

208
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,993
- if I wasn't so desperate!
- Tomorrow's the asset seizure.

209
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,996
They're going to force open the door
and start tagging items,

210
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,208
so he wants a lawyer to come along too.

211
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,669
- There's really no way?
- I understand your situation,

212
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,921
but we really can't.

213
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,715
All right, then.

214
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,970
I'll see you tomorrow.

215
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,603
Mr. Eom, are you going
to the asset seizure tomorrow?

216
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,065
Yes. You don't have to worry about it.

217
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,568
What kind of person is the debtor?

218
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,321
He runs a business.
It's a classic dine and dash.

219
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,073
The lender's the real victim.

220
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,951
It seems he lent his whole fortune.

221
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,335
You're going
to the asset seizure tomorrow?

222
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,798
Yes, I do feel bad for the lender,
but I'm also curious.

223
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,301
You're going to see some ugly stuff.

224
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,221
Debtors who are cornered tend to lash out.

225
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,391
Don't go. What for?
You'll just come across trouble.

226
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,936
No, it's okay.
Word is, the debtor's actually loaded.

227
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,772
But he's hidden all his assets,
so they have no choice but to seize them.

228
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,109
Rich people aren't easy to deal with.

229
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,361
- Wait! He hasn't taken a picture yet.
- I did.

230
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,030
- What? When?
- Earlier.

231
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,406
He's fast now.

232
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,701
Hold on! It's not ready yet.

233
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,747
But if you just started yesterday,

234
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,750
you should be swamped with looking
at your own case files right now.

235
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,793
Do you have time to tag along
on some other case

236
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,837
just because you feel for them
and are curious?

237
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,963
You're only a first-year.

238
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,217
Yes, I've already reviewed
all my case files.

239
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,801
All of them?

240
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,512
Yes, but as I looked through,
a few parts were confusing.

241
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,682
- Can I ask you about them later?
- Why would you ask me?

242
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,268
That's what it said on the handover file.

243
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,312
It said to ask you about difficult cases.

244
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,730
- What?
- Wait.

245
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,233
That was in the handover file?

246
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,570
Yes. "Ask Ahn Juhyeong
for difficult cases."

247
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,697
"For good restaurants, ask Bae Munjeong."

248
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,575
And it said to ask Ha Sanggi
for savings accounts,

249
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,662
retirement plans, and tax deductions.

250
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,832
It turns out Mr. Yu
was more calculating than I thought.

251
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,753
Look at him.
He's already calling his friend "Mr. Yu."

252
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,507
Well, what about me?

253
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,635
You were...

254
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,930
I guess there was nothing.

255
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,764
Yes.

256
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,101
I was the closest to him though.

257
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:46,022
I brought it along just in case.
They're notes my predecessor wrote.

258
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,151
- I don't understand the part he marked.
- Let me see.

259
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,905
Gosh, look at these insane indents.

260
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,991
I know.
That firm always formats like that.

261
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,951
- Hey, Juhyeong...
- I'm in a hurry.

262
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,412
- I have to...
- Just wait a second!

263
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,831
I'm busy this afternoon too.

264
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,708
Geez.

265
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,169
It's ready.

266
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,463
Eat up.
Ask him after we're done eating.

267
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,674
- Okay.
- I want some meat.

268
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,093
- That's good.
- Here you go.

269
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,387
What are you consulting on, Juhyeong?

270
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,098
It's related to an eviction lawsuit.

271
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,311
A real estate transfer claim
through the creditor's subrogation right.

272
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,770
What? What lawsuit?

273
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,064
It's a lawsuit to evict someone
for not paying debts.

274
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,608
You made it sound too fancy.

275
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,277
Did you do that to intimidate her?

276
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,364
It's the same as mine.
Tracking someone down over unpaid loans.

277
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,744
It's totally different. I file lawsuits
and don't chase people to their homes.

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,247
Hey, hurry and eat.
You said you were busy.

279
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,752
Cooking it longer was a good idea.

280
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,297
- The flavor needs to infuse in the tofu.
- It's really good.

281
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,926
I'd be better if it simmered a bit more.

282
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,192
I forgot my phone!

283
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,488
Goodness.

284
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,834
- Bye.
- See you.

285
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,798
Later.

286
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,223
I think you might be
misremembering things.

287
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,102
- About what?
- We never made plans to meet in Seoul.

288
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,354
That wouldn't have happened.

289
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,692
Try to think carefully again.

290
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,252
That's what all the attitude was about?

291
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,428
<i>I believe I'm remembering it correctly.</i>

292
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,055
<i>This is kind of ridiculous.</i>

293
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,102
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

294
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,105
<i>Okay.</i>

295
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,108
Is he insane?

296
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:50,249
IS HE INSANE?

297
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,462
- Huiji, do you have a minute?
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,548
Can you sit in on a consult for me?

299
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Sure.

300
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,148
Mr. Jang Hyeonseok!

301
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,984
I said no one by that name's here.

302
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,862
Are you sure he's not in there?
It's the right address.

303
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,781
Yes, it is.

304
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,866
But no one by that name lives here,
so leave.

305
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,035
We were here two days ago!

306
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,662
Look, we have documents
showing he lives here.

307
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,917
There's a court order to vacate,
and we have to enforce it today.

308
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,794
It makes no sense that he's suddenly gone.

309
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,254
Either way, they're not here.

310
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,131
So leave. Get out!

311
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,341
How many times do I...

312
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,676
Is he really not here?

313
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,887
- I need the restroom.
- Are you insane?

314
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,432
Get out!

315
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,983
Thank you so much.

316
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,861
I agreed to help
because of your circumstances,

317
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,196
but I can't do it next time.

318
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,114
No, I should be the one apologizing.

319
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,200
Gosh.

320
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,119
Hey, hang in there.

321
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,704
Okay.

322
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,540
Thank you.

323
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,799
NEIGHBORLY SAVINGS BANK
KIM JAEWAN

324
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,010
Yes, I heard the eviction order
didn't go through today.

325
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,596
No. We went, but some stranger
answered and claimed

326
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,349
Jang Hyeonseok didn't live there.

327
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,812
Let's consider a provisional injunction
to block transfer of occupancy.

328
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,273
First, look at this
since that's what you came for.

329
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay.

330
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,735
Mr. Na told me you wanted to hear
the explanation again

331
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,904
before the hearing date.

332
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,991
Yes. I'm still unclear on a few parts.

333
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,704
Right. We did go over it once by phone
before the complaint was filed.

334
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,082
Basically, you loaned him money, right?

335
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,334
Yes, he said he needed it
for a lease deposit.

336
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,338
Right, but he hasn't paid back
the principal or the interest?

337
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,048
- That's right.
- So as collateral,

338
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,884
the lease deposit was transferred to you?

339
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,511
- Yes.
- Okay.

340
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,806
In this case, the debtor's lease
should have ended first.

341
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,809
But since we acquired
the lease deposit claim,

342
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
they can't oppose us
with a renewed contract.

343
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,355
The original lease term has ended now,

344
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,190
so the contract is considered terminated.

345
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,817
But that doesn't mean

346
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,820
the landlord is required
to give back the deposit to us.

347
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,488
The debtor must hand over

348
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,824
the rental property to the landlord first

349
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,076
before the deposit can be returned.

350
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,703
Since that isn't happening,

351
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,873
we're exercising
our subrogation right as the creditor

352
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,001
to forcibly claim the property.

353
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,086
That's the lawsuit.

354
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,051
Right.

355
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,055
Okay.

356
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,601
This is us. And this is the debtor.

357
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,188
That's the landlord of the debtor's home.

358
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,398
- Who's this again?
- Us?

359
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,858
- The debtor.
- The debtor.

360
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,987
DEPOSIT

361
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,492
Now, once you move out,

362
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,828
the public housing corporation
can return the deposit to the bank.

363
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,790
The bank is evicting you
to get the deposit back.

364
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,959
Does that make sense?

365
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,127
Yes.

366
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,005
Since it's true
that you haven't paid the bank back,

367
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,216
so legally,
it's hard to block the lawsuit.

368
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:32,470
Then, does that mean
I'll just get kicked out of my house?

369
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,767
You should still fight it somehow.
At least try to buy yourself some time.

370
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,770
But the trial's tomorrow.

371
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,107
It seems cases like these
are common nowadays.

372
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,359
I heard about a similar one earlier today.

373
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,070
I heard the lawyer's office for the bank
was in this building,

374
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,199
so I came to try and plead with them.

375
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,537
I didn't even get to see their lawyer.
They turned me away at the door.

376
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,791
I'm grasping at straws,
so I came up here.

377
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,169
The floor below us?

378
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,672
Do you know the lawyers downstairs?

379
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,299
COMPLAINT FILED BY LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN
ATTORNEYS NA, AHN

380
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,343
What are you consulting on, Juhyeong?

381
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,429
It's related to an eviction lawsuit.

382
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,515
A real estate transfer claim
through the creditor's subrogation right.

383
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,852
It's a lawsuit to evict someone
for not paying debts.

384
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:26,525
If you're close to them,
could you ask them to drop the case?

385
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,529
The lawyers downstairs
are just doing their job

386
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,239
on behalf of the bank.

387
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,785
It's not my place to ask them to drop it.
It wouldn't be proper.

388
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,787
Right, of course.

389
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:44,584
Then, don't you take on
any pro bono cases?

390
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,253
I know it's shameless of me to ask.

391
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,965
I'll ask my director and get back to you.

392
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,342
- Thank you.
- No problem at all.

393
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,849
I used to take pro bono cases
because I wanted to help.

394
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,934
But once word got out,

395
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,562
everyone started showing up
asking for free help.

396
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,731
So I stopped.

397
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,776
I can see that.

398
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,363
I do feel for him.

399
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,949
But I'm afraid I can't.

400
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,795
All that fancy talk,

401
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,424
but he's just kicking people out
of public housing while acting cool.

402
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,553
COMPLAINT

403
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,436
Don't we need an appointment?

404
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,357
Don't places like this
usually take walk-ins?

405
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,569
There are so many law offices here.

406
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,073
How do we know where to go for counseling?

407
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,867
- There's too many to choose from.
- Should we try every floor?

408
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,744
- Let's skip the 6th floor.
- Why?

409
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,413
That one's a law office, not a law firm.

410
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,710
- Is there a difference?
- Doesn't it feel like a smaller operation?

411
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,190
Sixth floor...

412
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,881
A merger?

413
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,759
Some of you run law firms,

414
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,137
and others run law offices.

415
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:06,100
But don't most people prefer
to run a law firm if they could?

416
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,811
Law offices aren't necessarily lesser.

417
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,105
I'm well aware of that.

418
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,151
But do regular folks see it that way?

419
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,819
Probably not.

420
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,031
- Attorney Ahn, are you busy?
- Yes.

421
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,326
Attorney Kim Geoncheol left,

422
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,661
so you know we have
an open partner spot, right?

423
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,372
- Yes, I'm aware.
- Any thoughts of taking that spot?

424
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,252
- All of a sudden?
- Come on. You've been at it for 10 years.

425
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,172
Sir, don't keep adding a year
every time you bring it up.

426
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,507
It's been eight years
since I passed probation

427
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,718
and nine if you're counting by calendar.

428
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,720
Either way, you're due to go solo.

429
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,388
- Yes, well...
- Who stays an associate

430
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,848
this long in Seocho-dong?

431
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,059
No, I have no thoughts
about that right now.

432
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,979
A few years ago, you talked about
starting your own practice with me.

433
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,483
No, I like where I'm at now.

434
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,407
Really?

435
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,243
- Okay, don't worry about it.
- Okay.

436
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,168
But we're not a law office.
We're already a law firm.

437
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,795
So why should we do this?

438
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,756
You currently have
only two registered partners now, right?

439
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,801
Since Attorney Kim left?

440
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,428
You need at least three,
excluding associates.

441
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,223
We're planning to bring someone in soon.

442
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,434
If your firm stays non-compliant
for a few more months,

443
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,938
you'll end up paying back a ton in taxes.

444
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,440
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

445
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,903
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

446
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,366
She's coming
to the asset seizure tomorrow.

447
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,910
She's really dedicated.

448
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,496
Right? I think we made a good hire.

449
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,500
I had a great feeling about her
during the interview.

450
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,711
She's very eager to learn too.

451
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,131
You were so worried
since we only had one resume come in.

452
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,926
Exactly. We rarely get applicants.

453
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:14,687
I hope she doesn't leave soon
for some bigger firm though.

454
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,356
No, I don't think she will.

455
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,155
You're saying we should ditch
our current independent partners

456
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,284
and only merge
with the managing partners here?

457
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:33,080
If we ditch them, we'd lose headcount.
There'd be no point in merging.

458
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,834
You'd need to grow in numbers
for it to mean something.

459
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,502
With more lawyers,
the firm will look bigger.

460
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,630
And that would help with both business

461
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,716
and recruitment.

462
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,885
Ms. Kang,

463
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:48,305
it seemed like
finding that new hire wasn't easy.

464
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,974
LAW GROUP CHUNGGONG

465
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,392
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

466
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,644
I need more business cards.
Could you order them?

467
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,563
- Sure.
- Ms. Kim, hold on.

468
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,689
What's the matter, sir?

469
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,441
Put a hold on ordering those for now.

470
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,525
Sorry?

471
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,737
- But I only have about 20 left.
- Just wait a bit, all right?

472
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,823
You don't even use them.
Do you use them for something else?

473
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,368
- No, it's not like that.
- Exactly, so just hold off.

474
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,662
If the boss says so,
there's always a reason.

475
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,998
It's for business reasons.

476
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,625
It's not like you scout clients.

477
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,001
Yes, sir. I understand.

478
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,670
No new cards. Okay?

479
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,381
Gosh.

480
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,759
Thank you.

483
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,525
Hyungmin Building's Law Group...

484
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,610
Hyungmin.

485
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,237
<i>Law Group Hyungmin.</i>

486
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,155
That will be the name of the merged firm.

487
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:53,077
Well, you've already picked a name?
I have no thoughts of joining though.

488
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,787
If you merge,

489
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:58,792
you'll get the top four floors
of our eight-floor building.

490
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,545
A single law firm taking up
half the building with a name

491
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,339
that matches the building's?

492
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,050
It looks way more impressive, right?

493
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,928
It'll look like the firm
owns the building.

494
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:11,680
It'll be beneficial.

495
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,771
Hyungmin Building's Law Group Hyungmin.

496
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,650
Law Group Hyungmin in Hyungmin Building.

497
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,319
It'll look great even on a business card.

498
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,030
Law Group Hyungmin,
located in Hyungmin Building.

499
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,783
What do you think?
It would help with business.

500
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,494
- Right, Director Seong?
- I like it.

501
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,454
It's nice.

502
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,331
- Right? I like it.
- You already operate separately.

503
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,583
So even if you merge,

504
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,336
you'll still keep
your own clients and profits.

505
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,255
Nothing really changes.

506
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,091
Except now, you look like a major firm.

507
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,261
I can't see why you'd say no.

508
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,514
Gosh, Ms. Kim.

509
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,142
You seem to know everything
about this field.

510
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,603
Are you a former lawyer?

511
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,483
I've spent my fair share of time
in Seocho-dong.

512
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,655
Let's assume we have no reason
to turn it down.

513
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,659
But what would you get out of this?

514
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,248
Me? Nothing really.

515
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,417
Then, I won't accept the offer.

516
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,710
Because I don't benefit?

517
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,379
There's no such thing as a deal
with zero upside.

518
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,256
Saying you have nothing to gain

519
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,177
just sounds like
you have something to hide from us.

520
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,641
You're lawyers through and through.

521
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,809
All right.

522
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,062
Here's the truth.

523
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,484
If your firms merge
and share the same name as the building's,

524
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,404
it'll be harder for you to move out.

525
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,827
I want to maintain
stable, long-term tenants.

526
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,664
So does that sound convincing enough?

527
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,916
Even with all of that,

528
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,919
if one of us wanted to
move somewhere else,

529
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,673
it wouldn't be impossible to open a branch

530
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,549
under the same name.

531
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,720
Well, it's not impossible,
but I'm sure it'd be a pain.

532
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,599
Make it easy to enter and hard to leave.

533
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,726
That's basic business.

534
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,686
And one more thing.

535
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,481
If you do merge,
I might throw a few cases your way.

536
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,817
Maybe often.

537
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,028
I always have a lot of lawsuits
going on around me.

538
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,950
What do you say? Would you like to merge?

539
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,161
ORDER AND GROUNDS

540
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,250
MANAGING PARTNER KANG JEONGYUN

00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,782
<i>This is Kim Hyungmin.</i>

543

544

545
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,398
Thank you.

OFFICIAL BUSINESS

547
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,000
How do you live here
and not pay your debts?

548
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,423
Hello.

549
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,842
Hello!

550
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,511
What about Mr. Eom?

551
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,514
He said he had an errand
to do early this morning.

552
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,350
I guess he'll be a little late.

553
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,311
Okay, we'll just open the door then.

554
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,314
We'll open the door
and begin the asset seizure.

555
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,149
Are you the creditor?

556
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,943
- Yes.
- Okay, right here.

557
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,986
Just sign here, please.

558
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,530
CREDITOR: SON
DEBTOR: KIM

559
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,740
And...

560
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,910
- Here.
- Are you the witness for the creditor?

561
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,078
- Yes.
- Here.

562
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,664
Please sign here.

563
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,917
Hey, Jeongsik!

564
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,294
- What?
- Put that out and come here.

565
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,880
Here, sign this.

566
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,341
- Sign it here?
- Yeah.

567
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,094
Okay.

568
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,930
All right, then. We'll open the door.

569
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,099
Okay.

570
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,740
Excuse me.

571
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,074
What are you people doing?

572
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,785
We're from
Seoul Eastern District Court.

573
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:31,583
According to case 2024-65123,
we'll proceed with the asset seizure.

574
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,294
- Sir, please open the door.
- You can't just barge in!

575
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,254
- Please move, sir.
- Stop it!

576
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,089
- Come on, sir!
- Sir!

577
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,008
- How dare you barge in?
- Can I leave now?

578
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,803
Hang on. You signed as a witness,
so you should at least step inside.

579
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,097
I'm busy though.

580
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,432
For goodness' sake.

581
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,683
Hold on!

582
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,810
I'm done.

583
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,354
- Don't waste your energy, dear.
- Right!

584
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,608
Come in or don't! I don't care!

585
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,612
- Easy! This flooring isn't cheap.
- Please excuse us.

586
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,822
What are these fools
doing here this early?

587
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,199
- Come this way.
- Okay.

588
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,242
- Hey, upstairs...
- Pay back the money!

589
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,036
- What money?
- Pay back what you borrowed!

590
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,039
I said I would, you fool!

591
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,457
Oh, my God!

592
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,126
If that breaks, you're paying for it!

593
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,379
- Yes, we'll take care of it.
- Why are you going into the kitchen?

594
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,923
You scoundrels!

595
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,717
- Tag that silver tray too.
- What silver tray?

596
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,428
- That's not silver!
- Sir.

597
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,558
This is obstruction. Please step aside.

598
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,561
- Come on!
- That blue painting.

599
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,063
The blue one? Here it is.

600
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,147
Hey, who are you?

601
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,858
For someone looking so clean-cut,
why pull this nonsense?

602
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,194
- Get out!
- She's the creditor's witness.

603
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,112
Quiet! Get out of here!

604
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,074
What a joke!

605
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,493
Unbelievable!

606
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,245
You'll be charged with obstruction!

607
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,039
- Fine, whatever!
- Whatever? Okay!

608
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,624
Why are you opening that?

609
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,545
That's where my underwear is!
How dare you touch them, you creep?

610
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,338
- Are you a pervert?
- Don't be ridiculous!

611
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,259
- What do you want with women's underwear?
- Geez, I don't want them!

612
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,470
- Don't stick that label there!
- Yes, ma'am.

613
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,099
- My clothes are going to get ruined!
- They won't.

614
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,686
My goodness, this is unbelievable.
Why are you digging through everything?

615
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,480
- Don't tag that!
- We have to look through all of this.

616
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,316
I don't believe this!

617
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,151
- And over here...
- No, not there!

618
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,113
Gosh, there's a bunch.

619
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,116
Seriously, that's...

620
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,913
- What am I going to do?
- Sir!

621
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,164
- Yes?
- Over here!

622
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,918
- Just a moment.
- Are you nuts? Why are you opening that?

623
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,545
My goodness.

624
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,589
Why did you open that? What are you doing?

625
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,966
You can't go up! Don't!

626
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,260
My goodness!

627
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,642
- I knew it.
- Seriously, these...

628
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,644
All of these were borrowed, okay?

629
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,314
We borrowed all of these!

630
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,442
They're not mine. None of them are mine!

631
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,987
- Seriously!
- Why on earth are you doing this?

632
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,698
- What?
- What you're doing is obstruction!

633
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,867
I want to be naked in my own house!

634
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,202
So what's it to you?

635
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,954
- Put it back on!
- Put what on?

636
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,957
- Get dressed.
- Don't touch me!

637
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,335
But you touched other people's money!

638
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,088
I didn't touch a thing! Get out!

639
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,010
Yeah. That's a good idea.

640
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,263
Yeah! Let's all strip. Come on!

641
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,724
Hold on!

642
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,893
- Happy now? Satisfied?
- How dare you?

643
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,102
- Do you?
- Get out!

644
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,479
- Aren't you hot?
- Come out!

645
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,731
- Take it off! We have nothing to lose!
- Hold on!

646
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,316
Sir, is this right?

647
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,778
What else can we do
if they keep acting like that?

648
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,198
Hey! What are you doing there?

649
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,741
Who said you can use the bathroom?

650
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:53,910
You...

651
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,871
What are you looking at?

652
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,166
You stripped to make us look
and feel uncomfortable!

653
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,503
Well, we saw
and we were uncomfortable. Happy?

654
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,468
Gosh.

655
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,473
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

656
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,768
There must've been an accident somewhere.
Traffic was so bad.

657
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:20,937
It's okay.

658
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,898
Things happen.

659
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,402
I'm sorry.

660
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,989
It must have been really tough.

661
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,701
I'm okay.

662
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,830
Let's just go.

663
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,837
I went up to the secret room,

664
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,464
and there were tons of bags and paintings.

665
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,924
Then, I heard yelling downstairs.

666
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,720
I went down and Chairman Kim
was taking off all his clothes.

667
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,304
- Seriously...
- Gosh.

668
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,515
See? I told you not to go.

669
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,435
I told you rich people
aren't easy to deal with.

670
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,021
They have so much
and don't want to lose any of it.

671
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,940
Also, it's not something
to be so upset about.

672
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,651
Rich or not,
people just do whatever they can.

673
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,153
Come on.

674
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,406
- That doesn't mean they should.
- Exactly.

675
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,576
Where's the food?

676
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,578
I said we shouldn't come here.
The food takes forever.

677
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,041
That's because
they only start breading the pork cutlets

678
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,584
right when you order.

679
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,335
That's why it's so good.

680
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,629
I have a trial this afternoon.

681
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,214
Always acting busy.

682
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,383
You should've brought
your files like I did,

683
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,011
so you can head straight to court.

684
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,723
- What trial is it?
- You know. The real estate transfer claim.

685
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,142
The one against Jang Hyeonseok?

686
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,436
How did you know?

687
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,105
That's the case where a savings bank

688
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,317
was suing a public housing tenant
for eviction.

689
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,903
It must feel bad to work on the case.

690
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,242
Did you feel bad
during the asset seizure?

691
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,204
They both didn't pay, so we acted.
What's there to feel bad about?

692
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,166
But how did you even know
about Juhyeong's case?

693
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,252
Jang Hyeonseok came to us for a consult.

694
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,588
It turned out to be Juhyeong's case.

695
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,714
By chance?

696
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,466
Not exactly.

697
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:18,387
He wanted me to ask Juhyeong
to drop the case.

698
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,305
Why didn't you tell me?

699
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,726
Still, I couldn't ask you to drop it.
It's your job.

700
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,647
That's surprising.

701
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,482
I thought you were nosy
like a certain someone.

702
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:31,901
I guess you're not that bad.

703
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,784
Me? Are you talking about me?

704
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,494
I'm not that bad.

705
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,912
Why are you so serious?

706
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,914
I have feelings too, okay?

707
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,457
- What?
- Here are your pork cutlets.

708
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,459
Thank you. I'll take mine first.

709
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,920
Thank you.

710
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,216
- Shouldn't you eat first?
- Go on and eat.

711
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:01,973
See you.

712
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,891
- Bye.
- Bye.

713
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,021
Coffee?

714
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,988
Why are you always cold to only me?

715
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,408
I was cold to only you?

716
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,244
Do you have main character syndrome?

717
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,581
If we consider the past,
I should be the one being cold.

718
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,125
But why are you doing that to me?

719
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,335
What did I do back then?

720
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,463
You said we should meet up, and then...

721
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,427
Never mind. Why bother?

722
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,556
Well, I wouldn't know
since I don't remember you that well.

723
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,232
So he's not insane? He's just a jerk?

724
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,695
Defendant? Mr. Jang Hyeonseok?

725
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,780
Please sit.

726
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,492
You sue someone to evict them
just because they missed a payment?

727
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,454
You call yourself a lawyer?

728
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,206
Then, you can just repay them.

729
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,667
Shouldn't the court
be protecting people like me?

730
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,753
Please sit.

731
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,174
Counsel for the plaintiff,
is there any chance of a settlement?

732
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:22,260
No, the plaintiff won't settle
unless the full amount is repaid.

733
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,346
If I had the money, I would've paid!

734
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,764
What do you want me to do?

735
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,265
Sit down!

736
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,351
Defendant.

737
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,520
One more disrespectful outburst,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

738
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,482
Yes, I'm sorry.

739
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,862
So Defendant, you can't repay
what you borrowed. Is that correct?

740
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:41,655
Yes, that's right.

741
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,199
Then, it's true.

742
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,952
So why are you getting this worked up?

743
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,460
Excuse me, sir!

744
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,545
Look, isn't there any other way?

745
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,173
Just pay back the debt.

746
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,051
But it's not like I'm refusing
to pay on purpose!

747
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,929
If you borrowed money, please repay it.

748
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,139
That's our client's stance.

749
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,772
WE REQUEST THE CLAIMS BE UPHELD

750
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,407
What a long day!

751
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,910
Time to go home.

752
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,038
Time to go home...

753
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,213
The kid acted out,
so I gave them a warning.

754
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,340
That's a relief.

755
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,051
Actually, we're planning
to merge floors 5 through 8.

756
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,430
So we've started clearing people out.

757
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,975
Your drink.

758
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,352
Please, continue.

759
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,855
I'll get going.

760
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,012
My goodness, I'm so tired!

761
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,073
SUPREME COURT UPDATE

762
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,451
Do they always have to
send these at night?

763
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,728
A CREDITOR OF A PUBLIC HOUSING TENANT

764
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,689
TERMINATED THE LEASE ON THEIR BEHALF

765
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,244
A CREDITOR OF A PUBLIC HOUSING TENANT

766
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,497
TERMINATED THE LEASE ON THEIR BEHALF

767
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,835
What are we supposed to do now?

768
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:44,003
I'm here for a divorce consultation.

769
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,089
I see.

770
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,385
- Sir.
- Thank you.

771
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,685
The Supreme Court set a new precedent.
The case is exactly like ours.

772
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,313
It says going forward, it'll be harder
to evict public housing tenants

773
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,982
like Jang Hyeonseok.

774
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,316
Then, what?

775
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,070
Given this, dropping the lawsuit
would be the right move.

776
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,865
LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

777
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:17,537
Listen, these public housing leases
run 10, sometimes 20 years.

778
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,707
So we just sit and wait until it ends?

779
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,419
That would mean a huge loss for our bank.
Isn't there anything we can do?

780
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,046
This precedent
literally came out yesterday.

781
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,840
Jang Hyeonseok probably doesn't know,

782
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,594
and even the judge
may not be aware of it yet.

783
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,429
Then, what do we do?

784
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,556
Just because we know about this precedent

785
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,018
doesn't mean we're obligated
to bring it up.

786
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,896
- Let's proceed as is.
- Is that okay?

787
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,024
Yes, that's what we should do.

788
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,776
Act natural.

789
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,156
- Don't look here and just act natural.
- Hurry up and take it!

790
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,324
- There you go.
- Can I eat naturally?

791
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,658
No, wait!

792
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,619
- Hurry up.
- Hold on!

793
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,746
- You're taking all day!
- Help me out!

794
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,831
The cream is melting.

795
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,168
- Done? Can I eat the cake?
- Hold on.

796
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:09,047
Isn't your blog called "A Lawyer's Table?"
Why take photos of drinks then?

797
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,759
That narrow-minded mindset
won't get you far.

798
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,094
Then rename it.

799
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,555
"A Lawyer's Food and Beverage."

800
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,681
That sounds awful.

801
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,975
- Come on.
- What?

802
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,769
What?

803
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,437
No one called you.

804
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,982
- What are you so deep in thought about?
- It's nothing.

805
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,984
What do you mean "It's nothing"?

806
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,488
Even through the camera,
I can see your face is full of worry.

807
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,075
Yeah, spill it. Big bro's listening.

808
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,661
Did you have a blind date
and you liked her?

809
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,704
- How about another bet?
- There she goes again.

810
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,957
I guess you saw the precedent.

811
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,501
Isn't that what it's about?

812
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,962
Wait, you read it?

813
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,714
- It came out yesterday.
- Wait.

814
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,467
You read a precedent
that came out yesterday?

815
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,553
Is there an exam we need to take?

816
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,929
What's with you two?

817
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,056
You're dropping the case
because of it, right?

818
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,433
Nope. We're not dropping it.

819
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,519
You're not?

820
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,688
In that case,
the plaintiff was also a bank,

821
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,857
and the defendant
was a public housing tenant.

822
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,068
They used the deposit
as collateral when the loan was given.

823
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,446
- It's the exact same as yours.
- Were you shut down by the precedent?

824
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,784
- Wasn't it going to be an easy win?
- I know. I read it carefully too.

825
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:23,496
Wait! How did you even find out
about a precedent that came out yesterday?

826
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,749
But if you proceed,
you'll lose the case.

827
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,298
I might've lost against you,

828
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,425
but not with these two.

829
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,011
What?

830
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,972
- Did you know about it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

831
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,183
- Can't we win too?
- Did you see it yesterday?

832
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,894
- I guess not.
- Can we not while we eat?

833
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,565
- Not reading is normal.
- You just jumped to that conclusion.

834
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,988
He's not just a jerk.
He's a total thug.

<i>Yes, this case was continued,</i>

841
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:45,286
<i>because the defendant
requested more time to repay the loan.</i>

842
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,165
So, has there been
any progress since then?

843
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,543
Your Honor, I haven't paid it back yet,

LATEST SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

849
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,993
- You said I could play with it after you!
- It's not even yours!

850
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,745
I want to play with my friends too!

851
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,248
Don't run!
The neighbors are going to complain!

852
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,167
- Honey, stop.
- You promised I could play after you!

853
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,046
We don't even know
how long we'll be staying here.

- Who is it?

00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,678
Hush. Wait inside.

856
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,150
Hello.

857
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,957
They're notes my predecessor wrote.

858
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,334
I don't understand the part he marked.

859
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,336
Gosh, look at these insane indents.

860
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,506
I know.
That firm always formats like that.

861
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,887
I'm not an expert,

862
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,932
but I heard the Supreme Court
recently ruled that people like me

863
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,144
can't be kicked out anymore,
so I submitted that information.

864
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,938
There was a relevant precedent?

865
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,649
Counsel for the plaintiff,
were you aware of this?

866
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,942
- Yes.
- With this precedent,

867
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,195
it's hard to say

868
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:46,282
that the defendant
still has an obligation to vacate.

869
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,994
Counsel for the plaintiff,
have you had time to review this?

870
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,872
We'll take a closer look
and either withdraw the claim

871
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:55,333
or submit a rebuttal
before the next hearing.

872
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,418
All right, please do.

873
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,004
But it seems to me

874
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:03,050
that a withdrawal
might be your best option.

875
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,136
I'll discuss it with my client.

876
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:16,020
Sir, I'm sorry.

877
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:20,942
I became so angry during the last trial
and acted so rudely towards you.

878
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,818
I'm not usually like that.

879
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,320
No, it's all right.

880
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,074
I just didn't want to end up
out on the street.

881
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,245
We're all just doing whatever we can.

882
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,914
You didn't have
any personal animosity towards me.

883
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,792
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

884
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,652
You were taking too long,
so we started eating.

885
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,322
- We literally just started.
- How was your trial?

886
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,533
Come eat.

887
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,954
What was that, Ms. Kang?

888
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,498
It was pro bono.

889
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:20,167
Someone was focused on personal gain,
so I did some public interest work.

890
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,504
You should've officially signed on
and shown up then.

891
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,590
Are you mad I didn't show up at court?

892
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,050
I'm not mad.

893
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,264
- What happened?
- I think we should stay quiet.

894
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,975
You said you weren't that nosy.

895
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,395
But that wasn't pro bono.
That was meddling.

896
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,939
The precedent's already out.

897
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,190
It's not like I made it up.

898
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,695
- I just let things follow their course.
- Do you agree with that precedent?

899
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,866
- What?
- Do you agree with the Supreme Court?

900
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,246
Are you saying you disagree with it?

901
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,961
<i>Public housing exists to protect people
who have a hard time</i>

902
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,838
<i>finding homes like Jang Hyeonseok.</i>

903
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,049
You can't just kick them out so easily.

904
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,800
You think I'm the bad guy.

905
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,762
You wonder why I took this case.

906
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,931
I'm not criticizing you for taking it.

907
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,435
But you should at least
feel uneasy about it.

908
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,937
You should be aware of what you're doing.

909
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,733
You said it was "public interest work"?

910
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,403
Are you sure that really was
in the public's interest?

911
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,950
For lawyers, public interest means
defending their client's rights.

912
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,952
Making the other side
accountable for their violations.

913
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,621
That is public interest.

914
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,164
Thinking beyond that is arrogance.

915
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,125
Does that belief make you feel better?

916
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,336
It's not that thought of arrogance
holding you back.

917
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,755
You just lack the courage
to think that far.

918
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,966
It seems you're the one
who doesn't know what they're saying.

919
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,470
What do you think would happen
if I told the bank to drop the lawsuit

920
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,473
and that they can't sue anyone
who can't repay anymore?

921
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,392
What do you think
would immediately happen?

922
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,936
Less people would be kicked out
of their homes by banks.

923
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:05,357
Banks are going to stop lending
to people like Jang Hyeonseok.

924
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,567
The world isn't that black and white.

925
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,445
If one thing changes,
everything else related to it changes.

926
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,406
We're sorry, sir.

927
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:17,493
For now, we can't offer deposit loans
for public housing.

928
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,537
It's due to a Supreme Court precedent.

929
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,331
That was for people
who didn't repay their loans.

930
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,583
- I don't miss my interest payments.
- I'm sorry.

931
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,377
So even if awarded public housing,

932
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,880
more people won't be able to move in
because they can't cover the deposit.

933
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,925
If collateral can't be enforced,
you think banks would still lend?

934
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:37,222
That means the ones who borrow
and repay properly end up suffering.

935
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,974
And still, you're certain
this is public interest?

936
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,434
Why do you only see one side?

937
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:45,897
When a person loses their home,
their entire world falls apart.

938
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,318
Do you think one person's world
counts as public interest?

939
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:55,740
Hey, stop it.

940
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,116
- You're so loud.
- She's right.

941
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,743
Hey, cut it out!

942
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,495
You said not to act like a lawyer,
but you're doing it the most!

943
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:05,166
Sorry, don't mind us. Please eat. Sorry.

944
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,794
Eat before your food gets cold.

945
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,381
- Let's eat.
- Sorry.

946
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,594
We're really sorry.

947
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,516
- Have you made a decision?
- Yes.

948
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,312
Please file the withdrawal.

949
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:28,482
We've reviewed it internally

950
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,527
and decided to look for another solution.

951
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,070
I see.

952
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,949
I'll also think it over
and see if there's another way.

953
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,534
Okay.

954
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,663
Withdrawing is simple.

955
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,707
But the issue is what will follow.

956
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:51,880
I know.

957
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,699
- It's dragging on for a while.
- What is?

958
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,203
Come on!

959
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,330
You've known each other 10 years.
Let's make up.

960
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,915
Shake hands. Okay?

961
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,667
Ten years? Says who?

962
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,336
Ten years, my foot.

963
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,421
You were the one who first said that.

964
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,300
Changwon, I think we should stay quiet.

965
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,679
- Why am I always told to stay quiet?
- Have some dumplings.

966
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:42,973
Thanks.

967
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,809
You knew I liked dumplings?

968
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:11,293
I'm not criticizing you for taking it.

969
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,461
<i>But you should at least
feel uneasy about it.</i>

970
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,464
<i>You should be aware of what you're doing.</i>

971
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:21,011
When a person loses their home,
their entire world falls apart.

972
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,055
What does she know?

973
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,017
As if I haven't had those thoughts either.

974
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,952
If one thing changes,
everything else related to it changes.

975
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,588
For lawyers, public interest means
defending their client's rights.

976
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,424
<i>Making the other side

977
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,051
<i>That is public interest.</i>

978
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,886
Thinking beyond that is arrogance.

979
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,889
He's the most arrogant one.

980
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,154

AS OF TODAY, LAW GROUP KYUNGMIN

HAS OFFICIALLY ENTERED
THE PROCESS OF A MERGER

986

WITH JOHWA, CHUNGGONG, AND HOJEON

987
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,865
A merger?

988
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,665
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

989
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,177
Where did he run off to?

990
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,349
I BELIEVE I'M REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY

991
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,560
THIS IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS

<i>Just be honest.</i>

996
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,079
<i>You remember, don't you?</i>

997
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,042
You're still pretty though.

998
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,253
<i>I guess the merger really did happen.</i>

999
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,172
<i>We're all under one roof now.</i>

1000
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,465
<i>Don't get empathize.</i>

1001
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,634
You'll lose objectivity
and hinder your work.

1002
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,928
You don't empathize,
because you can't feel anything.

1003
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,472
<i>It's not by choice, okay?</i>

1004
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:03,268
- Are you really a lawyer?
- It's all on her.

1005
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,187
<i>Something feels off.</i>

1006
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,981
<i>Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!</i>

<i>Need help with something?</i>
