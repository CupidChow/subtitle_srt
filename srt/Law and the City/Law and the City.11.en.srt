00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,648
Hello, ma'am.

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,817

Geez.

Wait.

9
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,128
When did they all become one firm?

10
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,509
Please leave, sir.

11
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,052
- Gosh.
- Mr. Lee!

12
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,096
Okay, goodbye.

13
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,307
- I said I'll give you a piece of the land.
- Yes, if you get it.

14
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,017
Come back if you really get it.

15
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,727
You should head out for today.

16
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,270
- Let go of me!
- Goodbye!

17
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,939
I can let myself out!

18
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,942
For crying out loud!

19
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,194
My goodness.

20
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,989
You think smiling like a weasel
solves everything?

21
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,783
You don't even know what this is about.

22
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,245
Goodness. Geez!

23
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,330
Hello.

24
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,623
Attorney Cho.

25
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,835
Come to work earlier.
Why should I handle this stuff?

26
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,629
Damn it.

27
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,635
Excuse me.

28
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,886
What was that about?

29
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,097
Well...

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,558
Yes, I understand what you're saying,

31
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,643
but we're so busy that we can't.

32
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,062
- Please try elsewhere.
- Come now.

33
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,189
You're not the only lawyer here!

34
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,275
Just hand it off to another lawyer!

35
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,736
- It's because we're a small firm.
- My goodness!

36
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,030
Even though I'm offering you
a piece of the land?

37
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,157
I'm so sorry.

38
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,409
Geez!

40
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,888
Hello. How can I help you?

41
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,516
I'd like to get a replacement
for my old card.

42
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,559
While you're at it,

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,228
would you like to try
our newly launched debit card?

44
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,398
It's a great cashback card for savings,
so it's very popular.

45
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,066
Sure, I'll go with that one.

46
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,444
Okay, please wait a moment
while we make your card.

47
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,529
Okay.

SHINHYUP SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT PLAN

49
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,246
You have support programs
for small businesses too?

50
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,041
Yes, that's right.
We offer various services.

51
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,503
Like low-interest loans
and financial education.

52
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,380
Okay. Here's your card.

53
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,426
We'll also give you some stickers
to decorate it.

54
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,970
They're cute. Thank you.

55
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,232
Attorney Kang.

56
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,109
Seoul Central District Court
called to ask if you can take

57
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,028
a court-appointed case on May 12.

58
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,112
What should I tell them?

59
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,157
- Tell them I'm available.
- Okay.

60
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,583
So your first court-appointed case?

61
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,086
Yeah, I'm finally doing one.

62
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,337
What's the case?

63
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,130
I'm not sure yet.

64
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,384
They just checked
if I was available first.

65
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,303
Did your boss sign off on it?

66
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,265
I applied after getting
her approval before,

67
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,934
but things got awkward
during that inheritance case.

68
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,186
I might check with her again.

69
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,941
Hey, did you also have
that weird old man visit this morning?

70
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,611
He visited you too? I heard he had
some weird paper with Chinese characters,

71
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,155
saying acres of land
were his or something.

72
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,450
Yeah. It looked like a document
from the National Archives.

73
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,703
As if you've ever been there before.

74
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,872
- Have you?
- Of course, I have.

75
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,915
I once had a case
involving a national honoree.

76
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,085
Well, I heard from my boss earlier.

77
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,129
And it sounds like
he's been around everywhere.

78
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,299
He said he couldn't pay the retainer.

79
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,884
Our firm probably turned him away.

80
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,051
Most likely.

81
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,972
I bet your boss
would've taken him in though.

82
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,474
My boss isn't that much
of a pushover either.

83
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,019
- I see.
- I see.

84
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,901
Come on. Lunchtime's not even over yet.

85
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,695
- What is it?
- Our boss called, so we have to go.

86
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,071
I'll clean up. Go ahead.

87
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,324
Thanks. Let's go.

88
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,909
Bye.

89
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,703
Let's go to a cafe. I need some caffeine.

90
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,999
- No, I have to go too. I'm busy.
- Come on.

91
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,836
I can't go either.

92
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,006
- Want this instead?
- Okay.

93
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,801
- Want one too, Sanggi?
- Thank you.

94
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,678
Here.

95
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,555
What a lifesaver.

96
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,438
Hey, clean up before you leave!

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,691
I'd like you two to handle
this real estate case.

98
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,986
- We're taking that old man's case?
- You know about it?

99
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,406
Yes, we heard from the other attorneys.

100
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,660
It's not like you
to take on a case like this.

101
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,078
What kind of case is this?

102
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,872
I heard they can't pay the retainer.

103
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,251
If we win the land back for him,
we'll get a share of it.

104
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,711
It's a pretty big area.

105
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,715
In return, we're covering
all of the legal costs.

106
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,426
But if things work out, it's a jackpot.

107
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,679
I'll be counting on you.

108
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,059
This is it?

109
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,353
Yes, that's all he had.

110
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,314
What are we supposed to do with just this?

111
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,150
Are you really going to do
something like this?

112
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,115
What's with everyone lately?

113
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,534
So many complaints.

114
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,204
Let's just stick
to how we've always done things.

115
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,417
Okay?

116
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,469
Yes, Attorney Kang? What is it?

117
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,806
Ma'am.

118
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,561
I just got word I'm going to be assigned
a court-appointed case.

119
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,770
Is it okay if I take it?

120
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,147
Of course.

121
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,941
There's no need to ask about that.

122
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,569
I just wanted to double-check.

123
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
I told you before it was fine.

124
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,161
Right, thank you.

125
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,915
Please set up a system
where new case assignments

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,586
can be logged and shared
right away by each firm.

127
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,838
That way, they can avoid
ending up on the same case.

128
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,466
Also,

129
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,509
let's get a dedicated tax accountant
for each floor,

130
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,345
so they can manage their own books.

131
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,557
Chairman, will you still be
working from here?

132
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,643
It must be tough to go back and forth
from the foundation. I'm sorry.

133
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,021
Not at all. I'm fine with it.

134
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,233
But a few people are saying
you're only focused on this place.

135
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,445
Both from the foundation and the company.

136
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,950
The staff and the directors
have done such a great job,

137
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,119
so I've been really thankful.

138
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,371
But I guess I've been neglectful.

139
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,417
Thank you for telling me.
I'll try to pay more attention to them.

140
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,085
Well...

141
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,672
This law group is neither a charity
nor a business.

142
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,718
Do you mind if I ask
why you're so invested in it?

143
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,884
Yes, that's great.

144
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,970
Then, I'll do these two.

145
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,847
- Could you take care of the rest?
- Okay.

146
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,182
And one more case just came in.

147
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,268
It seems like
a real estate contract issue.

148
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,270
The client's young.
Could you do a consult?

149
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,730
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,315
And...

151
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,860
Have you thought about what I gave you?

152
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,112
The PhD program.

153
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,866
Yes, about that...

154
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,495
I appreciate you looking out for me,
but I've decided not to do it.

155
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,497
Why?

156
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,959
They won't accept me
if I work and study at the same time.

157
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,918
The school said that?

158
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,087
Yes.

159
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,214
I mean, I have to stay here and work.

160
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,216
I can't just go and leave you behind.

161
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,303
I am going to return to my office
and get some work done.

162
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,638
All right.

163
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,414
If you're a lawyer,
you can't just be sitting around all day.

164
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,500
You have to go out and hit the streets.

165
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,337
Or at least listen carefully
to what people have to say.

166
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,841
So you're saying this land
was taken by others

167
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,386
after Korea was liberated
and the Korean War, right?

168
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,638
That's right.

169
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,348
Suddenly after the war,

170
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,520
the land ended up
in the hands of the Kwak family.

171
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,856
But with this one document,
there's not much we can verify.

172
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,233
If not one, then what?

173
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,110
Would two make a difference?

174
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,821
There was only ever one to begin with.

175
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,074
It's the lawyers' job to dig up the rest.

176
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,993
All right, now.

177
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,829
Look here. Okay?

178
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,498
"Doheung-myeon."

179
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,958
Now, it's Doheung-eup. Okay?

180
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,210
"Lot 580."

181
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,003
Yeah. Here.

182
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:21,676
That's around 32 acres.

183
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,469
"<i>Taisho</i> 3."

184
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,140
<i>Taisho</i> is an era name
from the Japanese occupation period.

185
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,225
And here!

186
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,520
- Han Insu...
- We know what it says.

187
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,940
But we're saying we can't tell
what happened just from looking at this.

188
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,360
This lot number
doesn't even exist anymore.

189
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,156
What is your relation to Han Insu?

190
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,283
We're family.

191
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,201
So how exactly are you related?

192
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,122
We're more like family than family.

193
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,416
Family isn't just about blood.

194
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,753
- So you're not related at all?
- Come now.

195
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,838
Look at this. I'll show you.

196
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,550
Getting this land back isn't about me.
Look at this.

197
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,094
These are Han Insu's great-grandchildren.

198
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,388
HAN SUCHEOL
HAN SUKJA

199
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,185
Then, you're not related at all.
Why are you trying to reclaim it?

200
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,898
Everyone in the neighborhood knows

201
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,151
that land belonged to Han Insu!

202
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,487
But they're all keeping quiet.

203
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,408
Why? Because all the elders
in Han's family have passed away.

204
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,496
Come with me.
You'll understand once you see.

205
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,832
- We don't need to go there--
- Let's go.

206
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,001
What? Really?

207
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,464
Sure. Let's go. Get up. Come on!

208
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,511
You're really going?

209
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,471
We need to check
if that power of attorney is legit.

210
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,555
Let's go.

211
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,015
POWER OF ATTORNEY
PARK MANSU

212
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,101
AUTHORIZING THE ABOVE TO APPOINT A LAWYER

213
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,228
TO RECOVER THIS LAND

214
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,439
GRANTORS
HAN SUCHEOL, HAN SUKJA, HAN SUCHAN

215
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,986
So, I trusted the realtor
and signed the lease.

216
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,699
But now, the landlord's saying they never
agreed to such a thing and want me out.

217
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,827
- And you've never met the landlord?
- No.

218
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,914
The realtor said they were authorized
to act on the landlord's behalf

219
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,000
and showed me
their power of attorney document.

220
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,420
The power of attorney...

221
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,925
- But it's not included in these documents.
- Well...

222
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,262
They said they could only show it
and not give me a copy.

223
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,888
No.

224
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,431
If you don't meet the landlord,

225
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,768
you must receive
their power of attorney document.

226
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,521
Then...

227
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,232
I messed that up too.

228
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,068
Did you sign the lease by yourself?

229
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,489
I grew up in an orphanage.

230
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,701
I barely got that place
with my self-reliance grant.

231
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,370
I didn't have anyone I could ask.

232
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,167
It's okay. This isn't your fault.

233
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,211
These people are the ones
who did something bad.

234
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,879
Yes.

235
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,214
Well, in any case,

236
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,174
it sounds like the realtor

237
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,093
signed off on this contract on their own
and stole the deposit.

238
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,180
I mean, I was living there
and everything was fine.

239
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,017
And then, out of nowhere,
I get an eviction notice.

240
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,102
It's all so overwhelming.

241
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,688
I don't even have anywhere else to go.

242
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,149
It's okay. All right, Yunsu.

243
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,985
You know the location
of this real estate office, right?

244
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,697
BLUE HOUSE REAL ESTATE

245
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,574
That wasn't me.

246
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,452
He used to be one of my employees,

247
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,955
but even I don't know where he is now.

248
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,292
Come on, you tell him.
You know I didn't do it.

249
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,175
Well, even if it wasn't you,
your employee did it.

250
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,803
So you're still legally responsible
as their employer.

251
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,598
I'll take responsibility if I need to.

252
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,099
Go ahead and sue.

253
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,229
Have you worked
with the landlord for a long time?

254
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,022
I heard they own the whole building.

255
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,941
Yes, we worked together for a while.

256
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,319
But due to this, our partnership ended.

257
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,614
Is he someone who'd be willing
to show some understanding?

258
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,409
No way. He's as cold as ice.

259
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,705
Right, that employee you mentioned.

260
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
He apparently showed

261
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,919
Mr. Yunsu a power of attorney.
What was that?

262
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,465
There probably wasn't one.

263
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,307
BLUE HOUSE REAL ESTATE

264
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,150
Why is this only happening to me?

265
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,861
Don't think that way.

266
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,075
I should've looked into it more.
That's on me. I know that.

267
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,413
But everyone else in the building
signed through this agency too.

268
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,083
Everyone else signed just fine
and had no issues.

269
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,294
So why is it just me?

270
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,344
It was just bad luck.

271
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,555
That's all it is.

272
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,372
COMPLAINT
REAL ESTATE REPOSSESSION

273
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,709
LANDLORD
HEO SIWON

274
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,588
DEFENDANT'S CLAIM OF LEASE AGREEMENT

275
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:04,143
All of them went through the same agency,
but they didn't have any problems.

276
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,128
"Article 129."

277
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,963
They said this area

278
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,676
is about to be designated
an industrial park or something,

279
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,886
so the value of the land has shot way up.

280
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,970
Okay?

281
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,889
They wanted to forget and move on,

282
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,393
but when I heard that, I got so fired up!

283
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,353
I couldn't sit still.

284
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,398
- All this used to belong to one person?
- Yes.

285
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,110
The Kwak family took it
and carved it all up for themselves.

286
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,697
Even the government took a piece too.

287
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,700
- What about beyond that stream?
- What?

288
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,702
No, that's not part of it.

289
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,620
We have to hurry.

290
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,747
I'm already 80,

291
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,085
and Han Insu's great-grandchildren
aren't exactly young either.

292
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,504
Why haven't they intervened?

293
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,591
All the elders in their family
passed away early.

294
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,094
They've had hard lives
since they were kids.

295
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,138
They're still on welfare right now.

296
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,931
They're busy trying
to get by each day,

297
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,809
so they can't even dare to do this.

298
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,186
You said they still live here, right?

299
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,939
- The great-grandchildren?
- Yes.

300
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,649
Can we meet them?

301
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,277
There's one.

302
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,362
Hey!

303
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,823
- Hello!
- Hey!

304
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,869
Thank you so much
for coming out here in person.

305
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,620
Come now.

306
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,624
I said you had to go and see it
for yourself to understand,

307
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,835
so what could they do?

308
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,798
I thought if I didn't settle this
before I die,

309
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,841
I'd never be at peace.

310
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,261
Goodness, you need to live a long life.
Don't say that, sir.

311
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,598
If he weren't around in our town,
nothing would get done.

312
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,975
Come on.

313
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,356
Hurry and follow me. We're not done yet.

314
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,442
Take care.

315
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,843
Okay.

316
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,679
Take this with you, okay?

317
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,847
HAN INSU

318
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,225
And...

319
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,810
Let's see.

320
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,937
Here. Okay.

321
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,897
This one too.

322
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,191
Take a look at it, okay?

323
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,984
My goodness.

324
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,737
I'm sure it's here.

325
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,614
Here it is.

326
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,828
This is the complaint I filed
at the town office.

327
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,122
And this was the story
that was in the local newspaper.

328
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,791
Okay? All right.

329
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,253
What do you think we can do with these?

330
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,380
Come now.

331
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,883
You need to figure that out.
I'm not the lawyer here!

332
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,764
But with these,

333
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,350
there's not much we can do.

334
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,435
Goodness.

335
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:39,942
That's why we need you
as the lawyers to handle that.

336
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,370
He wasn't a scammer.

337
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,956
The power of attorney was legit too.

338
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,464
At the end of the day,
this document is the issue.

339
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,554
What are you going to do?

340
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,973
We have to find something.

341
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,776
First, let's review
all the footage we took...

342
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,905
and compare it with the map.

343
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,074
- Okay.
- Let's look closely at the land's shape.

344
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,956
- The shape of the stream...
- Yeah, the boundary lines are here too.

345
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,169
Lot 580...

346
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,379
We need to find it.

347
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:57,311
It's 102,882.7 square meters.

348
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,855
So it's about 25 acres.

349
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,698
Twenty-five...

350
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,368
It doesn't add up?

351
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,452
No.

352
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,537
Damn it.

353
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,040
He was full of nonsense all along.

354
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,630
Either the old man was mistaken or lying.

ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

356
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,735
Hi. What's up?

357
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,029
Hey, Munjeong.

358
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,159
Have you thought about
working in-house again by any chance?

359
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,743
What?

360
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,455
<i>It seemed like you were interested
in my company last time.</i>

361
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,292
Well, there's an opening now,

362
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,795
<i>so I thought of you and called.</i>

363
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,839
Really?

364
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,843
<i>Maybe I read that wrong.</i>

365
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,469
No, not at all.

366
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,306
- Can I think it over and call you back?
<i>- Of course.</i>

367
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,101
My gosh! You're going to get
your legs caught! Be careful!

368
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,394
Sorry about that.

369
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:25,106
Okay. So, the job posting will go up soon.

370
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:29,027
I'll send you the details in advance.
Let me know once you've seen them.

371
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,488
Okay. Thanks, Jeongin.

372
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,340
Attorney Kang.

373
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,177

- Attorney Ha.
- Hi.

392
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,158
You were already here.

393
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,244
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

394
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,466
- Who is it?
- Hello.

395
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,635
- Hello.
- Hello.

396
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,761
Hello.

397
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,015
I'm Attorney Ha Sanggi
with Law Group Hyungmin.

398
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:08,227
We're having some issues
with this building's lease contract,

399
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,021
so we'd like to ask for your help.

400
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,065
- Do you happen to have your contract?
- What about it?

401
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,650
- Could we take a photo?
- No.

402
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,611
- We'd appreciate it.
- Please leave. You can't.

403
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,779
No, just the contract...

404
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,865
- The contract?
- Yes.

405
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,742
There won't be any legal issues.

406
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,786
We only need it as a reference.

407
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,998
- All right, here.
- Thank you.

408
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,042
If you get worried,
you can give me a call.

409
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,501
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

410
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,879
Thank you.

411
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,176
Gosh, which floor is this?

412
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,807
You should've told me
there was no elevator.

413
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,061
STANDARD RENTAL AGREEMENT

414
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,110
POWER OF ATTORNEY

415
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,911
You said you were never given
power of attorney by the landlord.

416
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,371
There wasn't a single unit we checked

417
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,248
that didn't have one.

418
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,044
I didn't say we never had
power of attorney.

419
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,759
I said there probably wasn't one
when this young man signed his lease.

420
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,261
Now, at the time,
we had it.

421
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,681
We received power of attorney
from the landlord

422
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,766
and handled leases on their behalf then.

423
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,435
And then, he told us
that wouldn't happen anymore

424
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,396
and to just handle the brokering.

425
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,106
So we threw all of them out.

426
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,817
Then, you should've also
said that back then.

427
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,194
Come on, you didn't ask
for that much detail.

428
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,905
It's not like I lied.

429
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,369
Then, out of all these leased units,

430
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,248
how many were signed after the landlord
revoked the power of attorney?

431
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,171
Power of attorney...

432
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,261
Just one.

433
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,931
- Just one?
- Just me?

434
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,643
We handled all the leases
on the landlord's behalf up until then.

435
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,938
But once the landlord said
he wanted that to stop,

436
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,189
what were we supposed to do?

437
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,109
That's his call.

438
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,112
And it just so happened
the first lease after the change was his.

439
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,823
That employee acted like
we still had authority to sign leases

440
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,535
and ran off after scamming him.

441
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,297
I guess I really do have rotten luck.

442
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,217
- Of all people, it had to be me.
- No.

443
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:53,059
You actually might've become really lucky.

444
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,186
Yeah.

445
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,150
Wait, how do they not add up?

446
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,985
Did you calculate the numbers right?
Did you?

447
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,948
I mean, you can't even
work out the area properly?

448
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,534
My goodness.

449
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:15,373
Maybe they measured land differently
back in the Japanese occupation days.

450
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,042
I checked, but it wasn't different.

451
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,752
Do you have the original copy?

452
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,337
My goodness.

453
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,507
Let's say this paper's wrong.

454
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:28,803
But everyone in our town
has known for generations

455
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,013
that the land belongs to that family.

456
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:36,102
The only things we could call evidence is
this single sheet of paper and your words.

457
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,729
But even those don't line up.

458
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,982
So you're saying that I'm lying?

459
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,819
Forget it. I'll find someone else.

460
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,987
Why are you going this far?

461
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,034
What do you mean?

462
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,787
You said this wasn't your land.

463
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,498
You really don't gain anything from this?

464
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,254
Do you only do things for your gain?

465
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,049
If I don't do this, who will?

466
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,053
Someone's got to do it,
so that's why I'm doing it.

467
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,181
Forget it. That's all for today.

468
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,392
Thanks for your work.

469
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,287
Wait, so what happened?

470
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,706
The old man just left after that?

471
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,041
Yeah. He probably went
to find another firm.

472
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,295
See? I told you
he seemed off to begin with.

473
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,423
Or he could've been just mistaken.

474
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,886
Let's eat.

475
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,847
Since I'm pregnant,
I'll help myself first.

476
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,944
Did you receive the decision
on your court-appointed case yet?

477
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,448
I did, but it's a murder case.

478
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,034
- What?
- Goodness.

479
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,077
Have you all had murder cases before?

480
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,495
Yeah, I have.

481
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,416
I had one before, but my client
was definitely a bad guy.

482
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,710
Is it a really brutal case?

483
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,961
I'm not sure.

484
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,257
In a way,
it might be the most brutal case,

485
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,509
but it also might be not.

486
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,307
She killed the sibling
she'd taken care of for over 10 years.

487
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,270
Things must've been awful
for her to do that.

488
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,106
Hey, someone died...

489
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,568
I honestly don't know
how I should feel about this case either.

490
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,155
I'm not sure
if I'll ever fully understand my client.

491
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,409
Eat first.

492
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,995
- Eat up.
- Yeah.

493
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,425
When doing court-appointed cases,

494
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,804
there are always ones
that weigh on your mind.

495
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,139
It's normal to feel conflicted.

496
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,725
I thought you'd tell me
not to get emotional

497
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,936
and that it was just work.

498
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,231
Of course, it's better not to.

499
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,483
But you can't help it.

500
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,620
Do you feel bad for the old man?

501
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,417
I guess I wanted to believe him.

502
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,754
I wanted Mr. Park Mansu
to be telling the truth.

503
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,674
Even the part
about doing it out of goodwill.

504
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,260
It's a shame.

505
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,141
Have you noticed
you've changed recently?

506
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:05,854
Thanks to you.

every one of these leases

00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,939
As you can see,
only the date section was left blank

524
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,234
and was later filled in by hand.

525
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,402
This was the case for all of them.

526
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,570
The plaintiff gave

527
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,449
dozens of POA documents stamped
with his seal to the real estate office

528
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,411
and told them to fill in the dates
and use as needed.

529
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,706
Even after ending
their business relationship,

530
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,458
the plaintiff did not take back
the rest of those documents.

531
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,462
So the defendant saw
one of those stamped documents

532
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,967
and believed the realtor
still had power of attorney.

533
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,552
Since the plaintiff
is partly responsible

534
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,178
for the defendant's misunderstanding,

535
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,723
according to Civil Act, Article 129,

536
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,727
the defendant's lease
should be carried out as normal.

537
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,894
Plaintiff's counsel,

538
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,564
is it true the landlord
didn't take back those documents?

539
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,774
He heard the realtor
had destroyed all of them.

540
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,902
So he heard
but didn't personally take them back?

541
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,904
Yes, Your Honor.
That is my understanding.

542
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,407
Here's what we'll do.

543
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,952
I'm issuing a settlement recommendation.

544
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,038
Let's have the plaintiff
withdraw the lawsuit,

545
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:34,418
and I'll send out the official decision
to have the lease agreement carried out.

546
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,589
Counsel, meet with the plaintiff
and try to convince him.

547
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,133
The plaintiff is a victim too.

548
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,093
And so is the defendant.

549
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,637
If the plaintiff played a part
in causing this situation,

550
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,850
then Civil Act Article 129 says
he bears responsibility.

551
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,477
Yes, Your Honor.

552
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,644
- Defense counsel.
- Yes, Your Honor?

553
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,689
You understand that if we go
with a settlement recommendation,

554
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,568
each party will cover
their own legal fees?

555
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,737
- Yes, Your Honor.
- The plaintiff can't be ordered

556
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,989
to pay the defendant's fees.

557
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,492
Are you okay with that?

558
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,162
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Okay.

559
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,624
Then, I'll issue the decision
on the settlement recommendation.

560
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,668
If there are no objections
within two weeks, it'll be finalized.

561
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,753
Thank you, everyone.

562
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,381
Let's move on to the next case.

563
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,195
Attorney Ha.

564
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,074
Thank you.

565
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,577
Thank you so much, Attorney Ha.

566
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,247
You're very lucky. I told you.

567
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,041
You're a very lucky person, Yunsu.

568
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,712
Thank you, Attorney Ha.

569
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,968
Aren't you hungry?
Do you want to go get some food?

570
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,054
Let's go.

571
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,856
Slowly. Okay.

572
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,996
Attorney Ha.

573
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,915
You're so cool.

574
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,250
Sorry?

575
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,003
You took care of everything.

576
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,799
I want to go to college too
and become just like you.

577
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,719
Then, are you studying right now?

578
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,264
Yes, I've been preparing
for the college entrance exam.

579
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,141
But I may have to stop now.

580
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,268
Why?

581
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,313
Well, I need to make money.

582
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,525
I have a younger sibling
who's about to age out of the orphanage.

583
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,819
I'll have to take care of them.

584
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,239
My situation may not allow me to study.

585
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,583
Well...

586
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,003
Even if you can't right now,

587
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,008
don't give up on your dream completely.

588
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,305
These are all cooked.

589
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,522
Thank you.

590
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,658
Can you check if we still have
that scholarship certificate?

591
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,451
Yeah.

592
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,329
No, it's probably with you.

593
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,583
No, there's just someone
I want to connect the scholarship with.

594
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,045
Okay. All right, bye.

595
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,610
- Have you thought it over?
- About what?

596
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,028
Joining the company.

597
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,114
I'm not doing it. It's not for me.

598
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,573
And being a lawyer is?

599
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,118
Even if I quit law,
I'm not going into business.

600
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,496
If I'd been interested,
I would've joined from the start.

601
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,709
It's not like I got into business
because I loved it.

602
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,086
You're drawn to
what suits you as you go.

603
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,755
I didn't start law
because I loved it either.

604
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,717
But I'll figure out what suits me as I go.

605
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,010
You stubborn kid.

606
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,054
You get that from me, you know.

607
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,680
I know.

608
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,641
That's why you'd do well in business.

609
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,727
For goodness' sake.

610
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,730
- I have plans too.
- What plans?

611
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,231
Just wait.

612
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,900
I have something I'm working on.

613
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,449
MATERIALS TO PREPARE FOR PROSECUTOR EXAM

614
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,709
<i>What about beyond that stream?</i>

615
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,378
No, that's not part of it.

616
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,053
<i>He was full of nonsense all along.</i>

617
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,972
<i>Either the old man was mistaken or lying.</i>

618
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,225
If he wasn't around in our town,
nothing would get done.

619
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,520
Come on.

620
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,233
Do you feel bad for the old man?

621
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,862
<i>I wanted Mr. Park Mansu
to be telling the truth.</i>

622
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,739
<i>Even the part
about doing it out of goodwill.</i>

623
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,826
Do you only do things for your gain?

624
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,829
If I don't do this, who will?

625
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,125
Someone's got to do it,
so that's why I'm doing it.

626
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,761
<i>It looked like a document
from the National Archives.</i>

627
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,763
As if you've ever been there before.

628
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,389
- Have you?
- Of course, I have.

629
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,644
I once had a case
involving a national honoree.

630
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,866
We can access
the National Archives these days, right?

631
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,118
What?

632
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,202
LOCATION NAME SEARCH

633
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,206
"580 Dongjan-ri."

634
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,873
Here.

635
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,752
- Click on the one that says "Han Insu."
- Okay.

636
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,715
Let's pull everything
with the name "Han Insu" on it.

637
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,468
Yeah, okay.

638
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,806
Back then, Lot 580 was
one large piece of land.

639
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,184
But it looks different
from how Mr. Park described it.

640
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,789
- This part?
- Right?

641
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,093
I'll print out
land registers for these areas.

642
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,060
Eighty-four...

643
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,649
Three-hundred eighty-four...

644
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,655
One hundred and thirty...

645
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,752
That's 130,757.1.

646
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,503
And in acres...

647
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:19,258
That adds up to around 32 acres.

648
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,051
Here.

649
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:25,348
That's around 32 acres.

650
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,767
Mr. Park was right.

651
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,105
Gosh.

652
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,768
Hello.

653
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,480
I'm Attorney Kang Huiji,
your court-appointed lawyer.

654
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:18,943
Hello.

655
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,450
Life in detention
is pretty tough, isn't it?

656
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,622
I don't need a lawyer.

657
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,126
I didn't even request a public defender.

658
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,378
Who called you here?

659
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,879
Ms. Jeong,

660
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,841
you fell under mandatory appointment.

661
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,050
Even if you didn't apply,

662
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,430
you were eligible to have the court
assign you an attorney.

663
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,934
Then,

664
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,104
just do whatever you have to do and go.

665
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,565
Don't worry about me.

666
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,400
My job

667
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,736
is to hear your side of the story.

668
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,822
It's to find out what happened and why.

669
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,242
Hearing it won't change anything.

670
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,913
I killed Myeongjae...

671
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,167
and I'll just take the punishment.

672
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,170
Then, it'll be hard for the court
to understand your situation.

673
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,839
I killed someone.

674
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,217
What's there to understand?

675
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:32,391
I don't want to be understood,
and I don't want to be forgiven either.

676
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,398
- Just leave.
- I'm not here to understand you

677
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,693
nor do I have the right to forgive you.

678
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,906
Like you said, you'll be punished
no matter what your reasons are.

679
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,743
Yes.

680
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,703
Exactly.

681
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,956
So make sure I get punished.

682
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,629
If you have nothing else to say,

683
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,215
may I go now?

684
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>I killed my brother.</i>

685
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,294
<i>I'm the one who killed him.</i>

686
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,672
<i>And I'll receive punishment.</i>

687
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,555
LATE-ONSET DEMENTIA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

688
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,182
DATE OF DIAGNOSIS
JUNE 7, 2015

689
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:03,356
PHOTO OF CRIME SCENE

690
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,817
Yes?

691
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,239
Attorney Kang,
Ms. Jeong Sunja's children are here.

692
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,741
Her children?

693
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,622
Are you Ms. Jeong Sunja's son
and daughter?

694
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,708
Yes.

695
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,835
What's going to happen to her?

696
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,713
She'll be going to trial soon.

697
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,756
But she hasn't told me anything yet,

698
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,510
so it's been difficult
to prepare her defense.

699
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,389
How did she end up
living with her brother?

700
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,058
I didn't know she had any children.

701
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,273
Well...

702
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,358
Our mom was the only family
our uncle had left.

703
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,112
So she lived with him to take care of him.

704
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,034
Then, did you two visit often?

705
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,745
No.

706
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,164
We didn't think it was something
we had to be involved in.

707
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,126
How did Ms. Jeong manage financially?

708
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,129
She likely had her pension

709
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,257
and some caregiver support benefits.

710
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,051
Did either of you
provide any financial help?

711
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,345
No, we...

712
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,889
We couldn't afford to do that.

713
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,892
Can she get out?

714
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,191
It's a murder charge.

715
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,277
It's not an easy situation to get out of.

716
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,614
Gosh, Uncle Myeongjae...

717
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,700
Would it...

718
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,162
be okay if I visited where they stayed?

719
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,082
- Hello?
<i>- Why did you call?</i>

720
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,458
I have something to tell you.

721
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,418
I wanted to ask if you could stop by.

722
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,630
<i>Why call me in
if you won't take the case?</i>

723
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,883
<i>I'm not going!
I'm busy looking for someone else.</i>

724
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:56,762
We never said that.
We just said there wasn't enough evidence.

725
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,391
Please come by.
It's something worth hearing.

726
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,770
How about later at 5:00 p.m.?

727
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,273
<i>We'll see if I have the time.</i>

728
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,191
I'll see you later.

729
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,709
You can go in.

730
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,085
You're not coming in with me?

731
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,169
No.

732
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,464
We don't really feel like going in.

733
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,259
Call us when you're done.

734
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:20,596
ORAL MEDICATION

735
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,107
MEDICAL RECEIPT

736
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,863
<i>Tuesday, December 31st.</i>

737
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,616
<i>No response at all.</i>

738
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,284
<i>My chest felt heavy.</i>

739
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,244
<i>His breathing grew shallow and rough.</i>

740
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,371
<i>December 27th.</i>

741
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,539
<i>He opened his eyes,
but they were glazed over.</i>

742
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,291
<i>There was no reaction to my voice.</i>

743
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,170
<i>I wish I could live
just one day longer than Myeongjae.</i>

744
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,672
<i>December 25th.</i>

745
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,423
<i>I called his name in the morning.</i>

746
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,009
<i>He blinked and turned his head slightly.</i>

747
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,221
<i>His eyes were clear for just a moment.</i>

748
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,722
<i>He had a bit of porridge,</i>

749
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,559
<i>and then slept a long time,
as if all his strength was gone.</i>

750
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,852
<i>December 28th.</i>

751
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,022
<i>He twitched slightly when I held his hand.</i>

752
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,775
<i>His face looked peaceful,
and I felt more at ease.</i>

753
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:16,901
<i>December 30th.</i>

754
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,195
<i>I held his hand,
but there was no strength at all.</i>

755
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,446
<i>I just kept the IV in.</i>

756
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,908
<i>What am I hoping for
in trying to keep Myeongjae alive?</i>

757
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:28,080
<i>Does he even want to live this way?</i>

758
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,333
<i>December 29th.</i>

759
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,793
<i>No response at all.</i>

760
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,921
<i>He can barely swallow.</i>

761
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,759
<i>No one's willing to hear me out.</i>

762
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,888
<i>No one cares.</i>

763
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,192
DEMENTIA CARE CENTER

764
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,531
Ms. Jeong Sunja?

765
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:08,912
She didn't quite meet the criteria,
so we could only offer minimal support.

766
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:13,167
She had children, so that made it hard
to qualify for other programs.

767
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,170
But from what I heard,
her kids were indifferent.

768
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,174
If you knew that,
you could've given her support.

769
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,509
We have to follow the guidelines.

770
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,970
If we could, we'd give all our help.

771
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,931
Then, how did she manage to get by?

772
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,601
I heard she had some insurance payouts

773
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,563
to cover her living expenses
and his medical bills.

774
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,274
- Insurance payouts?
- Yes.

775
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,443
She apparently had cancer insurance.

776
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,572
But she was never able to use it
for her own treatment.

777
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,450
I heard it was terminal cancer.

778
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,044
Thank you.

779
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,090
You're in a good mood.

780
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,009
So are you.

781
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,639
Mr. Park must be the one feeling good.
It turns out he was right.

782
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,601
What if he really doesn't come
because he's upset?

783
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,853
You could've just told him
we figured it out.

784
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,815
Well, I was going to tell him in person.

785
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,413
You're not going to
say anything again today?

786
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,300
Then, I'll talk.

787
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,761
Ms. Jeong,

788
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,057
you had to take care of your brother
since he had no one else.

789
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,769
You didn't want your kids

790
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,147
to feel burdened by their uncle.

791
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,317
That's why you couldn't ask for help.

792
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,487
Instead, you asked the state for help.

793
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,741
But you always fell
slightly out of criteria,

794
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,537
so all you could receive in support
was the bare minimum.

795
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,373
That went on for 10 years.

796
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,334
And you must've gradually become scared.

797
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:25,132
You were worried you might die
before your brother.

798
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,721
Then, you found out you had cancer.

799
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,227
How do you...

800
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,565
know all of this?

801
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,696
I want to hear your story,
Ms. Jeong.

802
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,203
No one...

803
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,710
Literally, no one would listen to me.

804
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,464
All I could do was endure.

805
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,050
I didn't have a choice.

806
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,261
I couldn't die first.

807
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,139
Do you know

808
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,019
what my first thought was...

809
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,483
when I learned I had terminal cancer?

810
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,864
"At least the insurance will pay out."

811
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,785
I thought

812
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,746
maybe things would be okay for now.

813
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,165
I felt relieved.

814
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,089
It meant I could've died first.

815
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,840
But my goodness,

816
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,510
I actually felt relieved.

817
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,971
I prayed every day

818
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,685
to live just one day longer
than Myeongjae.

819
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:05,815
But I couldn't leave it
to the heavens anymore.

820
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:10,570
They wanted to take me first.

821
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,616
Is that why you felt
you had no other choice?

822
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:19,538
I don't want to say I had no choice.

823
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,795
How can I say

824
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,299
I had no choice but to kill someone?

825
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,094
But that's the story
behind what led you here.

826
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,763
You need to explain that in court.

827
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,809
In any case,

828
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,311
I'm going to die soon.

829
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,568
There's no need to ask
for a lighter sentence.

830
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,531
My brother...

831
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,749
I killed him with my own hands.

832
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,463
How could I dare ask for forgiveness?
What right do I have?

833
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:19,639
Then, only take the punishment
for what you deserve.

834
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:24,770
Not every crime gets the same sentence.

835
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,232
You'll be punished
based on your own actions.

836
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,235
And it's my job to explain that.

837
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,158
Please let me do my job.

838
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:04,518
<i>The number you have dialed
is not available. Please leave...</i>

839
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,828
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

840
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,039
PARK MANSU

841
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:42,513
And so, we conclude the defendant caused
the death of the victim by asphyxiation

842
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,891
and committed murder.

843
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,060
Okay, Counsel.

844
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,189
Please state your position on the charges.

845
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,608
The defendant admits to all charges
and accepts all evidence.

846
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:58,238
Okay. We will review the evidence now.

847
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:21,427
We've concluded the evidence review.

848
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,972
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

849
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,352
We request a sentence
of 10 years in prison.

850
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,649
Counsel, present your statement.

851
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,910
I believe taking a life

852
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,371
is something
that can never be truly forgiven.

853
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,998
The defendant understood that as well

854
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,791
and turned herself in
right after her crime.

855
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,462
She has consistently
admitted responsibility from the start.

856
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,299
She was the victim's sole caregiver.

857
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,134
Mr. Jeong suffered from severe dementia,

858
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:05,138
and Ms. Jeong cared for him
for over 10 years.

859
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,060
Receiving practically no support
from either her family or society,

860
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,563
she had to handle both the caregiving
and financial burden.

861
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,651
In the midst of all that...

862
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,366
Ms. Jeong was recently diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

863
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,422
Ms. Jeong couldn't bear
the possibility of dying

864
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,051
even a day before her brother.

865
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,638
Ms. Jeong is not asking for leniency.

866
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,267
She just wants to take responsibility
for the crime she committed.

867
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,564
But this crime happened
in the context of fractured caregiving,

868
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,776
continuous isolation,
and prolonged exhaustion.

869
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,364
So I ask, Your Honor,

870
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,160
that you take into account her remorse,
the circumstances that led to this act,

871
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,957
and her current health condition
in your judgment.

872
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,054
Mom, why...

873
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,938
God, no...

874
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,248
Are you skipping meals?

875
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,877
I eat too well,
so don't worry, okay?

876
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,796
I almost forgot. Mom.

877
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,550
You didn't forget
your health checkup appointment, right?

878
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:09,763
- I told you I don't need to get one.
- I told you to get checked.

879
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,768
Right. I found what you asked for.

880
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,729
It was tucked in the back of the wardrobe.

881
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,857
The scholarship certificate?
Mom, do it after dinner.

882
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,942
Geez, why is she like that?

883
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,919
We sure got a lot of help
from a bunch of different places.

884
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,216
I got this one in college.

885
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,427
This one too.

886
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,347
Yeah, these are all from college.

887
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,266
CERTIFICATE OF SCHOLARSHIP

888
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,226
I got this one in law school.

889
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,561
It's when we got support
for living expenses.

890
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,772
It was called
the Dandelion Scholarship Foundation.

891
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:02,857
Right?

892
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,907
DANDELION SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION
CHAIRMAN KIM HYUNGMIN

893
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,997
- What?
- It's nothing.

894
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,667
Let's eat. Eat up, Mom.

895
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,598
Hello.

896
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,061
- Hello, good morning.
- Attorney Cho.

897
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,064
Mr. Seong wanted to see you
in his office when you arrived.

898
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,275
Okay.

899
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,655
Come in.

900
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,908
- Mr. Seong, did you ask for me?
- Yeah.

901
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,661
You know Mr. Jang Sugil well, right?

902
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,163
It's been a long time.

903
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:04,543
Hello.

904
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:05,962
Well, have a seat.

905
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,090
Director Jang's here to assign you a case.

906
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:14,596
Well, I drank just a tiny bit
and had a little accident while driving.

907
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:16,806
Help me out, okay?

908
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,975
You're my go-to lawyer.

909
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,155
- Hello, Attorney Ha.
- Hello, sir.

910
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,908
Hold on!

911
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,035
Just a second.

912
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,371
Attorney Ha. Just getting in?

913
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,207
Yes, hello.

914
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,503
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

915
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,894
He just bumped into someone.

916
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,396
It wasn't even a big accident.
It should be an easy case.

917
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,065
You're telling me to take it, right?

918
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,483
Of course. Who else?

919
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,903
Director Jang came here
specifically to hire you.

920
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,826
I won't take it, sir.

921
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,038
- What?
- I don't want to take it.

922
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,291
What do you mean?
You want me to do it then?

923
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,087
Well, you could take it
or tell him to go find someone else.

924
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,673
That's up to you, sir.

925
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,678
You're talking like you run the place.

926
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,304
If this keeps up, I can't work with you.

927
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,515
Yes, because we won't have to anymore.

928
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,851
I quit. Find yourself another associate.

929
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:07,750
Come in.

930
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,297
- You're here early.
- Yeah.

931
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,133
- Well...
- Mr. Park Mansu.

932
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,467
He's still not answering, right?

933
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,429
I've called him multiple times too.

934
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,392
Should we drop by later after work?

935
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:27,687
Sure.

936
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,358
PARK MANSU

937
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,072
Hello?

938
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,207
Where was it?

939
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:59,070
Law and The City

940
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:33,228
Law and The City

941
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,774
- What is this all of a sudden?
- Exactly what I just said.

942
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,276
Is this law firm a joke to you?

943
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,986
I just touched her.

944
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,614
- Excuse me?
- It wasn't an accident. I touched her.

945
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,742
I want to give it another shot.

946
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,953
Okay, good job!

947
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,748
I liked you, Attorney Ha.

948
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:55,333
<i>-We're being audited.
- We're dealing with a mess right now.</i>

949
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,794
- We didn't do anything wrong--
- What's your purpose?

950
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,046
What was your purpose in merging?

951
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,883
No matter what I say
to try to convince you...

952
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,760
you won't change your mind, right?

953
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,679
<i>I'd like to try it my own way now.</i>

954
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,807
<i>Actually, there's something
I wasn't able to say earlier too.</i>

955
