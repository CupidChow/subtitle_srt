00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,483
CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY

4
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,956
You haven't eaten yet, right?

5
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,417
Hey, bring some food over here too!

6
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,502
Okay.

7
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,506
Did he have any health issues?

8
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,675
No.

9
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,343
He was always in great health.

10
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,513
I never thought he'd pass
so suddenly like this.

11
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,729
Please eat.

12
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,774
He seems to have a big family.

13
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,819
No, they're all his neighbors.

14
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,904
He has one son, but he's in the US.

15
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:58,201
So everyone's eager to stand in
as the chief mourner until he gets here.

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,786
So the townspeople prepared all of this?

17
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,913
Yes.

18
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,460
There's not a single person in this town
who didn't get help from Mr. Park.

19
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,463
Even if it weren't his problem,

20
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,883
he'd diligently go around and make sure
everyone was taken care of.

21
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,469
If it weren't for Mr. Park,

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,513
I wouldn't have even thought of
getting our family's land back.

23
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,267
I don't even know
where the land starts and ends.

24
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,146
The land that was taken
is even bigger than what you thought.

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,439
What?

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,735
We found a land register
from the Japanese occupation period.

27
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,112
Everything past the stream
was owned by Han Insu

28
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,617
- Even that part beyond it was ours?
- Yes.

29
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,911
But what does it matter now?

30
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,874
Mr. Park is gone now,
and there's no one left to fight for it.

31
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,251
Enjoy your food before you go.

32
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,423
And thank you
for hearing Mr. Park out.

33
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,518
He must've been a really good person.

34
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,568
I quit. Find yourself another associate.

35
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,328
What do you think you're doing?

36
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,289
Exactly what I just said.

37
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,751
Fine. Don't take Jang Sugil's case.

38
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,837
No, sir.

39
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,756
This isn't just about this one case.

40
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,009
I've thought about it for a long time.

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,804
I...

42
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,015
can't keep working here anymore.

43
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,188
What is this all of a sudden?

44
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,692
Is this law firm a joke to you?

45
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,244
Goodness.

46
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,580
You can't just do this all of a sudden.

47
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,874
Resignations must have a period of notice.

48
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,960
We need to hire a replacement,
handover duties, and follow protocol--

49
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,088
Did you follow that protocol
when you hired me?

50
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,049
You didn't even give me a proper contract.

51
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,845
So that's what you were upset about.
Goodness.

52
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,431
Okay, let's talk this out like lawyers.

53
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,558
Here, have a seat.

54
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,400
All right, then.

55
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,736
Stay until we hire someone new.
Just until then.

56
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,155
I don't want to.

57
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,448
Well...

58
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,160
So you do have a backbone, Attorney Cho.

59
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,745
Fine. Then...

60
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,416
Just give me 10 days.

61
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,381
- One week.
- Okay, one week. Thanks.

62
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,550
Okay.

63
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,827

67
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,157
You must've had a rough time, Attorney Ha.

68
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,337
<i>I don't think
Ms. Kim gave you the case</i>

69
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,465
<i>just to use extenuating circumstances
and reduce his sentence.</i>

70
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,468
It's a student from her foundation,
so she's more invested.

71
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>- Are you joining us today?
- I'd like to take the class as well.</i>

72
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,390
Is that okay?

73
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,892
Are you going to apply
for the PhD?

74
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,394
This? No, it's nothing.

75
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,313
I say go for it.
I'm very much for it.

76
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,107
Professor, you got this!

77
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,784
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN
ADVISOR KIM HYUNGMIN

78
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,162
Come in.

79
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,671
- Attorney Ha.
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

80
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,132
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

81
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,844
What brings you here?

82
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,558
So...

83
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,852
The foundation

84
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,437
that you oversee...

85
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,649
It's the Dandelion Scholarship Foundation, right?

86
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,902
Yes, that's right.

87
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,112
Where did you hear that from?

88
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,662
It seems you didn't hear it in passing.

89
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,339
Thanks to you,

90
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,548
I was able to graduate from law school

91
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,760
without needing to take a single break.

92
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,886
It was the first time in my life

93
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,349
where I could focus on studying
and not worry about anything else.

94
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,393
Thank you so much.

95
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,271
If it wasn't for your support,

96
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,691
I couldn't have even dreamed of this.

97
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,820
I didn't realize you were so close.
I'm sorry it took so long to thank you.

98
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,322
I'm truly grateful.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,086
Gosh, please sit.

100
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,177
Just seeing you doing well
made me the grateful one.

101
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,431
- You knew all along?
- Of course.

102
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,477
I was so happy when I heard
you worked at a firm in our building.

103
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,229
Then, you should've told me.

104
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,189
Tell you for what?

105
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,650
I'm someone you didn't need to know.

106
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,028
Gosh.

107
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,824
I thought I always had in mind
all the people who had helped me,

108
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,576
but not being able to
recognize you like this...

109
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,454
I'm ashamed.
There's so much I need to repay.

110
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,622
You don't owe me a thing.

111
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,711
Just keep doing well like you are now.
That's how you repay me.

112
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,262
Goodness. By the way,

113
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,515
just like you once did for me,

114
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,435
I've found someone I want to help out.

115
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,146
He grew up in an orphanage,

116
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,399
and I want to financially support him,
so he can go to college.

117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,151
But I don't want him
to know it's from me,

118
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,905
so I'd like to do it
through your foundation.

119
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,281
So you have someone in mind?

120
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,825
Then, our foundation
will take care of the funds.

121
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,994
No, I want to do that.

122
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:44,209
And well...
I have a bit of money now, Ms. Kim.

123
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,797
Honestly,

124
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,510
I didn't know why I was so persistent
in saving money all this time.

125
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,097
But I want to put it to good use.

126
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,478
All right. Let's do that.

127
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,234
Goodness.

128
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,861
It's hot in here.

129
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,116
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

130
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,804
Let's just drop that case.

131
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,888
I looked over the land documents,

132
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,224
and if we go through everything,

133
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,395
just the filing and delivery fees alone
would cost tens of millions of won.

134
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,522
So things actually worked out.

135
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,234
Even though Mr. Park is gone,

136
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,735
the clients are all still here.

137
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,655
We're fully capable of handling it.

138
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,950
But didn't you say there could be tons
of plaintiffs and defendants?

139
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,577
It'll get out of hand and drag on.

140
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,746
It'll probably take years to see through.

141
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,914
We never should've taken it on.

142
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,917
- Just let it go.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,713
I figured you'd say that.

144
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,449
Do you only do things for your gain?

145
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,743
If I don't do this, who will?

146
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,622
Someone's got to do it,
so that's why I'm doing it.

147
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>Since the burden of proof
lies with the plaintiff,</i>

148
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,342
and because she has not provided...

149
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,969
evidence to overcome this...

150
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,513
we request the court
to dismiss this claim.

151
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,142
<i>You were never bothered
by this kind of stuff.</i>

152
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,645
<i>It had always bothered me.</i>

153
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,022
<i>I just got used to the discomfort.</i>

154
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,364
Attorney Ahn, should I clear out
the maps in the meeting room?

155
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,451
Don't throw them out.
Bring them to my office.

156
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,536
Okay, sir.

157
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,247
Also...

158
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,833
could you bring me the files
on Shin Jihye from the Deus GA case?

159
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,001
Okay.

160
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,671
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

161
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:44,055
DEFENDANT
JEONG SUNJA

162
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,275
Let's go.

163
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,321
<i>We'll begin with the case ruling.</i>

164
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,950
Criminal case number 2025-7430.

165
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,244
The charge of murder.

166
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,330
Defendant Jeong Sunja.

167
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,983
We will now deliver the ruling.

168
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,027
The verdict.

169
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,154
Defendant, Jeong Sunja,

170
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,948
is sentenced to three years in prison.

171
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,370
COUNSEL'S SEAT, DEFENDANT'S SEAT

172
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,375
However,

173
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,045
this sentence will be suspended

174
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:02,008
for five years
from the date of this ruling.

175
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,232
Thank you...

176
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,486
for listening to me,

177
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,237
Attorney Kang.

178
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:54,811
Episode 12
See You in Seocho-dong

179
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,159
I've decided to quit my firm.

180
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,541
I applied to become a prosecutor.

181
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,252
I'm going to start studying for the exam.

182
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,294
- Prosecutor?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,673
You used to hate prosecutors.
Why all of a sudden?

184
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,550
That's exactly the reason why.

185
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,886
I'll become the type of prosecutor
I don't hate.

186
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,304
When did you start thinking about this?

187
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,515
It hasn't been that long.

188
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,310
But once the thought hit me,
I couldn't do this job anymore.

189
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,897
You'll do great. It suits you.

190
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,316
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.

191
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,321
You guys have nothing to say?

192
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,906
Well? Are you upset?

193
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,325
"Prosecutor Cho Changwon"
doesn't really thrill me.

194
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,618
Exactly.

195
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,620
He'd be a pain to deal with in court.

196
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,040
But your boss
didn't say anything about this?

197
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,960
He gave me so much flak when I quit.

198
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,338
So what if he does?
It's my decision to leave.

199
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,757
So when are you staying until?

200
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,178
Until this week.

201
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,388
That soon?

202
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,472
Yeah.

203
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,600
It just worked out that way.

204
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,394
I applied for a PhD program.

205
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,937
You finally went for it?

206
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,315
- Yeah.
- Wait...

207
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,193
- So you had wanted to be a professor?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,739
You taught the interns with such effort.
I guess it suited you.

209
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,370
- Then, what about work?
- Yeah. I don't think I can stay.

210
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,499
You're quitting too?

211
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,919
Well, my professor said

212
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,341
if I studied and worked at the same time,
I wouldn't be selected.

213
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,845
I have an interview tomorrow.

214
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,766
- What interview?
- It's for an in-house counsel opening.

215
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,476
If I get it, I'll switch jobs.

216
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,604
When I think about having a kid,

217
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,273
I don't think I can keep working here.

218
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,944
So they didn't allow
the maternity leave after all?

219
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,904
Well, that too.

220
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,113
But even after I have the baby,

221
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,784
the benefits as in-house counsel
are way better.

222
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,285
There would be way less overtime too.

223
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,121
But you struggled with corporate life.

224
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,706
That's why you came here.

225
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,751
Better me than the baby.

226
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,586
But I heard it's super competitive.

227
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,006
So if I don't get it,
I can't leave even if I wanted to.

228
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,760
I'd just have to quit then.

229
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,934
Goodness.

230
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,436
This won't do.

231
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,021
Ma'am, could we get
a bottle of soju, please?

232
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,232
Okay.

233
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,492
I guess everyone had
a lot on their minds.

234
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,502
Actually, there's something
I wasn't able to say earlier too.

235
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,921
What is it?

236
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:14,510
I've been thinking about
becoming a public defender.

237
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,887
A public defender?

238
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,267
I had a thought cross my mind
while working on Jeong Sunja's case.

239
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,811
If no one had listened to her,

240
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,356
she might have received
a much harsher sentence.

241
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,858
Without a court-appointed counsel,

242
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,444
she would've had no chance
to tell her story to anyone.

243
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,489
Not everyone will be like her
in court-appointed cases though.

244
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,243
There are plenty of shameless
and violent criminals too.

245
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,913
I know. I'm sure there are.

246
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,710
But I want to help people
like Jeong Sunja,

247
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,756
and the only way to do that
is to be a public defender.

248
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,636
It might be a lot harder than you think.

249
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,266
You become emotionally invested
in your clients.

250
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,437
And you'd do the same
for even the unforgivable ones.

251
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,528
I just worry it'll be too hard on you.

252
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,251
Actually, I have something to say too.

253

2025 IN-HOUSE COUNSEL INTERVIEW NOTICE

254
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,374
- Ms. Bae Munjeong?
- Yes.

255
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,626
- Come this way, please.
- Okay.

256
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,713
RESUME

257
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,049
You've worked in the public sector

258
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,677
and also spent a few years
at a private company.

259
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,263
You've done litigation too.

260
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,142
- Yes, that's correct.
- What made you go into litigation?

261
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,815
I wanted to meet clients in person
and gain experience in trials.

262
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,445
Then, why do you want to become
an in-house counsel?

263
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,865
After doing litigation,

264
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,368
I think corporate work suits me best.

265
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,912
I want to give it another shot.

266
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,333
Law Group Hyungmin.

267
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,295
It looks like it wasn't a big firm.

268
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,130
That must've been very tough.

269
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,592
You would've had to deal
with every person directly.

270
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,387
Excuse me for being late.

271
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,724
I'm Attorney Bae Munjeong
with Law Group Hyungmin.

272
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,603
Attorney Bae,
please do what you can for her.

273
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,940
Let's get that joy back.

274
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,611
I'm sure dealing
with a lot of people can be difficult.

275
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,363
Yes, it can.

276
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,990
You won't have that here.

277
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,408
There's no work outside the office,

278
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,953
and you won't always
have to do new things.

279
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,417
<i>You just need to stick to a routine
and get along with everyone here.</i>

280
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,338
Okay. That sounds great.

281
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,340
We're looking for

282
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,842
someone who will stay long-term.

283
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,596
Yes, I'm looking for a place
where I can stay long-term too.

284
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,477
That sounds great.

285
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,524
Do you have any final thoughts
you'd like to share?

286
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,350
No.

287
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,727
I don't think you'll need to get in touch.

288
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,479
- Sorry?
- The truth is,

289
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,106
I actually like litigation.

290
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:42,319
I like meeting people and going to trials.

291
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,948
And I love taking on new cases every time.

292
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,202
I think that kind of work
matters to me more.

293
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,124
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

294
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,834
Wait...

295
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,846
What?

296
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,268
How did it go?

297
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,229
- How did what go?
- Your interview.

298
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,572
I'm not taking the job.

299
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,494
I said I'm not taking the job.

300
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,291
You're not, right?

301
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,087
Okay, good job!

302
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,422
Why are you so happy?
You didn't want me to take the job?

303
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,259
No, because it wasn't
the type of work you wanted to do.

304
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,306
That's right.

305
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,225
Did I do a good job?

306
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,852
Yeah, you did a really great job.

307
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,313
You did an amazing job.

308
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
Let's eat.

309
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,901
- I want some water.
- Sure.

310
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,915
Here's your water.

311
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,629

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,841

Why are you crying? Let's eat.

00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,581
<i>I've already forgotten
how hard the first one was.</i>

351
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,666
<i>I can't believe I'm planning for a second.</i>

352
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,793
Luckily, the results are good.

353
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,879
We'll be doing egg retrieval in two weeks.

354
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,505
<i>I'm worried I won't find a place</i>

355
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,718
<i>where I can work for just a year
before my first child enters school.</i>

356
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,261
<i>But I'm sure things will work out.</i>

357
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,224
<i>By any chance, are there any lawyers here
looking for a parental leave temp?</i>

358
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,643
SEND A NOTE

359
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,313
<i>Hello, I'm an associate attorney
about to go on maternity leave,</i>

360
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,317
<i>and I'm currently looking
for a temp to cover my position.</i>

361
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,782
You must be Mr. Kwon Gukjin.

362
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,451
Yes, I am.

363
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,204
You don't have to be too nervous.
What brings you in today?

364
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,792
One of our new employees

365
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,504
reported me for sexual harassment.

366
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,801
Could you explain the situation?

367
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,889
Well, we had a welcome dinner

368
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,098
for the new hire.

369
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,062
And somehow,
she ended up sitting next to me.

370
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,897
But...

371
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:58,028
she's saying I touched her thigh
under the table and reported me.

372
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,866
Did you accidentally
touch her thigh by any chance?

373
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,494
No, I didn't accidentally touch her.

374
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,499
PLAINTIFF SUFFERED HUMILIATION
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS

375
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,042
REQUESTS PUNISHMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT

376
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,336
I just touched her.

377
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
Excuse me?

378
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,842
It wasn't an accident. I touched her.

379
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,059
Then, are you admitting to the charges?

380
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,853
Yes. It's true that I did it.

381
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,860
Then,

382
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,406
you must be seeking a lighter punishment.

383
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,494
Is this your first offense?

384
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,788
By that, do you mean

385
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,916
the first time I've ever touched someone,

386
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,420
or the first time
I've been caught and punished?

387
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,215
I've never been caught or punished before.

388
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,803
There's no CCTV there,
and it was under the table,

389
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,264
so no one could've seen it.

390
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,517
I'm hoping I can get off this time too.

391
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,269
It'll be possible, right?

392
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,857
I've never been caught before,
but it'd be weird

393
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,692
if it were to happen this time.

394
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,461
PRESIDENT KIM

395
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,216
Hello?

396
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,814
You just happened
to be passing by my office again?

397
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,275
Yeah, that's right.

398
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,111
You showed up right on time.

399
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,073
For what?

400
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,493
It's nothing.

401
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,954
What is it? Tell me.

402
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,127
What? Is something on your mind?

403
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,010
Well, there's something
called a public defender.

404
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,596
They're appointed by the court

405
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,725
They only handle court-appointed cases
for people who can't afford a lawyer.

406
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,687
Hey, I know what they are.

407
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,941
Are you thinking of doing it?

408
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah.

409
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,154
But I'm wondering
if I'm just thinking too idealistically.

410
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,492
Do you have to do it?

411
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,829
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Why not?

412
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,875
I don't like the idea of you
dealing with troubled people all the time.

413
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,964
There could also be people like you
who are falsely accused.

414
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,758
Sure, maybe.

415
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,554
Maybe I'm just being selfish,

416
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,056
but I don't want you to do it.

417
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,810
You feel that way too?

418
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,397
Was there someone else
who said the same thing?

419
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,192
Yeah.

420
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,045
- Attorney Cho, I'm coming in.
- Yes, come in.

421
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,258
My goodness.

422
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,718
Wait, what's all this?

423
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,929
Mr. Seong wanted you to write up briefs
for each of these cases.

424
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,266
- All of these?
- Yes.

425
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,687
Okay, I understand.

426
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,327
Did you get the cases?
You can do them, right?

427
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,580
- There's still plenty of time.
- Yes, I can do them.

428
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,709
You sure do have a backbone, Attorney Cho.

429
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,378
- Can you check these?
- Sure.

430
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,634
Also, about the unjust enrichment part...

431
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,766
Come in.

432
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,645
Let's settle this today.

433
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,607
Either I leave or you follow the law.

434
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,317
What's that?

435
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:52,155
Resumes of temps
you didn't even bother looking for.

436
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,033
I've done this a few times before and--

437
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,703
Done what?
Everyone probably left on their own.

438
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,331
But I'm not leaving.
No, I refuse to.

439
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,124
It's my right. Why should I leave?

440
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,710
But realistically...

441
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,171
Realistically,
you can take your pick from here.

442
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:13,969
These folks are ready to take my place
per the labor law. That should do, right?

443
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,054
I'll get going then.

444
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,145
What is wrong with her?

445
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,898
COMPLAINT

446
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,318
DEFENDANT
KWON GUKJIN

447
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,953
<i>I'm hoping I can get off.</i>

448
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,290
I've never been caught before,
but it'd be weird

449
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,625
if it were to happen this time.

450
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,672
DEFENDANT
JEONG SUNJA

451
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,799
Thank you...

452
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,219
for listening to me,

453
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,971
Attorney Kang.

454
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,117
Let's start again by discussing

455
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,952
your admission of the charges.

456
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,668
Come in.

457
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,795
Yes, Attorney Ha?

458
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,049
Ma'am, do you have any plans tonight?

459
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,343
No. Why?

460
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,639
If you're free, would you
like to have dinner with me?

461
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,059
Sure.

462
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,685
Okay, I'll grab my things
and be right out.

463
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,853
- Okay.
- All right.

464
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,230
Okay.

465
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,863
- Try this too.
- Okay.

466
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,240
- They say it's good.
- You too.

467
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,996
It's really good.

468
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,749
But...

469
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,085
why did you suddenly ask to eat dinner?

470
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,046
I didn't expect
you'd suggest a place like this.

471
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,383
Well, it's been a while
since we had a meal together.

472
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,053
And I've never treated you before either.

473
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,805
So does that mean

474
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,891
- you're paying for this?
- Of course.

475
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,731
Ms. Kim.

476
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,610
I've decided to apply for the PhD.

477
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,362
Really?

478
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,614
That's great!

479
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,158
So they're allowing you
to work and study at the same time now?

480
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,244
No.

481
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,664
What? Then, what happened?

482
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,877
I think I'll have to resign.

483
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,641
So you're telling me

484
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,561
that you're quitting?

485
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,521
Yes.

486
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,900
It feels like I'm getting dumped.

487
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,069
So...

488
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,738
this was a farewell dinner?

489
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,031
Well...

490
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,536
It wasn't meant to be,
but it turned into one. I'm sorry.

491
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,415
Who throws a farewell like this?

492
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,500
You're free after this, right?

493
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,467
Let's just go get a drink.

494
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,553
Okay.

495
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,931
But this...

496
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:48,975
But...

497
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,227
But this was an expensive meal.

498
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,354
Wait, Ma'am!

499
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,235
Come in.

500
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,740
Mr. Park, what's the matter?

501
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,619
Chairman, we're being audited
at the foundation.

502
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,749
- Why all of a sudden?
- Someone filed a complaint.

503
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,752
They'll come here next soon.

504
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,839
A complaint? From who?

505
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,678
Should I hand all of these over?

506
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,098
I'd like everything
from last year up to today.

507
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,479
Hello, this is Seong Yudeok.

508
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,273
I had something to ask you.

509
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,614
- It's in here.
- Okay.

510
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,799
Put those in too.

511
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,300
These were before the merger.

512
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,428
- Just put them in.
- Give it to them.

513
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,223
What exactly are you investigating?

514
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,476
We're checking if money
from the Dandelion Scholarship Foundation

515
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,854
was paid as retainer fees here.

516
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,023
If we find any signs of embezzlement
or violations of the Attorney Act,

517
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,193
we'll have to file formal charges.

518
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,989
<i>The complaint says it's suspicious</i>

519
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,284
<i>that the foundation
keeps sending money to this law firm</i>

520
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,870
<i>as retainer fees.</i>

521
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,250
<i>They're basically suspecting
that both are under your control.</i>

522
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,759
What is the meaning of this?

523
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:52,181
We're dealing with a mess right now
just for accepting retainer fees from you.

524
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,350
Who's Lee Dongsu?

525
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,852
- Lee Dongsu?
- Yes.

526
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,645
Mr. Seong looked into it,

527
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,150
and apparently, it's all because
this Lee Dongsu filed the complaint.

528
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,945
Is having your own office
at the firm making you...

529
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,822
a little confused?

530
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,493
Everyone, it's nothing.
So let's all calm down.

531
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,080
- We didn't do anything wrong--
- What's your purpose?

532
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,500
What was your purpose in merging?

533
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,756
Did you really do the merger
so the foundation could funnel money away?

534
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,885
At first, it seemed to be helpful.

535
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,095
But then came
that conflict of interest case.

536
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,474
And the associates
all hang out in their own clique.

537
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,685
The associates have been acting strange
since the merger.

538
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,277
There won't be any issues
with today's investigation.

539
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,489
The retainers were for real cases
the foundation asked the firm to handle.

540
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,865
There's nothing to cause concern.

541
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,993
But it seems...

542
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,206
that's not the only thing
you have issues with, is it?

543
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,236
How long have you been with us now?

544
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,615
It's been about three and a half years.

545
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,617
It's been a while.

546
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,286
I...

547
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,249
- I've always wondered.
- Yes?

548
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:46,169
Why did you leave the firm downstairs
and come work for us?

549
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,381
Well, you offered me a better salary.

550
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,552
- Was that really the only reason?
- Yes.

551
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,762
You sure are a strange one.

552
00:41:55,763 --> 00:42:00,976
I mean, if you move just one floor up,
you have to see Mr. Seong all the time.

553
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,060
Isn't it really awkward?

554
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:06,231
Then, why did you hire someone
who was right downstairs?

555
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,733
It'd be awkward for you too.

556
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,736
I liked you, Attorney Ha.

557
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,826
I could tell right away
you wouldn't be someone who'd mess around.

558
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,706
And when we spoke,
I figured we'd get along.

559
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,631
When did you...

560
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,384
start to think that way?

561
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,678
At the interview.

562
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,266
We've never talked much besides then.

563
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,062
- At the interview?
- Yes.

564
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,148
At the interview. What were you thinking?

565
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,192
I wasn't thinking about anything.

566
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,860
What were you thinking about?

567
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,821
I wasn't thinking about anything either.

568
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,864
- What would I be thinking?
- Weird.

569
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,117
Of course, it was the interview.

570
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,167
Actually...

571
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,879
I offered to support you with your PhD

572
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,424
to keep you around longer.

573
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,678
Really? I honestly had no idea.

574
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:22,892
But my offer ended up
making you leave.

575
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,228
What a shame.

576
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,530
Ms. Kim.

577
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,740
Thank you for everything.

578
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,493
I learned a lot

579
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,369
working under you.

580
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,996
Geez, stop it.

581
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,499
Just drink. As if you learned from me.

582
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,710
But are we supposed to
finish the whole thing like this?

583
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,505
- Just drink however you want.
- It's so strong though.

584
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,551
- This is how I drink.
- Wait.

585
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,971
Take your time.

586
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,029
You look pretty tired.

587
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,115
Are there a lot of trials tomorrow?

588
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,284
I don't have any tomorrow.

589
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,372
I...

590
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,584
I've decided to try
and become a public defender.

591
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,755
I know it's not going to be easy.

592
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,343
Like you said, dealing with
shameless people was so tough.

593
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,637
I met someone like that.

594
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,182
But...

595
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,685
I still saw it through to the end today.

596
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,980
So don't worry too much about me.

597
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,407
I know. You'll do great.

598
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,078
It's a really tough job,

599
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,166
but out of everyone I know,
you'd be the best person for it.

600
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,794
Thanks.

601
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,644
- Ms. Kim?
- No.

602
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,818
Ms. Kim, did you sleep well?

603
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,153
Yes, I was out cold.

604
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,698
Yeah, I slept like a rock.

605
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,750
Yes, tell me what's going on.

606
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,296
I've found something I want to pursue,
so I think I'll have to resign.

607
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,757
I'd like to apply
to become a public defender.

608
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,510
I came here to tell you this.

609
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,847
Thank you for all the opportunities
you've given me.

610
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,311
I expected this.

611
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,229
I didn't know
it'd be as a public defender,

612
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,065
but I figured you'd want to go
in that direction.

613
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,820
I'm sorry I wasn't able to
fully support you in that.

614
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,533
No, you've done more than enough for me.

615
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,830
So how long do you plan to stay?

616
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,416
If you need,
I'll stay until you find someone new.

617
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,169
I'll stay as long as I can.

618
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,671
Didn't you say you hate staying

619
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,383
and getting paid for work
you weren't fully invested in?

620
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,803
- Sorry?
- During your interview,

621
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,766
I asked why you quit your last job
before finding a new one,

622
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,226
and that's what you said then.

623
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,314
I really liked that answer.

624
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,111
I'll do my best right up to the end,
so my paycheck won't feel like a waste.

625
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,864
Your answer then
was the reason why I hired you.

626
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,992
I can't ask you to go back on your word.

627
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,206
You'll have a lot to study
for the public defender exam.

628
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,793
Go study hard and make sure you pass.

629
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,669
I'll handle things here.

630
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,802
It's a shame, but let's end it here.

631
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:11,972
Okay.

632
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,394
Thank you, ma'am.

633
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,189
Me too.

634
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,233
I've finished the brief
for the Taegeon Pipeline case.

635
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,568
I organized the current status
and handover notes

636
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,321
for all 48 cases I was handling

637
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,033
and saved them on my computer's desktop.

638
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,913
When you hire a new attorney,
just have them check that file.

639
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,456
Do you know any lawyers
you could recommend?

640
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,042
It's been tough to find someone.

641
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,341
If not, don't worry. I'll handle it.

642
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,510
Thank you for your work.

643
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,473
If we meet in court later, let's say hi.

644
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,601
Yes, sir. Thank you.

645
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,038
- Yes?
- Yes?

646
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,748
- What?
- What is it?

647
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,001
- Sorry.
- Right.

648
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,712
- I need to drop by the fourth floor.
- Okay, sure.

649
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,965
- Okay.
- Today's your last day anyway.

650
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,759
Why suddenly ask for permission?

651
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,595
- You can go.
- Yes, if you go this way...

652
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,890
- Yes, I will.
- I'll go this way.

653
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,728
Yunsu will believe
he got the scholarship from our foundation

654
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,690
after being referred to by the orphanage.

655
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,443
Yes, thank you.

656
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,488
Helping someone hold onto their dream...

657
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,365
It really is a great feeling, isn't it?

658
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,242
Yes.

659
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,204
That's why I want to hold onto mine too.

660
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,375
Rather than wanting to become a lawyer,

661
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,294
I think I just wanted to keep studying.

662
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:10,216
Back then, my circumstances
didn't make it easy to study.

663
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,720
Also, being a lawyer seemed like
a good way to make a living.

664
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:19,391
I never thought there would be
room in my life for a dream.

665
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,769
But I have one now.

666
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,523
I've decided...

667
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,776
to pursue the PhD program.

668
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,277
Really?

669
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,655
That's great. Congratulations.

670
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,991
I really wanted to tell you in person.

671
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,826
Thank you for sharing that with me.

672
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,579
Gosh, you'll be even busier now.

673
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,083
Studying and working late nights...

674
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:48,045
Actually, I'm going to resign.

675
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:53,217
Now that I've figured out what I want,
I'm going to focus on just that.

676
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,011
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

677
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,763
Today's my last day.

678
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,849
Today's my last day too.

679
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,519
What do you mean?

680
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,940
I'm stepping down from my position
as an advisor here.

681
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,400
I guess being in Seocho-dong

682
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,571
tricked me into thinking
that I'd achieved some kind of dream.

683
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,283
So I kept hanging around here,

684
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,160
bought a building,

685
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,080
and wanted to rent it out to only lawyers.

686
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,416
But...

687
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,335
I've come to accept
that none of those things

688
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,713
could fill that void.

689
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:37,720
I'm thinking...

690
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,223
of studying again to become a lawyer.

691
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,564
You can do it!

692
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,943
You can do it too!

693
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,490
I'll help you.

694
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,826
Of course.

695
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,595
I apologize again
for causing concern yesterday.

696
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,141
We figured there won't be much trouble,
so it's all right.

697
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,687
If there is an issue,
it'd be a headache for you, not us.

698
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,817
Anyways, I'm more worried
about hiring a new associate.

699
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,444
Yours left too?

700
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,988
We need to hire someone new too.

701
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,366
Yeah, me too.

702
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,870
I'm not sure we'll find someone
as good as Attorney Kang.

703
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,330
They all resigned?

704
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,956
They'd always hang out together.

705
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,708
Now, they're leaving together too. Geez.

706
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,627
Wait, Attorney Ha quit too?

707
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,048
Did he get a better offer
somewhere else again?

708
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,508
No. That's not it.

709
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,095
He left to study.
And I encouraged him to do it.

710
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,097
I see.

711
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,015
Did anyone resign at your firm?

712
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,725
I heard someone was pregnant.

713
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,478
Why would she quit?
She can just take maternity leave.

714
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,397
We've found someone to cover for her.

715
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,857
Why is your associate leaving?

716
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,444
She found something she wants to do.

717
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:22,866
Of course, I know associates
eventually move on,

718
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,828
but it's always bittersweet for us.

719
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,332
The associates must be pretty sad
to part ways with each other too.

720
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,127
It was always nice
seeing them get along so well.

721
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,504
They helped me out a lot too.

722
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,306
I wanted to see you in person
to say goodbye as well.

723
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,608
Thanks to you, I was able to
live out a dream for a little while.

724
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,488
Without this experience, I wouldn't have
had the courage to make this decision.

725
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:07,661
You can keep the firm merged as is
or go back to how things were before.

726
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,373
Whatever you choose,
I'll provide whatever support you need.

727
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,631
Are you going somewhere?

728
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,425
No.

729
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,470
I just have something I want to focus on.

730
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:30,392
I hope we get to
cross paths again someday.

731
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,611
Please eat.

732
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,790
Thank you.

733
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,503
I'll get going.

734
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:52,349
You don't need to come out.
We can go on our own.

735
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,811
You're all free now.

736
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:00,524
Gosh, trying to study again
at this age is rough.

737
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,734
Then, don't go. Stay in Seocho-dong.

738
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:04,694
I'll visit often.

739
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:07,780
No one ever does after saying that.

740
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,658
I can't help but come by often.

741
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,577
How annoying.

742
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,954
You don't have to tell me
when you're coming.

743
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,623
I don't want to know.

744
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,584
All right.

745
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,084
I'm off.

746
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,379
- Bye. Keep in touch.
- I'll get going.

747
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,360
It's due to the hormones, okay?

748
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:12,220
Attorney Ahn, Deus GA is asking
if you can handle the appeal too.

749
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,431
It seems Shin Jihye filed it.

750
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,891
They said since you did
a great job last time,

751
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,267
they want you on it again.

752
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,436
I'd appreciate it.

753
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,166
Yeah?

754
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,922
I won't be taking the Deus GA case.

755
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,258
What do you mean?

756
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,095
Also, I'll be continuing
with Park Mansu's case.

757
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,555
What?

758
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:59,768
What are you doing?
I told you not to do that case anymore.

759
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,188
Yes.

760
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,440
But I'm not saying I'll do it here.

761
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,071
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

762
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,535
Thank you for everything.

763
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,162
You're quitting?

764
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:20,706
Yes.

765
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,673
I know you've been unhappy with me lately.

766
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,300
But as the managing partner,

767
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,720
I have responsibilities.

768
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,389
Attorney Ahn, you understand that.

769
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,015
I don't think your approach is wrong.

770
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,687
I became used to it,
so I worked with you for 10 years.

771
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,774
But now, that familiarity
has started to feel uncomfortable.

772
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,903
I'd like to try it my own way now.

773
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,829
- Does that mean you plan to go solo?
- Yes.

774
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:12,007
No matter what I say
to try to convince you...

775
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,760
you won't change your mind, right?

776
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,262
No, I don't think so.

777
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,347
Okay.

778
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:21,558
I understand.

779
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,604
Thank you for your work.

780
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,277
Thank you, sir.

781
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,715
Why did you want to see me?

782
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,593
- There's something I had to tell you.
- What?

783
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,971
Did that company tell you
to pass along another message?

784
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,516
- It's not like that--
- Then, let me ask you first.

785
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,394
Were you on Deus' side from the beginning?

786
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,023
Did you pretend to listen
while hiding that from me?

787
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,568
You know...

788
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,532
I told you everything,
because I trusted you.

789
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,618
How could you do that?

790
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,831
I'm sorry.

791
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,706
That's not what it was.

792
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,125
Then, what was it?

793
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,169
What did you come here to say?

794
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,631
I heard you're filing the appeal.

795
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,012
- You're trying to stop me from that too?
- No.

796
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:48,770
All insurance contracts are made
to be logged in the company's system.

797
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:54,233
If what you said is true
and they keep people late to hit quotas,

798
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:57,237
there should be a lot
of late-night entries in the system.

799
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:02,658
Some of those were probably contracts
the agents input themselves.

800
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,121
If you submit those records,
they will help prove the abuse.

801
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,421
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

802
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,677
Because I wanted to make things right.

803
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,900
I'm truly sorry.

804
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:52,751
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

805
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,951
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

806
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:35,961
ATTORNEY CHO CHANGWON

807
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,840
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

808
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:46,930
ATTORNEY KANG HUIJI

809
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,823
Hold on!

810
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,243
Thank you.

811
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,120
Ms. Jang.

812
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,123
Attorney Bae!

813
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,417
- It's been a long time.
- Congratulations on the baby!

814
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,961
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

815
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,045
Attorney Bae.

816
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,548
- Hello.
- Hello.

817
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,009
It's been so long
since I've been out of the house.

818
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,761
Hey, there.

819
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,430
- Mr. Na.
- How's the baby doing?

820
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,057
How have you been?

821
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,934
Good. You can work and go.

822
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,438
The baby's... doing well.

823
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,277
He hasn't changed a bit.

824
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,196
Come in.

825
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,658
My goodness. Hello, Attorney Bae.

826
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,827
It's been a while. How have you been?

827
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,830
Good. Hold on, you look great though.

828
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,292
No way. I feel like I'm dying.

829
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:08,172
Hang in there for the one-year miracle.
Things get better after the first year.

830
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,592
- That miracle will really happen?
- Yeah.

831
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,929
In any case, I'm sorry to bother you
while you're on leave.

832
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,390
No, it's okay.

833
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,933
I live right next door anyway.

834
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,436
I heard the Sumyeong ENC case
is giving you trouble?

835
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:26,398
Yes, it's a case you wrote
the complaint for before you left.

836
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,817
But it's progressing differently
from what I expected.

837
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,820
- Can I see the file?
- Yes.

838
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:34,782
- It's this part.
- I see. This part.

839
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,079
This isn't it.

840
01:06:45,293 --> 01:06:46,376
Where was it?

841
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,753
- This?
- Yeah!

842
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,922
Okay.

843
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,176
What time was tonight's
evening class moved to?

844
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,221
I'm not the teaching assistant
for that one.

845
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,431
- You're not?
- No, Professor.

846
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,725
- Gosh...
- That. This one.

847
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:02,977
Yeah, that's it.

848
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:10,734
Then, can you post a notice later
saying I'll be five minutes late

849
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,778
for the law school class on contract law?

850
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,113
Yes, Professor.

851
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:15,740
Hold on!

852
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,536
- Kang Sumin?
- Here.

853
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,498
- Kang Hyeokchan.
- Here.

854
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,499
- Ko Eunho.
- Here!

855
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,335
- Donghyo.
- Here.

856
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,629
- Minju.
- Here.

857
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,756
- Seonhyeong.
- Here.

858
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,716
- Kim Sein.
- Here.

859
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,679
- Kim Hyungmin.
- Here.

860
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,558
- Na Junyeong.
- Here.

861
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,560
- Noh Yunseong.
- Here.

862
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,354
- Nam Sehun.
- Here.

863
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:47,939
Mun Boram.

864
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,653
My goodness.

865
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,617
I told you to wait there.

866
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,912
Why? It's nice to walk there together.

867
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,918
It's tough coming here
every day for lunch, isn't it?

868
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,379
My boyfriend is a student.

869
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,423
I have to at least keep him fed.

870
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,591
Come along.

871
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,677
I feel like you'll buy me
something fancy today.

872
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,639
No, I'm not.
We're going to eat <i>tteokbokki.</i>

873

COUNSEL'S SEAT

874
01:08:57,425 --> 01:09:00,261
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

875
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,516
The defendant embezzled
billions of company funds,

876
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,018
denied it to the end,

877
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:12,982
and even coerced his subordinates
into perjury to put the blame on them.

878
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,442
There's been no sign of remorse.

879
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:19,112
Since this is the behavior
of a shameless and vicious criminal,

880
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:23,076
we request a sentence of 15 years
in prison as strict punishment.

PROSECUTOR'S SEAT

882
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:40,968
Hello.

883
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,266
Here.

884
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,186
Attorney Kang,
how many are you seeing today?

885
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,855
Today, I'll be seeing 17 of them.

886
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,024
Gosh.

887
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,402
Please wait out here for a moment
and have some water.

888
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,529
Okay.

889
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:26,514
Everyone, don't worry too much.
It'll all work out.

890
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,599
Sir, everything will work out.

891
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,227
Attorney Ahn.

892
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,607
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

893
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:44,906
Let's go.

894
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,035
Civil case number 2026-3784.

895
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,081
Plaintiff Han Sucheol and 42 others.

896
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,292
Defendant Kwak Jeongyeon
and nine others.

897
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,585
Is everyone ready?

898
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:57,753
Yes, Your Honor.

899
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,339
Okay. Attorneys from both sides,
please step forward.

900
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,970
Plaintiffs and defendants,
please remain in the gallery.

901
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:12,059
We're starting a difficult case.

902
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,062
Who's representing the plaintiffs?

903
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:18,565
I'm Ahn Juhyeong,

904
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:21,319
attorney for Han Sucheol and 42 others.

905
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:44,383
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

906
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,764
Let's go eat.

907
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,600
Were today's visits rough too?

908
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:56,311
I ran into a total madman this time.
He was a complete lunatic.

909
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,854
I couldn't believe that guy.

910
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,898
- You ran into a madman?
- Yeah.

911
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,067
You should back out.

912
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,151
I have to do it. It's my job.

913
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,695
I'm a public servant.

914
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:06,781
Or you could come work with me.

915
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,368
- Nope.
- But why? "Nope"?

916
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,958
Everything's changed except for this.

917
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,377
This will never change.

918
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,007
Hello.

919
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:31,596
- You still dragging your feet?
- Come on, I'm not that late.

920
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,099
Want to hear something funny
that happened today?

921
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,517
Tell me later.

922
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,310
- You only poured for yourself.
- Hello.

923
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,520
Geez, seriously?

924
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,730
You just never change...

925
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,358
Look at the time!

926
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:44,986
Haven't ordered yet?

927
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,737
Not everyone's here.

928
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,531
How's the baby doing?

929
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,494
Here they are.

930
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:58,039
Do you have no concept of time
or no concept of etiquette?

931
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,958
Checking everyone's attendance
took 30 minutes.

932
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:03,295
- I had 17 client visits.
- Hey, I came all the way from Suwon.

933
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,548
I came back out after watching my kid.

934
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,424
- Hurry up and order.
- Okay.

935
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:10,177
- Five bean sprout soups, please.
- Okay.

936
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,525
Next time, let's meet in the middle.

937
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,068
That's what I wanted to say.

938
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:30,781
But we've never met
anywhere else for lunch, have we?

939
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,867
Nope. We've never gone
outside this area.

940
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:36,746
Just come to Seocho-dong.
It's comfortable here.

941
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,006
Next time, let's eat something nice.

942
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,925
- Yeah.
- Who even suggested

943
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,551
- bean sprout soup today?
- Exactly.

944
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,303
- We should've gotten pork cutlets.
- Sanggi.

945
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:54,972
- What?
- Let's get some <i>bossam.</i>

946
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,643
They have <i>bossam</i> here?

947
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:02,063
- Thanks for buying, Sanggi.
- They have octopus <i>bossam.</i>

948
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:43,646
Law and The City

949
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:26,147
Law and The City

950
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,152
Is the kimchi good?

951
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:32,903
Yeah, try it.
