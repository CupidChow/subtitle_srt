CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:35,429
Mom!

4
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,681
- What's going on?
- Your dad was leaving for work.

5
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,433
But the police came
and arrested him.

6
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,436
Why would they arrest Dad?

7
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:48,317
Actually, he'd been sued
and was being investigated.

8
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,235
What?

9
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,904
You should've told me about this!

10
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,365
The lawsuit just seemed so ridiculous.

11
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,369
I didn't want to worry you for no reason,
so I didn't tell you.

12
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,165
What was he charged with?

13
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,251
Fraud.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,131
Fraud?

15
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,843
I'm sure it's a mistake.
He'll be out soon.

16
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,055
There's no way your dad
would do that. I mean, fraud?

17
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,474
There's no way.

18
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,484
LUNCH CREW

19
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,568
I WANT RICE
FRIED RICE?

00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,570
NOTHING GREASY, LIGHT AND CLEAN
SSAMBAP?

21
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,988
SOUNDS GOOD
SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS

22
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,115

Episode 8
A Stranger Who Feels Close

26
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,243
- Hello.
- How may I help you?

27
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,161
I'm here to see someone in custody.

28
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,164
As legal counsel or for a family visit?

29
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,961
A family visit.

30
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,592
Mr. Kim refused the visit.

31
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,470
What? He refused?

32
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,639
Does he know who came?

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,016
He was willing to come
for a family visit.

34
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,270
But he refused
when we said it was his daughter.

35
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,289
What? You're kidding, right?

36
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,249
That's not true, right?

37
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,087
No, I've trusted you this whole time.

38
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,507
So please, just give me
my money back, okay?

39
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,262
What do you mean there's nothing?
You got it through Park!

40
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,350
No, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

41
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,061
Please, I'm begging you.

42
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,189
I...

43
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,497
No, it's not that...

44
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,597
Huiji.

45
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,392
Don't worry.

46
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,896
No matter what it takes,
I'll get that money back.

47
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,441
I'll make things right again.

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,238
It couldn't be...

49
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,793
Legal deadlines.

50
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,630
As lawyers, we always
have to be careful with legal deadlines.

51
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,966
Deadlines for appeals, objections...

52
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,010
Miss them by even a minute,

53
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,555
and there's no going back.

54
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,265
Got it?

55
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,433
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,728
Why are you...

57
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,146
You didn't submit your work.

58
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,565
But I did.

59
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,732
I emailed it to you.

60
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,817
It was due yesterday,

61
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,362
but you sent it
after midnight at 12:05 a.m.

62
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,074
Right. I'm sorry.

63
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,035
- Excuse me, Ms. Kim?
- Yes?

64
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,414
Could I have a quick word with you?

65
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:13,998
Sure.

66
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,334
- Take your time, everyone.
- Okay.

67
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,587
Please come in.

68
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,679
Please have a seat over here.

69
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,180
No.

70
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,601
It's not something we need to
sit down and talk about.

71
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:40,233
You keep calling Attorney Ha away,
so it's starting to become a distraction.

72
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,527
I'd prefer if you stopped.

73
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,073
Tomorrow's the last day for that.

74
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,201
But the thing is, while it's true
that I first asked him to help out,

75
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,163
it seems he's the one
who is enjoying it now.

76
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,498
He's been helping often.

77
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,045
It's good for the students,
and he seems to be having fun.

78
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,881
Could you let him finish it out? Please?

79
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,593
Did Attorney Ha say he enjoys it?

80
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,928
Would you like to go and take a look?

81
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,474
No, why would I do that?

82
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,476
Well, all right.

83
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,936
Then, I'll get going.

84
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,898
I was in the middle of class.

85
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,033
A round of applause.

86
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,582
All of you have failed
your assignments.

87
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,167
- What?
- What?

88
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,545
Come on. You said we'd win the case.

89
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,966
What kind of land
was involved in this case?

90
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,012
It was farmland.

91
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,391
What does the Constitution
say about farmland?

92
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,685
"Farmland is for farmers."

93
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,690
Only farmers can own farmland.

94
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,817
Even if you did win this case,

95
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,486
if your client isn't a farmer,
they can't reclaim this land.

96
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,117
So, the point of this assignment
wasn't just to win in court.

97
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,246
It was to also find a legal way
to take ownership of the land.

98
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,167
If you think the work ends with a win,

99
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,628
you'll never become a good lawyer.

100
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,881
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,191
<i>I hope we can be friends.</i>

102
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:09,007
SEX CRIMES, DUI, CYBERCRIME, THEFT

103
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,718
Not here.

104
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,476
NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT VIOLATION

105
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,104
CHILD ABUSE

106
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,773
Damn it.

107
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,621
I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS

108
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,252
Come in.

109
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,803
Attorney Cho, the verdict came in for
the court-appointed voice phishing case.

110
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,097
They found her guilty.

111
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,891
- Do Mikyung's case?
- Yes.

112
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,269
She was fined 10 million won.

113
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,733
Okay. Thank you.

114
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,991
Damn it. I don't believe this.

115
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,342
Hello, Attorney Kang.

116
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,844
Hello.

117
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,846
I'm sorry for taking the morning off
last-minute today.

118
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,265
No, it's totally fine.

119
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,934
Did the thing you had to
take care of work out?

120
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,396
Yes, it worked out well thanks to you.

121
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,022
That's good.

122
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,463
Attorney Kang,
were you expecting any complaints?

123
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,049
A fax came in addressed to you.

124
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,468
Right. Thank you.

125
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,776
COMPLAINT

126
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,822
DEFENDANT
KIM MYEONGHO

127
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,116
I don't know what cryptocurrency
you're talking about.

128
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,993
I never received any money.

129
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,120
Didn't you make a deal with Choi Seongmi?

130
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,205
REASON FOR LAWSUIT

131
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,414
THE ACCUSER WAS MISLED

132
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,708
AND LOST 350 MILLION WON

133
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,963
<i>No matter what it takes,
I'll get that money back.</i>

134
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,049
I'll make things right again.

135
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,519
You're back again.
Family visit hours are over though.

136
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,980
I'm visiting as his attorney.

137
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,193
Please tell him to come out. Please.

138
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,028
Okay.

139
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,928
Why did you come all the way here?
It's nothing serious.

140
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,931
It's the exact same way
that you were scammed.

141
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,437
How did you know that?

142
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,857
You're not defending this, right?

143
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
Huiji.

144
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,739
You absolutely can't take this.
Listen to me.

145
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,660
I came out here to tell you that.

146
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
It's not true, right?

147
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,582
You said no matter what it took,
you'd make things right.

148
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,627
This isn't what you meant, right?

149
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,340
I don't know anything about this.

150
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,509
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

151
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,512
It'll be cleared up soon. Don't worry.

152
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,432
Dad.

153
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,311
Don't come back anymore. Okay?

154
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,521
I'll see you when I get out.

155
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,665
- Here. Deliver this to the client.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

156
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,835
Aren't you close with the attorney
from the eighth floor?

157
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,254
Yes, we are.

158
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,173
I see. It seems her family
has something going on.

159
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,258
Her father...

160
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,093
was in jail.

161
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,886
What?

162
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,596
I saw her at the police station.

163
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,515
What? He refused?

164
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,725
Does he know who came?

165
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,518
He was willing to come
for a family visit.

166
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,771
But he refused
when we said it was his daughter.

167
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,940
<i>I wonder if he has
a long criminal record.</i>

168
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,777
She didn't seem to be
on good terms with her father.

169
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,156
I don't know to that extent.

170
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,450
Not that close? That's good.

171
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,202
You should keep your distance.

172
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
You can go.

173
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,130
ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT FORM

174
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,174
I'll do it, Mom.

175
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,842
I'm going to get another lawyer.

176
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,052
Don't worry about it.

177
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,221
Why is it such a problem? I'm a lawyer.

178
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,724
If you take this, your boss will find out.

179
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,643
What are you going to tell her?

180
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,396
That your dad got arrested for fraud
and you have to defend him?

181
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,482
He didn't commit fraud.

182
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,944
I'll tell my boss that too.
Then, it'll be fine.

183
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,153
Still, you can't.

184
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,073
Don't bring it up anymore.

185
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,119
We don't want you

186
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,996
to get hurt because of us,
not even a little.

187
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,084
Just like when we first took you in,

188
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
and even more so now.

189
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,135
Mom.

190
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,948
KANG HUIJI

191
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,296
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you? I'm now...</i>

192
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,971
There you are.

193
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,101
So...

194
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,063
I need a favor from you.

195
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,444
If you just make it look
like you're handling it,

196
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,988
I'll take care of the actual work.

197
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,533
Just take care of the visible aspects
like visitations and trials.

198
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,077
And to your boss,

199
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,955
just say it's for someone you know
through an acquaintance.

200
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,166
Are you okay?

201
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
What?

202
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,962
You're going through a lot.

203
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,675
It was a little rough at first.

204
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,261
But now, I'm fine.

205
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,141
I'm sorry I'm asking you to do this.

206
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,940
I'll do it.

207
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,153

KIM MYEONGHO

210
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,744
"Kim Myeongho."

211
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,756
PARTIES MET WHILE VOLUNTEERING
MONEY TAKEN FOR CRYPTO INVESTMENT

212
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,883
SUING FOR FRAUD

213
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,350
That's why I invest
with Mr. Kim Myeongho.

214
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,102
He works in the trade business,

215
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,604
- so he knows a lot about foreign crypto.
- How's the food?

216
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,191
- Mr. Kim does that kind of business too?
- Of course.

217
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,116
Please sit. We were talking about
your crypto business.

218
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,785
What exactly is it?

219
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,370
Well...

220
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,831
I'm planning to buy
some promising foreign cryptocurrencies.

221
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,124
I know them pretty well.

222
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,918
If you invest with me,
I'll set up a crypto wallet for you

223
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,753
and share the profits.

224
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,005
And that's not all.

225
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,881
If you bring in other investors,

226
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,176
your payouts go up,
like multi-level marketing.

227
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,889
So if you're going to do it,
you have to go through me, okay?

228
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,642
Then, I'll get a bigger cut, right?

229
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,562
Hey, don't count your chickens just yet.

230
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,939
They don't seem interested in investing.

231
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,943
Well, what kind of payouts
are we talking about?

232
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,655
<i>I don't know what cryptocurrency
you're talking about.</i>

233
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,116
<i>I never received any money.</i>

234
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,993
Didn't you make a deal with Choi Seongmi?

235
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,203
What are you talking about?

236
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,707
We clearly agreed to invest
through Ms. Choi that day,

237
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,668
and we have records that confirm
she transferred the money to you!

238
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,881
So, do you have any kind
of investment contract that we signed?

239
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,216
You don't.

DEFENDANT
KIM MYEONGHO

241
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,810
What's up? Have you eaten?

242
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,771
Well, sort of.

243
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,775
It feels like
I haven't seen you in a while.

244
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,408
Do you have a minute?

245
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,870
So, is your father okay?

246
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,958
What do you mean?

247
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,546
I thought about pretending not to know,

248
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,923
but I was worried.

249
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,884
I heard he's being held in custody.

250
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,098
I'm sorry.

251
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,599
I found out by coincidence.

252
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,895
My boss said he saw you
when he was at the police station.

253
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,899
Well...

254
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,110
He's been framed.

255
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,486
Framed?

256
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,655
Yeah, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

257
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,781
Wait.

258
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,992
Who were the fools
that didn't investigate properly?

259
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,453
The cops or prosecutors?

260
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,000
Will you be okay on your own?

261
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,962
Juhyeong agreed to help me.

262
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,718
Juhyeong knows about it?

263
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,179
Yeah, it just kind of happened.

264
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,639
We couldn't reach you yesterday.

265
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,518
Everyone else is really worried
about you too.

266
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,188
Really? I had no idea.

267
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,273
I'll get in touch with them myself.

268
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,358
Okay.

269
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,944
All right.

270
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,698
ATTORNEY CHO CHANGWON

271
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,833
Yes?

272
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,543
Attorney Cho, Ms. Do is here.

273
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,712
I see.

274
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,048
Hello, Attorney Cho.

275
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,132
Hello, ma'am.

276
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,426
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

277
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,227
They said I was guilty.
The fine is 10 million won.

278
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,356
Yes, I also heard.

279
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,567
I'm sorry.

280
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,655
Not at all, Attorney Cho. It was my fault.

281
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,990
Thank you for helping me.

282
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,579
I haven't given you anything,
so I feel bad for coming again,

283
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:16,252
but I didn't really understand
what happens if I can't pay the fine.

284
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,463
I came back here
to ask you about that.

285
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,882
I'm glad you came.

286
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,885
PERFORM HARD LABOR IN DETENTION

287
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,389
It means if you can't pay the fine,

288
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,392
you'll be sent to prison.

289
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:36,522
You'll work there, and each day counts
as 100,000 won off your fine.

290
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,778
So I can work it off?

291
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,738
That's a relief.

292
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,328
When do I go in?

293
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,373
It's not something

294
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,792
you can just turn yourself in for.

295
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,551
Don't worry about the fine. I'll cover it.

296
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,179
- What?
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

297
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,058
No, I can't! What are you talking about?

298
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,519
Goodness, I shouldn't have come.

299
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,439
It's a loan, not a gift.
You can take your time and pay it back.

300
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,065
No, I'm fine.

301
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,776
- It's really okay.
- Attorney Cho.

302
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:28,490
I did come here for your help
but not that kind of help.

303
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,494
I may not be the smartest,
but I know what's right from wrong.

304
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:38,208
Whether I steal or work the money off,
I'll come up with it on my own.

305
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,211
Thank you
for all the help you've given me.

306
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,297
Goodbye.

307
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,986
- I'm heading out, Ms. Kim.
- Okay.

308
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,948
Could you come in for a second?

309
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,449
Yes?

310
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,203
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,664
There's a farewell party
for the interns tonight, right?

312
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:21,042
- Use this.
- It's okay. Ms. Kim will handle it.

313
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,629
Just say you're buying and use this.

314
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,423
Thank you.

315
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,844
You seem to really enjoy teaching.

316
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,598
Your eyes were totally lit up.

317
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,809
What?

318
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,019
You were great.

319
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,272
Well...

320
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,400
I see.

321
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,361
- Go on.
- Okay.

322
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,114
- Goodbye.
- All right.

323
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,201
Should I close the door, or...

324
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,328
It's okay. You can leave it.

325
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,664
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

326
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,431
Hi.

327
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,099
Hello.

328
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,395
Did you have dinner?

329
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,564
Not yet.

330
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,151
Let's just sit for a bit,
and then head out.

331
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,156
Did you read the complaint?

332
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,745
You said it was your father's case?

333
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,707
Yes.

334
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,670
Even if I take this case as a formality,

335
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,133
I'll learn more about you
than you might like.

336
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,260
Are you sure

337
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,512
you'd be okay with that?

338
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,017
Of course, I don't mind.

339
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,814
My parents died in an accident
when I was little.

340
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,942
My aunt and uncle raised me.

341
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,527
That's why my last name's different.

342
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,031
I don't mind if you know these things.

343
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,328
If you're okay with it, then I am too.

344
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,797
Ever since I became a lawyer,

345
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,134
I thought I'd always be ready
for situations like this.

346
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,763
But nothing's going
the way I want.

347
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,224
You don't have to go it alone.

348
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,185
That's why you told me, isn't it?

Technically, we're not in the same firm,
so you can speak freely.

356
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,446
I'm not worried about that.

357
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,408
I'm fine as long as Huiji
doesn't take this case.

358
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,329
First, I'd like to discuss
the charity event.

359
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,208
Could you tell me
what happened with Ms. Choi?

360
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,670
It was an unfamiliar setting for me,
so I felt uncomfortable.

361
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,423
Ms. Choi wasn't next to me either.

362
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,570
Hello.

363
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,244
Mr. Kim had it all set up securely,
so I don't have any concerns.

364
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,954
Right, Mr. Kim?

365
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,539
Yes.

366
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,585
Thanks to Ms. Choi,
our business has found some relief too.

367
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,254
They are very interested
in foreign transactions as well.

368
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,798
If I introduce them to you,
you have to take care of them.

369
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,966
Yes, of course.

370
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,721
Then, you'll adjust
my commission rate too, right?

371
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,641
Yes, we can do that.

372
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,144
Then first, you'll need to go through me.

373
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:56,985
Gosh.

374
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,362
Ms. Choi's great at what she does.

375
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,238
You can trust and do business with her.

376
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,992
I think chiming in then
is what caused the misunderstanding.

377
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,994
So, what exactly am I being accused of?

378
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,372
You're being charged
with investment fraud.

379
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,290
They're accusing you
of teaming with Ms. Choi

380
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,169
to make them invest
in a fake cryptocurrency MLM scheme.

381
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,963
But Ms. Choi claims
you were the mastermind,

382
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,216
and she didn't really know
what was going on.

383
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,175
I can't believe her.

384
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,636
How long have you known Ms. Choi?

385
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,513
Maybe about two years?

386
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,473
I got to know her
through the business.

387
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,476
Could you also explain
the 900 million-won transfer you received?

388
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,106
She once urgently asked to borrow money.

389
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,607
I used one of her properties
as collateral.

390
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,110
I lent the money under the company's name
and got it back.

391
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,112
- Did you write up a promissory note?
- Yes.

392
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,406
Do you still have it?

393
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,240
Not anymore.

394
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,159
She paid it all back, so I returned it.

395
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,788
What about the transfer details
of the loan?

396
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,582
I lent it to her in cash.

397
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
All 900 million won?

398
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,378
Yes.

399
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,424
I see.

400
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,308
Sorry for making you all worry.

401
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,060
Gosh, don't feel bad.

402
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,604
Just focus on yourself.
Don't worry about us.

403
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,941
Exactly. Hey, Changwon--

404
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,739
What's this reaction?
Did you know about this?

405
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,241
Well...

406
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,786
I knew about it, but not from Huiji.

407
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,455
I found out by coincidence.

408
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,124
You should've at least
given us a heads-up if you knew.

409
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,960
How could I bring up
something like that?

410
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,007
Why didn't you say anything about this?

411
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,471
How much do they know?

412
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,181
I told them everything.

413
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,475
Okay, then.

414
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,144
So, anything we can do to help?

415
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,855
Why would you ask that?
Of course, we should work together.

416
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,774
That's why I'm asking.

417
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,651
Exactly, we should help too.

418
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,703
That's great. Let's do some work together.

419
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,915
Yeah, collective intelligence.

420
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's do it!

421
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,421
Kim Myeongho said
we've only known each other for two years?

422
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:26,843
Yes. He claimed the only person
he knew there was you.

423
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,304
Well, look.

424
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,306
The weather was terrible that day.

425
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,184
But Kim Myeongho insisted I come,

426
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,019
because people with money would be there.

427
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,396
What do you think that means?

428
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,816
What does it mean?

429
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,153
It means he wanted us to raise some cash.

430
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,365
I think it was back in 2019.

431
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,326
We had planned
a cryptocurrency venture together.

432
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,494
He was going to restart it on his own.

433
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,248
He said if I rounded up investors,
he'd give me a cut.

434
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,209
If it was that type of setting,
he could've done it alone.

435
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,089
He had no reason to make you come
if he had to pay you a cut.

436
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,094
You don't land investors
by talking about it on your own.

437
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,930
You need someone next to you
to hype things up.

438
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,432
It's even better if a shill
says they've invested too.

439
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,146
I did that favor for him,
and that's why I'm locked up now.

440
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,065
I shouldn't have said I put money in too.

441
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:28,112
Even if that's true,
you still urged them to invest.

442
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,449
That at least makes you
a fraud accomplice, doesn't it?

443
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:37,037
Hey, I never even imagined
his crypto business was a complete lie.

444
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,040
I even asked those people for a kickback.

445
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,002
I told them to give me a cut
when he gave them their payouts.

446
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,962
Only then would I connect them to him.

447
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,133
So who do you think was telling the truth?
Kim Myeongho or me?

448
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,304
I'm here to prove
Mr. Kim was telling the truth though.

449
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,918
CEO KIM MYEONGHO

BANK TRANSACTION HISTORY

454
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,563
Back from the visitation?
What did Choi Seongmi say?

455
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,775
I told her your father said they had
only known each other for two years,

456
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,278
and she couldn't believe it.

457
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,698
She said they planned
a cryptocurrency venture together in 2019.

458
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,867
Crypto? Wait. Here it is.

459
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:45,166
It looks like your father did prepare
a cryptocurrency business back in 2019.

460
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:49,295
Yeah, he did try to invest
in the cryptocurrency business back then.

461
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,714
That's how he got scammed.

462
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,716
If you look here,

463
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,553
we also found a partnership contract
with Choi Seongmi from then.

464
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,721
Did you check the stamps on it?

465
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,347
Yeah, I checked.

466
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,392
They match her father's company seal.

467
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,230
The victims' statements

468
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,150
all line up
with what Choi Seongmi said too.

469
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,697
Huiji, just going by the evidence,

470
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,826
her story seems a bit more plausible
than your father's.

471
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,161
Timeline-wise,

472
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,955
it seems like he was working
with Ms. Choi on a crypto business

473
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,707
and then was scammed.

474
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:27,834
The real issue is

475
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,545
whether or not your father recently made

476
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,090
the same proposal again to Choi Seongmi.

477
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,426
Something like that, right?

478
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,892
Wait, you think this contract is legit?

479
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,018
We have to consider that possibility.

480
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,812
Dad said he didn't even know
Choi Seongmi back then.

481
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,148
So he must not know about this contract.

482
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,524
The seal is a match,

483
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,903
and the context of the contract
makes sense.

484
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,578
If you look here,

485
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,248
Ms. Choi's transactions
only started about two years ago.

486
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,877
There's nothing in 2022.

487
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,379
The first transaction was in 2023.

488
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,673
Isn't it weird to start
a crypto business with someone

489
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,341
you've never made deals with before?

490
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,969
- No transactions exist afterwards either.
- This is just circumstantial evidence.

491
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,764
We can still re-examine the context.

492
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,354
There may come a point
where we have to plead guilty later.

493
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,273
You know how denying
each piece of objective evidence

494
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,110
could affect the sentence.

495
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,654
You have to think objectively.

496
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,699
Okay, why don't we keep

497
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,661
both possibilities open
and think about it?

498
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,956
Yeah. Huiji has a point,
and so does Juhyeong.

499
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,211
For now,

500
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,547
we'll object to the contract
as evidence at trial.

501
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,340
Once you agree, it sticks.

502
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,386
I'll handle the evidence admission form,
so let's go with that.

503
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,097
Okay.

504
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,700
Hey.

505
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,248
It's Huiji's father.
Aren't you being too impersonal?

506
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,251
If that fact changes things,
that's a bigger problem.

507
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,838
- Still...
- I'm not saying I've made up my mind.

508
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,466
It's just what the evidence shows so far.

509
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,391
- Hey.
- Sanggi.

510
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,813
You look really tired. Are you okay?

511
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,481
Yeah, I'm fine.

512
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,443
You were working late last night too.

513
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,072
Yeah. I was trying to finish
all of my backlog of work.

514
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,704
Hello, Attorney Kang speaking.

515
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,625
Is this Mr. Lee Sanghoon?

516
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,629
I'll get that draft to you
by the end of the day.

517
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,173
Yes, I'm sorry.

518
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,300
I forgot.

519
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,141
DEFENDANT'S TABLE

520
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,435
Should we try again?

521
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,523
The victims reached out.

522
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,148
To you directly?

523
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,234
Yeah.

524
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,404
They told me to hurry up
and pay the settlement

525
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,865
if we want a lighter sentence for Dad.

526
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,221

00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,393
All right, counsel for Mr. Kim,
share your position on the evidence.

528
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,734
EVIDENCE ADMISSION FORM

529
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,366
You're objecting to the statements
from Choi Seongmi, the victims...

530
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,578
and to the contract as well?

531
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,663
Yes, Your Honor.

532
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,498
All right, we'll note that.

533
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,793
Prosecutor, please proceed
with the witness request accordingly.

534
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,878
Yes, Your Honor.

535
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:27,049
Then, the next hearing
will be held on March 18th, 2025

536
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,593
for witness examination.

537
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,797
We'll be calling Choi Seongmi to the stand
even though she's a co-defendant.

538
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,882
The victims will testify next.

539
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,469
I'd prefer it
if Huiji didn't come to the trial.

540
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,227
May I ask why?

541
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,693
I'm just wondering if it relates
to the truth of the case.

542
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:32,072
If Ms. Choi's story is correct,
please tell me now.

543
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,658
That way, I can prepare the right defense.

544
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,411
It's nothing like that.

545
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,167
Then, why are you trying
to keep Huiji from coming?

546
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,089
I didn't mean that.
Please I'm begging you.

547
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,049
Please.

548
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,051
Mr. Shin.

549
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,228
Do you know what it feels like
to show a side of yourself

550
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,356
you never wanted your daughter to see?

551
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,087
Is my dad okay?

552
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,757
He's very worried about you.

553
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,177
He doesn't want you to come to the trial.

554
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,430
I'm sure he doesn't.

555
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,266
He always only worries about me.

556
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,812
It was upsetting to hear me

557
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,314
be so blunt, wasn't it?

558
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,816
Not at all.

559
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,111
I know you only did that
for my dad's sake.

560
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,701
I can't believe something like this
is happening again.

561
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:05,666
It must've been so hard for him
back then on his own.

562
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,254
People were scared they wouldn't get paid,
so they all hounded him.

563
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,092
He couldn't take it
and shut the business down in the end.

564
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,512
Even after that,

565
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,806
the company itself remained registered.

566
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,101
He really treasured that company.

567
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,187
Maybe it's because
it was inspired by my name.

568
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,484
So later on, when he started over,

569
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,779
he just reused the same corporation.

570
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,574
After becoming a lawyer,

571
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,535
did you go back to that case?

572
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,331
No, I didn't really want to look into it.

573
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,627
I'd keep thinking
that if I knew then what I know now,

574
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,421
maybe I could've stopped it.

575
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,383
That thought would hurt too much.

576
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:08,354
It seems your father
often did keep cash at the office.

577
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,065
I went through a few years
of their bank records,

578
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,776
and there were a lot
of periodic cash withdrawals.

579
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,029
So the claim
that he lent money in cash checks out.

580
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,824
It wasn't investment money he received.

581
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,660
It was just a loan repayment.

582
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,043
- Hello?
- <i>Damn it. Do you know what time it is now?</i>

583
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,671
CLIENT LEE SANGHOON
WH EMBEZZLEMENT CASE

584
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,006
Is this Mr. Lee?

585
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:41,136
<i>You keep saying you'll send it by today.
Damn it, you've said that for days.</i>

586
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,306
I'm sorry. By today-- I mean,
I'll send it now as soon as it's ready.

587
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,434
I'm so sorry. Okay, bye. I'm sorry.

588
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,352
What's wrong?

589
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,273
There's something urgent I need to do.
I'll head in first.

590
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,984
- Huiji!
- You should eat first...

591
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,073
I don't think she even took a bite.

592
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,420
Yes?

593
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,504
Are you really busy?

594
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,049
Hey, Sanggi. What's up?

595
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,968
Nothing much.

596
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,601
An embezzlement case?

597
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,896
- Yeah.
- I see. Scoot.

598
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,689
What?

599
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,192
Let's see.

600
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,112
So I just sort the table
and submit it with the statement?

601
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,366
- Yeah, that's right.
- Scoot.

602
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,617
Hurry up and scoot.

603
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,286
What? Wait.

604
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,413
I can do it myself.

605
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,958
Just leave it to me.

606
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,254
You should go and discuss
your father's case with them instead.

607
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,465
Go on, now.

608
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,884
Thanks, Sanggi.

609
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,275
Let's go over each one.

610
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,652
One if Choi Seongmi is right,
and one if Huiji's father is right.

611
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,028
If Choi Seongmi is right,

612
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,198
that means they tried to prepare
a similar business before.

613
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,033
This time, Choi urged investment

614
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,246
and her father explained
the business structure to the victims.

615
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,872
The old contract backs that up.

616
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,874
The victims' statements are evidence too.

617
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,669
They're consistent with Choi's story.

618
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,256
You're right.
Their testimonies are the issue.

619
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,259
If Huiji's father is telling the truth,
what happens to the victims' stories?

620
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,262
They're not really victims then.

621
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,346
What?

622
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,600
If Dad's telling the truth,
then those statements are false.

623
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,895
The victims aren't just victims anymore.

624
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,994
Let's meet them.

625
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,330
- Now?
- Yeah.

626
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,586
Where did you first meet Mr. Kim Myeongho?

627
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,713
We met while doing volunteer work.

628
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:25,050
So you both have businesses as well?

629
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,137
No, we're just office workers.

630
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:35,728
The volunteer group Mr. Kim chairs
is usually for businesspeople.

631
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:42,192
The group he chairs was made recently.

632
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,570
We met through
a different volunteer program.

633
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,447
- All right?
- I see.

634
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,033
He said it'd be really profitable

635
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,286
and told us to send the money
through Ms. Choi.

636
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,455
Ms. Choi used that as an excuse

637
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,042
to make us give her kickbacks.

638
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,337
Then, you could've transferred the money
directly to Mr. Kim.

639
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,382
You barely knew Ms. Choi,

640
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,885
but she asked for kickbacks,
and you just went along with that?

641
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,472
What do you think you're doing?

642
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,935
We came here today
thinking we'd discuss a settlement.

643
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,607
If her father's telling the truth,

644
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,193
then what on earth

645
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,153
was that 2019 contract?

646
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:31,324
It must've been so hard for him
back then on his own.

647
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,828
He couldn't take it
and shut the business down in the end.

648
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,373
According to Huiji, he was scammed
and had to close his business.

649
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,209
Then, four or five years ago,
he started over.

650
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,214
When he shut down,
what contract would he have signed then?

651
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,966
How long have you known Ms. Choi?

652
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,801
Maybe about two years?

653
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:54,098
Just as her father said,
if he had just recently met Choi,

654
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,560
would she know
his business failed once before?

655
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:02,022
Right. If she met him recently,
she wouldn't know about that.

656
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,068
Choi Seongmi is lying.

657
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,114
But why would the victims lie too?

658
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,241
That's what I don't get.

659
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,371
Who told you we were lying?

660
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,916
Did she say you'd get your money back
if you painted Kim Myeongho as a fraud?

661
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,711
I don't know what you're talking about.

662
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,629
Even if you get your money back that way,

663
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,882
that won't ease your conscience.

664
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,385
You would become the frauds,
not the victim.

665
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,266
How I feel doesn't matter at all.

666
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,269
Right now, money is what matters.

667
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:43,772
Let's go.

668
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,067
Please.

669
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,737
Tell us the truth.

670
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,532
I'm sorry.

671
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,799
Are you okay?

672
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,760
Yeah.

673
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,763
What's wrong?

674
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,016
It's just...

675
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,560
It reminded me of how my family was.

676
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:28,442
I've seen up close how the swindled
suffer more than the swindler.

677
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,906
Not to mention the grief
from losing your life savings all at once.

678
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,159
At that point,

679
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:43,415
you'd rather just get your money back
than see the scammer get punished.

680
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,001
Gosh.

681
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,379
You've worked so hard, Huiji.

682
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,385
Everyone's probably waiting.
Want to buy some late-night snacks?

683
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,972
- Sure.
- Sure. It's on me.

684
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,557
What do you want?

685
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,559
What do you want, Munjeong?

686
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,270
Hey, look at what I underlined.

687
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,313
Over here.

688
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,523
- Hey, Changwon.
- Yeah?

689
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,066
Look at the one from two years ago.

690
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,150
- Hold on.
- Okay.

691
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,236
Juhyeong, look.

692
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,488
Look at this ruling...

693
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,908
They're hard to piece together.

694
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,454
Yeah, the data from then might help us.

695
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,459
Make sure you check these.

696
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,794
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

697
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,006
- Eat this first.
- Hey, you're back.

698
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,559
Attorney Cho.

699
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
What is it?

700
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,062
Do I just mark it like this?

701
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,773
This one and this one...

702
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,317
They're the same.

703
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,694
These are right.

704
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,212
No further questions.

705
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,339
WITNESS STAND

706
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,508
Okay. Counsel for Mr. Kim, please proceed
with your cross-examination.

707
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,594
Yes, Your Honor.

708
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,058
You agreed to launch a crypto business

709
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,434
with the defendant in 2019.

710
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:30,981
And this time, he asked you
to start it up again. Is that correct?

711
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:32,941
Yes, that's correct.

712
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,531
On the left is the contract
you said you two signed then.

713
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,409
On the right is a recent tax invoice
from Mr. Kim's company.

714
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,952
Same registration numbers, right?

715
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,038
Yes, I'm sure they are.

716
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,499
Are you aware

717
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,336
Mr. Kim's company shut down
around July 2019?

718
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,256
Shut down?

719
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:05,682
This is a tax invoice
dated January 11th, 2019.

720
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,142
That number was voided
when the company closed.

721
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,145
From October 2020 onwards,
a new number was used.

722
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,773
But how is it that a contract
supposedly written in 2019

723
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:16,819
contain a number
that didn't exist until 2020?

724
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,541
You also borrowed 900 million won
from Mr. Kim's company, correct?

725
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,001
You needed to repay that money
to regain the collateral you put up.

726
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,336
But you didn't have the money,

727
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,799
so you scammed 900 million won
from victims as investment, correct?

728
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,219
- That's not true.
- You received a promissory note

729
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,472
from Mr. Kim after repaying him,
didn't you?

730
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,725
Didn't you copy the seal
from that promissory note

731
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,476
to forge this contract?

732
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,104
Wasn't it intended to frame Mr. Kim?

733
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,440
That's not true!

734
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,947
At this point, we question how credible
Ms. Choi's testimony is.

735
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,032
No further questions.

736
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,880
You told the police
during their investigation

737
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,923
that Mr. Kim asked you to invest

738
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,633
in his crypto business, correct?

739
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,844
Yes.

740
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,971
And just now,

741
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,641
you saw how Ms. Choi
was caught lying, didn't you?

742
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,437
Is what you told the police true?

743
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,317
The credibility of Ms. Choi's testimony
has been completely dismantled.

744
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,485
Think carefully.

745
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,321
Don't add perjury on top of this.

746
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,874
I'll ask you one more time.

747
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,876
Is it true?

748
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,590
Ma'am!

749
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,092
Why did you lie?

750
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,638
- Counsel.
- Because that way, I'd get my money back!

751
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,439
She said if I went along,
I'd get my money back first.

752
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,318
So you framed Mr. Kim,

753
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,778
knowing Ms. Choi was the real culprit?

754
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,071
I didn't know at first.

755
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,032
At first, I really thought
I was investing with Mr. Kim.

756
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,325
But thinking back,

757
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,162
Mr. Kim never even mentioned
cryptocurrencies.

758
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,374
All he did was just back up
what Ms. Choi said.

759
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,251
So when you confronted Ms. Choi,

760
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,253
did she suggest framing Mr. Kim?

761
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,380
I asked what happened,

762
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,049
and she said she had no money to give.

763
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,177
She said if she went to jail,
we wouldn't get it back.

764
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,764
Our only chance was to go along with her.

765
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:56,103
I didn't know it would go this far either.

766
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:57,813
I'm sorry.

767
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:43,191
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

768
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,289
Stop it, you two.

769
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,916
Hi.

770
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,918
- What's going on?
- Get in.

771
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,422
- Today was the end of your troubles.
- Hurry and get in.

772
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,800
Hey, the wrong lawyer came in earlier.
And it was super awkward.

773
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,719
We've gone up and down
a few times already.

774
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,097
- We were holding the elevator.
- Really?

775
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,016
We'll begin with the sentencing.

776
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:22,856
Criminal case number 2025-194.

777
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,818
Defendants Kim Myeongho and Choi Seongmi.

778
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,319
The verdict.

779
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,282
Defendant Choi Seongmi
is sentenced to seven years in prison.

780
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:36,453
Defendant Kim Myeongho
is found not guilty.

781
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:17,828
Eat up.

782
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,497
You've been through so much.

783
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,084
Huiji's the one who went through a lot.

784
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,503
I'm sorry. I messed up again.

785
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,633
Dad.

786
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,347
You've always been a good dad.

787
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,814
Stop trying so hard.
You can lean on me now.

788
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,486
Eat up.

789
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:53,822
Okay?

790
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,608
<i>It's on me today!</i>

791
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,610
- What are these?
- This one's on me.

792
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,737
- So eat up, everyone!
- I chose the dishes.

793
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,824
- No, my baby did.
- Geez.

794
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,452
Thank you all so much.
I couldn't have done it alone.

795
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,746
Well, you're the one who did a good job.

796
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,582
In any case, this is nice to see.

797
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:47,876
What?

798
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,003
- Your bowl.
- Sure.

799
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,342
Thank you.

800
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,649
Thanks.

801
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,442
Damn it.

802
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,278
How long do we have to play dumb for?

803
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,989
Right? We're lawyers. We catch on quick.

804
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,827
Exactly. So, should we wait
a bit longer or what?

805
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,460
Well...

806
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,633
If you all know,
then there's no need to say.

807
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,554
Instead of food pictures today,

808
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,223
I better take some photos of you two.

809
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,724
Can you get closer?

810
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,395
- Get closer.
- Just for a second. Just like that.

811
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,313
Okay, two, three...

812
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,398
Okay.

813
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,943
Now that you're close,
you two look good together.

814
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,628
- What is it?
- Ta-da!

815
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,797
- What's this?
- Fruits.

816
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,133
You wanted some this morning.

817
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,219
I sliced up a bunch just in case.

818
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,306
Take some out
and eat them when you want.

819
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,436
- Thanks.
- I'm off.

820
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,691
Did they say
when your maternity leave starts?

821
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,067
- Maternity leave?
- Yeah.

822
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,777
I have to think about that already?

823
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,906
No, it just came up
while I was talking to the staff today.

824
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,993
With our schedule, it's better
to plan and coordinate in advance.

825
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,245
I haven't thought about it.

826
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,040
That's okay. Take your time to think.

827
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,750
- While you eat your fruit.
- Okay.

828
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,419
- Okay, I'm going.
- See you.

829
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,548
Press the first floor.

830
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,217
Right. Bye!

831
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:32,749
Maternity leave?

832
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:44,803
Yes, come in.

833
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:49,848
What is it?

834
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:54,270
Sir, how do I apply
for maternity or parental leave?

835
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:58,358
I don't know.
I don't think there's ever been one.

836
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,567
Not even once?

837
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,988
Yes, people usually just quit.
Why do you ask?

838
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:04,572
Are you pregnant?

839
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,742
Yes. I mean, it's only been a few weeks.

840
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,706
We still have a little bit of time.
Let's talk about it then, shall we?

841
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,043
But it's guaranteed by law.

842
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,338
Do we really have to
discuss it again later?

843
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:24,801
Come on, you know the drill.

844
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,054
How many cases are you handling right now?

845
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,681
About 50.

846
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:31,807
So what do we do?

847
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,519
Do Attorney Ahn and I each take 25?
We already have 50 each.

848
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,480
Hiring a temp lawyer
for three or six months isn't easy.

849
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,275
Plus, I'm not eager to do that.

850
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,903
You know clients hate it
when their attorneys keep changing.

851
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,572
That is true.

852
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,990
But it's still my right.

853
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,784
Yes, I know it is.

854
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,747
All right,
I'll give it some serious thought.

855
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,791
We have some time. Let's talk later.

856
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,753
Hello, this is Na Kyungmin.

857
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:02,964
Yes.

858
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,800
I sent that to you yesterday.

859
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,011
Yes, I sent you an email.

860
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,728
Yes, I get it,
but if you say it like that...

861
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,396
Yes.

862
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:20,814
I'm sorry.

863
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,026
Yes, I think it's best to come in
and coordinate in person.

864
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,154
Yes, I understand.

865
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,072
All right, then.

866
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:29,407
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

867
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,660
Hello, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

868
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:37,206
He's not here right now. Yes, I'm sorry.

869
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,249
When dealing with municipal vendors,

870
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,462
the defendant is usually the one
responsible for payment.

871
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,372
Law and The City

872
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,166
