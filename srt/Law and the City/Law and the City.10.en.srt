Law and The City

00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,483
CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,987
ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY
WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION

4
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,741
Well, is there a problem?

5
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,412
I'm still currently handling
Moon Chanyeong's case.

6
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,497
Right.

7
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,669
Isn't it a bit much to assign me a case

8
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,463
to defend a perpetrator
of school violence?

9
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,260
Who are you to turn down cases?

10
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,638
- I know I'm just an associate, but--
- No.

11
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,807
I mean aside from that.

12
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,146
You're a lawyer.
You don't get to cherry-pick cases.

13
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,441
Perpetrators can't be defended?

14
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,402
Yes. They can, but...

15
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,906
But right now, I'm representing
a victim of school violence.

16
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,826
Could you at least not give
both cases at the same time?

17
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,996
Do you defend your clients

18
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,707
with your feelings?

19
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,170
It seems you have it all wrong.

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,796
A lawyer's job is to translate

21
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,174
what a client wants to say
into legal terms.

22
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,258
That's it.

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,427
We're just technicians.

24
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,555
So you take cases on opposing sides
at the same time?

25
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,891
What does it matter?

26
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,547
Episode 10
Difference in Perspective

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,407
Let's do our best today.

28
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,118
Okay.

29
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,791
Because this could be my last case.

30
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,089
SEOUL POLICE STATION

31
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,051
I've read over the statement you sent,
Attorney Cho.

32
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,178
Mr. Moon Chanyeong?

33
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,681
- Yes?
- Do you admit to the charge?

34
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,188
Yes.

35
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,358
He's trying to say
he admits to the stabbing,

36
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,277
but he's not pleading guilty.

37
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,903
Yes, I understand.

38
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,324
You explained it very thoroughly
in your statement,

39
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,493
so I get what you mean.

40
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,870
What happened to the victim?

41
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,538
The kid who got stabbed?

42
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,624
- Yes.
- He's fine.

43
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,586
I mean, he wasn't stabbed anywhere vital.

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,175
But calling it self-defense...

45
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,302
You know how tricky that is.

46
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,720
The issue is,

47
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,305
it wasn't just self-defense.

48
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,806
It was more like an attack.

49
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,477
There are precedents that recognize
aggressive retaliation as self-defense.

50
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,479
The bullying went on for a long time.

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,856
We can't say the moment
Kim Jeongmin took out the knife

52
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,691
was the only time Chanyeong was attacked.

53
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,944
We've had a lot
of internal discussions too,

54
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,907
but we decided
to send it over for indictment.

55
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,367
We couldn't have just dropped it.

56
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,953
Because it's an attempted murder case.

57
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,206
Kim Jeongmin had already
stopped attacking too.

58
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,291
No.

59
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,250
His attack wasn't over.

60
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,045
What if he had picked up the knife first?

61
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,341
Or if Chanyeong grabbed it
and Jeongmin took it from him?

62
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,137
The violence went on for two years.
It wasn't just kids joking around.

63
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,142
I have a kid too,

64
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,646
so honestly,
I didn't want to do this either.

65
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,319
But I'll submit your statement
to the prosecution,

66
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,404
so go home and wait.

67
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,324
You never know.
They may decide not to indict.

68
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,885
Excuse me, where's Munjeong--

69
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,806
- Which area is Bae Munjeong in?
- Just a moment, sir.

70
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,189
You can go to Yellow Zone Number 2.

71
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,191
Yellow...

72
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,905
Munjeong.

73
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,906
Are you okay?

74
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,284
There's a lot of other patients here.
Quiet down.

75
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,037
What did they say?
Are you going to be okay?

76
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,582
I don't know.

77
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,250
Bae Munjeong?

78
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,459
You must be her guardian.

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,379
- How's the baby?
- How is my wife?

80
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,131
Let me take a look.

81
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,133
Your uterus grows
as you enter the second trimester,

82
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,802
so you may have stomach tightening.

83
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,637
When that happens,
it's best to relax your body

84
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,140
and get some rest.

85
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,933
I'll take a look at your stomach.

86
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,395
If it feels tight for over 20 minutes,

87
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,647
or if it happens more regularly,

88
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,024
it could lead to contractions.

89
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,902
In that case,
come straight to the hospital.

90
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,777
And don't go anywhere alone.

91
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,906
Make sure to always be with your guardian.

92
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,657
Okay. Gel, please.

93
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,703
Okay, we'll take a look.

94
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,547
The baby's doing well.

95
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,174
He's a strong one.

96
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,468
Don't worry.

97
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,930
Once you get all of the muscle relaxant,
you're good to go home.

98
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,974
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

99
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,409
Don't cry. He said you're fine.

100
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,536
I'm not crying.

101
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,258
I don't think it's right to split
the corporate tax based on revenue.

102
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,928
That means even firms not making profits
would have to pitch in,

103
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,389
and that's not fair.

104
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,849
I also agree with what Ms. Kang said.

105
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,893
The numbers we calculated separately

106
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,690
keep clashing
with the total net profit after taxes.

107
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,900
That's the issue.

108
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,069
Let's keep it simple and go by revenue.

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,906
Breaking down and calculating expenses
for each firm is tough.

110
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,909
Even if it's difficult,
doing proper calculations

111
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,036
will be better in the long term.

112
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,247
Just how long term are you even thinking?

113
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,791
Are you in the red?
Is this to avoid the corporate tax?

114
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,334
How could you say that?

115
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,962
Let's just do things
the easy way, okay? Geez.

116
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,755
You're pushing to go by revenue,

117
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,301
- because it benefits you this year.
- Is that not allowed?

118
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,262
You're also pushing
for what benefits you.

119
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,723
All I'm saying is
we should do it properly.

120
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,684
Well, we don't have an accountant.

121
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,936
Tracking expenses is a pain,
so handle it yourself.

122
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,814
Don't just shrug it off
so irresponsibly like that.

123
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,233
At this rate,
we'll never be able to wrap this up.

124
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,318
Let's...

125
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,361
set the criteria again.

126
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,739
What have we been talking about then?

127
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,297
Yes?

128
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,300
I need you to go over these too.

129
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,677
We suddenly received
five lawsuits all at once.

130
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,012
Okay, ma'am.

131
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,599
You're very busy, right?
I'll tell them to throw in a bonus.

132
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,350
It's okay.

133
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,731
Is something wrong?

134
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,400
No, nothing's wrong.

135
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,113
Okay.

136
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,907
Let's hang in there.

137
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,533
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,585
The defendant must respond diligently
to the request for clarification.

139
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,881
The next hearing will be held here

140
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:55,178
on May 15th, 2025 at 2:10 p.m.

141
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,807
We will proceed with the next case.

142
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,978
Civil case number 2025-2736.

143
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,987
Who are in attendance today?

144
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,615
Attorney Kang Jeongyun
from Law Group Hyungmin.

145
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,786
Attorney Seong Yudeok
from Law Group Hyungmin.

146
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,663
What?

147
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,208
First, have a seat.

148
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,919
What's going on?

149
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,213
Did you submit
the wrong power of attorney forms?

150
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,340
- You're the plaintiff's counsel?
- Yes, Your Honor.

151
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,884
- And you're the defendant's counsel?
- Yes, that's right.

152
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,886
It's a conflict of interest.
Neither of you knew?

153
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,430
A LAW FIRM CANNOT REPRESENT BOTH SIDES

154
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,348
No.

155
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,433
Well, first of all...

156
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,478
Let's postpone today's hearing.

157
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,896
Please have this sorted out.

158
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,731
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

159
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,235
We'll move on to the next trial.

160
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,366
You should withdraw, Mr. Seong.

161
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,870
- You should withdraw.
- We're the plaintiff.

162
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,913
The case started
when we filed the complaint.

163
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,958
The defendant likely hired counsel
after receiving it.

164
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,169
Chronologically, we were first.

165
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,715
The plaintiff kept threatening to sue,

166
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,050
so we were hired in advance
before the complaint came in.

167
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,427
When were you hired?

168
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,638
- Last winter.
- We were hired last fall.

169
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,559
I meant late fall. Winter came early.

170
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,729
How do you know your client?
I know mine well. You should withdraw.

171
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,274
Then, it'll be easier on you
to ask for their understanding.

172
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,571
How much was your retainer?
Let the cheaper one withdraw.

173
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,741
That's not how this works.

174
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,995
Your rate must be pretty low.

175
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,872
You folded before we even discussed it.

176
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,333
If I withdraw,

177
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,375
will you split the retainer?

178
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,586
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.

179
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,213
The retainer doesn't matter.

180
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,091
The one who was hired later
should withdraw.

181
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,386
No way.

182
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,529
I didn't hit him.

183
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,615
It was just a joke.

184
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,036
What, guys can't joke around a little?

185
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,042
And what do you think, sir?

186
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,752
My son says...

187
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,964
he did nothing wrong.

188
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,635
Are you claiming

189
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,136
- that you're innocent?
- Yes.

190
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,306
Dad, didn't you tell him in advance?

191
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,392
So Attorney Cho...

192
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,229
Can you get him off the hook?

193
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,105
He isn't innocent though.

194
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,649
You have to make that happen as my lawyer.

195
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,819
I'll pay you a fat retainer.

196
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,488
Son, just relax. It's okay.

197
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,448
It was just a joke, right?

198
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,787
Can we get some sides here?

199
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,128
Is Munjeong going to be okay?

200
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,964
I talked to her on the way out.
She's fine now.

201
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,719
I wish she could take a few days off.

202
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,095
- Isn't she busy with a bunch of trials?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,055
I can take on a few of her cases.

204
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,142
Let me know if you need help.
I owe Munjeong too.

205
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,476
Yeah.

206
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,355
- Let me know if you need me.
- It's fine. I have it covered.

207
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,235
- Did you get a perm?
- It looks nice, right?

208
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:40,987
Yeah.

209
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,072
Right. Did you hear
that my boss and your boss

210
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,908
ran into each other in court?

211
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,535
No, I didn't.

212
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,080
They were on opposing sides
of the same case.

213
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,789
What? A conflict of interest?

214
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,667
- Yeah.
- He really takes just any case.

215
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,377
Who agreed to withdraw?

216
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,837
Mine would never back out.

217
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,215
Mine's not one to cave that easily either.

218
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,177
Clients from both sides heard
and couldn't trust them, so they canceled.

219
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,428
They're both off the case now.

220
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,097
Geez, serves you right.

221
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,268
Not your boss. Mine.

222
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,694
- Bye.
- Bye. Get home safe.

223
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

224
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,371
What happened? What's wrong?

225
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,499
It's nothing.

226
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,419
Is the school violence case
not going well?

227
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,422
No, it's not that.

228
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,258
I took on another school violence case.

229
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,512
This time, I'm defending the perpetrator.

230
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,680
Gosh, some things never change.

231
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,099
Hey, that's just how Mr. Seong is.

232
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,601
Just keep it strictly business.

233
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,561
Says the one
who couldn't stand him and left.

234
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,064
I only left

235
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,274
because I was offered more money.

236
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,779
So? Are you happy
now that you earn more?

237
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,951
I have to be happy!

238
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,673
Pull an all-nighter because of me?

239
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,800
Why are you already back?
I told you to rest.

240
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,261
Forget it. I'm fine.

241
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,305
Hey. If things are hard, say it.
Don't just say you're fine.

242
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,766
I am fine.

243
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,272
Want me to get you a coffee?
You said decaf's okay, right?

244
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,941
You've learned a lot
from your girlfriend.

245
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,735
I'll buy coffee later.

246
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,621
- Ms. Jang, could you submit this for me?
- Yes? Sure.

247
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,542
JOB LISTING DETAILS
HIRING EXPERIENCED LAWYER

248
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,837
Well, this isn't...

249
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,841
He didn't say to upload it now.
He said to just get it ready.

250
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,011
I was just going to save it for now.

251
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,221
MANAGING PARTNER
NA KYUNGMIN

252
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,438
Hey, there.

253
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,564
Are you feeling okay?

254
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,609
- Are you planning to post a job listing?
- Oh, that?

255
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,571
I told them to have
something ready just in case.

256
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,156
It's just to have some resumes on hand.

257
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,075
- Are you hiring my replacement?
- We're not hiring right away.

258
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,745
- We don't know what will happen with you.
- Exactly.

259
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,207
We don't know, so why jump the gun?

260
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,418
- Are you telling me to leave?
- No.

261
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,046
Don't think of it that way.

262
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,173
I'm just worried. That's all.

263
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,507
I'm still good enough to work.

264
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,220
If something comes up, I'll let you know.

265
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,847
Until then, you don't have to worry.

266
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,483
My goodness, you're back.

267
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,443
Yes.

268
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,986
Attorney Cho.

269
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,072
What's written here...

270
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,531
Is this correct?

271
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,075
Yes, it is.

272
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,577
You want the charges dropped?

273
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,372
Yes.

274
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,583
But the evidence is pretty solid.

275
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,919
To say it wasn't assault at all,

276
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,380
that's a little...

277
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,928
It may look like assault
just from the photos.

278
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,056
But...

279
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,893
it was just a result
of kids joking around.

280
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,272
Kids joking around?

281
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,735
Yes. And apparently,
that student tends to get bruises easily.

282
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,126
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

283
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,836
- Attorney Cho.
- Yes?

284
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,338
The result
of Moon Chanyeong's case arrived.

285
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,673
I put it on your desk.

286
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,342
Okay, thank you.

287
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,353
Damn it.

288
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,450
RESULT OF DECISION
INDICTED WITHOUT DETENTION

289
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,582
MOON CHANYEONG

290
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,053
Attorney Cho.

291
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,263
Yes?

292
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,141
Does this mean I'm going to jail now?

293
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,521
An indictment just means
the case is going to trial.

294
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,148
It doesn't mean you're guilty.

295
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,317
Are you still...

296
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,362
going to argue self-defense?

297
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,910
About that...

298
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,914
I'm thinking about
what would be best for you.

299
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,833
What would you like to do?

300
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,170
I know...

301
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,841
that I did something wrong.

302
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,052
But...

303
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,100
Still, it's so unfair.

304
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,397
Attorney Cho, I'm so scared.

305
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,733
I don't want to go to jail.

306
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,011
I heard there were disagreements
about the corporate tax,

307
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,973
so I had it sorted out.

308
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,686
First of all, the amount paid

309
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,274
will be based on the net profit
calculated by each firm.

310
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,860
Going by revenue is much simpler though.

311
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,155
For expenses used on
entertaining or golf with guests,

312
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,742
if there were no records of who it was for
and how they were entertained,

313
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,034
they weren't counted as expenses.

314
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm on board with this.

315
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,997
And on the last page,

316
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,418
you'll see the amount of corporate tax
that each firm has to pay.

317
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,712
Take a look,
and if there are no major issues,

318
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,547
we'll move forward with this.

319
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,009
- Okay, then...
- It looks good.

320
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,802
- Let's go with it.
- Yes, sounds good to me.

321
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,888
All right, then.

322
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,350
Will we be able to afford
to do this next year too?

323
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,103
We lost a case for nothing.

324
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,481
The feeling is mutual.

325
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,941
Just a heads-up here.

326
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,777
If a similar situation occurs next time,

327
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,113
I won't be backing down.

328
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,867
I knew merging
wouldn't be all positives.

329
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,787
But still, it's been trying in many ways.

330
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,298
This merger was decided on by all of you.

331
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,555
As you know,
revenue has increased significantly.

332
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,270
I'm aware of the issues
the merger has caused.

333
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,398
If there's anything I can help with,
don't hesitate to let me know.

334
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,484
Okay.

335
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,999
<i>It's just to have some resumes on hand.</i>

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,086
We don't know what will happen with you.

337
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,728
I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS

338
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,322
MIN JEONGIN

339
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,732
Munjeong!

340
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,151
It's been too long.

341
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,570
How long has it been?

342
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,780
Right?

343
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,865
You look great.

344
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,950
Really?

345
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,994
I've been feeling off lately.

346
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,621
What are you talking about?

347
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,332
You look way better
than when you were an in-house counsel.

348
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:42,129
Back then, you always looked drained,
like a fish with dead eyes.

349
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,256
I agree.

350
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,508
I guess litigation suits you.

351
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,093
You look great too.

352
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,596
Me?

353
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,766
I'm just your average working mom now.

354
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,061
Do you feel more relaxed
than when you did litigation?

355
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,520
How's the vibe of the legal team here?

356
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,981
You've done it before, so you know.

357
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,901
It's a whole different world
from Seocho-dong.

358
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,237
But here,

359
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,909
I can come in and leave with my kid,
and that's nice.

360
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,244
- They go to your company's daycare, right?
- Yeah.

361
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,872
At what month did they start going?

362
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,792
Did you go back to work
right after giving birth?

363
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,754
Are you pregnant?

364
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,589
- Yes.
- My gosh!

365
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,299
My goodness!

366
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,097
- Congratulations! That's amazing!
- Thanks.

367
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,766
You must have a lot on your mind, right?

368
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,851
Yeah.

369
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,938
By the way,

370
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,401
how do you take maternity
or parental leave here?

371
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,534
Counsel, are you maintaining
the claim of self-defense?

372
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,035
Yes, Your Honor.

373
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,371
All right.

374
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,832
We'll conclude the evidence review.

375
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,294
Would you like to question
the defendant, Counsel?

376
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,804
Yes, Your Honor.

377
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,023
COUNSEL'S SEAT, DEFENDANT'S SEAT

378
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,528
Mr. Moon, what grade are you in right now?

379
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,239
I'm a senior in high school.

380
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,284
It's pretty rare
to transfer schools as a senior.

381
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,703
What caused you to transfer?

382
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,414
I was bullied...

383
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,626
for over a year.

384
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,170
PROSECUTOR'S SEAT

385
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,507
It became too hard to keep attending,
so you transferred, correct?

386
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,261
Yes.

387
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,766
What is the name of the student
who bullied you?

388
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,354
It's Kim Jeongmin.

389
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,943
When Kim Jeongmin showed up
at your new school,

390
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,446
how did that make you feel?

391
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,543
"This is never going to end."

392
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,298
Even if I reported him...

393
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,802
Even if he got punished...

394
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,140
Even if he got expelled
and I transferred schools...

395
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,853
I knew it wasn't going to end.

396
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,191
<i>When Kim Jeongmin came</i>

397
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,443
<i>and held a knife up to you,</i>

398
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,280
you fought back for the first time
and the knife fell, correct?

399
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,326
Yes, that's correct.

400
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:04,623
You stated you grabbed the knife
because you felt you had to get it first.

401
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,001
What was going through your mind
in that moment?

402
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,604
"I want to live."

403
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,069
"I don't want to die."

404
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,991
At that moment,

405
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,785
if the one who grabbed the knife first

406
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,914
was him and not you,
what would've happened?

407
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,294
I wouldn't be here right now.

408
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:00,929
Nothing further, Your Honor.

409
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,394
Would the prosecutor
like to cross-examine?

410
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,105
No, Your Honor.

411
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,650
All right.
Defendant, please return to your seat.

412
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,495
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

413
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,291
We request

414
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:34,129
a sentence of one year and three months,
suspended for two years.

415
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,470
You're requesting a suspended sentence?

416
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,306
Yes, Your Honor.
Based on all of the circumstances,

417
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,559
we're requesting probation.

418
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,647
Okay, I understand.

419
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,577
- Hello.
- Hello.

420
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,663
Okay.

421
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,707
Attorney Ahn,
I need you for a consult later.

422
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,001
Okay, sir.

423
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,554
- It just got rescheduled to tomorrow.
- Okay.

424
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,522
FAMILY RELATIONS CERTIFICATE

425
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,525
I requested a family registry
for the first time in a while.

426
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,903
It turns out our father had passed away.

427
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,781
- And you weren't aware?
- No.

428
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,827
Our parents divorced 20 years ago,
and we've had no contact with him since.

429
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:53,083
I didn't feel great about it,
so I got in touch with our relatives.

430
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,544
Apparently, he passed
less than a month ago.

431
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,421
And...

432
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,971
You two hadn't heard
about your father this whole time?

433
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,098
No.

434
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,268
We weren't in contact with him
after the divorce.

435
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,354
It's been over 20 years
since we heard from him.

436
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,482
Then, you probably
don't even know he remarried.

437
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,363
Hyeonwoo!

438
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,992
Say hello.

439
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,494
Hello.

440
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,331
Hi.

441
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,835
<i>It felt a little strange.</i>

442
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,255
Our parents got divorced
when we were about his age.

443
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,760
His second wife passed away last year
from a chronic illness.

444
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,513
Our father passed away
from cancer this year.

445
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:53,518
In a case like this,
are we still included in the inheritance?

446
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,272
Yes, you are still legal heirs
despite the divorce and living separately.

447
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,902
Right now, it's the two of you
and this child, so it's three joint heirs.

448
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,820
I see.

449
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,074
Then, we'll need to take action too.

450
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,829
From what we found,
he had a lot more debt than assets.

451
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,708
In that case,
can we just renounce the inheritance?

452
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,087
It's been less than a month
since he passed,

453
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,672
so you can file for renunciation.

454
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,801
It is possible, but...

455
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,266
Never mind. Renouncing is the best option.

456
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,728
Okay, let's go ahead with that.

457
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,438
Okay, then.

458
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,990
Once you renounce,
isn't that the end of it?

459
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,619
Technically, yes.
But I'm just worried about the kid.

460
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,790
If my clients renounce,
all that debt goes over to him.

461
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,710
- He can't renounce his inheritance?
- No.

462
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,756
When all the children renounce,
the siblings are next in line.

463
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:10,720
But one of them is the child's guardian,
and they'd have to renounce for him.

464
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,266
If they do that, the debt shifts to them.
So chances are, they won't.

465
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:19,771
- You want it done for the kid too, right?
- Yes.

466
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,190
Getting consent from them won't be easy.

467
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,737
Goodness. I renounced my inheritance
when my dad passed too.

468
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,075
Tracking everyone down
one by one was no joke.

469
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,176
The verdict comes out today, right?

470
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,137
- Yeah, at 2:00 p.m.
- What do you think?

471
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,017
No idea.

472
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:20,080
Ms. Kim, did Chanyeong
go to hear the verdict?

473
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,166
Yes, with our office manager.

474
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,751
Did his grandmother go too?

475
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,795
No, he went alone.

476
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,798
Is that so?

477
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,944
You're Moon Chanyeong's attorney, right?

478
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,446
Yes, Your Honor.

479
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,698
Please come join your client.

480
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,463
Defendant Moon Chanyeong.

481
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:10,799
Yes?

482
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,760
Before I read the verdict,

483
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,265
I want to say this was
a difficult case for us as well.

484
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,227
We recognize the defendant
was a victim of school violence.

485
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,272
And we agree
the plaintiff Kim Jeongmin's aggression

486
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,857
was ongoing as well.

487
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,110
This means

488
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,072
we recognize the element of immediacy
that justifies self-defense.

489
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,701
However,

490
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,162
in regards to the act of stabbing
Kim Jeongmin with a knife,

491
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,832
we cannot say

492
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,751
it meets the standard

493
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,004
of social acceptability
as a means of defense.

494
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,089
Therefore,

495
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,426
we cannot accept
the claim of self-defense.

496
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,931
That said,

497
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,435
since even the prosecution
has requested a suspended sentence,

498
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,228
it's clear that all parties

499
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,023
have taken the circumstances
of this case into account.

500
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,650
We will now deliver the verdict.

501
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:18,116
The defendant Moon Chanyeong is sentenced
to one year and three months in prison.

502
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,827
However, this sentence
will be suspended for two years

503
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,456
from the date of the ruling.

504
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,342
You did well.

505
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,219
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

506
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,972
PROSECUTOR'S SEAT

507
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,331
<i>Who wants dinner? It's on me.</i>

508
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>Me.</i>

509
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,722
That's amazing. Well done, Cho Changwon.

510
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,268
No. All the credit goes to the prosecutor.

511
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,354
I mean, I fought for my client.

512
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,440
But it's not easy
for a prosecutor to go that far.

513
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,781
Hey. What would you have been
if you hadn't become a lawyer?

514
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,035
- Why ask that all of a sudden?
- Well...

515
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,037
I was honestly surprised.

516
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,123
Ever see a suspended sentence request
for attempted murder?

517
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,541
Nope.

518
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,252
I've never seen it
for even lesser charges.

519
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,503
Exactly.

520
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,423
Even the judge looked surprised.

521
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,717
So, it made me think.

522
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,013
If I were the prosecutor,
could I have done that?

523
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,318
I mean, did you ever
want to be something else?

524
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,362
Well...

525
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,156
I did, but I decided not to.

526
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,283
What was it?

527
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,576
I'm not doing it, so why tell you?

528
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,829
- Come on, what was it? Tell me.
- I don't want to!

529
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,330
- You don't want to?
- No.

530
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,167
Then, take a hike.

531
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,172
- Are you crazy?
- Cheers.

532
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,686
<i>I'm heading to prison now.</i>

533
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,606
<i>Was there a reason you became a lawyer?</i>

534
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,149
You just kept studying
and ended up as one.

535
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,901
<i>A lawyer's job is to translate</i>

536
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,069
<i>what a client wants to say
into legal terms.</i>

537
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,156
That's it. We're just technicians.

538
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,407
<i>You're requesting a suspended sentence?</i>

539
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,827
Yes, Your Honor.
Based on all of the circumstances,

540
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,663
we're requesting probation.

2025 PROSECUTOR APPLICATION GUIDE
FOR EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS

542
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,030
What is your name?

543
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,825
Shin Jihye.

544
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,784
Okay. What can I do for you?

545
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,370
My husband is dead.

546
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,793
What happened?

547
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,546
He took his own life.

548
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,385
He was an insurance agent.

549
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,972
FOR PERFORMANCE AND INCOME,
IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER

550

<i>Hey. It's me, Taehyeon.</i>

551
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,145
How are you?

552
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,897
Yeah. Well...

553
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,651
<i>He was with a firm called Deus GA.</i>

554
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,820
<i>Pressure on performance there was high.</i>

555
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,406
Do you happen to have
any cancer insurance?

<i>If they didn't meet the daily quota,</i>

557
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,995
<i>the whole team wasn't allowed to go home.</i>

558
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,039
<i>And if nothing worked,</i>

559
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,500
<i>you'd have to sign up for a policy
under your name just to go home.</i>

CONTRACTOR
KIM TAEHYEON

561
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,507
We can finally go home now.

562
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,222
If you can't make a sale,
you should've done this earlier.

563
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,390
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

564
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,516
Good night.

565
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,977
- We can go home now.
- Good night.

566
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,478
- We're finally going home.
- Good night.

567
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,397
- I'm so tired.
- I have to take a cab now.

568
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,274
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

569
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,358
- Good night!
- Good night!

570
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,111
Let's do our best again tomorrow.

571
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,158
Geez.

572
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,342
Honey.

573
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,097
Honey?

574
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,099
- What?
- Here.

575
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,477
You forgot your phone.

576
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,985
<i>I could see him slowly falling apart.</i>

577
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,926
What? He came in today?

578
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,845
Great. I guess we're working late again.

579
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,264
So annoying.

580
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,525
All right.
Let's try to do well today. Okay?

581
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,653
It looks like we're not going home again.

582
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,321
- Again?
- He always just sits there.

583
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,323
- What is he doing?
- It'll be overtime again.

584
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,451
Shouldn't you feel bad
for being inept?

585
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,703
- He's making us suffer.
- He has no clue.

586
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,621
- He's so bad.
- Incompetent and irresponsible.

587
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,748
- Seriously.
- Unbelievable.

588
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,875
He's hopeless.

589
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,629
But I didn't know
he was struggling that much.

590
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,382
I figured...

591
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,469
stuff like this only happened to others.

592
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,476
Are you planning to sue the firm?

593
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,145
I already filed the complaint.

594
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,649
But doing it alone is overwhelming.

595
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,486
Right.

596
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,992
I'm sorry. Attorney Ahn,
could I have a moment?

597
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,546
Just wrap things up.
Don't let her hire you.

598
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,216
- Why?
- Things got a little messy.

599
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,927
I should've told her not to come,
but the message wasn't conveyed.

600
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,180
Just make something up and slip out.

601
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,516
You'll have another consultation later.
You'll see then.

602

FAMILY RELATIONS CERTIFICATE

603
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,050
Hello, this is Attorney Kang Huiji.

604
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,386
I'm sorry to bother you.

605
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,432
You mentioned you visited the child once.

606
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,726
Would you mind telling me
where he lived?

607
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,043
We thought it'd be best to include him
in the inheritance renunciation.

608
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,213
We'll handle that ourselves.

609
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,923
We heard
you're Jinyeong and Jina's lawyer.

610
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,468
Then, just focus on them.
Why bother us?

611
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,222
Jinyeong and Jina
will renounce their inheritance.

612
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,017
That leaves Hyeonwoo as the only heir,

613
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,105
which means all of Kim Wonho's debt
would go to him.

614
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,732
If you agree, we'll include the child
in the renunciation.

615
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,818
Then, what about us?

616
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,945
If he also renounces,
it'll all fall on us.

617
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,781
You think I wouldn't know that?

618
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,325
It's not like you're including us too.

619
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,459
What if I can?

620
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,797
Well, then...

621
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,091
Go ahead.

622
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,232
You're from Deus GA?

623
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,902
Yes. Hello.

624
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,861
I'm the branch manager.

625
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,530
And this is our president.

626
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:01,699
Hello.

627
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,159
STATEMENT OF FACTS

628
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,829
Our company isn't that overbearing.

629
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,915
You'll know once you look
at this statement of facts.

630
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:14,336
All of our agents confirmed
we didn't operate oppressively like that.

631
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,547
I do feel for his wife. I really do.

632
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,384
But asking us for damages?
That's a bit much.

633
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,638
You saw her earlier, didn't you?
Shin Jihye.

634
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,098
- Yes.
- She keeps making a scene

635
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,934
about taking this to court,

636
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,478
so we have no choice
but to start preparing ourselves.

637
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,439
Excuse me. Making a scene?

638
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,193
Don't talk like that
about someone who's hurting.

639
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,488
Yes, sir. I apologize.

640
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,454
- Sir, what's going on?
- About what?

641
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,164
How did they find out about us?

642
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,541
Well, I don't know.

643
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,046
You want to take their case now?

644
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:01,717
They're paying a much higher fee.
What can we do? We can't take both sides.

645
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,929
This could be a problem.

646
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,474
Ms. Shin never officially retained us.

647
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,309
It's not even against
Attorney-at-law Act.

648
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,395
What's the issue?

649
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,357
Still, she came to us first
and we were in discussion.

650
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,110
You can't reject her without any reason
just to take a bigger fee.

651
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,322
What? You don't want it?
I'll hand it off to Attorney Bae then.

652
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,166
No, I'll do it.

653
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,587
When we file for Kim Jinyeong and Kim Jina
to renounce inheritance,

654
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,592
how about including their half-sibling
and relatives too?

655
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,429
But they're not our clients.

656
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,056
That's true,

657
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,142
but it's just a matter
of adding their names.

658
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,144
It won't be complicated or extra work.

659
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,771
More work isn't really the issue.

660
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,358
That's something
you can adjust on your own.

661
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,361
But we're not doing this for charity.

662
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,989
We can't just do it for free.

663
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,535
But if only our clients
renounce the inheritance,

664
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,912
that child ends up taking on all the debt.

665
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,706
That can cause concern,

666
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:19,044
but we can't take on every case
that weighs on our minds.

667
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,837
Let me try convincing them again.

668
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,382
Could we at least add the child?

669
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,267
I really do admire this about you,

670
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,312
but my perspective's a bit different.

671
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,857
I get that it's heartbreaking.

672
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,985
But when we're working,
let's set our emotions aside.

673
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,627
<i>It's only natural to say that,
but it was still surprising.</i>

674
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,255
I thought she was someone
who was similar to me.

675
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,218
It was likely the right call as a boss.

676
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,804
It's easier to justify things that way.

677
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,351
At times like this,
just say I'm right and take my side.

678
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,436
Wait.

679
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,980
You said it was only natural
to say that too.

680
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,066
I just said that to be polite.

681
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,486
As my boyfriend,
you should do the same for me.

682
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,113
Now, repeat after me.

683
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,572
"Your boss was out of line."

684
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,159
"What's so hard about helping with that?"
Go on.

685
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:40,126
Your boss was out of line.
What's so hard about helping with that?

686
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,002
Good job.

687
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,969
I know what you said wasn't wrong.
My boss has her reasons too.

688
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,348
But he's still just a kid.

689
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,229
If adding clients is the issue,
then I'll have to find another way.

690
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,899
Now, it's your turn.

691
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,401
My turn for what?

692
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,237
Something's bothering you.
It's obvious.

693
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,118
My boss made me turn down a client

694
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,787
and represent the other side instead.

695
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,914
I don't think I'll be able to
find another way.

696
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,251
Wait, what?
Did I understand that right?

697
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,295
A client came to you,

698
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,631
but you turned her down
to represent the opposing side?

699
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,051
Why? Because of the retainer?

700
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,679
Yes, pretty much.

701
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,557
That's so messed up.

702
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,143
It's fine.

703
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,812
Once you get around 10 years,

704
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,731
you have to be.

705
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,483
And I am fine.

706
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,737
You're not saying "nine years" anymore.

707
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,700
Your boss was so wrong.

708
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,418
Try this. It's delicious.

709
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,886
<i>I'm currently employed
at the Gang-ro branch of Deus GA,</i>

710
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,389
<i>and I worked with the late Kim Taehyeon.</i>

711
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,641
<i>After Mr. Kim's death,</i>

712
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,977
<i>claims of the company's pressure
on performance arose</i>

713
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,479
<i>and there were misunderstandings about it.</i>

714
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,856
<i>So I'd like to set the record straight.</i>

715
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,111
<i>Our office has a family-like atmosphere
that doesn't put pressure on performance.</i>

716
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,863
<i>On our team, we encourage
and help each other.</i>

717
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,449
<i>There was no culture
of unreasonable meddling in</i>

718
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,618
<i>or pressuring
our individual performances.</i>

719
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,704
<i>The claim that agents couldn't go home
without meeting quotas</i>

720
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,623
<i>is a delusional exaggeration.</i>

721
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,252
<i>Working hours were flexible
based on one's own task completion.</i>

722
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,170
Geez, you're so frustrating.

723
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,966
<i>The late Mr. Kim had always struggled
to adapt to the company's culture.</i>

724
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,885
<i>Mr. Kim struggled
due to his own limitations</i>...

725
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,555
<i>The company did not pressure
or criticize him much.</i>

726
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,723
<i>They instead made efforts to support him.</i>

727
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,561
<i>I hereby sign and affirm
that this statement is true.</i>

728
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,604
<i>Kim Juhyeok.</i>

729
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,402
Goodness!

730
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,989
Attorney Ahn,
what brings you here so unexpectedly?

731
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,574
Hello.

732
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,367
Would it be possible to meet the people

733
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,620
who signed the statement of facts
you gave earlier?

734
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,540
Why?

735
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,543
I'd like to get a clearer picture
of the atmosphere here.

736
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:29,670
Sure.

737
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,672
Okay, but...

738
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,008
most of them are busy.

739
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,510
Maybe one or two at most are available.

740
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,345
Yes, that's fine.

741
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,478
It's all true.

742
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,816
You mentioned Mr. Kim
always had trouble fitting in.

743
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,609
In what way was that so?

744
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,694
Well...

745
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,404
He'd look drained
as soon as he came in for work.

746
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:59,282
He barely said hi to people.

747
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,202
Was that from the beginning
or did he change over time?

748
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,871
I'm not sure.

749
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,582
But he was definitely like that
toward the end.

750
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,002
I thought maybe his depression
had come back.

751
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,046
What? His depression came back?

752
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,548
So he had always suffered from depression?

753
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,635
Yes, he said he struggled with it
when he was younger.

754
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,387
So he was already dealing
with mental health issues.

755
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,598
How did you know that?

756
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,184
We used to be close at first.

757
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,978
We'd have drinks,
and he would talk about his past.

758
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,814
He said he struggled a bit
when he was younger.

759
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,653
So you're saying he didn't always
have trouble fitting in?

760
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,115
Did I say that?

761
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,618
I guess so.

762
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,203
- Yes.
- Attorney Ahn.

763
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,871
What does that matter now?

764
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,500
What matters is that
we weren't the cause, right?

765
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:56,465
Yes.

766
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,353
SHIN JIHYE, DEUS GA

767
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,697
We'll proceed with our next case.

768
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:24,576
Civil case number 2025-37845.

769
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,831
Plaintiff, Shin Jihye.
Defendant, Deus GA.

770
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,347
Who is in attendance?

771
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,435
This is the plaintiff, Shin Jihye.
And I'm Attorney Kim Sehyeon.

772
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,561
For the defendant,

773
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,606
I'm Attorney Ahn Juhyeong
with Law Group Kyungmin.

774
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,025
Okay, have a seat.

775
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,905
The defendant

776
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,574
enforced oppressive practices,

777
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:09,580
such as not allowing
an entire sales team to go home

778
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,249
if an agent were unable
to meet their quota.

779
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,003
The plaintiff's husband
developed depression due to this stress,

780
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,046
and this ultimately led to his suicide.

781
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,718
Therefore, the defendant is liable
to compensate the plaintiff for damages.

782
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,219
Okay, I understand.

783
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,014
First off, we've received
the NHIS's response

784
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,433
to the document submission order.

785
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,436
- Defense counsel, have you received this?
- Yes, Your Honor.

786
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,189
Okay, please present your statement.

787
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,943
According to the documents
submitted by the NHIS,

788
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,737
the plaintiff's husband, the late Mr. Kim,

789
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:46,283
had already been diagnosed
with depression in his twenties.

790
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,367
To claim damages from the defendant,

791
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:52,413
the plaintiff must prove a link
between the suicide and the depression

792
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:56,167
and another between the depression
and the work he did at his company.

793
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,211
However, Mr. Kim's depression

794
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:01,297
appears to have existed
before he joined the company.

795
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,884
Therefore, it has no connection
to the defendant.

796
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,012
No! That's not true!

797
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,056
I don't know how he was
when he was younger,

798
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,059
but after we got married,
he never showed any signs of it.

799
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,394
Per the statements
submitted by other agents,

800
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,899
the defendant's company was not operated
in the manner the plaintiff claims.

801
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,195
Since the burden of proof
lies with the plaintiff,

802
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:26,281
and because she has not provided...

803
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,454
evidence to overcome this...

804
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,668
we request the court
to dismiss this claim.

805
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,728
There's one thing
I didn't get to explain last time.

806
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,441
It's best for both of you
to renounce your inheritance.

807
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,151
It's the simplest option.

808
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,154
But if you both make that decision,

809
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,367
all of your father's debts
will be given to Kim Hyeonwoo.

810
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,829
Won't he give up his inheritance too?

811
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,331
If he does, that debt
will pass on to your father's siblings.

812
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,501
They're currently taking care of Hyeonwoo.

813
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,963
That's why they won't
let him renounce it.

814
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,383
It'll all go to the child?

815
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,557
There's another option you can take
aside from renouncing inheritance.

816
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,768
It's called qualified acceptance.

817
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,769
QUALIFIED ACCEPTANCE

818
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,937
What's that?

819
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:45,151
If renunciation means
you don't inherit assets or even debts,

820
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,236
qualified acceptance means
you only repay debts

821
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,447
up to the value of assets
your father left behind.

822
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,782
If the debts exceed the assets,

823
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,285
you're not responsible
for repaying all of that.

824
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:58,581
So for us,
it's basically the same as renunciation?

825
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,750
That's right. If you go with this

826
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,960
and even if Hyeonwoo
renounces his inheritance too,

827
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,755
your father's debts
won't move on to his siblings.

828
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,424
It all ends with you.

829
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,218
That would make your relatives
willing to let Hyeonwoo renounce.

830
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,763
Then, we can do that.

831
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,891
Yes, but there's a catch though.

832
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,060
Renunciation can be wrapped up
in a few days

833
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,687
or a couple of weeks at most.

834
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,149
But qualified acceptance takes longer
and is more complicated.

835
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,902
You'd have to provide
a detailed accounting

836
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,238
of every asset and debt your father left.

837
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,201
You might even need to go through
extra steps like inheritance bankruptcy.

838
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,171
Honestly, if it were just about you two,

839
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,383
I'd be right to recommend a renunciation.

840
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,052
But if you're willing to wait a little,

841
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,722
I'll handle all of the bothersome steps.

842
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,518
So how about considering
qualified acceptance as an option?

843
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,568
What if Jina renounces
and only I do qualified acceptance?

844
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,570
Yes, that's possible.

845
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:15,242
We'd still get the same results
you mentioned, right?

846
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:16,785
Yes.

847
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,957
- I'll proceed with qualified acceptance.
- I'll do it too.

848
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,961
I just thought
maybe you'd wanted to renounce.

849
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,964
If our renouncing
means that kid takes on all the debt,

850
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,216
I wouldn't want that.

851
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,136
Thank you for letting us know.

852
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,180
No, thank you.

853
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,060
Let's move forward with this.

854
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,563
Okay, then.

855
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,664
QUALIFIED ACCEPTANCE

856
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,962
So can we go ahead
and file for Hyeonwoo's renunciation?

857
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,381
Yes, go ahead.

858
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,050
Let us know when it's done.

859
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,261
Yes, I will.

860
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,445
Hello?

861
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:38,200
<i>Hello, Attorney Ahn. This is Kim Juhyeok.</i>

862
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:39,950
Who is this?

863
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:44,247
<i>You came by our office the other day.
The insurance agency.</i>

864
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,708
<i>I'm the one you discussed
the statement of facts with.</i>

865
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,794
I see. Yes.

866
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,587
<i>You wouldn't happen to need insurance,
would you?</i>

867
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,672
<i>Cancer or accident coverage?
Pension insurance?</i>

868
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,258
<i>We have everything.</i>

869
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,810
You haven't clocked out yet?

870
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,395
What?

871
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,814
Well...

872
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,858
No, it's not like that.

873
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,362
Hello?

874
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:17,989
<i>Hello?</i>

875
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,703
- Okay, I'll sign up for one.
<i>- Really?</i>

876
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,415
<i>Thank you. Yes, thank you.</i>

877
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,334
Why didn't you do that earlier?

878
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,086
- I'm sick of this.
- Get it right.

879
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,963
- Go on.
- Good night.

880
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,715
I appreciate your hard work.

881
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:37,801
Hey, good work.

882
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,472
The ruling for the Deus GA case
just came in.

883
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,559
- Should I leave it here?
- I'll take it.

884
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,143
Okay.

885
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,980
You won. Congratulations.

886
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,733
I won?

887
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,319
Yes.

888
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:58,238
Thank you.

889
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,323
Sure.

894
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,129
Yes, come in.

895
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,311
The ruling on Shin Jihye's case came in.

896
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,771
Which case?

897
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,482
The case with Deus GA.

898
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,735
I see.

899
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,279
Congratulations, we won the case.

900
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,906
You came just to tell me that?

901
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,659
- Yes, I wanted to report it to you.
- Why report this like it's a big deal?

902
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,287
I wanted to report this one.

903
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,838
You were never bothered
by this kind of stuff.

904
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,507
What's different this time?

905
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:06,222
It had always bothered me.

906
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,017
I just got used to the discomfort.

907
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,689
I thought you and I were similar,

908
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,067
but I guess not.

909
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,779
No, I guess not.

910
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,456
Come in.

911
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,669
- Ma'am.
- Yes, Attorney Kang.

912
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,506
It's about Kim Jinyeong
and Kim Jina's case.

913
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,590
Yes?

914
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,760
We're proceeding
with qualified acceptance.

915
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:47,180
We'll file the renunciation for the child.

916
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,307
And we've received the retainer.

917
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,521
Is that so?

918
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,526
All right. If you've done all that,

919
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,653
then what more can I ask for?

920
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,367
Thank you, ma'am.

921
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,121
Okay, you're free to go.

922
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,353
Aren't you coming to dinner?

923
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:36,855
I am.

924
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,274
What happened with the case?

925
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,984
We're going with qualified acceptance.

926
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,069
Good call.

927
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,570
You did a good job.

928
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,822
What about you?

929
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,743
I won.

930
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,418
Good job.

931
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,008
Thanks.

932
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,523
The seats...

933
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:33,036
Five <i>tonkotsu</i> ramen
and three orders of gyoza, please.

934
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,746
- Could you pass the soy sauce?
- Thank you.

935
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,373
- What?
- She wants the soy sauce.

936
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,339
- Here.
- Thanks.

937
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,673
Why are your hands so cold?

938
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:51,053
- They always get cold when I'm stressed.
- Did something happen?

939
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,138
Nope.

940
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,267
Other than the boss trying to hire
a replacement before anyone quits.

941
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,852
What happened?

942
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,648
She's probably talking about
that job posting thing.

943
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,608
Don't pay it too much mind.

944
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,444
- What did he say?
- Don't pay it too much mind.

945
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,655
Don't pay it too much mind.

946
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,656
Thanks.

947
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,324
- She says thanks.
- She says thanks.

948
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,327
- She says thanks.
- No need.

949
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,960
All right. You all did a great job.

950
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:23,878
Great job, everyone.

951
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:50,405
Law and The City

952
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:28,651
Law and The City

953
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,570
<i>It's not like you
to take on a case like this.</i>

954
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:32,738
This is it?

955
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,323
What kind of case is this?

956
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,700
I heard they can't pay the retainer.

957
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:39,579
<i>Do you feel bad for the old man?</i>

958
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,581
<i>I killed someone.</i>

959
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,917
What's there to understand?

960
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,127
It's been a long time.

961
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,420
Please leave.

962
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,589
<i>It was just bad luck.</i>

963
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,591
If this keeps up, I can't work with you.

964
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:53,843
<i>Why are you going this far?</i>

965
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,386
You really don't gain anything from this?

966
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,015
Do you only do things for your gain?
