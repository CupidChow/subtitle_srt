NAM TAEWOO

5
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,271
Hello?

6
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,605
Hey...

7
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,357
<i>Is this Juhyeong?</i>

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,567
Hey, it's been a while.

9
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,903
<i>Hey, how are you doing?</i>

10
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,489
Yeah, I'm good.

11
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,366
What's up?

12
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,829
<i>Geez, this is kind of awkward
to talk about.</i>

13
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,623
<i>I briefly went out
with this client of mine,</i>

14
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,502
<i>but it turns out she's a married woman.</i>

15
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,546
Okay. So?

16
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,340
Well, anyway,

17
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,553
her husband told everyone at work
I'm the guy she cheated with.

18
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,848
Is there any way
to stop this rumor from spreading?

19
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,767
Well, you can't physically stop him.

20
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,102
You can't chase him around
and keep him quiet.

21
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,647
Isn't there anything I can do legally?

22
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,940
You won't be able to stop him directly.

23
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,526
- What about an affair lawsuit?
<i>- It hasn't come up.</i>

24
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,445
<i>If I didn't know she was married,</i>

25
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,365
<i>I don't need to worry, right?</i>

26
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,950
You didn't know?

27
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,036
I honestly didn't know.

28
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:46,040
I have all the texts
that show she lied about being single.

29
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,959
I see. That won't be a problem then.

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,462
Are you suing for defamation?
I'll refer you to another lawyer.

31
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,798
That depends
on where the water is leaking from.

32
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,386
Depending on whether it's leaking
from upstairs or a shared pipe,

33
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,013
it changes who's responsible.

34
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,726
Right, you won't know
until you open it up.

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,856
I don't know.

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,610
I'm a lawyer, not a plumber.

37
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,613
Okay, bye.

38
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,662
Seriously...

39
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,249
Hi.

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,462
Is there any reason
to sue the security guard?

41
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,429
So everyone is okay
with that law student intern program

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,472
I mentioned last time, right?

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,141
I can't afford to do that.

44
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,184
A lot of small costs
add up here and there.

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,729
- How will you handle that?
- You won't have to worry.

46
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,857
It won't be any trouble to you.
I'll take care of it.

47
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,316
Okay, then. If you say so.

48
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,862
I don't have much of a reason to say no.

49
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,239
But honestly, I'm not sure
if it's necessary.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,991
Well, I've never done it before.

51
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,619
I'm not sure how it works,
so I wasn't that interested.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,208
Promoting the firm
to clients is important,

53
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,796
but you also have to create connections
with potential lawyers,

54
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,301
so great attorneys
will join down the line.

55
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,473
You really sound
like you're part of our firm.

56
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,517
I am grateful
the company has grown thanks to you.

57
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,189
But still,
you're not actually one of us, right?

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,443
That last comment
kind of crossed the line a bit.

59
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,197
There's been no word
of giving us a case either.

60
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:47,370
I do think it'd be good
if law students got to know our firm.

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,538
Don't you all agree?

62
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,540
- I wouldn't say no to it.
- Me neither.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,959
Of course, it's good.

64
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,086
Who doesn't know that?

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm not opposed to it either

66
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,174
as long as you handle everything.

67
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,053
Thank you so much.

68
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,514
I'll do my best to make it work.

69
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,682
Can I order a dessert?

70
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,936
Of course.

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,770
Do you like meringues?

72
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,147
- Seriously...
- What?

73
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,151
Yes, thank you.

74
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,489
Here, it's the grand opening.

75
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,989
Here.

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,325
All right.

77
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,412
Thank you...

78
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,166
Hello. It's for the grand opening.

79
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,503

Welcome to Law Group Hyungmin.

87
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,011
Thank you, Attorney Kim.

88
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,889
I'm not a lawyer.

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,474
I'm an advisor.

90
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,561
You're not a lawyer?

91
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,523
Then, when are the other lawyers coming?

92
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,902
Let's go. I'll introduce you to them.

93
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,279
- Okay!
- Sounds good!

94
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,364
Are you busy, Attorney Kang?

95
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,908
Hello, Ms. Kim.

96
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,619
The internship starts today.

97
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,954
If it's okay,
I'd like to introduce them to you.

98
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,039
Of course.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,332
Hello.

100
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,667
- Hello!
- Hello!

101
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,752
This is Attorney Kang Huiji.

102
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,211
It's our pleasure to meet you.

103
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,379
It's our pleasure!

104
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,673
It's a pleasure to meet you as well.

105
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,133
- All right.
- Have a good day.

106
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,260
Take care.

107
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,390
Also, if you have any closed case files,
mind if I take a few?

108
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,268
I'd like the students to take a look.

109
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,646
Thank you, Attorney Ha.

110
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,357
When you have time,
could you help them now and then?

111
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,400
Feel free to give them assignments too.

112
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,819
Yes, of course.

113
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,493
Come in.

114
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,204
Sir, the defendant
for the court-appointed case is here.

115
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,165
Okay. Is she in the conference room?

INDICTMENT
DEFENDANT DO MIKYUNG

NEW LOAN OFFER
EMERGENCY LOANS FOR LOW CREDIT SCORES

118
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,514
I'm sorry. Things are tough right now,

119
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,641
so I could only use
a court-appointed lawyer.

120
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,561
Not at all. Don't worry about that.

121
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,356
You've been charged
with aiding and abetting fraud.

122
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,526
You know why you've been charged, right?

123
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,736
Charged? What does that exactly mean?

124
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,989
Even if I read it,
I honestly have no idea what it means.

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,827
So the prosecution believes
you committed a crime,

126
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,537
so they've sent this case to trial.

127
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,414
That's what we call being "charged."

128
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,541
They're charges
of aiding and abetting fraud.

129
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,710
I get the fraud part,

130
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,712
but what does "aiding and abetting" mean?

131
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,172
Does it mean
I just stood by while it happened?

132
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,299
That's a common misunderstanding.

133
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,177
It means you helped, not just stood by.

134
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,138
It's a type of accomplice.

135
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,224
You're saying I helped commit fraud?

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,228
Yes, it says you were involved
in a voice phishing scheme.

137
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,398
You acted as a money mule.

138
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:49,820
They're saying you withdrew the money
from the scam and handed it off.

139
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,366
That's not true.
All I did was just try to get a loan.

140
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,203
According to the indictment,

141
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,082
after getting a text from someone
calling himself Baek from BX Bank,

142
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,792
you spoke with him on the phone.

143
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,544
Do you remember what was said?

144
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,881
Yes. At first, he said
I wouldn't qualify for a loan.

145
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,758
But then, he said he'd make sure

146
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,259
to help me out to get a loan.

147
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,929
<i>Your account hasn't had much activity,
so your credit rating is low.</i>

148
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,183
<i>We'll help you create
some transactions first.</i>

149
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,393
In my bank account?

150
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,980
<i>I'm only suggesting this
since I trust you, Ms. Do.</i>

151
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,107
Here you go.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,571
<i>First, I'll deposit some money
into your account</i>

153
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,114
<i>to create some transactions.</i>

154
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,991
Thank you.

155
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,954
<i>But you can't keep that money.
You have to return it to us.</i>

156
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,794
- Great job, ma'am.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,379
Thank you.

158
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,928
But in the end,
he never gave me the loan.

159
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,600
Do you happen
to have a recording of that phone call?

160
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,559
I'm not sure.

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,355
- Could I see your phone again?
- Of course.

162
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,027
This happened last November, so...

163
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,864
Here it is.

164
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,824
Here.

165
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,284
BX BANK
BAEK JEONGHYEON

166
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,538
<i>Hello, this is Baek Jeonghyeon
with BX Bank. How may I help you?</i>

167
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,209
<i>I'm calling about the text I got.</i>

168
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,960
The call was recorded.

169
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,380
- Were you questioned by the police alone?
- Yes.

170
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,509
It seems what you just said
wasn't conveyed, so they charged you.

171
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,094
If this recording had been submitted,

172
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,681
it would've been clear
that you were tricked and not involved.

173
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,392
Am I okay then?

174
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,477
It wasn't voice phishing, right?

175
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,230
Well...

176
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,234
The voice phishing victims did transfer
money into your account though.

177
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,990
And you did withdraw that money
and handed it over to the scammers.

178
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,867
But you didn't know it was a scam.

179
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,369
I had no idea.

180
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,414
I also wondered if this was
some kind of voice phishing

181
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,748
and asked him about it.

182
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,501
But he told me it wasn't that.

183
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,753
He didn't ask me for money or anything.

184
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,341
He just said he'd give me a loan,
so I believed him.

185
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,634
Don't worry too much about it.

186
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,305
If you submit
a transcript of this recording,

187
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,140
it'll prove your innocence.

188
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,227
Goodness. Thank you, Attorney Cho!

INDICTMENT
DEFENDANT DO MIKYUNG

190
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,734
<i>The main voice phishing scammers
are usually overseas,</i>

191
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,112
so I heard they track down
all the money mules here

192
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,697
and push for heavy sentences.

193
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,824
I heard some get a few years in prison.

194
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,620
Still, she didn't even know
she was used as a money mule.

195
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,373
How can they charge her
after such a sloppy investigation?

196
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,337
Still can't get a hold of him?

197
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,297
No. It's so annoying.

198
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,300
If I ever get my hands on this bastard...

199
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,219
That unpaid construction cost son of a...

200
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,888
- That person?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,641
We have a site inspection tomorrow.
What is he doing?

202
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,768
I asked for documents,
but I can't reach him.

203
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,228
Filing isn't the end, okay?

204
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,562
Calm down.

205
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,356
The building's not even finished.

206
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,275
They stopped over a payment issue,

207
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,403
so someone who knows the details
needs to be there.

208
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,282
The client's all carefree,
and I'm the one who's stressed.

209
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,326
You'd think I was the one being stiffed.

210
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,954
I did think that.

211
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,291
Hey, it's nice being at a cafe though.

212
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,586
We've always been stuck
in the break room lately.

213
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,797
Are those interns set up
in the break room?

214
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,757
Yeah, did they stop by and say hi?

215
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,759
They asked us to drop by now and then.

216
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,137
- Yeah, they did.
- Was I that baby-faced back then?

217
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,722
They were cute.

218
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,517
They didn't come say hi to me.

219
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,102
Hey.

220
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,689
I guess Ms. Kim also knows now
that you're a jerk.

221
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,731
What are you going to do now?

222
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,401
I was out this morning.
They must've come by then.

223
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,862
Shouldn't we at least do a welcome dinner
or something for them tonight?

224
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,948
I can't tonight.

225
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,409
The contractor probably
won't even show tomorrow,

226
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,620
so I'll have to comb through
whatever documents I have.

227
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,706
How about tomorrow?

228
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,332
I have plans.

229
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,209
- With who?
- He's meeting his high school friends.

230
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,881
Even though I'm in early pregnancy,
my husband insisted on going too.

231
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,635
He said you hadn't come in a while
and used you as his excuse.

232
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,138
He said I needed to be there
as his excuse.

233
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,723
He's buying
to celebrate the baby.

234
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,600
Ridiculous.
Does he think he's the pregnant one?

235
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,854
I can just make plans for tomorrow too.
Let's have the dinner then.

236
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,230
- Sure.
- Yeah, do it tomorrow.

237
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,107
Ms. Kim didn't ask Juhyeong,

238
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,735
- so he won't have to come.
- Right?

239
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,653
I told you I was out then.

240
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,377
Yes.

241
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,846
- Hello!
- Hello!

242
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,390
There's no need to be so formal with us.

243
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,726
Have a seat.
I'm not a professor or your boss.

244
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,186
- Please sit.
- Okay.

245
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,605
- Thank you.
- You're sitting?

246
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,274
I'm just kidding! Sit down.

247
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,359
Okay.

UNJUST ENRICHMENT

249
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,657
- Have you read this too?
- No, not yet.

250
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,117
This was my case.

251
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,744
- Goodness.
- Incredible.

252
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,538
If it's okay, would you like to try
writing a report?

253
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,623
- Sure.
- I'll write one.

254
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,874
- Me too!
- Okay, then.

255
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,127
If anything's unclear,
I can help for a moment.

256
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,520
This looks too complex, like wordplay.
It's hard to follow the word order.

257
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,189
- Ms. Kim?
- Yes?

258
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,901
Could you copy the evidence record
for today's court-appointed case?

259
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,487
- Yes, of course.
- Ms. Kim, hold on.

260
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,489
- It's a court-appointed case, right?
- Yes.

261
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,615
I see.

262
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,828
Copy court-appointed files yourself now.
Don't go through the staff.

263
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,748
This is how we've always done it,
and you approved it too.

264
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,251
Well, not anymore.

265
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:23,548
Technically, court-appointed cases
aren't firm cases. They're personal ones.

266
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,759
Yes, but the firm needs to meet
our pro bono hours.

267
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,636
My court-appointed cases fulfill that.

268
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,390
Does the firm get paid for those?
No, they pay to you.

269
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,685
Ms. Kim, don't worry
about court-appointed cases.

270
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,602
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

271
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,938
Water those plants instead.

272
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,858
Yes, sir.

273
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,028
I'll take care of it.

274
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,914
Thank you.

Damn it.

285
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,567
You guys always show up
right when I take a quick break

286
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,651
and frighten me.

287
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,861
Why are you so startled?

288
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,948
- Were you looking at something weird?
- No.

289
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,658
What are you doing here?

290
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,159
No reason.

291
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,577
Are you busy?

292
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,497
Yeah, because of tomorrow's inspection.

293
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,293
The construction plans changed a lot,
so I need to know them well.

294
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,254
But with no help from the client,
this is all I can do.

295
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,339
By the way,

296
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,299
is it okay to work this late?

297
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,718
Why not? I've always been a night owl.

298
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,138
Shouldn't you stop now?
Because of the baby?

299
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,891
You think so?

300
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,020
Your stomach's gotten bigger too.

301
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:25,855
No, it hasn't.

302
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,356
It hasn't even been that many weeks.

303
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,984
- Really?
- It hasn't.

304
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,197
What are you doing here this late?

305
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,575
That voice phishing case
I mentioned earlier.

306
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,660
It seemed like a simple matter.

307
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,204
Why are you still working on it?

308
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,499
It's not that simple anymore.

309
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,294
Normal cases should be easy to represent.

310
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,632
Even with all that clear evidence
that shows she's innocent,

311
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,425
they still charged her.

312
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,844
Well, yeah.

313
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:02,516
Voice phishing is still prevalent,
so they're cracking down hard.

314
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,436
Exactly. That is what's making me nervous.

315
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:11,400
This seems like an excessive charge,
but I'm worried they'll still convict her.

316
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,111
Geez.

317
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,531
And they can't catch real scumbags
like Jang Sugil.

318
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,452
That prison visit thing
is over now, right?

319
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:26,582
Yeah. It's the first time I've ever wanted
the prosecution to arrest my client.

320
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,417
Wait. I wasn't his attorney.

321
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,045
So he's not even my client.

322
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,547
Don't overthink it. Just let it go.

323
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,593
Instead of catching guys like him,
they're after the wrong people.

324
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,637
So, it keeps bugging me.

00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,367
You're still not picking up?

328
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,171
- You're the defendant and building owner?
- Yes.

329
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,716
- It's only you for the plaintiff side?
- Yes.

330
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,801
Is that so?

331
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,261
Then, let's get started.

332
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,721
Please put these on, everyone.

333
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,223
Okay.

334
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,978
What was the plan for the floor?

335
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,813
Mortar, of course.

336
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,357
- Auto-leveling?
- Yes.

337
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,369
- What ceiling finish did you decide on?
- Sheet molding compound.

338
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,371
You had all the pipes
run through here too?

339
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,457
Pretty much.

340
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,670
What's the spacing
on the tied rebars here?

341
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,758
I'm not sure.
It should be in the blueprints.

342
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,457
Here. You can look at this.

343
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,126
- The blueprints?
- Yes.

344
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,631
You're welcome.

345
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,469
I don't think I've seen
the stair reinforcement blueprint here.

346
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,554
Me neither.

347
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,388
They didn't show it to us.

348
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,515
Here's the blueprint.

349
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,266
We have on record that we sent it.

350
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,394
- They didn't send it.
- We did.

351
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,899
Look, here's the email history.

352
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,651
Thank you, everyone.

353
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,403
- I'll submit the inspection report.
- Okay, thank you.

354
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,489
- Thank you.
- Okay.

355
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,451
What was the original plan
for the access road surface again?

356
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,829
- That was...
- Asphalt concrete.

357
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,206
- What particle size?
- It was 13.

358
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,208
That's what it was from the start.

359
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,086
Thirteen? Thank you.

362
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,214
Where do you get this?

363
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,925
- Sorry?
- I recently became pregnant too.

364
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,468
But I still have a lot to learn.

365
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,013
Really? Congratulations.

366
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,097
How many weeks?

367
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,725
It's been 32 weeks now.

368
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,726
You're almost there.

369
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,770
It must be so hard for you. Right?

370
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,690
Not at all. I'm okay for now.

371
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,379
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

PREGNANT WOMEN FIRST

373
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,141
But seriously, where do you get this?

374
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,560
Geez...

375
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,286
Hey!

376
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,121
Did someone suddenly make you do this?

377
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,209
Attorney Ha asked us
to try writing a review memo.

378
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,961
What are you doing? Let's go.

379
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,172
- Sanggi, did you say this was due today?
- Yeah?

380
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,757
Yeah. What is this?

381
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:31,220
- Still not done? You had enough time.
- We won't make it to dinner.

382
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,846
Just do it by tomorrow.

383
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,266
Attorney Ha,
is it okay to finish it by tomorrow?

384
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,184
By tomorrow...

385
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,435
morning.

386
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,770
- Come on.
- Hey!

387
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,398
Just take your time
and do it by the end of tomorrow.

388
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,984
- Let's go! Move it!
- Hey.

389
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,069
Where's Juhyeong?

390
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,237
- He's meeting his friends.
- Right.

391
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,031
Hey, you got one.

392
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,700
- Cute.
- It's cute.

393
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,368
That's cute.

394
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,246
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see!

395
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,418
Juhyeong!

396
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,005
Hey.

397
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,339
You're here too?

398
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,591
Did I not tell you?
I made sure he came today.

399
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,844
Long time no see.

400
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,512
Yeah, long time no see.

401
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,140
Goodness, everyone's here on time.

402
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,558
Jihun.

403
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,185
When was the last time I saw you?

404
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,939
Was it early July 2021?

405
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,524
You briefly joined us in Sinsa-dong

406
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,109
and left before the second round.

407
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,528
Wasn't that the last time?

408
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,571
Was it?

409
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,199
Why do you even remember stuff like that?

410
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,035
How could I forget?

411
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,537
I even remember
your karaoke song that night.

412
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,955
Are you drinking <i>makgeolli?</i>

413
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,248
- Yeah.
- No.

414
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,209
Just drink <i>makgeolli.</i>
One <i>makgeolli</i> here, please!

415
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,503
Okay!

416
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,423
<i>If I didn't know she was married,</i>

417
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,176
<i>I don't need to worry, right?</i>

418
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:57,765
Juhyeong, what should I prepare
if I want the divorce to work in my favor?

419
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,685
Is there a way I can get my money back?

420
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,146
I need to use the restroom.

421
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,315
- Okay.
- Sure.

422
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,776
Your tie is so tacky...

423
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,861
- I need to go to the restroom too.
- Okay.

424
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,197
It's the kind of thing...

425
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,750
Juhyeong.

426
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,212
I've decided to give things

427
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,881
another shot with my wife.

428
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,468
I'm just thanking you.

429
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,636
For what?

430
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:40,848
Remember what I asked you last time?
Things with my wife weren't great.

431
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,518
You did?

432
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,021
Sorry, I've been
all over the place lately.

433
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,149
It's probably better
that you don't remember.

434
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,277
Geez, you're the king
of being indifferent.

435
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,114
I can't wear something that's cute?

436
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,074
You're wearing pink at your age?

437
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,118
So childish. Seriously.

438
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,912
Geez, it's not right.

439
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,249
How do all of you still look so good?

440
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,750
Life must be treating you well?

441
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,503
There's no reason it wouldn't be.

442
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,547
Exactly.

443
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,967
Our lives have usually been
smooth sailing.

444
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,262
That's true. Except for him.

445
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,639
- Him?
- What?

446
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,685
Did things ever get sorted out?

447
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,689
With what?

448
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,359
- Your affair with that married woman.
- What?

449
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,533
Hey, what was that head shake just now?
Unbelievable.

450
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,326
I mean,

451
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,329
if you had an affair with a married woman,
shaking your head makes sense.

452
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,706
That's pretty messed up.

453
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,082
- Yeah.
- I told you

454
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,918
I didn't know she was married.

455
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,338
What kind of lawyer goes around
airing people's dirty laundry?

456
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,259
I wondered why you showed up tonight.
Just to stir up drama?

457
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,552
Wait, what?

458
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,889
You told Juhyeong about it?

459
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,643
I have no idea what you're talking about.

460
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,980
Then, where did you hear that?

461
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,815
The word's spread all over our office.

462
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,235
He's the hottest gossip
among office workers right now.

463
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,446
- That was about him?
- It was him?

464
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:22,867
Can you please tell people it's not me?

465
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,328
I'm losing it because of that!

466
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,916
I think you owe Juhyeong
an apology though.

467
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,128
Hey, I'm sorry.

468
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,087
- Do it right.
- You punk.

469
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,840
Do it properly, you punk.
Be sincere, man.

470
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,467
I'll handle it! Leave me alone.

471
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,802
- It's fine.
- No, it's not...

472
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,179
- Geez...
- Hey.

473
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,305
Here.

474
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,391
Let's cheers. Come on.

475
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,269
- I'm tipsy.
- Anyways, good job today.

476
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,688
Even though you drank,
go and look over some cases...

477
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,856
- Stop!
- Hey!

478
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,525
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

479
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,237
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!

480
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,572
Anytime.

481
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,158
Well, we'll head out first.

482
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,284
- Bye.
- Get home safe.

483
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,036
- Good job today.
- See you tomorrow.

484
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,621
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night!

485
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,706
Let's go.

486
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,043
What?

487
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,920
Did it end too soon? Up for round two?

488
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,213
- Round two?
- Yeah.

489
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,714
Sure. Where should we go?

490
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,091
How about where Juhyeong is?

491
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,217
Sure.

492
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,970
When you started college,
you fell for that upperclassman

493
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,721
and kept asking us what to do.

494
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,849
- Seriously!
- Munjeong!

495
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,355
- What's this?
- Did you drink a lot?

496
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,066
- Not at all.
- Hello.

497
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,484
- Congratulations!
- Munjeong!

498
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,777
I'll introduce you.

499
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,237
- It's okay.
- Come sit here!

500
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,905
- Hello...
- Come here.

501
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,615
- Why?
- It's fine.

502
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,701
- We'll drink on our own.
- We're not joining?

503
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,285
- No, sit here.
- See you later!

504
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,371
- Do you want to sit here?
- Sit here.

505
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,580
Be good to her, man.

506
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,748
I am good to her.

507
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,376
Hey, that person.

508
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,171
The girl you met on your trip
when you were in law school.

509
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,257
Isn't that her?

510
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,175
Or does she just look similar?

511
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,806
No, it is her! What's going on?

512
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,350
Who? Attorney Kang?

513
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,521
We just ended up
working in the same building.

514
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,982
You told us back then
you met someone you liked.

515
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,401
You were sending pictures
and asking us what to do.

516
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,194
Wait, you two were a thing?

517
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,738
No, we're just colleagues.

518
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,573
- You know her too?
- Yeah, last time

519
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:29,452
he called me out
late one night to help her out.

520
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,328
Unbelievable.

521
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,205
So, what's going on?

522
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,125
- Are you trying to make it work again?
- Is that so?

523
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,251
Not at all.

524
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,087
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

525
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:40,839
- Is he?
- I don't know.

526
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,759
No, it's true. I saw it.

527
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,094
Then, introduce me to her.

528
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,057
- What?
- No.

529
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,601
Why not?

530
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,687
She hates blind dates.
Hates them with a passion.

531
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,442
So she prefers
to just let things happen naturally?

532
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,532
Let's see each other
more often and not yearly.

533
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,951
Yeah, we should.

534
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,413
- You should quit sulking.
- I'm not sulking.

535
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,125
Are you coming to the next meetup?

536
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,462
Well, I'm not sure yet. We'll see.

537
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,964
Why? Should I not come?

538
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,549
Come on.

539
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,469
That's not what I meant.

540
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,097
Munjeong!

541
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,268
These are my old school buddies.

542
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,728
These are my friends.

543
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

544
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,732
I was so grateful for the other day.

545
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,068
But I couldn't make it to dinner.
I'm sorry.

546
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,948
It's all right. Juhyeong paid that day.

547
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,575
So there was a reason why you paid.

548
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,872
Juhyeong's feelings for Attorney Kang...

549
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,499
People often say I'm pretty clueless.

550
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,959
Thinking back on it now,

551
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,002
he's been into her since Hong Kong--

552
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,213
Hey! Munjeong is looking for you.

553
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:07,091
Hello, I'm Juhyeong's friend,
Min Jihun.

554
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,843
I see. Hello.

555
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,428
I heard you don't feel comfortable
with blind dates.

556
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,097
Hey. Go home if you're drunk.

557
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,642
Next time, I'll make sure once again...

558
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,434
I'll say hello properly.

559
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,602
- We're off.
- Good night.

560
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,020
- Bye!
- Good night!

561
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,772
- Okay, bye.
- We're going too.

562
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,149
- Bye.
- Get home safe.

563
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,943
- Good night!
- Good night!

564
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,070
- So, are you taking the bus?
- Yeah.

565
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,697
I'm taking the bus tonight too.

566
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,533
- Okay.
- Okay. We're taking...

567
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,409
- The subway.
- Bye.

568
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,620
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Bye!

569
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,000
Should we go too?

570
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,179
- What was that about blind dates earlier?
- Blind dates...

571
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,267
Jihun saw Attorney Kang at the bar
and asked to be introduced to her.

572
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,270
They mentioned
she didn't like blind dates.

573
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,733
That's what Juhyeong said.
He said she hates them, so he said no.

574
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,110
That clever punk.

575
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,070
- It's not true?
- Yeah, it is.

576
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,073
Right? She gives off that vibe.

577
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,493
What's that in your hand?

578
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,496
- French fries.
- What?

579
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,665
I noticed earlier you ate a lot of them.

580
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,127
You've barely been able to eat
with morning sickness.

581
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,963
- Hey. So those are all fries?
- Yeah.

582
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,882
Are you crazy?

583
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,675
That's going to last us a week!

584
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,845
Okay. All right, I got it.

585
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,973
Let me know if you need anything else.

586
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,476
Tell me what happens.

587
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,686
Bye.

588
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,233
- Is it a friend?
- Yes.

589
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,111
Lately, a lot of friends
have been dealing with stuff.

590
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,739
I'm getting a lot of calls
about legal advice.

591
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,449
Are you very close?

592
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,701
Fairly close.

593
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,665
Then, don't ask
about how things turn out later.

594
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,458
What?

595
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,503
It's better to completely wipe it
from your memory.

596
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,588
Why?

597
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,548
You might drift apart.

598
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,886
Still, it's a friend.
You should check in and see what happened.

599
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,472
If you act too indifferent,
won't you drift more apart?

600
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,267
You need to play dumb
the worse things are to prevent that.

601
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,645
People might reach out and ask now
because they're desperate.

602
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,981
But in the end,
they don't want to see anyone

603
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,900
who knows about their misfortunes.

604
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,945
Is that so?

605
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,966
So, you didn't enjoy
today's gathering?

606
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,760
- Do I look like it?
- A little.

607
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,763
That's strange.
I'm having a good time now.

608
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,599
Why would I look like that?

609
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,767
You do look happy now.

610
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,525
Why did you tell them
I don't like blind dates?

611
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,863
You must've had
a really good time in Hong Kong

612
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,616
if your friends still remember it.

613
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,040
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- I heard everything earlier.

614
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,378
- Look, that was--
- So...

615
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,048
when was your favorite moment?

616
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,774
Do you...

617
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,777
want to grab a bite?

618
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,115
Okay.

619
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,389
What do you want to eat?

620
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,020
You speak English...

621
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,147
I don't understand.
Could you speak Chinese?

622
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,232
Well...

623
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,317
Cantonese?

624
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,781
This one...

625
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,872
FOOD RECOMMENDATION

626
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,793
These are fried eggs.
These are pork chops.

627
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,712
And Swiss chicken wings. They're good.

628
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,213
Are you okay with beef noodles?

629
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,674
That sounds good.

630
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,592
This is beef steak.

631
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,014
SWEET FOOD

632
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,978
Sweet food! Okay, give me a moment.
I'll come back soon.

633
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,697
Your English pronunciation is really good.

634
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:26,703
I took classes here and there growing up.
I'm a piano major.

635
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,251
I'm actually here for a gig
to fill in for a friend.

636
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,805
You seem to know
a lot of Chinese characters too.

637
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,101
- Law books have a lot of those, right?
- Well, no.

638
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,605
I just studied a lot
of Classical Chinese as a kid.

639
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,994
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

640
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,871
- Yes.
- Then, how did you find this place?

641
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,581
From <i>Comrades: Almost a Love Story.</i>

642
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,584
It looks similar
to a place from that film.

643
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,048
You don't like Hong Kong films?

644
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,175
I'm not familiar.

645
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,552
Hold on.

646
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,230
These are all places from movies.

647
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,113
You're planning to visit all of them?

648
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,370
- Where are we now?
- Right now, we are...

649
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,455
at our comrades' base.

650
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:58,461
This sweet food is for the beautiful lady.
And this is for the handsome guy.

651
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,465
It looks delicious.

652
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,204
Stop!

653
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,831
- Why?
- Stop.

654
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,638
Shall we go?

655
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,558
By the way...

656
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,396
do you think we'll be together
back in Seoul?

657
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,194
We agreed to meet up in Seoul.

658
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,075
But we didn't actually
make any solid plans yet.

659
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,418
Since we're on a trip, I thought maybe
we're just caught up in the mood and all.

660
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,569
So, which moment did you like the most?

661
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,488
Everything I just said.

662
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,074
You asked when, so I told you.

663
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,285
- All of it?
- Yes.

664
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,495
What?

665
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,289
But you don't remember this?

666
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,375
I've had this on for ages.
You didn't see this?

667
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,626
Stop shaking it around.

668
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,546
How could I not? I bought it for you.

669
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,843
- Let's go.
- Okay.

670
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,723
<i>Therefore, the defendant is charged with</i>

671
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,017
aiding and abetting
unidentified individuals

672
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,394
in a voice phishing scam.

673
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,272
All right, Counsel.

674
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,068
Please state your argument
on the charges and evidence.

675
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,363
We deny the charges
and agree to all the evidence,

676
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,281
but we dispute
what they intend to prove.

677
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,574
All right, then.

678
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,202
We'll review the evidence now.

679
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,298
Okay, evidence review is complete.

680
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,510
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

681
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,640
- Yes, Counsel?
- We'll question the defendant.

682
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,559
Question the defendant?

683
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,893
It seems I hadn't asked that.

684
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,770
But is that necessary?

685
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,315
Let's save your comments
for the final argument.

686
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,819
Yes, but I'd like to ask the court
to allow the defendant a chance to explain

687
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,155
what happened at the time.

688
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,288
Defendant, when you first received
the loan advertisement text,

689
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,665
you thought it came
from a real bank, correct?

690
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,792
Yes.

691
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,878
When someone posing as a bank employee

692
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,297
promised a loan
by making your transaction history,

693
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,631
you believed them, correct?

694
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:42,470
Yes, I didn't even realize it was a lie
until the police investigation.

695
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,056
In the end,
you didn't benefit from this, right?

696
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,226
No, they never gave me the loan.

697
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,270
I didn't receive anything.

698
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,690
You were deceived by the person
posing as Baek Jeonghyeon, correct?

699
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,401
Yes, I think so.

700
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,987
No further questions.

701
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,323
Prosecutor,
would you like to cross-examine?

702
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,075
Yes. Just one question, Your Honor.

703
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:04,994
Defendant.

704
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,121
You asked that unidentified person

705
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,291
if this was voice phishing or not, correct?

706
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,126
Yeah, that's true.

707
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,212
No further questions.

708
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,548
Redirect, Your Honor.

709
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,301
Yes, please keep it brief.

710
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,428
When the defendant asked that question,

711
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,639
that person said it wasn't voice phishing

712
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,557
and to stop
if you didn't want the loan?

713
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,517
Yes, he clearly said it wasn't a scam.

714
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,479
You asked if it was voice phishing,

715
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,691
because you were worried
they'd ask you for money too, correct?

716
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,442
Yes, that's right.

717
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,071
I wondered for a moment
if he was trying to scam me out of money,

718
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:44,282
but he didn't ask for any,
so I figured it wasn't a scam.

719
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,035
He even said he'd use his own money

720
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,622
to help make my transaction history,
so I was grateful.

721
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,207
- No further questions.
- All right.

722
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,543
Defendant, you may return to your seat.

723
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,673
Prosecutor, your sentencing request?

724
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:00,925
Yes, Your Honor.

725
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,886
We request

726
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,223
a fine of 15 million won
for the defendant.

727
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,437
Counsel, present your statement.

728
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:22,238
Your Honor, Ms. Do Mikyung
was facing severe financial hardship.

729
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,906
So a loan offer
despite her low credit rating

730
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,575
couldn't help but be appealing.

731
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,829
It was more than appealing.
To her, it felt like a lifeline.

732
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,040
Since those behind voice phishing scams
are hard to catch,

733
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,209
we fully agree
with the prosecution's stance

734
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,461
on cracking down
on money mules as a deterrent.

735
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,674
However, using that single question
of asking if it's voice phishing or not

736
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:47,220
as grounds to apply <i>dolus eventualis</i>
and charge someone who had no idea

737
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,640
they were being used as a money mule
as an accomplice

738
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,184
is excessive and unjust.

739
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,021
She was deceived
into withdrawing the cash.

740
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,149
That call was fully recorded
and transcribed in the evidence.

741
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,775
The prosecution also knows this,

742
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,612
as reflected
in the relatively light sentence.

743
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,952
You may think,
"Still, how could she not know?"

744
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:15,498
But not everyone understands
how these scams work.

745
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,419
They may not know,
so that's exactly how they're tricked.

746
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,756
But not knowing cannot be a crime.

747
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,926
Therefore, we ask the court to recognize

748
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:31,389
that the defendant lacked any intent
to aid in fraud and find her not guilty.

749
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,725
That is all.

750
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,773
TRANSCRIPTS

751
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,163
"Specific review..."

752
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,998
"One. Grounds for termination..."

753
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,127
Things like this. I just caught one.

754
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,380
That's not how you spell "contract."

755
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,383
- Kind of ridiculous, right?
- I'm sorry.

756
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,968
Make sure to proofread thoroughly
before submitting.

757
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,887
I'll keep an eye out next time too.

758
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,972
Next...

759
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,057
I'm sorry.

760
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,393
Sorry, I'm late.

761
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,688
Are you joining us today?

762
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,732
I'd like to take the class as well.

763
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,360
- Is that okay?
- Of course. We were just about to start.

764
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,238
Okay.

765
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,951
You wrote, "Whether the barbecue area
can remain in place or not

766
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:36,287
in the sale of a vacation home
is a key factor of the contract." Right?

767
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,998
Yes. In Korea,
when people rent vacation homes,

768
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,376
a barbecue area is pretty much a given.

769
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:44,671
So I believe not being able to keep it

770
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:48,842
justified a cancellation of the contract.

771
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,177
Correct. Give him a hand.

772
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:51,971
Thank you!

773
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,597
- Or is it?
- Sorry?

774
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,807
What do you think?

775
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,101
I thought the contract should still stand.

776
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,479
The vacation home business
is officially registered as lodging.

777
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,065
That takes priority,
and everything else is secondary.

778
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:09,822
I think the ratio of the barbecue area
to the entire property area matters,

779
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,908
- but there's no data on that.
- Ratio of area?

780
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,994
That is an interesting take, isn't it?

781
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,414
Or it might be
a completely irrelevant take.

782
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,498
What about you?

783
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,918
I think the key
is whether the barbecue area's value

784
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,546
was reflected in the sale price

785
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,842
at the time of the contract agreement.

786
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,926
Good point.

787
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,763
But isn't anyone
going to mention the mistake of motive?

788
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,140
You would've studied this.

789
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,309
MISTAKE ABOUT REASON
FOR MAKING A LEGAL ACT

790
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,518
Yes, Ms. Kim.

791
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,062
I have studied it before.

792
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,482
This is bad, folks.

793
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:49,152
Even our non-lawyer advisor knew it.
That's a problem.

794
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,403
By tomorrow,

795
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,364
each of you should prepare
10 different mistake of motive cases.

796
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,659
No duplicates.

797
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,703
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

798
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,456
Yes, Ms. Kim?

799
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,626
I'm a law school grad too.

800
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,419
Is that so?

801
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:09,172
Then, I'd like you to prepare
10 cases by tomorrow as well.

802
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,798
- What?
- By tomorrow.

803
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,926
- But I--
- No overlaps.

804
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,052
- Wait--
- Okay, next.

805
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,513
Attorney Ha, I...

806
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,307
Wait, that's...

807
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,121
- Hello.
- Hello.

808
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:46,919
That was brutal.

809
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,629
- Gosh, good work!
- It's still wrong.

810
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,298
My goodness.

811
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,260
- Ms. Kim was here too?
- Yeah, but she ran away.

812
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,053
- Why?
- Because I gave her homework.

813
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,179
Thank you.

814
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,557
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

815
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,434
I told you not to go overboard
with the highlighter.

816
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,645
Have you seen this case too?

817
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,604
Yes, we have.

818
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,357
But anyone could see
that case was clearly a scam.

819
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,820
Do people actually fall
for scams like fools that way?

820
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,405
I found that case weird too.

821
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,948
- Can you not tell?
- Right?

822
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,867
Getting fooled like that is their fault.

823
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,495
Anyone can be fooled.

824
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,466
That's why

825
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,052
you all need to be careful too.

826
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,721
Please, drink.

827
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,764
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

828
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,850
It looks tasty.

829
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,905
I'm surprised
you reached out first this time.

830
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,743
I'm sorry.

831
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,288
I brought the final version
of the blueprints,

832
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,626
the construction breakdown,
and the contract.

833
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,005
I asked for these ages ago.
You can't bring these to me now.

834
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,008
I have no excuse.

835
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,552
You can curse at me all you want.

836
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,430
Still, how could I ever do that?

837
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,391
This needs to be added
to the progress valuation.

838
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,477
Is it too late?

839
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,814
The assessment's already done.
I can't add anything now.

840
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,780
I just...

841
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,997
Just thinking about not getting paid
makes my blood boil.

842
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,088
I didn't want to keep dwelling on it,
so I didn't notice I avoided it...

843
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,049
and ended up here.

844
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,301
I'm sorry.

845
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,807
What were you supposed to add?

846
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,937
Well, the ceiling and roof
were supposed to use deck plates,

847
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,565
- but that changed--
- I added that one.

848
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,526
- You did?
- Yes.

849
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,612
<i>The construction documents
listed "deck plate,"</i>

850
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,032
<i>but when I checked the site,
they didn't match.</i>

851
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,244
Here. You can look at this.

852
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,414
So I added that to the valuation myself.

853
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,457
I see. And the stairs--

854
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,000
I added that too.

855
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,920
<i>There were two versions
of the stair reinforcement blueprint.</i>

856
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,548
<i>The latter one
showed a different rebar count,</i>

857
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,466
so I added that to the valuation too.

858
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,428
I don't think I've seen
the stair reinforcement blueprint here.

859
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,554
Here's the blueprint.

860
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,515
We have on record that we sent it.

861
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,978
Thank you, Attorney Bae.

862
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,689
How did you figure all that out
just from the documents

863
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,191
without any explanation?

864
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,277
That's why

865
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,113
I need you to be
more responsive from now on.

866
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,074
I know this has been tough,

867
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,910
but you won't feel any relief
until you get paid.

868
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,372
That's not going to happen
any other way. Right?

869
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,252
I'll do everything I can
until the very end.

870
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,047
Okay.

871
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,092
Thank you, Attorney Bae.

872
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,471
Thank you.

873
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,282
This one looks good too.

874
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,036
Should I get out first?

875
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,662
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

876
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,880
Hello.

877
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,507
- Hello.
- Hello.

878
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:04,009
Should we put these over here?

879
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,430
It's heavy. I'll take it.

880
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,391
- Okay.
- Thank you.

881
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,518
What's all this?

882
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,062
I just wanted to wish you
a Happy Lunar New Year.

883
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,855
I'll put them here. Please take one.

884
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,775
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

885
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,527
Happy New Year.

886
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,112
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

887
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,698
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

888
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,326
These must be very expensive.

889
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,161
- What are they?
- They're quite big.

890
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,830
- This is awesome.
- It's so heavy.

891
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,499
Wow, are these fruits?

892
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,918
- Open it.
- Is it Korean beef?

893
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,962
Big companies are great.

894
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:41,837
What are those?

895
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,258
Okay, I'm going to open it.

896
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,594
My goodness!

897
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,182
My goodness!

898
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,187
They're alive.

899
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,445
MANAGING PARTNER KIM RYUJIN

900
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,198
What was she startled by?
Was it the lobster?

901
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,659
Or was it me?

902
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,328
Gosh.

903
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,003
Ms. Kim.

904
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,672
- Are you going home?
- Hello.

905
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,217
You shouldn't have done all this.

906
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,761
Well, I just wanted to wish you
a Happy Lunar New Year.

907
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,096
Thank you for the gift.

908
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,223
Sure.

909
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,311
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to find more cases for you.

910
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,979
Sure.

911
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,400
we were really part of the same firm
if I helped out more.

912
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,530
I'm sure you'll help us out well
in the future.

913
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,752
Ms. Kim, thank you for the gift.

914
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,713
You're welcome. I wanted to wish you
a Happy Lunar New Year.

915
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,089
Thank you for the lobster.

916
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,883
Of course. Happy New Year.

917
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,510
- Happy New Year.
- All right.

918
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,638
Ms. Kim.

919
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:14,514
Thank you for the gift!

920
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,141
And it's lobster! Thank you!

921
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,934
Yes, Happy New Year.

922
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,520
- Happy New Year.
- All right.

923
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,481
- I'll get going first.
- Yes, all right.

924
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,108
Happy New Year.

925
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,693
Yes, all right.

926
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,287
Could I add some avocados?

927
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,707
I'll have honey oat bread.

928
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,627
I'll add extra shrimp and cheese too.

929
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,672
Make that American cheese.

930
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,513
I'll have the same one.
Make it a footlong, please.

931
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,154
Hey, this is good. It's nice.

932
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,824
Hey, are you all going home
for the holidays?

933
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,450
- Of course.
- Yeah?

934
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,535
Hey.

935
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:20,079
I bet they stop nagging you
about having a baby now.

936
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,622
I haven't told them yet.

937
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,125
- Why not?
- Why is that such a secret with you?

938
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,584
I'll tell them soon.

939
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,130
This time,
I'm escaping the nagging for good.

940
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,299
I got rid
of the marriage nagging long ago.

941
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,012
Once I get past the baby stuff,
it's total freedom from nagging.

942
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,765
But do your families really ask
why you're not married?

943
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

944
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,017
Your folks don't ask?

945
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,186
They don't.

946
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,689
You may be the youngest in this group.

947
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,524
But you'll start hearing it soon.

948
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,194
My parents aren't the type
to nag about that stuff.

949
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:56,073
In my family, my dad's the one
who always brings it up.

950
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,199
Me too.

951
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,952
My mom always lobs it up,
and my dad takes the swing.

952
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,455
Me too. Wow! It's totally the same.

953
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,332
I'm jealous. I don't have a dad.

954
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,461
Damn it.

955
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,297
Don't make jokes with stuff like that.

956
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,884
- Geez, Sanggi! Cut it out.
- Ouch!

957
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,469
Father!

958
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,971
- How old are you?
- Geez.

959
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:22,183
- It's freezing.
- It's so cold!

960
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,935
- It's so cold.
- Gosh!

961
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,521
I guess we'll see each other
after the holidays.

962
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,690
- Get some good rest for once.
- All right.

963
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,816
Don't miss me and cry.

964
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,443
- Go on, now.
- See you!

965
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:33,653
- Bye!
- Bye!

966
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,072
It's so cold!

967
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:41,869
What? What is it?

968
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:42,954
Nothing.

969
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,959
Lobster!

970
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,920
- What?
- Lobster!

971
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,422
Jiseok loves lobster.

972
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,643
By the way, do you have any thoughts
about getting married?

973
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,645
Why are you shocked?

974
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,105
What's with you?
You're not that kind of person, Mom.

975
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,690
Can't I even ask that?

976
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,818
Dad.

977
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,694
Not interested in marriage?

978
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,822
Dad!

979
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,218
Mom, when's Junki coming?

980
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,761
He's coming tomorrow.

981
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,179
Where are you going?

982
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,390
I have to go to work.

983
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,850
But it's New Year's.

984
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,727
It's our busiest time.

985
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,856
Put that in the fridge, please.

986
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,108
- Okay.
- I'm off.

987
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,793
That's the best news
I've heard in a while!

988
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:16,046
- I did well, right?
- Are you planning for a second right away?

989
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,633
What? No, this is my first pregnancy.
Why are you mentioning a second?

990
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,137
At your age,
how can we not mention a second kid?

991
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,762
Dad.

992
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,473
What about work then?

993
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,559
Can you take maternity leave
or parental leave?

994
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,229
Come, now. She's a lawyer.
What are you even worried about?

995
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,231
Geez, everyone just be quiet.

996
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,483
I'll handle it.

997
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,320
Uncle Changwon, buy us ice cream.

998
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,697
Buy us some ice cream.

999
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,241
- Hey.
- Uncle Changwon!

1000
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,077
- Buy us some ice cream.
- Buy us some ice cream.

1001
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,622
All right. I'll buy you some ice cream.

1002
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,666
Go sit down. I'll get you some soon.

1003
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,505
Changwon.

1004
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,382
Yes?

1005
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:01,968
I'll call you later.

1006
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,261
Here, read this,

1007
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,305
and pretend you're my lawyer.

1008
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,432
Try to make a case.

1009
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,518
- Make a case?
- Pretend you're in court. Try it out.

1010
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,520
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

1011
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,481
Do I need to give you a retaining fee?

1012
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,566
No, it's not that.

1013
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,487
Yeah, you do this all the time.
You can tell easily, right?

1014
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,459
It looks so good. Eat up!

1015
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,544
- It looks delicious.
- It does.

1016
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,838
<i>When should we go to your aunt's tomorrow?</i>

1017
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,635
I think I need
to stop by the office tomorrow.

1018
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,971
<i>Are you that busy?</i>

1019
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,224
I just have a bunch
of little things to take care of.

1020
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,310
Okay. Bye.

1021
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,068
What are you doing here?

1022
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,488
I thought you'd be glued
to your parents all break.

1023
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,865
There's not much to do at home.

1024
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,409
I guess I'm a full-fledged lawyer now.

1025
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,704
The office just feels more peaceful.

1026
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,163
How about you?

1027
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:16,710
Well, I've been a lawyer for a long time.

1028
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:28,888
Do you...

1029
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:30,974
want to grab a bite?

1030
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,768
Sure.

1031
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,605
This way?

1032
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,691
Here?

1033
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,029
Don't you smell something delicious?

1034
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,990
I've been frying <i>jeon</i> all day.

1035
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,199
Doesn't your family make <i>jeon?</i>

1036
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,785
We make dumplings.

1037
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,288
- Dumplings?
- Don't you smell dumplings?

1038
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,459
How would clothes
ever smell like dumplings?

1039
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:02,839
- You know, like from dumpling hot pot.
- I see. So you had dumpling hot pot?

1040
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,050
We had hot pot and...

1041
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,765
Gosh, even this place is empty now.

1042
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,309
Right? Every place is closed.

1043
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,020
Maybe places
near Gangnam Station are open?

1044
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,689
Wow, Gangnam Station.

1045
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,902
I know a place there
that's open for 24 hours.

1046
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,987
On the night you stood me up,

1047
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,699
I was so cold
I ended up eating there alone.

1048
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,036
It's still around,
and I get angry every time I pass by.

1049
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,916
No wonder I couldn't find you.

1050
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,085
What?

1051
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:42,879
Well...

1052
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,507
I went to Gangnam Station too.

1053
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:47,509
You're lying.

1054
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,553
I'm not like you. Why would I lie?

1055
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,055
Why are you saying this now?

1056
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,351
Well, I missed the right moment to say it.

1057
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,441
I still can't believe it.

1058
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,195
How could you possibly take that
as me canceling?

1059
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,572
No, we definitely agreed to meet,

1060
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,783
but then, you asked if we'd be together.

1061
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:15,537
In my mind, I was basically
confessing my feelings for you.

1062
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,247
We were running out of time together.

1063
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:22,168
You even said we should meet in Seoul,
but you still didn't ask me out.

1064
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,260
Next time, whatever it is,
say it clearly so I can understand.

1065
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,514
Next time when?

1066
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,406
Now?

1067
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,259
Is that clear enough?

1068
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,849
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1069
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,438
So, what do you want to eat?

1070
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,652
Acai bowl.

1071
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:12,778
Acai bowl?

1072
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,447
- What's this?
- What on earth?

1073
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,661
What?

1074
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,246
- What are you doing here?
- What's going on?

1075
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:25,374
- Did you make plans without me?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1076
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,917
Why are you here?

1077
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,877
- Where's your husband?
- He's asleep.

1078
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,587
Hold on.

1079
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,798
Then, did we run into each other
by chance?

1080
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,716
Why is he so excited?

1081
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,427
It's exciting! It feels like fate!

1082
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,679
- Geez.
- Geez.

1083
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,014
Perfect. It's snowing too.

1084
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,102
I can't believe nothing was open.

1085
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,937
You said it was open 24 hours.

1086
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,939
I never said 365 days a year.

1087
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,024
Geez.

1088
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,741
Hey, what are you all doing?

1089
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,534
What?

1090
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,702
What's up with you two?

1091
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,328
Did you make plans without us?

1092
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,417
No, I was here first.
And then, Juhyeong showed up too.

1093
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,796
Well, I was on my way to the office,
and she was standing outside.

1094
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,090
- What does that mean?
- Suspicious.

1095
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,300
Whatever. Just eat.

1096
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,343
- I want that one.
- Yeah.

1097
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,847
I was worried two pies would be too much,
but it worked out. Let's eat.

1098
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,057
Hey, aren't you curious
why we're all here?

1099
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,226
It's obvious.

1100
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,104
I didn't take a picture. Hold on.

1101
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,648
I took one earlier. I'll send it to you.

1102
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,067
I have my own artistic style though.

1103
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,529
- I took a good one.
- Thanks.

1104
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,622
It's nice to be in the break room again.

1105
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,833
You're right.

1106
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,586
This place feels the most comfortable.

1107
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,970
It's really snowing a lot.

1108
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,024
Hi, Mom.

1109
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,027
What?

1110
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:22,528
Law and The City

1111
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,601
Law and The City

1112
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,436
<i>You should've told me about this!</i>

1113
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,689
What do you mean there's nothing?
You got it through Park!

1114
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,566
- It couldn't be...
<i>- Her father...</i>

1115
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,944
<i>was in jail.</i>

1116
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,529
Are you okay?

1117
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,406
You're going through a lot.

1118
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,450
You're not defending this, right?

1119
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,910
Dad.

1120
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,455
Don't come back anymore. Okay?

1121
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,418
Wait, you think this contract is legit?

1122
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,256
It's Huiji's father.
Aren't you being too impersonal?

1123
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,799
<i>I'm visiting as his attorney.</i>

1124
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,344
<i>Please tell him to come out. Please.</i>

1125
