CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY
WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION

4
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,900
What brings you here?
There was no heads-up.

5
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,279
Why are you so surprised?
Were you two watching something naughty?

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,033
You could've at least called first.
Did you eat dinner?

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,242
Probably not.

8
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,411
Go wash your hands.

9
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,495
- Want some snacks?
- Yeah.

10
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,456
No snacks.
That'll ruin your appetite.

11
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,167
Wait until after dinner.

12
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,881
I've become a chairman now.

13
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,050
What? Chairman of what?

14
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,638
It's just a volunteer group made with
other business people. I became its chair.

15
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,141
There you go bragging
about useless things again.

16
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,750
You asked to meet,

17
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,419
but you're just as quiet as ever.

18
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,590
Was I like this before too?

19
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,716
Yeah.

20
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,219
When we broke up.

21
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,935
Why did you want to see me?
The trial's already over.

22
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,187
It's just...

23
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,317
I hadn't seen you in a while,

24
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,570
but it felt like
we didn't get to have a proper talk.

25
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,032
Have you been all right?

26
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,951
Yeah.

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,204
I've been fine, as you can see.

28
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,376
I haven't been, as you probably know.

29
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,049
About the trial...

30
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,385
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,387
It was the best I could do.

32
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,264
I felt it was better to end it quickly.

33
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,349
I know.

34
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,685
Ending it quickly was the right call.

35
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,770
For me too.

36
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,863
After hurting you like that...

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,700
I deserved it.

38
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,618
Right?

39
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,623
No.

40
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,500
I didn't think that.

41
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,460
I just thought

42
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:16,297
it would've been better
if we hadn't run into each other this way.

43
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,966
If we had met differently,

44
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,385
you wouldn't have talked to me.

45
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,975
Sujeong.

46
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:29,978
Take care of yourself.

47
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,606
I came here to tell you this.

48
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,994
This was the side of you
I liked the most.

49
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,374
Okay.

50
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,879
I came to say goodbye too.

51
00:04:58,924 --> 00:04:59,925
Right.

52
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,511
Let's not meet again.

53
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,221
Especially like this.

54
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,600
Later on, if something really good
happens in your life,

55
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,936
send me a text.

56
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,110
I will take care of myself.

57
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,613
Thanks.

Episode 5
The Courage to Face It

59
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,267
Excuse me.

60
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,271
Juhyeong left already. You should go.

61
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,554
MESSAGE

62
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,680
AHN JUHYEONG

63
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,141
<i>Can you come out for a moment?</i>

64
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,830
Well,

65
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,374
- I called you here to--
- Let me go first.

66
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,464
I turned Park Sujeong away.

67
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,052
After what happened last night,
I went down and she was waiting outside.

68
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,597
Before I knew it, I told her
you'd already left work.

69
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,435
I crossed the line. I'm sorry.
I should've told you right away.

70
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,691
Why did you do that?

71
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,363
Well...

72
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,450
I'm not sure. Why did I do that?

73
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,122
I guess I didn't want you to get hurt.

74
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,258
I didn't think it'd be good for you
to run into her in that state,

75
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,094
so that's why I did it.

76
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,099
It could've hurt you
even though it's all in the past already.

77
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,061
I mean, maybe not for you yet. But...

78
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,691
- So what I mean is...
- It is in the past.

79
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,863
You were right.

80
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,366
It was stupid to take that case on.

81
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,036
It didn't sit right with me.

82
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,415
But I'm really okay now.

83
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,250
That's what I came to say.

84
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,043
So...

85
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,422
you don't need to feel bad.

86
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,817
I saw last time you didn't have
any emergency snacks.

87
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,237
So, I grabbed a few
while I was getting mine.

88
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
Just a few.

89
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,454
Thanks.

- What on earth?
- You scared me!

100
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,252
What's with all that money?
You haven't spent a dime?

101
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,713
Geez, why are you peeking
at someone else's account?

102
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,423
- I'll sue you!
- Go ahead.

103
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,300
We're not strangers.

104
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,802
- Security!
- Security!

105
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,095
I have a problem here!

106
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,598
- We're fine. We're fine!
- I have a problem! Security!

107
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,608
That's good.

108
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,861
Let's eat here again in two weeks.

109
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,280
I told you to dip it in the salted shrimp.
It tastes better.

110
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,660
I can eat on my own.
Who even dips peppers in salted shrimp?

111
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,081
Right. He's got a ton of money.
It's crazy.

112
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,501
- It's fake news.
- It's not fake news.

113
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,170
With all that money,
why are you still living there?

114
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,338
Just move already.

115
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,967
Grandpa saved up that much
without us knowing?

116
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,177
What's there to hide?
And I don't have that much either.

117
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,887
But why do you call him "Grandpa"?

118
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,682
Everything he does is like a grandpa.
Don't you think so?

119
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,100
- Come, now!
- Not at all.

120
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,476
He's like a cunning fox.

121
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,811
What was your nickname?

122
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,147
You must've had one in school.

123
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,816
"The Spirit of Spring."

124
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,279
Was that supposed to be funny?

125
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,240
That wasn't funny or moving at all.

126
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,117
It wasn't even thought-provoking.

127
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,618
Hey, you're paying for this.

128
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,705
You're not funny, but you're loaded.

129
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,707
- That's crossing the line.
- Don't you have more money?

130
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,667
That's my dad's money, not mine.

131
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,336
Your father's rich?

132
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,465
He does run a small, successful company,
but he's not super rich or anything.

133
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,719
It made some money subcontracting
for Hanguk Group, but without that...

134
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,554
It would've gone under instantly.

135
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,265
- I've told you several times.
- It's my first time asking.

136
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,144
In any case, it's all yours in the end.
You're the only child.

137
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm sick of hearing that only child talk.

138
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,233
Are you trying to pick a fight
with six million of us?

139
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,111
- And you're pretty well-off too.
- Says who?

140
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,362
I mean, you all went to law school.

141
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,073
That's a risky thing to say.

142
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,872
We're not all well-off like you.

143
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,042
Others may mistakenly think so,
but we know better.

144
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,921
Why are you being so serious?
You're the one with all that money.

145
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,679
Geez, bringing up money was a bad idea.

146
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,931
You brought it up.

147
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,307
Yeah, I was telling myself.

148
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,519
Me and my big mouth.
I can't keep it shut.

149
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,946
There doesn't seem to be any improvement.

150
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,073
Well, I'm pregnant,

151
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,117
so I couldn't take the meds
you prescribed.

152
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,161
Really? Congratulations.

153
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,122
Your husband must be thrilled.

154
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,002
I'm still not sure

155
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,838
if this is something
to be congratulated for.

156
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,929
<i>In that case, I'll switch your meds
to ones safe for pregnancy.</i>

157
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,539
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

158
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,709
Retail investors are idiots.

159
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,963
If a stock shows the slightest uptick,
they charge in like rabid dogs.

160
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,299
Are you talking about me?

161
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,302
- You're a retail investor?
- Of course.

162
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,095
Goddamn!

163
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,473
That's hilarious!

164
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,058
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,351
Anyways...

166
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,353
- Yes?
- The second the freeze lifts,

167
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,023
we dump all our shares.

168
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,608
But these suckers eat them all up.

169
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,985
That's how we pocket the profit,

170
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,280
and the stock tanks like crazy
until it's worth pennies.

171
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,866
Then, we do a reverse split,
take the profits,

172
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,910
and repeat the cycle until delisting.

173
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,539
That's how I was duped.
I think that's where all my money went.

174
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,334
When I get out, you want to join me?

175
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,004
I'll make you some real money.

176
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,134
I appreciate the thought.

177
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,637
If I was meant to get rich,
I'm sure it'll naturally happen.

178
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,391
I mean, I'd lose my law license over this.

179
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,814
What do you need
that fancy law license for?

180
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,940
Tell me.

181
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,694
You're just a goddamn errand boy
here to keep me company.

182
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,784
I can shoot the breeze
and earn a paycheck.

183
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,828
That's a great deal.
Don't you think so?

184
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,376
See? You're nuts.

185
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,253
That's why I like you, Attorney Cho.

186
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,464
Thank you.

187
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,257
Sir,

188
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,676
how long do I have to do these visits for?

189
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,430
Do you know how much we make
just for making those visits?

190
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,434
If you can pull in clients
of that value, I'll tell you.

191
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,852
Or...

192
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,688
If you bring in the retainer contract
from your father's company,

193
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,941
I'll take you off visits.

194
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,028
Never mind, sir.

195
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,657
The trial won't drag on, so just do it.

196
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,326
No need to go daily.
Every other day is fine.

197
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,079
Yes, sir. I understand.

198
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,748
Isn't this easier for you too?

199
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,418
You just go there and have fun.

200
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,713
If I were you,
I'd be thanking my lucky stars.

201
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:22,023
This isn't theft. It's actually called
misappropriation of lost property.

202
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,318
I seriously don't remember anything.

203
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,570
Did you drink a lot of alcohol?

204
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,697
Well, job hunting's been rough,

205
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,492
so I went out drinking with friends
to relieve some stress.

206
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,120
And I think I got carried away.

207
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,956
Do you recall
going to the convenience store?

208
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,292
I don't remember that either.

209
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,713
When I get drunk, I usually have
one last beer at a convenience store.

210
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,048
So I probably did go.

211
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,470
But the police said CCTV captured me
taking the watch that was there.

212
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,723
But if you did take it,
it should be at home, right?

213
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,183
There's absolutely nothing.

214
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,851
That's what's driving me crazy.

215
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,186
If it was at home,

216
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,981
I could apologize
for making a mistake while I was drunk.

217
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,816
But that isn't the case.

218
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,406
For now, don't admit to anything
during the police questioning.

219
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,910
Just tell them honestly
that you don't remember.

220
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,746
But...

221
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,333
What if they punish me harder
for being uncooperative?

222
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,794
During the investigation,

223
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,214
the police may or may not
show you the footage.

224
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,925
But if you say you don't remember,
they'll probably show it to you.

225
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,928
It won't be too late to admit it then.

226
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,890
I swear I didn't hit anyone.

227
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,852
I've been teaching for over 10 years
and never once used physical punishment.

228
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,066
Are these the kids' names?

229
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,695
No, the lawsuit was filed
under the parents' names.

230
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,822
Then, do you know
which kids pressed charges?

231
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,365
Yes, I know who they are.

232
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,244
I caught them using the gym after class
without permission, so I scolded them.

233
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,040
But a few days later, the police called.
They said I was reported for child abuse.

234
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,128
But do middle schoolers
count as children too?

235
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,923
Yes, anyone under 18
is legally considered a child.

236
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,925
You only gave them a warning

237
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,179
- without any physical punishment, right?
- Yes.

238
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,806
It says here that you made them lie prone

239
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,434
- and hit their backsides.
- That never happened.

240
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,269
After the police contacted me,

241
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,022
I wondered if I was too harsh
with my words.

242
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,526
But when I saw that complaint
and it mentioned all that, I was shocked.

243
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,321
I only scold my students with words.

244
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,740
Gently.

245
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,079
Right. Let's start
by getting the kids' names.

246
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,999
KIM SANGJUN, LEE MINHYUK, IM GIHOON,
JANG SEONGBIN, KANG JEHO

247
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,168
DEFENDANT
HWANG MINGU

248
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,975
I'm pretty sure it's here...

249
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,817
SIGN UP TO SEE

250
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,196
DO YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT? LOG IN
DOWNLOAD THE APP

251
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,085
Damn it, I told you to knock
before you come in.

252
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,462
Do you have Newstagram?

253
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,046
What?

254
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,423
Geez, you can make an account
and check yourself.

255
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,217
Why are you making me do this?

256
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,511
It's a hassle.
I don't know how to use it either.

257
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,597
There's no time to read the terms.

258
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,390
Why read the terms?

259
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,810
You have to read them.
Who knows what's in there?

260
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,437
What a lunatic.

261
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,190
HWANG MINGU

262
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,609
Hwang Mingu.

263
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,528
Gosh.

264
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,789
You're sure he didn't hit them?

265
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,333
Now what?

266
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,335
Try surfing the net.

267
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,504
What?

268
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,426
You know,
like surfing through friends' pages.

269
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,552
Surfing the net.

270
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,720
Surfing...

271
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,265
You mean looking at his followers.

272
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,145
But I doubt those kids
would follow his account.

273
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,104
Kim Sangjun.

274
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,440
KIM SANGJUN

275
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,024
NO RESULTS FOUND

276
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,525
Not here.

277
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,403
LEE MINHYUK

278
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,363
IM GIHOON

279
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,198
Not here.

280
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,993
JANG SEONGBIN, KANG JEHO

281
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,078
They're not here.

282
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,455
I guess not.

283
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,416
Damn it. Then...

284
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,418
Then...

285
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,713
Why don't we do this?

286
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,758
Let's look for students
who attend this school.

287
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,471
<i>Mr. Hwang,
let's go here for our next class trip.</i>

288
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,182
"Yea.na14."
She seems like a middle schooler.

289
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,185
Gosh, how should I deal with this then?

290
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,813
Let's look for a boy's name.

291
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
Nothing here.

292
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,942
LET'S GO EAT <i>TTEOKBOKKI</i>

293
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,278
She seems the most popular.

294
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,115
I see boys here.

295
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,537
Jooan?

296
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,748
See, I found some boys.

297
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,586
Hold on.

298
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,591
- "Sangjun Kim"?
- Kim Sangjun.

299
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,929
Is this him?

300
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,309
We found him.

301
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,519
eeeminhyuk liked this

302
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,021
COMPLAINT

303
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,152
<i>If you mess with us, you're done for.
Who are you to lecture us?</i>

304
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>Later, Mr. Hwang.
You should've minded your own business.</i>

305
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Goodness.

306
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,368
"Lee Minhyuk and others liked this post."

307
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,411
Lee Minhyuk, Im Gihoon... It's them, right?

308
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,373
Lee Minhyeok, Im Gihoon, Jang Seongbin...

309
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,708
It is them.

310
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,545
Geez, we found them.

311
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,549
- Yeah.
- That means I have to go there now.

312
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,137
Want to come with me?

313
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,016
I'm off.

314
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,725
Damn.

315
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,019
Good luck!

316
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,181
NO ENTRY AFTER SCHOOL HOURS
SEHYEON MIDDLE SCHOOL

317
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,570
Pass the ball! Why aren't you passing?

318
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,405
Damn it.

319
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,096
Kim Sangjun.

320
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
Lee Minhyuk.

321
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,101
Im Gihoon.

322
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,772
Let's see. Jang Seongbin.

323
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,275
And Kang Jeho.

324
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,115
From your faces, I see you're the ones.

325
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,910
Who are you, Mister?
You can't just walk in here.

326
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,371
That goes for you too.

327
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,623
Kim Sangjun, are you the ringleader?

328
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,542
How do you know my name?

329
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,712
You're the ones
who falsely accused Mr. Hwang, right?

330
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,174
No. We were really hit,
so we pressed charges.

331
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,637
Hold on a second.

332
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,438
<i>If you mess with us, you're done for.</i>

333
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,481
<i>Who are you to lecture us?</i>

334
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,110
<i>Later, Mr. Hwang.
You should've minded your own business.</i>

335
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,445
Guys.

336
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,198
If you want to commit crimes,
you can't be dumb.

337
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,660
If you're this sloppy now,
how will you manage as adults?

338
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,706
That's not enough to prove
we made a false accusation.

339
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,459
No, that's not something I have to prove.

340
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,962
I just need to raise reasonable doubt

341
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,297
about the actual occurrence
of physical punishment.

342
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,509
Speaking harshly
is also a form of verbal abuse.

343
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,261
Well, you should've reported that then.

344
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,347
Why say he made you lie down
and hit you?

345
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,228
This gym is supposed to be for students.

346
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,440
So they should let us use it.
Not allowing that is unfair.

347
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,067
Then you should've filed
an official complaint

348
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,694
through the proper channels.

349
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,072
You can't make false allegations.
That's a serious crime.

350
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,533
What are false allegations?

351
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,827
We're too young
to be criminally responsible.

352
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,371
Criminally responsible...

353
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,249
Then, you should've filed charges
under your names.

354
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,003
Why drag your parents into this
and turn them into criminals?

355
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,504
And juvenile courts try juveniles.

356
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,758
Community service, probation,
supervised care, or juvenile detention.

357
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,845
Well, who knows which one you'll get?

358
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,305
How did you find my account?

359
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,515
There's no way
you could have figured that out.

360
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,100
Why do you think that?

361
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,395
I bet you don't even know
what Newstagram is.

362
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,236
That's a little harsh.

363
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,573
Ever heard of surfing the net?

364
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,075
- What's that?
- Not sure.

365
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,745
- Why would you surf in the winter?
- No idea.

366
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,706
- This guy is weird.
- I know.

367
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,292
Claiming you don't remember
won't solve everything.

368
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,170
We're not just claiming it.
It's the truth.

369
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:33,050
You can't answer for the suspect.
You know that.

370
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,929
I really don't remember.
It wasn't at home either.

371
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,891
Then, I'll show you the footage.

372
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,727
Watch and tell us
how much you can remember.

373
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,604
Please come over here.

374
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,571
Here.

375
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,866
The victim comes out
of the convenience store.

376
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,037
See the small shopping bag
in his right hand?

377
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,582
- The watch was in that bag?
- Yes.

378
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,294
In a few moments,
Mr. Moon enters the store.

379
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,844
Then, the victim suddenly
gets up and leaves.

380
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,763
He forgets to take the shopping bag.

381
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,893
Then, Mr. Moon comes out
and sits in that spot.

382
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,631
Okay. Now, he gets up and leaves too.

383
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,222
Later, the victim comes back,

384
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,558
but the shopping bag's already gone.

385
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,312
He reported it to the police right after.

386
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,482
Mr. Moon was the only person there
at that time.

387
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,943
So all we can say
is that he put it in his bag.

388
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,363
But you can't clearly see
the spot from that angle.

389
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,240
Attorney Kang.

390
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,533
You saw the shopping bag, right?

391
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,037
Besides Mr. Moon, did anyone else come by?

392
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,916
I mean, you should deny
what's worth denying.

393
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,259
Hey, Mom. I just finished the interview.

394
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,387
I'm not sure how it went.

395
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,222
Yeah, I had lunch.

396
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,890
Yeah.

397
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,851
Okay, bye.

398
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,357
I told her I was going to an interview.

399
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,195
That convenience store's nearby, right?

400
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,232
What are you looking for?

401
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,359
To install CCTV,
you have to register with the authorities.

402
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,822
The police likely pulled footage
only from registered CCTVs.

403
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,031
So if registering is required,

404
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,451
that implies some may not
have been registered.

405
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,880
That teacher is unbelievable.

406
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,966
He's at fault and yet he hires a lawyer?

407
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,050
The same goes for you too.

408
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,054
You call yourself a lawyer,
but why are you chasing after our kids?

409
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,184
I mean, you talked to the kids already.
Why did you drag us here?

410
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,020
You filed the complaint.

411
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,983
The teachers and the lawyers...
None of them are acting like adults!

412
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,777
So what is it you want to say?

413
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,864
We're all busy people!

414
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,295
Excuse me for being late.

415
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,840
I'm Attorney Bae Munjeong
with Law Group Hyungmin.

416
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,468
- What are you doing?
- You looked outnumbered.

417
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,765
Have you decided?
Are you proceeding with the charges?

418
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,099
Come on.

419
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,393
They said they were hit,
because they were.

420
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,604
Why would they lie about that?

421
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,733
And what? False accusation?
You have proof?

422
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,904
I bet you can't prove it.

423
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,115
You're Im Gihoon's father, right?

424
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,867
Yes. How did you know?

425
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,702
He said the exact same thing.

426
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,831
That's not enough to prove
we made a false accusation.

427
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,666
The kids have already
come clean at this point.

428
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,835
If you keep pretending not to know,

429
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,838
we'll have to consider
how to hold you accountable.

430
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,510
They lied, not us!
Why are you doing this to us?

431
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,594
We didn't know it was false!

432
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,306
- It was the kids! Seriously!
- We didn't know!

433
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,435
I asked one of my relatives
who's a chief prosecutor.

434
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,939
And he said if we didn't know,
we're not liable.

435
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,982
So you're saying

436
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,652
- the kids are at fault and not you?
- Yes.

437
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,321
Have you ever heard the phrase,

438
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,157
"law is the moral minimum"?

439
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,911
Civil law includes something called
supervision liability.

440
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,913
As parents of minors,

441
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,208
you're legally responsible
for their supervision.

442
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,503
That's the minimum of being a parent.

443
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,422
But you say,
"The kids did it and I had no idea"?

444
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,887
If you won't take
moral responsibility as parents,

445
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,640
you'll be held legally responsible
for their supervision.

446
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,184
- My goodness.
- Wait.

447
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,438
Then, what should we do
to make this right?

448
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,065
You're lawyers,

449
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,652
so advise us.

450
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,529
We represent Mr. Hwang.

451
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,574
We are not your attorneys.

452
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,454
First, you should drop the charges.

453
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,540
After that, it's up to Mr. Hwang.

454
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,917
So, what would you like to do?

455
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,381
We should drop the charges.

456
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,550
I don't know.

457
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,013
Hey.

458
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,390
Why were you so worked up?
You startled me.

459
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,602
They had no idea they were wrong
but came in like an angry mob.

460
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,979
I couldn't stand it.

461
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,066
You need to have your head on straight
to not end up like those parents.

462
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,279
Anyway, what time
and where are we meeting?

463
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,072
I'll text you.

464
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,076
- Should we invite Huiji?
- Yeah, I'll reach out.

465
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,245
You let Jiseok know.

466
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,371
You do it. It's your husband.

467
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,209
He's your friend too, Attorney Ahn.

468
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,171
I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

469
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,258
Still, I can't.

470
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,762
We'll take a really quick look
at just that time frame.

471
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,013
You're a lawyer. Don't you know the law?

472
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,849
I can't just show this stuff
without the police.

473
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,895
Actually, if someone who was filmed asks,
you need to show it.

474
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,981
My goodness.

475
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,442
Excuse me for saying this
right off the bat,

476
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,236
but I have a criminal record.

477
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:53,573
So I'm trying to stay within the law now.

478
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,824
So go talk to the police,

479
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,869
and unless they say so,
I'm not showing anything.

480
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,162
Got it?

481
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,288
Goodbye.

482
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,458
- But... Sir!
- Wait...

483
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:15,971
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

484
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,348
What do we do, Attorney Kang?

485
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,602
- Are you sure the watch isn't at home?
- Yes.

486
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,942
Then, let's check the footage
with the police.

487
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,864
But what if...

488
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,534
we check the footage,

489
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,705
and it turns out I really did take it?

490
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,212
- It doesn't smell too bad.
- It does.

491
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,756
I washed it in the laundry.

492
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,259
In any case...

493
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,220
Good job. It smells like herbs.

494
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,598
Could we have another glass?

495
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,890
Huiji can't make it.

496
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,685
I guess she's busy with work.

497
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,520
Really?

498
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,481
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

499
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,625
You never ask for favors,

500
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,585
but why drag me out
in the middle of the night?

501
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,337
That's why I'm buying you dinner.

502
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,880
You live right next door too.

503
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,048
Exactly.

504
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,426
And you've never once dropped by
even though I've invited you.

505
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,845
It's no fun drinking with you.

506
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,972
Zero fun.

507
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,725
How ridiculous...

508
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,730
Unbelievable.

509
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,071
By the way, why aren't you eating?

510
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,782
What? I'm just...

511
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,282
not hungry.

512
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,494
Really? That's not like you.

513
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,123
Hey, did you hear from Juhwan?

514
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,417
He said he's being sued,
so I gave him your number.

515
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,877
Yeah, I'm taking his case.

516
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,382
You? That's a first.
You never handle your friends' cases.

517
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,467
Well, we're not close. I just know of him.

518
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,552
Do you go around
telling people we're close?

519
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,015
No, but don't get in trouble.
I won't take your case.

520
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,644
My wife's a lawyer too.
Why would I go to you? Right?

521
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,146
I'd be glad if he did
get into trouble for once.

522
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,315
You're so boring.

523
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,527
That was very hurtful, you know.
The both of you.

524
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,029
By the way, have you had
any blind dates lately?

525
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,447
I'm too busy.

526
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,282
What do you mean "busy"?

527
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,201
You had time to visit
the kids' school today.

528
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,494
I went there for work.

529
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,079
School? Why?

530
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,540
Well, there were these little rugrats

531
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,126
who falsely accused their teacher
of corporal punishment.

532
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,795
My goodness. That's terrifying.

533
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,798
That would make me
too scared to have kids.

534
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,383
Geez.

535
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,432
- So did it get resolved?
- Yeah, I think it will.

536
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,308
It's a relief, I suppose.

537
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,352
What's a relief?

538
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,815
Well, my client
wasn't some terrible person.

539
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,444
Why does that matter to you?

540
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,988
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

541
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,448
Who are you?

542
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,159
Where has Juhyeong gone?
Are you sick?

543
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,493
- He's being weird.
- He was always weird.

544
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,663
- He's even weirder today.
- I think so too.

545
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,623
I'm so full.

546
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,291
Thanks for the food!

547
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,460
- Thanks.
- Get home safe!

548
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,140
My client's not some terrible person.
That's such a relief.

549
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,768
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

550
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,481
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

551
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,374
Seriously.

552
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,377
Attorney Cho.

553
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,254
Want to hear something funny?

554
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,047
What is it?

555
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,216
Do you know

556
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,927
why my dad stuck you with me?

557
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,388
Well, to keep you entertained.

558
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,057
You're so funny.

559
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,810
You're so naive.

560
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,561
He sent you to keep an eye on me.

561
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,439
He's worried I might rat him out.

562
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,400
- Sorry?
- How do you think I got all my money?

563
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,777
It's all from that geezer.

564
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,030
But man, that old geezer...

565
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,240
is such a coward.

566
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,159
Why would I rat on him?
I'll be out in no time.

567
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,994
I've read some of your case files.

568
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,456
It might be tough to get released soon.

569
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,625
You want to bet?

570
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,086
To see if I get out or not?

571
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,549
I'm not supposed to
tell anyone about this.

572
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,009
This tip's worth hundreds
of millions of won.

573
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:07,929
Geez.

574
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,974
In stock manipulation cases,

575
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,643
it comes down
to who took the unfair gains...

576
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,729
No.

577
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,606
Want to work for me after I get out?

578
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,067
I'll tell you then.

579
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,072
I mean, you're already getting paid
to hang out with me.

580
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,448
Instead of pretending to be a lawyer,

581
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,703
you can just hang with me
while on my payroll.

582
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,663
It'll be fun.

583
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,043
Why would I ever work for you?

584
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,755
What's with that look?

585
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,135
Does showing off that look full of pride

586
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,844
make you feel better?

587
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,848
I don't need to show off
for a lowlife like you.

588
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,810
You're going to rot in here
for the next 10 to 20 years.

589
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,605
For a punk who's not even
getting out of here,

590
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,900
you sure like to run your mouth
about who'd work for you.

591
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,988
If I'm a lowlife,

592
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,491
then what does that make
someone entertaining me like you?

593
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,247
You'll be back in a few days anyway,

594
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,001
so drop the pride.

595
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,253
You'll only hurt yourself.

596
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,778
<i>Thank you, Attorney Ahn.</i>

597
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,072
<i>I'll work hard to teach the kids right.</i>

598
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,950
Talking to a girl?

599
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,535
- You scared me!
- Why did you smile at that text?

600
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,580
It's nothing. Let's go.

601
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,917
- Was it really a girl?
- No, it wasn't. Let's go.

602
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,542
Have a good lunch.

603
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,877
- You too.
- Thank you.

604
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,922
- What are you eating?
<i>- Malatang.</i>

605
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,799
That's a good choice.

606
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,302
What are we eating?

607
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,097
I don't know.

608
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,897
- Off for lunch?
- Of course.

609
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,439
You're not coming?

610
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,734
I think I'll have to eat on my own today.

611
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,487
That wasn't mentioned in the group text.

612
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,699
Why are you arguing? She must be busy.

613
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,409
- No, I...
- Juhyeong,

614
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,953
I'm a busy person too.

615
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,505
- I'll head out first.
- Okay, take care. Make sure you eat.

616
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,632
Okay!

617
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,973
What?

618
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,933
I knew it.

619
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,776
What?

620
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,195
I think we should have cold noodles.

621
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,238
- Sure.
- Today's cold noodles day.

622
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,532
Okay, cold noodles.

623
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,496
- Okay, enjoy.
- Thank you.

624
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,622
Of course.

625
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,167
- Are you leaving? Okay.
- Yes.

626
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,504
Thank you. Come again.

627
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,798
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

628
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,013
Sir, this <i>jajangmyeon</i>'s really good.

629
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,600
Our black bean paste is pretty unique.

630
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,311
I still can't show you the footage.

631
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,605
I'll only look at where my client appears.
That'll be enough.

632
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,607
And I've told you enough times.

633
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,984
Come back with the police.

634
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,911
This is good.

635
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,212
- Move the radish salad.
- Come on.

636
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,799
Nice. I got it.

637
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,136
Who eats cold noodles in the winter?

638
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,097
Cold noodles are originally
from a cold region.

639
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,641
Even people in cold regions
don't eat this in the winter.

640
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,852
You don't drink iced coffee
but eat cold noodles in the winter?

641
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,355
Munjeong said she was really craving it.

642
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,650
She's always really craving something.

643
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,486
Then, get <i>galbitang.</i>
Why do you complain so much when we eat?

644
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,280
I can't be the only one
to order <i>galbitang.</i>

645
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,990
That's true.

646
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,203
- Hey, one cold noodles, please.
- Okay.

647
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,581
Hello? What's up?

648
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,668
Yeah, I work for Law Group Hyungmin.

649
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:50,878
Kang Huiji?

650
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,257
Of course, I know her well. Why?

651
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,595
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

652
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,893
Geez. Hey.

653
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,478
I called you to stop her from coming.

654
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,314
- Why did you come with her?
- What?

655
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,566
It's been a while since I've seen you.

656
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,818
- You two must be really close.
- I'm a regular.

657
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,736
He always brings girls here to woo them.

658
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,405
- Then, he became a regular.
- Hey!

659
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,740
Why would you say that?
She'll get the wrong idea.

660
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,243
What? Why are you flustered?
You're really wooing her?

661
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,329
What are you talking about?
You're so weird.

662
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,000
But what do you do to woo them?

663
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,751
Well, that...

664
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,336
is a trade secret.

665
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,422
What a load of crap.

666
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,548
If I say no, it means no.

667
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,593
But since you're here with Changwon,
enjoy your meal.

668
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,678
I'll give you some mayo shrimp
on the house.

669
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,764
Thank you. I'll be back often.

670
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

671
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,061
- See you later.
- See you later!

672
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,284
Thank you for waiting.

673
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,954
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

674
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,747
It's so good.

675
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,499
Geez, they're so annoying.

676
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:23,553
It's burnt.
I can't post photos of burnt meat.

677
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,638
- No, wait...
- Not this one.

678
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,016
- It's because I was waiting for you.
- But this meat doesn't look good.

679
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,560
- Cook me a new piece.
- Okay.

680
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,603
- A new one.
- It's frozen.

681
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,812
Nice. The lighting's perfect.

682
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,980
- Done.
- Done?

683
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,107
Okay.

684
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,365
- Sorry.
- Was that revenge?

685
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,701
- I'm eating the burnt ones for you.
- Okay.

686
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,667
Goodness.

687
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,293
Here's your fried rice.

688
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,798
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

689
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,513
Stop smiling.

690
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,306
Why not?

691
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:16,816
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

692
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,113
Goodness.

693
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,074
I feel like it might work
if we go just one more time.

694
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,119
Right? One more time and we could puke.

695
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,121
These darn convenience store tables.

696
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,957
Why did they have to leave it here?

697
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,752
Still, you're seriously a committed one.

698
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,880
Sorry for dragging you in.

699
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,506
No, it's okay.

700
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,093
Following you around makes me feel
like I'm working hard too.

701
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,429
It's fun. I like it.

702
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,139
Really?

703
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,682
Then, does this feel worth doing?

704
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,727
You said you wanted some exciting work.

705
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,270
Well...

706
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,440
This is way better than what I'm doing.

707
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
I think

708
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,445
I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

709
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,947
Why? You're the one
who loves coming to work the most.

710
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,493
That's just because you guys are here.
That's why I enjoy it.

711
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,162
The job itself is...

712
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:12,704
I'm not sure about it.

713
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:17,000
Still, if you ever quit,
you can take over your father's business.

714
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,335
Come on.

715
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,297
It's his company, not mine.
I've told you a million times.

716
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,216
What about your dad?
You said he runs a business too.

717
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,968
Yeah.

718
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,137
Just a second.

719
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,306
Hey, Dad.

720
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,143
No, I didn't forget.
We talked about it last time.

721
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,105
Next Friday...

722
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,442
Okay. Bye.

723
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,029
What? You have plans next Friday?

724
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,074
Yeah, my parents' memorial rites.

725
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,992
What?

726
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,620
What? What is it?

727
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,164
Wait.

728
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,875
Just now on the phone,

729
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,293
didn't you say "Dad"?

730
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,962
Yeah, I was talking to my dad.

731
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,007
So...

732
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,302
- Your mother's memorial rites?
- No, my parents'.

733
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,054
What?

734
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:16,852
My parents passed away when I was seven,
so my aunt and uncle raised me.

735
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,438
My uncle's basically my dad.

736
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,859
I see.

737
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,737
Then...

738
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:32,993
So the dad who runs a business
is your uncle, who was just on the phone.

739
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,454
No, wait. He's your dad.

740
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,666
No, your dad passed away, so...

741
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:40,751
What?

742
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,171
Tough, right? It's okay.
You don't have to say anything.

743
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,714
No, still...

744
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,300
I feel like

745
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,593
I should say something.

746
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,179
No, just relax.

747
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,139
Is that okay?

748
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,559
Yeah, just relax. I'm fine.

749
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,311
Thanks.

750
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,553
SCHOLARSHIP RECOMMENDATION

751
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,347
This year's candidates
have been narrowed down to five.

752
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,143
Four high school seniors
and one student on a gap year.

753
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,980
This student's reported parental income
fluctuates a lot from year to year.

754
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,942
Do another background check to see
whether it's been underreported

755
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,819
compared to actual income.

756
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,447
- Then, I'll make a final decision.
- Yes, ma'am.

757
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,700
Chairman, Lee Dongsu
from the first cohort...

758
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,827
Again?

759
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,749
And the victim?

760
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,791
He hasn't hired a lawyer yet, right?

761
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,961
No, he's handling the case alone.

762
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,008
Should we cover
the victim's legal fees again?

763
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,344
No.

764
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,597
This time,
let's not just cover the legal fees.

765
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,433
Bring him here instead.

766
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,062
This is Law Group Hyungmin.

767
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,273
Let's represent the victim ourselves.

768
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,443
It's what I always wanted to do
if I ever got to form a law group.

769
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,570
Yes, ma'am.

770
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,120
- Hey.
- Welcome--

771
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,915
Seriously.

772
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,584
I've had it with you two.

773
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,002
Come on.

774
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,507
You sure it's okay to show you this?

775
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,885
I'm sure of it! You can show it
as long as no one else is seen.

776
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,303
But tell that kid to come.

777
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,348
- Doesn't he live around here anyway?
- Yes!

778
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,933
If I get in trouble, it's on you.

779
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,936
- Come on, man. We're lawyers.
- And I'm an ex-convict.

780
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,522
- I'll represent you.
- Deal.

781
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,496
My goodness.

782
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,625
Why did you do that?

783
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,190
I can't get a job.

784
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,654
I got drunk and stole someone's stuff.

785
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,161
Man, I'm absolute trash.

786
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:58,634
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

787
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,476
What do I do now, Attorney Kang?

788
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,520
You have to pretend not to know.

789
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,400
That's what I have to say as your lawyer.

790
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,695
With just the police's CCTV footage,
it'll be hard to prove anything.

791
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:19,863
But...

792
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,992
if I were your older sister,

793
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,997
I'd tell you to take that footage
to the police yourself.

794
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:37,589
If you're already beating yourself up
for being unemployed and stealing,

795
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,095
how will you live with yourself
if you also lie and hide this?

796
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,392
Getting cleared won't make
what you did wrong disappear.

797
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,819
That's a 2,668 percent increase
in the estimated statement.

798
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,743
What's going on?
Why are you gathered like it was planned?

799
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,287
Hey! Did you...

800
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:12,874
- Did you get together without me?
- We ran into each other by chance.

801
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,460
- For real?
- Is this <i>kimbap?</i>

802
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,462
- Ouch.
- I had so much greasy food lately.

803
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:18,963
I need something spicy.

804
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,089
Eat up, you punk.

805
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,341
Spicy...

806
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,761
<i>Spicy pepper</i> kimbap<i>.</i>

807
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,555
Spicy pepper <i>kimbap</i>?
There are two rolls. Give me one.

808
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,515
- Ouch!
- Hands off. It's Huiji's.

809
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,225
I thought she might need this too.

810
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,977
Munjeong needs one too.

811
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,104
What about Sanggi?

812
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,689
Get one yourselves.

813
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:40,486
Since we're all here

814
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,697
and we haven't hung out in a while,
let's set a date.

815
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,158
Well, how about next Friday?

816
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,576
- That works.
- Sounds good.

817
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,828
It works for me.

818
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,788
- But it won't work for Huiji.
- Really?

819
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,291
- And how do you know this?
- She just has things to do.

820
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,210
Because of that CCTV footage?

821
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,462
She's done with that.

822
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,882
- But she just has things to do.
- Okay, how about tonight then?

823
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,800
- Tonight sounds good too.
- Me too.

824
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,928
- Tonight won't work either.
- You or Huiji?

825
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,723
- Both of us.
- Geez, when can we hang out then?

826
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,561
Hey, you said you had a trial. Go on.

827
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,271
- Okay.
- I'll put up a poll in the group text.

828
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,356
What case is this?

829
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,651
This is Munjeong's case.
I was helping out for 10,000 won.

830
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,779
Hey! I said that's for Huiji!

831
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,282
What's his deal?

832
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,659
Geez, I can't do this.

833
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,412
Munjeong, take this back.
I can't do this for just 10,000 won.

834
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,497
Why not, Attorney Ha?

835
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,166
A 150-page summary
for 10,000 won is ridiculous.

836
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,127
- No refunds.
- Give me another 10,000 won, please.

837
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,255
- Just 10,000 won more.
- Just have some <i>kimbap.</i>

838
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,840
Just an extra 10,000 won!

839
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,439
Hello, Mr. Na.

840
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,984
<i>- You're not in court today, right?</i>
- That's right.

841
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,778
I just got a call that my kid's hurt,
so I rushed out.

842
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,322
But I totally forgot
that I had a trial to attend.

843
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,825
Could you cover for me?

844
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,285
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

845
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,537
What time is the trial?

846
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,163
<i>It's at 4:00 p.m.</i>

847
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,584
It's 3:50 p.m. right now.

848
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,502
If you run, you'll make it in time.

849
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,463
Okay, I'll hang up now.

850
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,757
<i>All right. Sorry.</i>

851
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,553
Damn it.

852
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,099
Damn it!

853
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,434
Attorney Bae!

854
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,937
Thank you! Sorry!

855
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,959
The plaintiff, Pungcheon Trading Company.
Are you present?

856
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,254
Plaintiff? Pungcheon Trading Company?

857
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,716
- Yes, I'm here.
- Yes, please step forward.

858
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,469
The defendant, Century International.

859
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,220
Present.

860
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,974
Okay, the plaintiff submitted their brief
during yesterday's session.

861
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,853
We'll begin
as soon as everything is ready.

862
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,762
<i>Hello, this is ON OB-GYN Clinic.</i>

863
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,515
<i>For appointments and inquiries--</i>

864
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,184
<i>- Hello, this is ON OB-GYN Clinic.</i>
- Hello.

865
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,688
I was wondering
if I could make an appointment?

866
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,066
The Chinese restaurant across the street?

867
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,194
Yes, they have a private CCTV.

868
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,452
It captured everything
without any blind spots.

869
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,538
Really?

870
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,667
Then, who was the culprit?

871
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,086
- It was me.
- What?

872
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,881
Yes, my client took it with him.

873
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,092
I see.

874
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,722
Then, I'll find out
how we'll proceed with this.

875
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,306
This will count as turning himself in.

876
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,934
But honestly,
I don't know where the watch is.

877
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,102
I don't even remember.

878
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,938
I might've dropped it somewhere.
But I'll make up for it somehow.

879
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,899
Okay. I'll talk to the victim about that.

880
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,403
Don't worry too much.

881
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,405
It wasn't that expensive.

882
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,532
I see. Thank you.

883
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,626
I guess you didn't tell your mom
it was an interview this time?

884
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,712
That's right.

885
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,630
What did you tell her?

886
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,551
I said I was going to the police station.

887
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,636
Good job.

888
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,848
Thank you, Attorney Kang.

889
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,643
You might as well call me your big sister

890
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,437
since you took her advice
and not your lawyer's.

891
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,814
Right. Okay.

892
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,816
Let's go.

893
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,620
- I'm buying to show thanks. Let me grill.
- It's okay.

894
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,080
I just want to eat quickly.

895
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:50,961
I was pretty bummed last time
when they went to eat barbecue without us.

896
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:56,343
That's why I said I'd treat you today.
You missed out because of me.

897
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,637
Still, it all worked out.

898
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,138
That guy's braver than he looks.

899
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,681
Yeah, I know.

900
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,559
This looks ready. Dig in.

901
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
Hold on!

902
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,398
Excuse me! One bottle of soju, please!

903
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,784
I don't want to go to work.

904
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:22,869
Why not?

905
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:28,749
I just blew up at someone I hate
like I'd never see them again.

906
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,335
But I'll have to see him soon.

907
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,087
Maybe even tomorrow.

908
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,967
You must really hate it.

909
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,056
Did you understand what I meant?

910
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,476
Not really,

911
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,604
but it felt like
you didn't want to say any more.

912
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,824
Actually...

913
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,244
I've been doing prison visitations lately.

914
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,955
- Prison visitations?
- Yeah.

915
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,042
I'm not even representing him.

916
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,753
Just keeping him company every day
is so exhausting.

917
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,923
Why would they make you do that?

918
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,093
That's why you've had that moody face?

919
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,473
How much longer do you have to go?

920
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,643
I have no idea
and not knowing that

921
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,645
is the hardest part.

922
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,825
Cheers.

923
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,675
Should we get more spicy cold noodles?

924
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,762
Sure. Ma'am!

925
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,638
One spicy cold noodles, please.

926
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,848
Okay.

927
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,691
Excuse me. We're ready to order here.

928
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,486
- Over here, please.
- Okay.

929
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,404
Thank you.

930
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,031
Okay.

931
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,700
As you get older,
you need to warm eat foods.

932
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,036
You can't eat that cold stuff.

933
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,247
This has been my favorite spot for ages.
Please enjoy.

934
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

935
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,379
Anyways, thanks to you,
our company has grown so much.

936
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,965
Business is definitely better.

937
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,424
We're truly grateful!

938
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,469
- You're welcome.
- All right.

939
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:46,929
Three pieces of meat.

940
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,473
Gosh, three pieces.

941
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,142
- Have some.
- Thank you.

942
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,020
Thank you.

943
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,151
By the way,
why did you want to meet today?

944
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,071
I'm actually pretty busy.

945
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,782
Right.

946
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,745
Since you're all busy,
I'll cut to the chase.

947
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,708
I'd like to ask you to take a case.

948
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,461
It's not a case that I'm involved in.

949
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,132
It's just a referral,
so please don't feel pressured.

950
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:25,968
Take on a case?

951
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,053
Yes.

952
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,930
Out of this group,

953
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,434
I was hoping two of you could take it.

954
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:36,312
Ms. Kim said she's too busy,

955
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:41,484
and Mr. Seong said
his business is already doing so well.

956
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:47,365
So I was thinking Mr. Na
and Ms. Kang could handle this one.

957
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,201
Us two?

958
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,370
I mean,

959
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,455
we're not doing <i>that</i> well.

960
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,539
I see.

961
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,166
So there are two cases?

962
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,876
No, just one.

963
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,003
Just one? Then, why both of us?

964
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:04,214
I want you two to work on it together.

965
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:07,092
That's the only condition I'm asking of.

966
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,803
I like collaborative cases.

967
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,639
I see. It's all right, Mr. Seong.

968
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,224
Since we're now one firm,

969
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,643
how about taking this chance
to collaborate?

970
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,771
That way,
I'll know the merger was worth it.

971
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,356
Together?

972
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,193
Think it over as you eat.

973
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,948
Why aren't you eating the rice?

974
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,659
I've stopped eating carbs.

975
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,621
I see.

976
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,641
You're getting out late.

977
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,226
Yes.

978
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,019
Witness examination?

979
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,147
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.

980
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,363
Did that CCTV footage case wrap up okay?

981
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:12,658
We checked
and it turned out my client did take it.

982
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,453
But he came clean and apologized.

983
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,957
It was just a mistake.
He wasn't a bad person.

984
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,918
Nice work. That's a relief.

985
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,170
Right?

986
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,053
Why don't you have a meal with me?

987
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:33,888
- Sorry?
- It's just...

988
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,809
Didn't you promise to buy me a meal?

989
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,187
For Ku Dongkyun's case?

990
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,773
Of course, I will.

991
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,317
Were you upset that I didn't?

992
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,195
I'm not upset. It's just...

993
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,697
A promise is a promise.

994
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,283
Okay, I'll treat you.

995
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,785
Think about what you'd like.

996
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,745
Okay.

997
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,020
Hello, Mr. Park.

998
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,566

<i>Yeah, let's give Sanggi some time.</i>

01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,987
You've been weirdly warm these days.

1046
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,156
<i>You must've been to a lot of clubs.</i>

1047
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,075
<i>Yes. You haven't?</i>

1048
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,454
I thought we were a lot closer
than some random coworkers.

1049
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,372
<i>I guess only I thought we were friends.</i>

1050
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,126
Is it okay if I bring it up?

1051
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,505
<i>Did I tell you this 10 years ago too?</i>

1052
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,008
<i>You really don't remember a thing.</i>
