ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY

4
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,192
What are you looking at
with such interest?

5
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,694
What brings you here?

6
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,279
I was about to ask you the same.

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,572
What brings you here?

8
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,407
It was written in the handover notes.

9
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,577
It said to come here
when I needed to relax.

10
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,704
He sure made the handover notes detailed.

11
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,165
I come here often to run.

12
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,336
Did you just go for a run?

13
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,382
Didn't you see me?

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,260
- I didn't.
- I'm pretty sure you did.

15
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,264
- Why would I lie about that?
- You're good at lying.

16
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,101
You really are a strange person.

17
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,395
When have I ever lied?

18
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,151
Back then, in Hong Kong.

19
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,529
We never said we'd meet again
once we returned to Seoul.

20
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,949
Just be honest.

21
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,035
You remember, don't you?

22
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,871
It came back to me afterward.
It came back to me but--

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,581
You remembered from the very start.

24
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,669
Also, you clearly asked me
to meet you in Seoul.

25
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,046
If there's a spot...

26
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,466
like this in Seoul,
want to go together?

27
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,718
Where?

28
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,639
Gangnam Station.

29
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,434
Gangnam Station.

30
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,353
We even picked a date and place.

31
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,562
Right, we did.

32
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,648
So?

33
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,317
But you're the one who canceled it.

34
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,778
I did?

35
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,570
By the way,

36
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,990
do you think we'll be together
back in Seoul?

37
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,785
Well...

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,745
We agreed to meet up in Seoul.

39
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,624
But we didn't actually
make any solid plans yet.

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:35,715
Since we're on a trip, I thought maybe
we're just caught up in the mood and all.

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,182
How is that canceling our plans?
That's not what I meant.

42
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,811
That is what you meant.
What else could it be?

43
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,067
Don't you know what "be together" means?

44
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,783
Come on. That's not the vibe
you gave off back then.

45
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,411
If it was, then why did you
ghost me in Seoul?

46
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,289
That's just more proof
that you wanted to cancel.

47
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,668
I didn't ignore you on purpose.
Back then, my phone--

48
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,715
Don't tell me you lost your phone.

49
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,634
You're right. I lost it.

50
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,187
<i>I arrived at the airport for my flight,
but I couldn't find it anywhere.</i>

51
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,564
Geez!

52
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:38,528
Since your number was saved on that phone,
I couldn't switch to a new one.

53
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,864
I even emailed the places in Hong Kong
but never found it.

54
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,491
I'm supposed to believe that?

55
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,993
Geez, you're such a strange person.

56
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,328
Why won't you believe me?

57
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,871
Because you're a good liar.

58
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,749
When did I ever lie to you?

59
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,836
In any case, you were the one
who said we should meet up.

60
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,505
Why say it
if you weren't going to show up?

61
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,716
Because I liked you.

62
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,769
Back then. Not now.

63
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:13,980
Yes, I know.

64
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,567
You were pretty and kind back then.

65
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,779
Now, it seems you've become kind of weird.

66
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,157
Who? Me and not yourself?

67
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,951
You're still pretty though.

68
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,421
You're not heading back?

69
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,925
I was about to.

70
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,510
Let's go.

71
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,018
Episode 3
How to Separate Work from Personal Life

72
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,693
I'm sorry about Jang Hyeonseok's case.

73
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,573
It was your case,
but I acted like I knew better.

74
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,742
I still don't think I was wrong,

75
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,746
and I believe the judge
should've been shown that precedent.

76
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,417
But I can't deny that I was being nosy.

77
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,088
I never even thought about it
from the standpoints you mentioned.

78
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,675
Are you apologizing right now?

79
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,636
I have to admit what's true.

80
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,724
But like you said, I'm just a first-year.

81
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,477
What's the worth of going all out
to fight a first-year over that?

82
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,772
If I didn't know,
you could've just explained it nicely.

83
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,572
By the way, didn't you say
you were a piano major then?

84
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,283
I never imagined you'd become a lawyer.

85
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,787
I totally knew you'd become a lawyer.

86
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,665
Well, obviously.
I was a law student back then.

87
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,836
That doesn't guarantee you'll make it.
You could've failed the exam.

88
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,879
Me?

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,800
Then, why would your handover notes say
to ask me if you didn't know something?

90
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,469
It's because I'm good.

91
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,429
What's the use?

92
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,641
You're so scary I can't even ask.

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,437
Fine. I'll help you as much as I can.

94
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,438
Nicely?

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,774
Well, I can't promise that.

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,489
- Then, can I ask you something now?
- Right now?

97
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,867
When were you planning to start? Tomorrow?

98
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,953
Go ahead.

99
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,709
What do you do when you're assigned a case
you don't want to take?

100
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,586
What employee actually gets to do
what they want?

101
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,507
You just do the job
without thinking about it.

102
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,009
Still, we're not just regular employees.

103
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,512
We get a paycheck, don't we?

104
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,054
We're the same.

105
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,389
We're lawyers though.

106
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,641
Just salaried lawyers.

107
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,353
I can't agree with this mindset either.

108
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,355
But fine.

109
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,900
It means even you have cases
you don't want to handle, right?

110
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,653
Yes. Family cases.

111
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,406
There's too much emotion involved
with the parties, so it's exhausting.

112
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,951
Aren't family cases
the most interesting ones?

113
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,704
Things like affairs, divorces,
and inheritances.

114
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:20,500
You think cheating, broken families,
and people dying are interesting?

115
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,340
When you put it like that,
it doesn't sound so good.

116
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,095
You tried to make me feel bad
on purpose, didn't you?

117
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,681
I told you to let me know nicely.

118
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,684
I said I couldn't promise that.

119
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,398
PRECEDENT ON PUNISHMENTS
FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE

120
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,014

OUR TEAM

126
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,057
I guess the merger really did happen.

127
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,976
Right? What kind of company
merges in just two weeks?

128
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,438
There are 15 lawyers in total,

129
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,523
but four are managing partners?

130
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,609
Out of 15 lawyers,
around 10 are members of the team.

131
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,362
And only five are associates.

132
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,280
You mean the other members
are partners, right?

133
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,700
Yeah, and they all operate separately.

134
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,120
Still, we're all under one roof now.

135
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,579
We're not in the same company.

136
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,498
Technically, we are in the same company.

137
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,792
Don't kill the mood.

138
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,628
Thanks. You're the best.

139
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,047
What's with Changwon's photo?
Where did he take this?

140
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,966
Seriously,
are you some kind of musician?

141
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,551
What? It came out great.

142
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,679
- No, it's...
- The break room's nice, isn't it?

143
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,307
- Hello.
- Hello.

149
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,534
Nice to meet you.

150
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,786
Make yourselves at home.

151
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,164
Let me know if you need anything.

152
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,374
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

153
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,217
Well, my office is over there.

154
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,344
- Yes.
- Right.

155
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,597
Have a good day.

156
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,563
Gosh.

157
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,984
What exactly do you do
as an advisor though?

158
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,654
Maybe she adds people to a vise.

00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,319
ATTORNEY KIM GEONCHEOL

178
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:51,057
SAEMUN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

179
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,521
When did my son's hands get this big?

180
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,858
I'm so proud of you, my son.

181
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,154
Because you're such a strong boy.

182
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,618
- What's going on?
- Geunhwan?

183
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,703
Doctor?

184
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,080
Doctor!

185
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,249
- Geunhwan.
- Doctor!

186
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,376
Geunhwan?

187
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,670
Honey, get out of the way.

188
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,839
- Move.
- Geunhwan?

189
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,174
Call a Code Blue.

190
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,804
Geunhwan?

191
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,556
Geunhwan!

192
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,913
There's no way our professor
made a surgical error.

193
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,082
By the way,
how do you two know each other?

194
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,127
I'm Kim Jeongsu,
head of Administration at the hospital.

195
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,879
I told them I could come alone,

196
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,382
but I think the hospital
wanted someone with me.

197
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,387
You're not the only defendant.
The hospital is too. That's why I'm here.

198
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,973
This is the surgery footage.

199
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,603
As you'll see, he didn't make any mistakes
during the operation.

200
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,648
Were you aware that the surgery
was being recorded?

201
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,736
Yes, we film every procedure
from start to finish.

202
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,822
- Did he die on the same day?
- Yes, in the evening.

203
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,658
- Any criminal charges?
- Yes.

204
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,370
But medical negligence wasn't found,
so they were dismissed.

205
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,082
I believe the family is trying
a civil suit as a last resort.

206
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,086
Looking at the complaint,
they didn't make any new claims.

207
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,549
Are you here to keep Prof. Ku quiet?

208
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,552
What?

209
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,097
No, not at all.

210
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,225
You've been answering everything for him.

211
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,520
So I was just wondering
why he wasn't allowed to speak.

212
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,856
No, there's nothing like that.

213
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,443
What kind of surgery
did the patient receive?

214
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,783
He had diverticulitis.

215
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,286
But there was a perforation,
so we couldn't do a laparoscopy

216
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,996
and did an open surgery instead.

217
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,832
After the surgery,
he suddenly went into shock and died.

218
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,335
"Diverticulitis."

219
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,796
Sorry, I'm not familiar,
but what exactly is that?

220
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:32,133
It's when little, bulging pouches develop
in the wall of the colon.

221
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,680
If waste gets trapped in those pouches,
it can lead to inflammation,

222
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,430
and they can often rupture.

223
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,142
- So in this case, there was a perforation?
- Yes.

224
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,229
It's a claim for damages,

225
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,317
saying the surgery was negligent,
the risks weren't properly explained,

226
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,986
and the surgeon arrived late.

227
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,154
Can't I just apologize

228
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,408
- and end this with a settlement?
- Professor.

229
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,243
You said you would stop saying that.

230
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,329
Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

231
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:09,129
So, you've been a surgeon
for quite a while, right?

232
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,298
Yes, well...

233
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,216
It's been about 20 years.

234
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,261
Then, this probably wasn't
the first time you've lost a patient.

235
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,639
No, it wasn't.

236
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,767
Do you usually

237
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,229
apologize and settle with the family
whenever this happens?

238
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,523
No.

239
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,357
Not always.

240
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,820
Then, may I ask why
you want to apologize this time?

241
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,490
I've never lost a patient
this young before.

242
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,411
As a doctor, I hate saying
some lives matter more than others,

243
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,455
but this one's been hard.

244
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,667
But an apology could be used
as evidence of negligence.

245
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,544
Please think about the hospital too.

246
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,714
That may not necessarily be the case.

247
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,300
If there's no other evidence
of surgical malpractice,

248
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,886
an apology alone isn't enough
to prove liability.

249
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,513
Still, it could make the hospital
look at fault,

250
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,766
and that could blow things up even more.

251
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,810
On top of that,
you want to offer a settlement too?

252
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,063
When we were sued,

253
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,274
wasn't it enough
to stop me from apologizing?

254
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,234
Now that we've been cleared,

255
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,653
let's apologize and settle things.

256
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,405
I said we can't do that, Professor!

257
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,293
Would it be possible for me
to attend the trial?

258
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,047
You're not required to appear,
but you can if you'd like.

259
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,508
Then, I'll see you at the trial.

260
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,386
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

261
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,514
All right, then.

262
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,229
I'm telling you,
I have no way of finding that out.

263
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,940
You can just sit in on the trial.

264
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,901
I'll let you know
the courtroom number and time.

265
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,946
I can't go there during work.
It's not even my case.

266
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,365
Dad, I'm an office worker too, okay?

267
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,575
I snuck out just now
and have to get back soon.

268
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,370
If Hanguk Group goes down,
our company goes down with it.

269
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,039
Hanguk Group makes trillions.

270
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,124
Losing one trial won't ruin them.

271
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,000
- That's not so for companies.
- Gosh.

272
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,837
It's the little things
that pile up and weaken them.

273
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,297
It's our job to pay attention
to things like these.

274
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,425
I know you subcontract for Hanguk Group,

275
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,760
- but this is too much of a fuss.
- As it should be.

276
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,263
They put food on our table.

277
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,931
Everything you've enjoyed came from them.

278
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,892
Not anymore. Count me out.

279
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,937
Wanting out won't make it happen.
We're a family business.

280
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,440
Family business, my foot.

281
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,066
Goodness.

282
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,121
Get your rice cakes!

283
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,247
For crying out loud.

284
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,833
- You going around selling rice cakes now?
- You little...

285
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,085
Who still uses
<i>bojagi</i> wrapping cloth like this?

286
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,588
I'm busy. Move.

287
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,631
Later.

288
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,651
You look young.

289
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,279
Thank you.

290
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,489
Are you really a lawyer?

291
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,741
- Yes.
- How many years in?

292
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,326
Me?

293
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,330
About seven or eight years.

294
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,832
Really? So you're not a newbie.

295
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,210
A law school graduate?

296
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,629
- Yes.
- You must come from money.

297
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,297
Sorry?

298
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,383
Nothing. Please keep reading.

299
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,230
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

300
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,482
Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

301
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,777
I'm reaching out
through Ms. Kang Jeongyun.

302
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,363
Yes, I heard. Hello.

303
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,824
Hello. Whenever we have a medical lawsuit,

304
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,534
I heard you consult for us.

305
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,285
Thank you, as always.

306
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,163
Did you get a chance
to review the footage we sent?

307
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,581
Yes, I did.

308
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,209
But there was nothing strange about it.

309
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,464
His hands seem a little slow,
but some doctors just work slowly.

310
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,968
- Then, what caused the shock?
<i>- It's usually unpredictable.</i>

311
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,762
And there are thousands of causes.

312
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,516
Sudden deaths like this
are beyond what humans can control.

313
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,188
I see. Thank you for your time, Doctor.

314
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,816
Goodbye.

315
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,881
We'll proceed with the next case.

316
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:07,928
Civil case number 2024-24215,
please step forward.

317
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,516
Plaintiff, Min Subin.
Defendant, Gonggang Industries.

318
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,646
I didn't say you could sit.

319
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,108
I apologize.

320
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,033
Please be seated.

321
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,038
Yesterday, we submitted a request
to present financial transaction records.

322
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,706
Request denied.

323
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,292
But Your Honor, as I explained,

324
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,211
the defendant is using the same name
as Gonggang Construction

325
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,881
and likely mixed
financial transactions with them--

326
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,675
This court is not an institution
for collecting evidence

327
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,218
of such a broad range.

328
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,638
Request denied.

329
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,807
But we've explained why it's necessary--

330
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,226
Nothing further from either side,
I assume?

331
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,561
No, Your Honor.

332
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,314
Then, we'll end proceedings.

333
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,108
The verdict is set
for the 24th of January...

334
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,171
That's insane!

335
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,715
- Damn it, that scared me.
- Right?

336
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,052
Even if he's not at fault,
someone died and he wants to apologize.

337
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,804
Isn't wrong to stop that?

338
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,764
- That's just plain wrong!
- Right?

339
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,058
- Maybe the doctor was at fault.
- That's not it.

340
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,186
He was cleared in the criminal case
with no sign of malpractice.

341
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,563
There's no risk,
but they won't let him apologize.

342
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,816
What's diverticulitis? Could you explain?

343
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,068
Sanggi, look.

344
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,530
Let me show you.
If your colon is shaped like this...

345
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,657
The small, bulging pouches
are diverticula.

346
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,076
They're prone to inflammation
and perforation,

347
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,412
so they usually remove them
with laparoscopy.

348
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,372
But inflammation means open surgery.

349
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,417
Wait, how do you even know that?

350
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,046
What? You said to help
if you didn't know something.

351
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,215
But I knew very well this time.

352
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,591
Don't empathize.

353
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,343
It's just work.

354
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,431
If you empathize, you'll lose objectivity
and hinder your work.

355
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,225
Juhyeong, stop pretending like
you're choosing not to empathize.

356
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,728
You don't empathize,
because you can't feel anything.

357
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,188
It's not by choice, okay?

358
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,150
You two are bantering a lot more now.

359
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,776
I thought we'd gotten closer.

360
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,611
Yeah, I am closer with you.

361
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,905
- Right?
- Yeah.

362
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,950
Did you just wink?

363
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,245
- Want one too?
- This day's been so brutal.

364
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,834
Goddamn it.

365
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,587
- Wet wipes.
- Wet wipes.

366
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,005
Hey, use this first.

367
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,090
- In the back.
- Hey.

368
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,699
Yes?

369
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,912
Ma'am, I just got back
from the verdict for Kang Yungu's case.

370
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,082
We won 650 million won.

371
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,584
- Really? That's a relief.
- Yes.

372
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,920
I'll let you know
once the judgment's delivered.

373
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,380
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

374
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,054
At least that's good news.

375
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,310
KANG YUNGU

376
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,188
- Hello?
- <i>Did you hear the verdict?</i>

377
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,983
- Yes, I did. Thankfully--
<i>- Why is it only 650 million won?</i>

378
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,820
<i>I filed for 700 million won.
Where's the rest?</i>

379
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:58,407
About that.
The 50 million was confirmed as repaid.

380
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,952
We planned to reduce
that part of the claim anyway--

381
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,621
<i>I said I didn't get that money.</i>

382
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,582
You received the 50 million
and it's all on record.

383
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,128
<i>What are you going to do
about the 50 million won?</i>

384
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,341
Mr. Kang,
out of the 700 million we claimed,

385
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,637
about 400 million
had no direct evidence of--

386
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,391
<i>If the court recognized all 700 million,
why did we only win 650 million?</i>

387
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,936
<i>Why did you lose 50 million won? Why?</i>

388
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,656
- Attorney Ahn.
- Yes, what is it?

389
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,994
What? Are you hungry?

390
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,788
No, it's not that.

391
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,298
- Here.
- I said it's not that.

392
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,234
Want to grab drinks later?

393
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,279
Are you an alcoholic? Give it a rest.

394
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,239
Okay.

395
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,204
Thank you for the snack.

396
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,459
When do you want to grab dinner?

397
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,920
I have dinner plans.

398
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,547
Everyone's busy.

399
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,216
Got it. Bye.

400
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,781
Something feels off.

401
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,575
What could it be?

402
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,039
MEDICAL RECORD

403
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,755
PERFORATION

404
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,186
Attorney Bae, did we lose Mr. Kang's case?

405
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,813
Sorry? Lose his case?

406
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,024
Yes, Mr. Kang is in an uproar right now.

407
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,945
Sir, we won 650 million
out of 700 million.

408
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,156
Then, why is he going nuts
and saying we lost?

409
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:44,991
I have no idea either.

410
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,785
It was confirmed the 50 million
was already repaid,

411
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,373
- so we suggested reducing the claim--
- Got it. Let's talk again tomorrow.

412
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,012
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

413
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,474
ATTORNEY HA SANGGI

414
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,895
Couldn't this be seen
as another person's life?

415
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,899
Lately, the courts have been narrowing
their definition of another person's life

416
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,359
- in breach of trust cases.
- No.

417
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,945
- No, look at this clause right here.
- Here?

418
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,489
- This one?
- No, here.

419
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,116
I didn't see this before.

420
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,243
Cheers.

421
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,373
By the way, are you really a lawyer?

422
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,584
Truth is, I'm not.

423
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,128
- What?
- I'm a K-pop idol.

424
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,255
- Come on.
- It's the truth.

425
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,424
I wasn't a famous K-pop idol.

426
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,550
But I really was one.

427
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,428
And one day, I thought about
giving studying a shot and--

428
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,765
MUNJEONG

429
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,027
Bastards.

430
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,489
They're never around
when you actually need them.

431
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,391
Let's finish this up tomorrow.

432
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,770
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

433
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,607
If you don't have any plans,
do you want to grab a beer?

434
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,279
Well, are you buying?

435
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,656
Of course.

436
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,409
- In that case, sounds good.
- Okay.

437
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,078
I'll go wrap up then, ma'am.

438
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,330
- Okay.
- All right.

439
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,378
Ma'am, my hands are full.
Could you open the door for me?

440
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,306
Okay.

441
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,934
She didn't even open the door for me.

442
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
Gosh.

443
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,700
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

444
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,452
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

445
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,205
- Call me when you get home.
- Okay.

446
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,506
<i>Is everyone busy?</i>

447
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,008
<i>You're not the only busy ones.</i>

448
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,468
<i>Ptooey! Screw you.</i>

449
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,812
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

450
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,360
ATTORNEY BAE MUNJEONG

451
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,546
Let's go now.

452
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,591
Let's go.

453
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,524
- You're always here late--
- My goodness!

454
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,733
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

455
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,444
Hello, Ms. Kim.

456
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,197
- Are you going home now?
- Yes.

457
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,491
But what are you doing here at this hour?

458
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,621
Well, I was just on a little patrol.

459
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,961
No one told you to do that, right?

460
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,923
No, that's not it. I just felt like it.
It's mine, after all.

461
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,508
Yours?

462
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,593
Well...

463
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,888
The company and the building are all mine.

464
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,934
Hyungmin Building.

465
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,478
Kim Hyungmin.

466
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,190
- I see!
- Yes.

467
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,236
Okay, get home safe.

468
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,322
Thank you.

469
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,241
Feel free to swing by my office next time.

470
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,034
Yes, I will.

471
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,620
- Okay.
- I'll get going.

472
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,288
I'm off.

473
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,458
- Hey, aren't you going to eat?
- Nope.

474
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,847
Damn it.

475
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,846
Wake up and get ready for work.

476
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,664
Okay.

477
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,716
It's my day off today.

478
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,593
Day off?

479
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,763
Yeah.

480
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,937
How long are you going to
sulk like that for?

481
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,273
What's everyone so busy with?

482
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,485
Sorry, I saw your message late last night.

483
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,154
Let's not call coworkers late at night.

484
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,823
Or I'll report you for harassment.

485
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,992
Since when are we coworkers?

486
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,994
We work at the same company now.

487
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,872
Hey, I begged like crazy,
but you wouldn't drink with me.

488
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,957
How are we coworkers?

489
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,084
You can just have drinks
with your husband.

490
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,210
He's no fun.

491
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,711
- He's not?
- Nope.

492
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,672
Do you all know him?

493
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,424
Not all of us.
He's Juhyeong's high school friend.

494
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,926
Still, they're a good match.

495
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,053
That's why I introduced them
to each other.

496
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,889
They hit it off, got married,
and are still doing well now.

497
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,683
- Happily together.
- All lovey-dovey.

498
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,352
- As they chit-chat.
- Cut the crap.

499
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,771
Good match, my foot.

500
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,193
You're expressing exhaustion
with every fiber of your being.

501
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,611
Did you work late last night?

502
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,864
Yes, I was looking into that medical case.

503
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,700
You said the surgery went fine.
Why keep digging?

504
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,410
I know,

505
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,538
but something just keeps feeling off.

506
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,290
Gut feeling is a science too, you know.

507
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,917
How is that a science?
It's just a feeling.

508
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,795
No, gut feeling is based on big data.

509
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,842
Your gut feeling emerges
from your lifetime of experiences.

510
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,802
I didn't know it had a philosophy.

511
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,556
No, Munjeong.
This is what you call insight.

512
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,641
She knows her stuff.

513
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,102
No.

514
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,395
No, you have to fist bump.

515
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,898
- Geez.
- You're kicking up dust here.

516
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,733
- Why use your palm?
- Anyway,

517
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:06,362
are you two going to
keep speaking formally to each other?

518
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,199
No, I can drop the honorifics.
But he doesn't, so I don't either.

519
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,619
You don't use it for the right people.

520
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,870
Who don't I use it for?

521
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,998
I wonder who. Who could it be?

522
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,627
With me, you punk.

523
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,712
- You were born early in the year.
- But I'm still older.

524
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,547
I'm an early '90. You're an early '91.

525
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,550
Right. And Munjeong is a '90,
so we're considered the same age.

526
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,845
Munjeong is a '90. You're an early '90,
so you two are the same age.

527
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,847
Then, us three are the same age. Right?

528
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,308
You are some kind of lunatic.

529
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,685
Look, Munjeong calls me <i>oppa</i>
to show I'm older.

530
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,813
For someone all about logic,
why are you suddenly acting dumb?

531
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,358
What about Sanggi then?
He's an '89, so he's my age.

532
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,817
Does that make you two equal?

533
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,027
You little punk.

534
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,448
Come on, that doesn't make sense.
I'm not that rude.

535
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,492
Enough with that.

536
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,245
You and Huiji should drop the formalities
and speak casually.

537
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,122
Would you like to?

538
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,875
Go ahead if you wish. I'll do as I please.

539
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,461
Are you sure? Fine, don't regret it.

540
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,921
Good.

541
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,676
- We're not going full casual, right?
- I'm not that rude either.

542
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,428
Then, do you want her
to call you <i>oppa</i> now?

543
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,056
What? <i>Oppa.</i>

544
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,309
Juhyeong <i>oppa. Oppa.</i>

545
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,436
He likes it.

546
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,524
He liked it. He does.

547
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,992
GRANDPA SANGGI

548
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,744
<i>Did you have a rough day yesterday?</i>

549
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,288
CHANGWON OPPA

550
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,126
<i>I'm free today. Let's grab a drink.</i>

551
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,670
HUIJI

552
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,549
<i>Good food always makes you feel better.</i>

553
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,388
<i>It's too late, you punks.</i>

554
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,349
IT'S TOO LATE, YOU PUNKS

555
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,644
My goodness.

556
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,231
What's got you so down?

557
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,820
Well, I asked you to grab drinks,
and you called me an alcoholic.

558
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,946
Hey.

559
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,699
Next time, spell it out
so I can understand properly.

560
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,076
Later.

561
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,204
Goodness.

562
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,811
Attorney Kang,
did Professor Ku go to the trial today?

563
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,774
I told him not to, but his phone's off
and he's not at the hospital.

564
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,068
I think he went anyway.

565
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,569
Hello, Mr. Kim.

566
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,072
Hello, Attorney Kang.

567
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:59,576
I haven't left the office yet,
so I'm not sure.

568
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,371
I'll check after the trial
and get back to you.

569
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:04,624
All right.

570
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,586
Then, I'll see you at the trial.

571
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,547
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

572
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,557
The plaintiff Kim Sanggu

573
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:26,187
is the father
of the late Kim Geunhwan, correct?

574
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,277
Yes, Your Honor.

575
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,488
Let's start with your complaint.

576
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,116
I see you've submitted
an additional brief today?

577
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,494
Yes, I also submitted
some video and photo evidence.

578
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,287
I apologize for the late submission.

579
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,332
Defense counsel,
have you reviewed this?

580
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,375
No, I have not.

581
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,544
What's the plan?

582
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:55,174
Would you prefer to respond
to this brief next time?

583
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,804
We'll acknowledge receipt for now.

584
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,349
All right. Then, please sign that.

585
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:05,810
Plaintiff's counsel,

586
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,104
since it came in today,
we haven't reviewed it yet.

587
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,440
Could you walk us through it briefly?

588
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,194
Yes, Your Honor.
Could you pull up Exhibit 8, please?

589
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,447
The defendant, Ku Dongkyun,
attended a tennis tournament

590
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,908
held at an alumni event.

591
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,244
Could you please pause it there?

592
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,540
As you can see, the defendant
is swinging with his left hand.

593
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,669
Please pull up Exhibit 9, please.

594
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:40,844
Left-handed.

595
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,680
- He's left-handed.
- Yes.

596
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,849
The defendant is left-handed.

597
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,351
But in the surgery footage,

598
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:49,937
the surgeon is right-handed.

599
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,648
The defendant
did not perform this surgery.

600
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,734
He had someone else operate in his place.

601
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,111
ALLEGATION OF GHOST SURGERY

602
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,584
Defense counsel.

603
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:13,710
- Yes, Your Honor?
- I believe

604
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,173
we'll need a detailed response to this.

605
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,761
We'll review this
and submit a written statement.

606
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,724
What is the matter?

607
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,517
We're here to make an arrest.

608
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,645
That's him.

609
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,859
You're suspected
of assaulting Ku Dongkyun.

610
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,237
You'll need to come with us.

611
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,162
Sir, I'll leave the rest of the trial
in your hands.

612
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,472
Strap him in.

613
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,850
- Excuse me, could you help us?
- Yes.

614
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:16,857
Thankfully, it's just a mild concussion.
They say he should wake up soon.

615
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,528
Why did he go there in the first place?

616
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,120
Mr. Kim, the deputy director
is asking for you.

617
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,289
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

618
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,051
PROFESSOR KU DONGKYUN

619
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,777
- He's left-handed.
- Yes, the defendant is left-handed.

620
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,155
<i>But in the surgery footage,</i>

621
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,198
<i>the surgeon is right-handed.</i>

622
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,333
<i>This is why something felt off.</i>

623
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,252
<i>The defendant
did not perform this surgery.</i>

624
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,338
<i>He had someone else operate in his place.</i>

625
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,506
Can't I just apologize

626
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,968
- and end this with a settlement?
- Professor.

627
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,803
You said you would stop saying that.

628
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,681
Either way, someone died, Mr. Kim!

629
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,155
AHN JUHYEONG

630
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,825
- Are you going home?
- Yes. But you're not?

631
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,201
I see. Good luck.

632
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,537
Thanks.

633
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,674
Didn't you say you'd drop
the honorifics with me?

634
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,759
You're not going to?

635
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,846
- No.
- I see.

636
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,310
Need help with something?

637
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,188
Yes.

638
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,077
Well, this is how everyone works,
isn't it?

639
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,830
I didn't complain.

640
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,753
- It turns out it was a ghost surgery.
- A ghost surgery?

641
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,507
The opposing side
submitted a brief the day of,

642
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,219
and I was absolutely blindsided in court.

643
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,351
Show me the surgery footage.

644
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,315
It's this one.

645
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,586
So, if you look here,
the surgeon is right-handed,

646
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,173
but a bunch of evidence shows
the doctor's left-handed.

647
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,133
What did the doctor say?

648
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,846
I haven't talked to him yet.
He's unconscious and was hospitalized.

649
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,808
On the way to court,
the victim's family ambushed him.

650
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,730
Then, once the doctor wakes up,
we'll know for sure.

651
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,399
What's the problem then?

652
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,947
This whole situation is distressing.

653
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,117
So,

654
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,578
you want to believe
your client's innocent, right?

655
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,914
How could I believe that now?

656
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,333
Then, why are you distressed?

657
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,211
Just accept it as is.
Then, it won't bother you.

658
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:52,424
I'm trying to accept it as is.
That process is what's distressing.

659
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,343
You've never felt that way?

660
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,557
Geez.

661
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,102
Do you know what you do
in times like these?

662
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,188
- What?
- Let's eat something first.

663
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,942
Continuing to sit here
won't help you focus on anything anyway.

664
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,404
I'm starving.

665
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,906
- Got anything to eat?
- Not at all.

666
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,825
Let's go out and eat.

667
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:35,986
Sorry.

668
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,678
Thank you.

669
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:13,829
Man, I'm hungry.

670
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,581
Do you...

671
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,417
want to grab a bite?

672
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,799
How do you not have any emergency snacks?

673
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,761
And you do?

674
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,470
Of course, I do.

675
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,889
You need things like energy bars
and chocolate bars

676
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,391
when your energy drops at work.

677
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,061
I didn't expect that from you.

678
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,917
You don't have to accept
that it was a ghost surgery.

679
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,003
You told me to accept it earlier.

680
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,297
You said it bothered you.

681
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:53,177
Okay, what you need to accept is
the doctor is left-handed.

682
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,638
And the surgeon is right-handed.
That's all.

683
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,306
Because you have proof.

684
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,976
But there's no proof
that it was a ghost surgery.

685
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,396
It was a ghost surgery.
They logically proved it.

686
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,439
Sure, logically right
based on common sense.

687
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,942
But that's our common sense.

688
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:12,489
My goodness!

689
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,410
- Who's that?
- Munjeong's husband.

690
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,830
He works as a scrub nurse
at a university hospital.

691
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,665
Hello.

692
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,377
- Are you done?
- Yes.

693
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,754
Let's head up.

694
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,851
How do you explain this?

695
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,356
It's like...

696
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,610
dragging a friend out
in the middle of the night

697
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,863
for no real reason.

698
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,448
What?

699
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,242
All left-handed surgeons operate
with their right hands.

700
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,244
I bet they can't operate left-handed.

701
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,123
Does that make sense though?

702
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,751
To the general public, maybe not.

703
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,962
But for us, it's common knowledge.

704
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,631
Hey, kindly explain it a bit more.

705
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,551
Got it.
Okay, let me break it down.

706
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,639
Your first time assisting?

707
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,517
Yes. I'll do my best.

708
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,854
<i>Surgical training is basically
old-school apprenticeship.</i>

709
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,106
Scalpel.

710
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,026
<i>But since things are passed down that way,</i>

711
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,945
<i>some things never change.</i>

712
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,824
- Are you left-handed?
- Yes, Professor.

713
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,951
Didn't your seniors tell you?

714
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,119
What do you mean, sir?

715
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,079
<i>Your hands bump
while facing each other,</i>

716
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,624
<i>so you have to match
your mentor's dominant hand.</i>

717
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,751
<i>Usually, the right.</i>

718
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,005
Hey. If you can only use
your left hand, get out.

719
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,841
- I'm sorry. I'll do it again.
- Get out.

720
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,177
That's why most surgeons
operate right-handed

721
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,387
even if they're left-handed.

722
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,265
Or they become ambidextrous.

723
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,811
Anyways, suspecting a ghost surgery
just because of this

724
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,063
doesn't hold up.

725
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,734
Did that help?

726
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,402
Yes.

727
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:16,947
You can go now.

728
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,951
- What?
- Go.

729
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,286
What am I, your pet?

730
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,539
Yanking me around
like I'm on a leash.

731
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,791
So I'll go, but you owe me a meal.

732
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,126
- Okay. Go.
- I'll ask for a fancy meal.

733
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,962
Thanks! That meals on me.

734
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,422
It's okay.
He'll just owe me something fancy.

735
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,632
- Thank you.
- See you.

736
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,717
- Bye.
- Later.

737
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,017
You owe me a meal instead.

738
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,854
Should I buy Munjeong a meal?

739
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,360
Just kidding.
I'll treat you to one. Thanks.

740
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,656
Okay, everything's sorted.

741
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,657
Are you that happy?

742
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,577
Of course, I am!

743
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,539
My client's not some terrible person.
That's such a relief.

744
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,250
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

745
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,422
Let's head out.

746
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,716
Sure.

747
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:56,963
Come in.

748
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:03,469
Mr. Na said to assign this case to you.

749
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,888
Okay, you can leave it there.

750
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,140
Okay.

751
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,378
PETITION
COUNTERCLAIM

752
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,465
A divorce.

753
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,189
What are you doing?
You should've knocked first.

754
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:01,026
I was just taking a five-minute break.

755
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,363
I was going to get back to work
after one comic.

756
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,823
Sure, if you say so.

757
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,492
It's not "if you say so."
It's true.

758
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,412
You always pop in whenever I take
a quick five-minute break.

759
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,164
All right. I didn't say anything.

760
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,834
Anyways, you want to switch cases with me?

761
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:18,961
Switch cases?

762
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,255
You said the sale proceeds case
was tough, right?

763
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,007
I'll trade you for a divorce case.

764
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,175
Sure. Did you clear it with Mr. Na?

765
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,553
I was just about to.

766
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,306
But what gives?
You want to swap cases?

767
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,019
Well, you'll find out
once you start on it.

768
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,855
- So it's a deal?
- Yeah.

769
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,570
He really hates taking divorce cases.

770
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,035
- Sir, can I come in?
- Yes, come in.

771
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,919
Sir, it's about the divorce case
you assigned me.

772
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,796
The Cha Jeongho case?

773
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:04,631
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, what about it?

774
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,301
I haven't done divorce cases in a while.

775
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,385
- Right.
- And usually,

776
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,638
clients prefer
female attorneys with divorces.

777
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,271
Since when do you say
you don't want to do something?

778
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,940
It's not that I don't want to do it.

779
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,777
- For various reasons, instead of--
- I get what you're saying.

780
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,197
But the client, Cha Jeongho,

781
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:31,700
specifically requested a male attorney,
so we don't have a choice.

782
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,039
- Then, that just leaves you.
- I see. He asked for a male attorney?

783
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,256
- Do you want me to do it then?
- No.

784
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,716
No, I should do it.

785
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,761
- I appreciate it.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,414
Right. Work is work.

787
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,176
How are you feeling?

788
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,929
I heard you woke up, so I came right away.

789
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:36,850
Thank you. I'm feeling much better now.

790
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,560
That's a relief.

791
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,688
I heard Kim Sanggu

792
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,607
claimed it was a ghost surgery?

793
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,775
Yes.

794
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,946
But I'm aware left-handed surgeons
often operate right-handed,

795
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,449
so I can explain that part clearly.

796
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:56,995
That's impressive.

797
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,372
Most people don't know that.

798
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,668
There was nothing wrong
with the surgery itself.

799
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,088
But things like this
still seemed to happen.

800
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,507
<i>Every time it happens,</i>

801
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,553
<i>I wonder if I'm actually saving lives
through surgery.</i>

802
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,388
<i>If their deaths aren't my fault,</i>

803
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,601
<i>maybe I shouldn't be get credit
for saving their lives either.</i>

804
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,313
That's why you wanted to apologize.

805
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,065
But mustering the courage wasn't easy.

806
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,110
I saw the look on your face back then.

807
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:34,198
But an apology could be used
as evidence of negligence.

808
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,450
That may not necessarily be the case.

809
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,661
If there's no other evidence
of surgical malpractice,

810
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,373
an apology alone isn't enough
to prove liability.

811
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,169
<i>I thought you'd be relieved
by what I said,</i>

812
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,338
but you looked surprised.

813
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,382
I do believe I should apologize,

814
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,676
but I just can't find
the courage to do it.

815
01:06:54,677 --> 01:07:00,265
Perhaps, a part of me felt at ease
when Mr. Kim tried to stop me.

816
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,142
Please think about the hospital too.

817
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,979
Because then,
it's not that I didn't apologize.

818
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,399
I was stopped from doing it.

819
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,113
I actually saw Kim Sanggu
on my way to court that day.

820
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,289
<i>I saw him.</i>

821
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,044
<i>I couldn't even face him,
let alone apologize.</i>

822
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,803
<i>I deserved to get ambushed.</i>

823
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,682
<i>What's going to happen to him now?</i>

824
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,686
I heard he returned home.

825
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,895
But he'll likely be indicted.

826
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:47,981
If I...

827
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:53,278
agree to settle,
will it reduce his punishment?

828
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:56,990
It would.

829
01:07:58,783 --> 01:07:59,784
I see.

830
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,164
I'll go with you.

831
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,252
You'll get the chance
to apologize as well.

832
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:12,547
Thank you.

833
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:28,938
Mr. Cha Jeongho?

834
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,690
Yes.

835
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,525
Hello.

836
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,861
I'm Cha Jeongho.

837
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,616
I'm Ahn Juhyeong.

838
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,414
We've agreed to divorce,

839
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:52,587
but we're stuck on alimony
and splitting assets.

840
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,881
Has a trial date been set?

841
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:59,343
Yes, we couldn't settle,
so a trial date's been set.

842
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,470
I mean,

843
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,056
we figured buying lawyers

844
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,725
would only make things messier,

845
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,729
so we both agreed not to buy them.

846
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,189
But at this point,

847
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,818
I felt like I needed to do
what was best for me.

848
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,778
You said you agreed

849
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,238
- not to buy lawyers?
- Yes.

850
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,240
Lawyers aren't things you buy and sell.

851
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,326
Really?

852
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,037
That's weird.

853
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,957
I'm here today to buy a lawyer though.

854
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,712
Yes, I see.

855
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,923
Are you far apart on your terms?

856
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,925
I can't give her a cent.

857
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,763
Sure, I brought up
getting a divorce first,

858
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,224
but that doesn't mean
I owe her money, right?

859
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,059
Then, you don't need to pay alimony.

860
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,853
I can't give away my assets either.

861
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,023
We've only been married

862
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,109
a little over a year.

863
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,402
It hasn't been that long.

864
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:01,447
None of my assets came from that marriage.

865
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,909
I covered almost
all the wedding expenses myself.

866
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,246
How much is the other party asking for?

867
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,667
She wants 10 million won in alimony
and 10 million won in assets.

868
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,715
Well, it's not actually a lot.

869
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,300
She just wanted a symbolic number

870
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,178
since I first proposed the divorce.

871
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:30,852
You could've just agreed
and settled this divorce then.

872
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,020
You're pretty well-off.

873
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:37,608
Why should I?

874
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:40,986
I'm not backing down.

875
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:46,199
We call it personality differences,
but the divorce is basically her fault.

876
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,453
So you're saying
she has cause for liability?

877
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,914
Well, not technically
cause for liability, but...

878
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,713
In any case, we're just incompatible.

879
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,757
Totally incompatible.

880
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:05,385
I'm losing my mind.
I can't live with her anymore.

881
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:09,056
Also, it's all on her.

882
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:35,583
NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL
PLAINTIFF KIM SANGGU

883
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,112
- What are you doing here?
- What?

884
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,742
While heading out,
I was just checking if everyone had left.

885
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,120
- Are you clocking out?
- Yeah, I am.

886
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,498
You must be the last one here.

887
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,751
Yeah, Juhyeong left early today.

888
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,877
Really?

889
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:21,962
Let's go.

890
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,047
Okay.

891
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,060
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
SEOUL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

892
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:04,462
The 10:50 a.m. case.
Family law case number 2023-3330.

893
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,048
Are the parties here?

894
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,134
Are you here for 10:50 a.m. case?

895
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,886
No, the 11:00 a.m. case.

896
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,429
Can I wait inside?

897
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:16,266
I'm sorry, you can't.
Most family law cases are closed trials.

898
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,434
They go one at a time.

899
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,518
Okay.

900
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,895
Are you the 10:50 a.m. case?

901
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,855
- Yes.
- Me too.

902
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:22,982
Please come in.

903
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,669
Are the parties here
for the 11:10 a.m. case?

904
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,503
Yes.

905
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,131
The 11:10 a.m. case?

906
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:48,966
Please come in.

907
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,116
Who's representing the plaintiff?

908
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,910
I'm Ahn Juhyeong

909
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,955
with Law Group Hyungmin,
attorney for plaintiff Cha Jeongho.

910
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,124
Okay, Attorney Ahn Juhyeong.

911
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,543
Who's representing the defendant?

912
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,178
Are you the party in question?

913
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:38,683
Yes.

914
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,601
I'm...

915
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:44,855
Park Sujeong.

916
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:11,340
Law and The City

917
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,372
Law and The City

918
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,542
<i>Crystal Park is his ex-girlfriend.</i>

919
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:50,336
Right now, I'm not Ahn Juhyeong.
I'm just Cha Jeongho's attorney.

920
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,922
<i>You should drop the case.</i>

921
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,800
<i>It's nothing big. It's just a quick visit.</i>

922
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:58,095
Did you assault her?

923
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,724
<i>I looked you up to see
what kind of person you were.</i>

924
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:05,852
I guess Juhyeong
takes on his friends' cases too.

925
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,980
That's actually
the one type of case he won't do.

926
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,107
Excuse me.

927
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,612
I paid with my money to buy you.

928
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,822
I don't let things slide.

929
