<i>This stop is
Seoul Nat'l Univ. of Education.</i>

00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,900
- Excuse me.
<i>- Court and Prosecutors' Office.</i>

6
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,695
<i>The doors are on your right.</i>

7
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>Passengers headed toward Daehwa,
Gupabal, or Ogeum Stations...</i>

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,202
<i>Here, we have a man.</i>

9
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,799
<i>A black suit and a white shirt.</i>

10
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>Judging from his face,
he slept with his tie on last night.</i>

11
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,848
<i>His commute takes him 30 minutes
by subway on Line 3,</i>

12
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,810
<i>but he appears exhausted,
as if it were a three-year trek.</i>

13
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,187
<i>Dozing from fatigue,</i>

14
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,191
<i>he still wakes up a station

15
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,657
<i>His office is in Seocho-dong,
where there are more law firms</i>

00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,116

17

SEOUL NAT'L UNIV OF EDUCATION

18
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,122
<i>He has the spirit
of a worn-out office worker who'd say,</i>

19
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,750
<i>"We all carry resignation letters
in our hearts."</i>

20
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,169
Damn, it's freezing.

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,382
<i>But he does everything asked of him
and never complains.</i>

22
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,467
<i>A textbook employee.</i>

23
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,805
<i>In Seocho-dong,
where most don't last five years</i>

24
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,518
<i>and go solo or become in-house counsel,
he's about to break the record.</i>

25
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:11,066
<i>His workday stretches on forever,
but he always punches in on time.</i>

26
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,694
<i>He's a salaried associate attorney
in his ninth year.</i>

29
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,204
<i>yearning for the far-off time
to clock out.</i>

30
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,333
<i>He lets out a sigh as short as a yawn.</i>

31
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,005
You're here early.

32
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,842
At this moment,
the man speaks to someone.

33
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,345
Doesn't all that talking this early
wear you out?

34
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,934
I talk because I'm tired.

35
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,811
Hey. I barely dragged myself out

36
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,771
- for a morning meeting.
- Later.

37
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,732
On my way here,
I got a text saying it's delayed. When?

38
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,818
At 8:35 a.m.

39
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,153

43
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,457
Good morning, sir.

ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

45
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,871
Man, I don't want to do this.

46
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,847
Hi.

47
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,230
How about looking with your eyes open?

48
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,648
- When did you get home?
- 2:00 a.m.

49
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,277
Hey! Good morning, everybody.

50
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,487
You waltzed out without a briefcase?

51
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,740
I got here earlier.

52
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,744
I had a meeting this morning,
so I barely dragged myself out.

53
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,789
But I got a text saying it was delayed.

54
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,044
When? At 8:35 a.m.

55
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,798
People have no manners.

56
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,344
There are three of us here,
and Sanggi only presses his floor.

57
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,222
<i>People like you...</i>

58
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>I'll press it for you next time</i>

59
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,892
<i>All talk, as usual</i>

60
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,061
<i>Better than nothing at all</i>

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,146
Geez.

62
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,192
- Is today Munjeong's trial?
- She wouldn't be here yet either way.

63
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,694
That is true.

64
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm off!

65
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,822
Right! What should we have for lunch?

66
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,700
Munjeong said she wanted
bean sprout soup yesterday.

67
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,035
What are we going to eat?

68
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,620
See you later on the fifth floor!

69
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,081
Changwon's so upbeat
this early in the morning.

70
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,165
SELL

71
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,209
So chaotic.

72
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,753
And nice!

73
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,547
- Did you profit?
- I did.

74
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,216
- How much?
- 8,800 won.

75
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,485
The defendant did not murder the victim.

76
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,240
The real perpetrator
was a third person at the scene.

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,076
<i>Your Honor!</i>

78
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,746
<i>The defendant did not murder the victim.</i>

79
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,332
At the time of the incident,

80
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,458
rather than the victim or defendant

81
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,754
the real perpetrator
was a third person at the scene.

82
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,257
There's a witness outside the door...

83
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,552
who can reveal all of this.

84
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,942
Nice.

85
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,576
FIRST-YEAR ATTORNEY

86
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,874
Hello.

87
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,420
SECOND YEAR

88
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,715
I'm just so frustrated.

89
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,176
I didn't hit anyone.

90
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,346
All I did was get hit.

91
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,183
This is so unfair!

92
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
Seriously...

93
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,272
This is so unfair.

94
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,724
THIRD YEAR

95
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,942
I'm not suing for the money.

96
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,486
That young man behaved so badly.

97
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,614
It's just to teach him
some life experience,

98
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,241
so feel free to take it easy.

99
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,745
Still, you should get paid
for what you're owed.

100
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,455
Gosh, no need.

101
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,957
I don't want that money.

102
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,713
Look at this, Your Honor.

103
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,841
How could anyone pay for this?

104
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,470
Hey, how could you lose?

105
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,221
You told me not to worry!

106
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,724
I needed to get that money, you bastard!

107
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,060
We couldn't win with a product like that.

108
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,686
What did you say, you bastard?

109
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,772
- You son of a...
- Sir!

110
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,816
Sir! Please!

111
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,883
EIGHTH-YEAR ATTORNEY

112
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,971
- This is delicious.
- That's right.

113
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,933
Another bottle of soju, please!

114
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,101
This is good.

115
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,645
Ma'am, over here. More meat, please.

116
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,231
Here's your chicken feet.

117
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,316
NINTH YEAR

118
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,539
<i>In court, I must stand by my client.</i>

119
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>But that doesn't mean
I have to be their friend.</i>

120
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,920
It took me nine years to figure that out.

121
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,262
TODAY'S CASES

122
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,238
Let's go!

123
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,789
Your Honor.

124
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,251
There's a witness outside the door
who can reveal all of this.

125
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,086
Your Honor.

126
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,256
I'd like to call a witness on this matter.

127
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,012
We'll proceed with the next case.

128
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,682
Civil case number 2024-3923.

129
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,151
Who's representing the plaintiff?

130
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,197
I'm Ahn Juhyeong with Law Group Kyungmin,
attorney for the plaintiff.

131
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,244
Yes, that part was stated
in the previous preparations.

132
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,039
Your Honor!

133
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,754
Your Honor?

134
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,717
Please sit down
and speak into the microphone.

135
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,010
Yes, Your Honor.

136
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,096
DEFENDANT, PLAINTIFF

137
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,646
I, the counsel--

138
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,107
You're the attorney
for the defendant, correct?

139
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,568
Yes.

140
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,362
I, the...

141
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,532
I, the counsel, would like to call...

142
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,827
a witness on this matter.

143
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,056
Okay, please go back
and submit the witness application.

144
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,059
What?

145
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,478
But...

146
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,773
- The witness is here today in person.
- So?

147
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,402
There's no stenographer, no time.
Nothing's ready.

148
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,946
Your Honor!

149
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,450
Then, may I at least explain
the purpose of the witness request?

150
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,124
I have dozens of hearings
to get through just today.

151
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,668
Even if you explain it now,
I won't remember it.

152
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,087
Submit it in writing.

153
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,967
The next hearing
will be on January 14th at 4:00 p.m.

154
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,094
Is that okay?

155
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,470
The plaintiff's counsel agrees.

156
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,681
And the defense counsel?

157
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,100
What?

158
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,314
Right. I'm sorry. One second, please.

159
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,358
What day was that again?

160
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,361
- The 14th.
- The 14th...

161
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,659
Yes, I believe I'm available as well.

162
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,547
I'm sorry, sir.

163
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,804
Don't learn how to defend cases
from TV shows.

164
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,016
Come early
and study the earlier hearings.

165
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,769
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,230
No one's ever pointed that out before.

167
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,440
I didn't say that to be thanked.

168
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,818
It's because you dragged this trial out.

169
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,491
Besides, that show's about criminal cases.
This is a civil case.

170
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,951
At least watch the right show.

171
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,592
I'll get it all ready
and mail it to you.

172
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,348
Okay.

173
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,849
What?

174
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,186
No, I'm on the subway.

175
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,271
It's unusually quiet today.

176
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,190
- Anyway--
- Try to be on time.

177
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,691
Yes, sir!

178
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,860
Yes, yes.

179
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,616
Right?

180
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,703
- Attorney Ahn, you're late.
- Hey!

181
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,096
These are last week's rulings
on the Tech Kori case

182
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,099
and the Seoul General case.

183
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,268
You won both cases.

184
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,812
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

185
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,235
This one's the ruling
on Park Jeongeun's case.

186
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,862
You lost this one.

187
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,406
Okay, thank you.

188
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:57,832
Mr. Na wanted you to take
a consultation on an assault case.

189
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,292
Now?

190
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,962
Yes, are you busy?

191
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,632
No, orders are orders.

192
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,759
I'll be right there.

193
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,763
ATTORNEY AHN JUHYEONG

194
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,349
MANAGING PARTNER
NA KYUNGMIN

195
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,110
Attorney Ahn treats me the same.

196
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,447
Don't mind him.
He gets the job done though.

197
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:38,414
Do lawyers usually not care
about winning or losing?

198
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,085
Goddamn it!

199
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,170
CASE DENIED

200
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,297
This sucks.

201
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,384
Yes.

202
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,802
Yes, please proceed.

203
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,013
Okay, thank you.

204
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,477
Hello?

205
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,062
Yes, put him through.

206
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,482
Attorney Yu Dongwook speaking.

207
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,121
Good luck, sir.

208
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,001
Please go over these too.

209
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,004
- Ma'am--
- Can you do it by tonight?

210
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,923
Okay, then. Tomorrow night.

211
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,387
For goodness' sake.

212
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,730
Busy, right?
I told them to throw in a bonus.

213
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,025
You'll get it soon. Going somewhere?

214
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,656
LAW OFFICE HOJEON 1 MILLION WON

215
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,033
By tonight?

216
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,201
By lunch.

217
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,287
Okay.

218
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,386
- Attorney Cho, take this consultation.
- Right now?

219
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,054
I have a meeting in 10 minutes.

220
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,849
You can finish in 10 minutes, then.

221
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,144
It's likely just another drifter
from the streets of Seocho.

222
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,563
If they won't hire, walk out.

223
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,734
What?

224
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,446
I understand, sir.

225
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,369
He's always dumping grunt work on me.

226
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,960
Is there any way you could make it work?

227
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,007
Well, it's just that...

228
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:59,180
This is our community leader.

229
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,683
She always comes with me
to my consultations.

230
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:08,481
I'm telling you
she's great at reading people.

231
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,943
Sir.

232
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,445
Yes?

233
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,033
You have such great energy.

234
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,118
Is that so?

235
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,830
You have a face full of fortune.

236
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,040
Let him handle the case.

237
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,876
You'll definitely win.

238
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,211
My goodness!

239
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,589
She said we'll definitely win, sir!

240
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,050
Wait, but...

241
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,262
What makes you say I have good energy?

242
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,434
I've often heard I have nice ears.
Would you like to take a look?

243
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,696
Your hearing's tomorrow?

244
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,699
I was debating it for a while,
so I'm a little late.

245
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,784
I see.

246
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,869
You got a suspended sentence
in the first trial.

247
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,163
The charge was injury, not assault.

248
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,374
Sentence in April...

249
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,418
was suspended.

250
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,546
Why appeal when you admitted
to everything in the first trial?

251
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,257
The truth is, I didn't hit him.

252
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,925
Then, why did you admit to it?

253
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,511
I didn't want it to blow up.

254
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,892
It felt like the court was siding
with the other person anyway.

255
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,228
So I just admitted it
to wrap things up quickly.

256
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,356
I also had to get back to work.

257
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,572
Mr. Park Kyunghyeon, are you a celebrity?
I'm not really familiar.

258
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,074
No, not at all.

259
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,826
No.

260
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,953
I wouldn't say that.

261
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,331
Then, what exactly were you afraid
would blow up?

262
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,377
At the time, I was just scared.

263
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,755
I thought it over again
and realized this wasn't right.

264
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,842
So I came here

265
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,927
to reveal the truth.

266
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,347
Why else would I be here now?

267
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,642
Just to get the truth out.

268
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,187
Right, if you say so.

269
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,522
How do you know the victim?

270
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
Right...

271
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,863
I'm a tax accountant.
He was a regular client.

272
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:27,076
We got into a dispute over fees,
and he claimed I assaulted him.

273
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,745
Did the fees change midway?

274
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,871
No.

275
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,917
That's just his side of the story.

276
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,771
As you can see,
I don't get that many clients.

277
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,066
So each one of them matters to me.

278
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,613
Seriously, for what reason
would I ever hit my client?

279
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,452
Okay, we'll proceed
with a not guilty plea for now.

280
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,582
I'll get a copy of the evidence records
and be in touch after reviewing them.

281
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,629
Is that it?

282
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
Yes.

283
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,556
How many people?

284
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,682
Come this way.

285
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,561
Come sit here. Please clear this table!

286
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,441
What is this, a funeral?

287
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:40,984
Hey.

288
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,986
Munjeong isn't here yet.

289
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,446
If we eat first,
we'll get yelled at again.

290
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,574
Gosh.

291
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,330
- Welcome.
- Hello.

292
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,874
- How many?
- I'm with a group.

293
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,001
Okay.

294
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,378
Let's eat.

295
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,547
- Come on.
- Hurry up, will you?

296
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,673
You make us look bad.

297
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,009
- Ma'am, everyone's here!
- Okay.

298
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,428
Hey, you were late
this morning too, right?

299
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,264
I'm not you. I came back from court.

300
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,057
- Really?
- How are you always late?

301
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,351
Know how early I left?
I had a morning meeting--

302
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,937
Technically, I don't think
it counts as being late.

303
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,024
If clocking out has no set time,
why should clocking in have one?

304
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,358
It's just a suggestion.

305
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,320
And you guys don't clock in. It's just us.

306
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,489
- Hey, they raised the price here.
- What?

307
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,662
This one's over our budget too.
Where am I supposed to go now?

308
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,624
Your firm's so cheap.
Is it still 8,000 won?

309
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,501
If it's over budget,
put it on Dongwook's corporate card.

310
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,379
- Hey, they notice when I use it.
- Use mine, then.

311
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,714
You got a company card now?

312
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:48,676
When I was there, they didn't cover meals.
Things have really improved.

313
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,222
No, I meant I'll pay out of pocket.
My treat.

314
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,223
It's not about money for me.

315
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,476
Yeah, it is.

316
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,477
- You're right.
- You're unbelievable.

317
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,021
They offer more money,
so you jump ship upstairs?

318
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,775
You should change jobs too
or open your own practice.

319
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,575
Can we get more radish kimchi here?

320
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,953
Geez, getting your money's worth
with kimchi?

321
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,581
- Finish this first.
- I'm going to finish it.

322
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,126
Happy now?
More radish kimchi, please. We're out.

323
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,346
I already want to go home.

324
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,601
You're such an old man.

325
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,936
Is that scorched rice tea?

326
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,020
Thank you.

327
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,690
You're the weirdos with iced coffee
in this cold weather.

328
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,025
You'll end up frozen stiff.

329
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,529
What are you drinking?

330
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,363
A strawberry yogurt smoothie.

331
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,490
It really doesn't suit you.
Don't drink that.

332
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,993
Don't force your coffee down.

333
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,285
That's tricking your body.

334
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,830
Should I call you old too?

335
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,790
I just write it here?

336
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,626
- What is he up to?
- What if they don't drop the charges?

337
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,462
You have to trust me,
or we can't reach a deal!

338
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,839
Gosh, it's so simple.

339
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,133
You're doing it again. Just sit still.

340
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,802
Everyone's an attorney here. Sit still.

341
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,012
Hey, Changwon.

342
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,306
I don't get how someone
this scatterbrained aced the CSAT.

343
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,935
That's why I barely passed the bar
after using up all five tries.

344
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,480
Great job!
Our friend Changwon did so well--

345
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,026
Chief.

346
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,819
Yes, how are you?

347
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,362
I hate that capitalist smile.

348
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,366
Gosh, I should have called you first.
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,702
Can a blind person even commit assault?

350
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,290
They're capable of assault too.
Even murder.

351
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,126
Is that being unbiased
or giving up on the defense?

352
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,046
Being visually impaired
doesn't mean you can't see anything.

353
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,340
They can perceive lights,
and most can make out shapes.

354
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,968
That's why we're writing this!

355
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,138
Come on. Let's just go, okay?

356
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,639
But...

357
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,558
By the way,
no one forgot about tonight, right?

358
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,019
- Yeah.
- I have a blind date. Can I be late?

359
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,562
- Again?
- You need to stop.

360
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,106
- What time is it?
- It's at 6:30 p.m.

361
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,150
Then, let's meet at 8 p.m. Okay?

362
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,028
It'll only take an hour or two, right?

363
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,738
Well...

364
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,491
If I like her, I might stay longer.

365
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,665
What? What is it?

366
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,085
Sure, that's possible.

367
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,378
What are you all laughing?

368
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,880
You were about to laugh too.

369
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:31,964
Hey, you want to bet?

370
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,342
Ten thousand won says
he won't like his date again.

371
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,968
- I'll bet for that too.
- Me too.

372
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,804
Come on. That's not a bet, then.

373
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,555
I'll go all in on "He likes her."

374
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,848
Beat the odds to win big.

375
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,184
There she goes again,
like a moth to the flame.

376
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,769
Seriously,

377
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,480
you always dislike your blind dates,
so why keep going?

378
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,731
From what I see,

379
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,567
your success rate is lower
than the lottery.

380
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,655
At least with the lottery, someone wins.

381
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,033
You could meet someone
you're destined to be with.

382
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,205
- Geez.
- Hey.

383
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,126
That's the funniest thing
you've said this year. No, ever.

384
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,753
Crazy bastard.
Destiny? That's so not like you.

385
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,463
You've had that experience before?

386
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,882
Yeah, once.

387
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,052
- Well, it wasn't a blind date.
- Not a blind date? Then what?

388
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,346
- Well...
- A dream!

389
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,850
DEFENDANT: PARK KYUNGHYEON

390
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,602
There's also an audio recording.
I put it on a USB drive.

391
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,480
Okay. Thank you for your help.

397
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,488
<i>Stop talking nonsense!</i>

398
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,616
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

399
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,035
Kim Seungkook!

400
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,913
What are you trying to pull, Seungkook?

401
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,669
- Come on!
- Since I'm a regular,

402
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,048
I gently asked if he could give me
a small discount that day.

403
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,259
<i>But he suddenly lost it
and started throwing things everywhere.</i>

404
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,137
Come on, is it that hard
to knock a little off the fee?

405
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,807
Why do you keep messing with me?

406
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,773
<i>I instinctively tried to call for help,
but my phone didn't work.</i>

407
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>So I ran to the landline in the office</i>

408
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>and picked up the receiver
to call the police,</i>

409
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,698
<i>but he threw it away.</i>

410
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,328
<i>It turns out the call didn't go through</i>

411
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,665
<i>because I hit the record button
by mistake.</i>

412
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,625
Let go of me!

413
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,429
<i>The truth is, I didn't do it.</i>

414
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,349
I thought it over again
and realized this wasn't right.

415
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,520
So I came here to reveal the truth.

416
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,693
Man, now that means
I have to go there.

417
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,905
I guess I'll have to go.

418
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,449
Geez, let's go.

419
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,748

Come in.

424
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,901
Thank you. I got here a little early.

ON-SITE PHOTOGRAPH

426
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,670
The interior looks totally different now.

427
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,715
Yes.

428
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,759
A friend said it'd make me feel better,

429
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,887
so they changed it for me.

430
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,764
But honestly, I wouldn't know.

431
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,390
Right.

432
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,392
I'll sit on the couch.

433
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,478
Okay.

434
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,873
You put it right in front of me.

435
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,503
I have this place mapped out in my head.

436
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,588
I see.

437
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,347
I've seen all the evidence.

438
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,184
Even if you claimed innocence,
you would've been found guilty.

439
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,311
What kind of evidence was there?

440
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,815
The broken items, the on-site photos,

441
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,860
photos of the injuries,
and a recording from the assault.

442
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,488
The photos and recordings were consistent
with the victim's account.

443
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,574
I see.

444
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,243
Just as I thought,
he was recording it.

445
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,705
You spoke casually with each other.

446
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,416
Yes.

447
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,794
He was a regular and...

448
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,421
we were the same age,
so we kept things casual.

449
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,466
That recording could've been
interpreted a certain way.

450
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,719
It seemed like
he was breaking things by himself,

451
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,681
and he was saying strange things,
as if I was doing something to him.

452
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,603
It even sounded like
he was hitting himself.

453
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,063
Are you saying Mr. Kim
staged all of that by himself?

454
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,149
Yes.

455
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,233
He kept saying weird things,

456
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,527
so I told him
to stop saying nonsense.

457
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,489
I admit I did push him.

458
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,328
Then, why didn't you mention that
this morning?

459
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,455
Did you make an effort to listen?

460
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,250
About half a year ago,

461
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,712
he kept saying he was drowning
in money issues.

462
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,841
From what I saw when I filed his taxes,
his situation didn't look good.

463
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,763
Then, Mr. Kim asking for a fee reduction
seems understandable.

464
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,600
Not at all. Well...

465
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,479
He never said anything like that.
Actually, that day...

466
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,275
he wasn't here for tax business.

467
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:55,491
You're saying Mr. Kim came here,
staged an assault, and recorded it?

468
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,576
Yes, that's right.

469
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,831
I have no reason to beat him up.

470
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,675
<i>It's 6:00 p.m.</i>

471
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:17,597
I'm on blood pressure medication.
I'm sorry. Give me one second.

472
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,307
Okay.

473
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,201
May I use the restroom?

474
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,037
Yes, of course.

475
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,088
The restroom is here. Feel free to use it.

476
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,511
Okay, thank you.

477
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,365
Where do we start?

478
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,200
We start, then just keep going.

479
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,244
- So...
- I'm a little...

480
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,204
But we have to drink what Dongwook wants.

481
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,497
You're down 900 million.

482
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,915
- Not bad.
- I got hooked.

483
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,043
It doesn't mean
I should drink it with you.

484
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,669
- If you call...
- It's your last day.

485
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,381
I'm saying you should buy the whiskey.
It's not our money.

486
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,133
Juhyeong might be a bit late.

487
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,217
- Really?
- What?

488
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,553
"I'm going to be a bit late."

489
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,679
What?

490
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,264
- What?
- He must've liked his date.

491
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,641
- Is he in trouble?
- Really?

492
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,725
I'll text him.

493
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,645
- Is he traveling far?
- Is this possible?

494
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,939
I had so much fun today.

495
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,233
Me too.

496
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,110
We didn't get to talk much.

497
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,903
It's such a shame.

498
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,405
Yeah. I'll be in touch again.

499
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,576
- Yes, please make sure you do.
- Okay.

502
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,820
It looks delicious.

503
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,365
This is fancy food.

504
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,282
It'll boost my blog views.

505
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,450
- Good.
- That's enough.

506
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,078
Turn it a little bit more like this. Okay.

507
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,579
- That's enough!
- Okay.

508
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,748
Still blogging? Was it "A Lawyer's Table?"

509
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,291
- Yeah.
- Wait.

510
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,087
You're such an old man. No one blogs now.
People post on social media.

511
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,923
Still, these sponsorships pay pretty well.

512
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,884
At best,
you just get a free meal out of it.

513
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,720
And always in boring Seocho-dong.

514
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,097
It's better than nothing.

515
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,933
- Are you done? Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

516
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,144
What?

517
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,315
- What's going on?
- What?

518
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,651
- How was it?
- You said you might be late.

519
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,737
Yeah, I'm late.

520
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,572
It's 8:03 p.m.

521
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,490
How was the blind date?

522
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,702
- Damn it.
- Yes!

523
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,122
All right, I'll send you each 13,300 won.

524
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,623
Hey!

525
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,334
Why is it short by 100 won?

526
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,212
The transfer fee. I'm the one sending it.

527
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,464
- Geez.
- Hey.

528
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,508
If it was bad, you should've rushed over.
Why are you so late?

529
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,428
- This dinner's not even for you.
- It's okay.

530
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,722
Forget it.
Just raise your glasses for a toast.

531
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:51,059
- No need for a toast. Let's just drink.
- Quitting's worth a toast. Cheers!

532
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,188
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

533
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,024
The shrimp toast is famous here.

534
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,277
Check out the octopus.
Whose idea was it to come here?

535
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,698
- That's why I suggested coming here.
- Good call. The texture is amazing.

536
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,243
How long have you worked here?

537
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,245
Just over a year.

538
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,996
You've hit 10 years?

539
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:15,083
You keep adding a year every time.
It's eight full years. This is my ninth.

540
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,504
Nearly 10 years in one place? That's wild.

541
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,588
It's my ninth year, okay?

542
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,672
Ninth year.

543
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,467
You should open your own firm.
You've been here too long.

544
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,220
If you're still here next year,
I'm telling the news.

545
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,055
"Stuck as an associate for 10 years."

546
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,725
Opening a firm's a hassle.
She was my classmate and she won't do it.

547
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:36,188
Hey, I passed the bar a year after you,
and I'm new to litigation.

548
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,732
I did public office
and in-house counsel work.

549
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,567
Why'd you switch to litigation again?

550
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,445
I'm just not cut out for corporate life.

551
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,447
Anyone can see
you're not cut out for that.

552
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,242
It took you four years to realize?

553
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,370
Is opening your own firm
that much of a hassle for you?

554
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,830
Of course. Isn't it for you?

555
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,957
You're literally starting from scratch.

556
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,917
And you could go broke too.

557
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:01,046
You hate taking orders, right?
Why not just do what you want?

558
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,590
If I start my own firm,
who's going to hand me cases?

559
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,134
I'd have to take whatever.
Beggars can't be choosers.

560
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:11,431
At least you could turn down
what you would really hate doing.

561
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,894
Just doing what I'm told is easier.

562
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,771
I've finally got the hang of things.

563
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,649
Paychecks come in on time too.

564
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,777
So it's kind of like...

565
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,335
- Look out!
- Hurry up!

566
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,421
Hurry!

567
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,340
Run!

568
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,247
All right, time to wrap up life
as an associate

569
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,166
and open your own firm.

570
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,461
Hurry!

571
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,175
Come on, move it! Hurry!

572
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,263
I don't want to.

573
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,228
"I don't want to?" What?

574
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,481
That's not the point. Bombs are going off.

575
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,524
You thought it was war,
but it was a drill.

576
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,110
- And you're wearing a padded coat?
- You never served.

577
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,613
It feels like that story
changes every year.

578
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,783
You touched it up again.
It makes even less sense.

579
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,119
It's just a metaphor.
What will you do after quitting?

580
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,707
I'm taking a break first.
I'll try to figure out what to do next.

581
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,127
Let's say you get a one-month break.
What would you do?

582
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,712
What would I do?

583
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,839
- Firstly, I'll...
- If you rest for a month,

584
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,883
it's hard to work again.
I'll take a week.

585
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,259
Don't be a buzzkill. Geez.

586
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,678
First, I'd go overseas.

587
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,763
Is it paid or unpaid leave?

588
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:20,394
I'm using the time to plan my next step,
so I have no time for travel.

589
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,479
Shut up!

590
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,563
Way to ruin the mood.

591
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,190
Don't go then, you psychos.

592
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,526
It's not ruined for me.
Ask me what I'd do. I'd--

593
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,028
Did they hire someone
to take your spot yet?

594
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,906
No, but I heard
they're interviewing someone tomorrow.

595
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,701
It's been hard finding someone,
so I left a handover file.

596
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,161
I put all your numbers.

597
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,831
You'll have a lot of free time.
Come visit us sometime.

598
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,666
Sure. Let's all have a drink.

599
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,875
Sounds good.

600
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,877
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

601
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,005
Congratulations!

602
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,718
First, I'd head overseas.

603
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,761
To Banff, Canada. Ever heard of it?

604
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,722
If no one wants this, I'm taking it.

605
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,265
- I want it.
- With who?

606
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,599
- The Rocky Mountains.
- Who?

607
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,143
It's untouched though.

608
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,228
- Who am I talking to?
- Go with who?

609
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,396
That's not important.

610
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,274
- Eat all of this.
- The Rocky Mountains...

611
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,750
Gosh, I feel queasy.

612
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,127
- Hey.
- Yeah?

613
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,464
- Geez.
- Do you smell alcohol?

614
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,090
Yeah, obviously.

615
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,551
Hey, did you see this?

616
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,678
What?

617
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,305
Dongwook left the group text?

618
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,891
Yeah. I even texted him
to check if he got home okay.

619
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,017
He didn't read it.

620
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,561
Seriously?
He said we'd hang out soon just yesterday.

621
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,147
I told him to leave the group.

622
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,274
- Why would you?
- It's a lunch group text.

623
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,027
It would've been weird if he stayed.

624
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,571
It'd be annoying to hear things
you're out of the loop on.

625
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,865
Still, that's not the point, man.

626
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,994
If someone's gone, why keep them around?
He'd already checked out anyway.

627
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,914
You're really cold, you know that?

628
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,250
We passed the 5th floor.

629
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,418
I told you to press my floor too.

630
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,837
Just get off and walk.
It's good for your health.

631
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,714
Then, you walk from the 5th floor.

638
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,608
Attorney Kang Huiji?

639
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,693
Yes.

640
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,657
It's only been seven months,
including your training period.

641
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,243
Any reason for changing jobs already?

642
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,286
It was very repetitive work.

643
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,413
I felt like
I wasn't learning anything new.

644
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,749
I've already quit my job.

645
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,253
So you quit before finding a new job?

646
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,674
I didn't want to stay and get paid
for work I wasn't fully invested in.

647
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,884
That's nice.

648
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,470
Just so you know,
it'll be only you and I working here.

649
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,307
- Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

650
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,811
I'd actually prefer being more hands-on.

651
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,943
All right. Let's give it a shot.

652
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,363
Is that it?

653
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,031
Yes.

654
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:30,036
If it's okay,
can I ask you just one thing?

655
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,122
Of course.

656
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,166
Why did you become a lawyer?

657
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,132
- Was that out of line? I'm sorry.
- No, not at all.

658
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,883
Good question.

659
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,971
Why did I become a lawyer?

660
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:53,060
I wanted to take matters into my own hands
and fix the problems around me.

661
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,232
Are you able to do that now?

662
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,109
Yes.

663
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,697
Did you like my answer?

664
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,116
Yes. Even more than I expected.

665
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,243
That's good to hear.

666
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,787
So, when can you start?

667
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,998
I can start now.

668
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,042
Now?

669
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,587
If it's too much pressure,
should I start tomorrow?

670
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,629
I mean, I like it here,

671
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,966
and it seems like you like me too.

672
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:29,137
If it's okay for me to step out later
for one last hearing on an old case,

673
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,765
I can start today.

674
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,852
All right. Great. You can start now.

675
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:36,978
Yes, thank you.

676
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,398
But you're going to a hearing?

677
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,817
You know lawyers don't usually
show up for that, right?

678
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,944
Yes, I know.

679
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:48,198
But it's my first hearing.
And I made a promise.

680
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,784
All right, sounds good.

681
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,912
I'd like to ask the same question.

682
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,625
What made you want to
become a lawyer?

683
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,049
- You can use this room.
- Okay, thank you.

00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,050
Perfect timing. There he is.

700
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,886
Hello, I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

701
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,262
Hello.

702
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,473
This is our new associate attorney.

703
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,601
- I see. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

704
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,396
I'm sure you know,

705
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,108
but the partners operate
separately from us.

706
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,860
We don't really collaborate,

707
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,489
- so a quick hello is enough.
- Okay.

708
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,948
By the way,

00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,826

Who?

712
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,211
I've never even heard of them.

713
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,796
Who are they?

714
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,928
Never mind, I must be mistaken.

- Help me.
<i>- It sounded like he was hitting himself.</i>

734
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,816
What are you trying to pull?

735
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,276
<i>He kept saying weird things,</i>

736
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,654
<i>so I told him
to stop saying nonsense.</i>

737
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,324

KIM SEUNGKOOK

745
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,119
We knew we'd drink a lot last night.

746
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:12,040
So obviously, today's lunch
would be bean sprout soup.

747
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,211
Why did we have this yesterday
for lunch too?

748
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,715
- Right? Are we dumb?
- I knew.

749
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,592
Then, you should've said something.

750
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,552
"Let's eat it tomorrow and not today."

751
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,679
I'm fine eating the same thing twice.

752
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,973
So annoying. You could've said something.

753
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,434
- About what?
- You little...

754
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,020
Never mind.

755
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,864
When is Dongwook being replaced?
He left our numbers.

756
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,617
She reached out to me.
It seems she started today.

757
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,868
- What?
- Right away?

758
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,496
- Yeah.
- I thought the interview was today.

759
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,039
She must've been desperate.

760
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,875
- Desperate for money?
- Find out for yourself later.

761
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,585
She's joining us for dinner.

762
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,170
I'm seeing my girlfriend tonight.

763
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,214
- Which girlfriend?
- The other day,

764
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,758
I passed a gorgeous girl
at Gangnam Station.

765
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,718
He's not serious.
He was messing with you.

766
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,762
I know. But I still have to answer him.

767
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,431
Then, how about
we have dinner on our own

768
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,059
and grab a quick beer later?

769
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,603
A quick beer? Sounds good.

770
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,397
After last night, you want to drink again?

771
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,566
Then, don't drink!

772
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,818
Don't even think about taking one sip.

773
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,614
You'll end up drinking anyway.
All you do is nag.

774
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,866
If we fought,
would you pretend not to know me?

775
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,701
He's changing the subject again.

776
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,579
- Is this that big of a deal?
- No.

777
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,875
Do you pretend not to know your exes too?

778
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,960
I don't think so.

779
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:42,464
Hey, I have boundaries too, okay?
I don't talk to my exes.

780
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,174
Right?

781
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,300
Anyway, like I was saying...

782
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,593
After I broke up--

783
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,928
- You're too loud.
- Loud?

784
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,889
- I just started talking.
- It's still loud.

785
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,598
I'll keep it down.

786
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,393
- After I broke up--
- Stop.

787
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,520
Forget it. I'll stop talking.

788
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,860
Civil case number 2022-4890.

789
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,531
Plaintiff, Lee Imja.
Defendant, Jeong Iseul.

790
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,825
Absent, I presume?

791
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,911
The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

792
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,790
The plaintiff shall bear the costs.

793
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:23,462
Civil case number 2023-34120.

794
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:27,174
Plaintiff, Bimyeong Inc.
Defendant, Lee Garam.

795
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,302
Absent, I presume?

796
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,179
This case shall be dismissed.

797
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,142
The plaintiff shall bear the costs.

798
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:40,771
Civil case number 2024-59302.

799
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,941
Plaintiff, Kim Mikyeong.
Defendant, Kim Naeun.

800
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,527
Absent, I presume?

801
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,198
Who is present?

802
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,200
Defendant, Kim Naeun.

803
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,495
Is the person next to you the plaintiff?

804
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,497
I'm her lawyer.

805
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,125
I see.

806
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,668
Her lawyer?

807
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,920
Yes.

808
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,132
My goodness. I was so nervous.

809
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,637
So, I promised I'd come with you
and that the ruling would go well.

810
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,263
Thank you so much.

811
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,681
Actually, I was worried.

812
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,518
- You were? I told you not to worry.
- Attorney Kang!

813
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,145
Hello, ma'am.

814
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,939
Wait, your hearing
was at Central District?

815
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,985
Yes, are you here for your trial too?

816
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,197
Say hello.
She's the CEO of my new law firm.

817
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,281
Hello.

818
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,492
Yes, hello.

819
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,621
You two go way back?
That's why you went to the hearing?

820
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,956
Actually, we didn't know
each other before.

821
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,085
We got closer through the case.

822
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,672
So she was just your client?

823
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,298
- Yes.
- I see.

824
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,676
I'll head back to the office first.

825
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:53,219
Okay.

826
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,304
See you later.

827
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,948
You're early.
We still have a bit of time.

828
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,908
Yes.

829
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,662
Here's what you asked for.

830
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,961
Yes, that's right.

831
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,592
I've read through the complaint
that Mr. Kim filed.

832
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,303
Normally, the address on the cover page
is redacted.

833
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:39,307
It seems the prosecution made a mistake.
It was fully visible.

834
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,729
I see.

835
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:51,026
In front of you, I've placed the cover
of Mr. Kim's complaint

836
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,113
and your resident certificate.

837
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:02,037
I don't assume
that being visually impaired

838
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,958
means you couldn't have hit Mr. Kim.

839
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:09,337
Assuming the blind can't commit assault
could be a form of bias.

840
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,215
That's not what my attorney
should be saying.

841
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,385
I've thought a lot about how to interpret

842
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,596
the fact that you two
have the same address.

843
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,515
257, GIREUM-RO 8-GIL, SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL

844
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,020
257, GIREUM-RO 8-GIL, SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL

845
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,159
<i>Even assuming you two were just roommates</i>

846
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,078
would've been a form of bias too.

847
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,374
- Isn't it cold?
- Yeah, the traffic was really bad.

848
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,628
- Wait, what's that smell?
- I made something good.

849
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,463
<i>You lived together but now live apart.</i>

850
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:55,299
<i>If you're hiding your relationship
after all this trouble...</i>

851
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,718
Spoon.

852
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,720
<i>...the most natural conclusion is that</i>

853
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,432
you were dating and then broke up.

854
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:09,271
Yes, that's right. We were together.

855
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,816
It's true that we've broken up.

856
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,609
I wasn't trying to hide it on purpose.
I'm sorry.

857
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,111
No, you were trying to hide it.

858
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:19,657
If there was violence after a breakup,
that's motive. Classic domestic abuse.

859
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,700
Did you hit Mr. Kim
because he ended things?

860
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,786
I didn't hit him!

861
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,419
He's doing all this because I ended it.

862
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,049
Let me be more specific.

863
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,719
It's because I asked him to pay back
the money I lent him

864
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,179
while we were still together.

865
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,431
But I'm guessing
you don't have that in writing.

866
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:47,477
No. I wasn't planning to ask for it back.

867
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:52,064
I was staying at his place,
and it felt like I was just covering rent.

868
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,483
But soon, it kept piling up.

869
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,902
Why should I have to pay that back?

870
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,364
If you keep this up,
I'll have no other choice.

871
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,242
Yes, the story sounds real now.

872
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,119
It makes sense with plenty of motive.

873
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,290
No, that's exactly what happened.
I have the bank records.

874
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:09,916
If that's the truth,

875
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,294
you'd have said that from the start.

876
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,597
But that would mean outing ourselves.

877
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,896
I've already come out.
But Seungkook hasn't.

878
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:46,036
You just went along with it
out of consideration for Mr. Kim?

879
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,956
Yes, that's right.

880
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,339
But you appealed, didn't you?

881
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,967
If you hadn't appealed, like you said,

882
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,219
it would've ended
with a suspended sentence.

883
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,097
There would've been no need
to reveal Mr. Kim's orientation.

884
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,643
I'd really like to know
why you changed your mind.

885
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,945
A suspended sentence means
losing your tax accountant license, right?

886
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:22,738
Yes, but that's...

887
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,535
Maybe you felt losing your license
was too steep a price for protecting him.

888
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,245
Or maybe you did hit him

889
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,165
but couldn't live
with your license being revoked.

890
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,626
It must be one of the two.

891
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,969
I tried to do the decent thing.

892
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,472
But it cost more than I could handle.

893
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,225
I can't accept losing
my license over this.

894
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,103
I'm sorry.

895
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,482
When I said my reason for appealing

896
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:03,363
was just to reveal the truth,
that was an exaggeration.

897
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,660
It wasn't an exaggeration.

898
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,577
It was a lie.

899
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,998
Although I'm not sure
where the lie started.

900
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,337
Sir,

901
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,298
you need to head to court now.

902
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,428
We should go.

903
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,358
You admitted everything
in the first trial,

904
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,695
but now you're appealing
on a not guilty plea?

905
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,696
Is that correct, counsel?

906
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:46,823
Yes, it is.

907
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,577
All right.
Please state your grounds for appeal.

908
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,582
According to the charges
and the original ruling,

909
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,793
this is an assault case
that started over a fee dispute

910
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,672
between the defendant,
who's a tax accountant, and his client.

911
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,091
But that's not what happened.

912
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,260
There was no argument over fees,

913
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,847
and the defendant committed
no act of assault or injury.

914
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,641
The original court's ruling
is based on a misreading of the facts.

915
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,518
PLAINTIFF

916
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,105
In the first trial,
you admitted to all of the charges.

917
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,318
Now you're saying
the facts are completely different?

918
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,653
That's right.
The defendant admitted to everything

919
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,572
to avoid making a big deal out of it.

920
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,075
But now, he's appealing
to set the record straight.

921
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:34,704
Understood. Prosecutor, your statement?

922
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,749
Please dismiss the defendant's appeal.

923
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,459
Okay, we will review the evidence.

924
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,296
No objections
to the first trial's evidence?

925
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:59,603
According to the victim's statement,
when asked for a discount on the fees,

926
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,356
the defendant suddenly began
throwing objects.

927
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,943
Why do you keep messing with me?

928
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,862
You're going to hit someone over money?

929
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:09,571
You're going to hit me?

930
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,449
Stop talking nonsense!

931
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,289
This is a laptop
for the visually impaired.

932
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,709
More precisely,
it's a braille display device.

933
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,545
Not only does each device
cost over 6 million won,

934
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:29,341
but without it, the defendant would face
unimaginable difficulties in daily life.

935
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,511
It would severely hinder his ability
to work as a tax accountant.

936
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,431
The defendant had no reason
to throw that object himself.

937
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,976
You can't do this to me!

938
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,271
Hey.

939
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,065
Hey, Kim Seungkook!

940
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,988
DIAGNOSIS: TOTAL BLINDNESS

941
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:54,868
The defendant is completely blind
and unable to perceive even light.

942
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,954
The restroom is here. Feel free to use it.

943
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,540
Given his condition,
it would be impossible

944
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,793
to strike the victim's hand
that precisely.

945
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,128
And unless we're defying gravity,

946
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,547
simply hitting the hand
wouldn't cause the receiver

947
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:12,218
to fly across the room
and hit the mirror.

948
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,765
Hey!

949
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,313
He took away the receiver and threw it!
The prior statement was inaccurate.

950
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,106
Are you the victim?

951
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,608
Mr. Kim Seungkook?

952
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:28,776
Yes, that's right.

953
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,196
You'll have a chance to speak,
so please remain silent.

954
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,574
If you interrupt again,
I'll have you removed.

955
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,660
- Counsel, please continue.
- Yes, Your Honor.

956
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,670
This is the defendant's
previous home address.

957
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,799
And it's the same as the victim's.

958
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,471
The relationship...

959
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,474
was beyond that
of a typical accountant and client.

960
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,892
- No--
- Please remain seated.

961
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,102
- No! Hold on!
- Please remain seated.

962
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,855
- Please sit. Calm down.
- Hold on.

963
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,525
Mr. Kim, this is your final warning.

964
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,197
The two were...

965
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:21,579
close enough to live together
as roommates.

966
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,886
The defendant lived with the victim
and lent him money countless times.

967
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,057
In total, the amount exceeded
80 million won, a significant sum.

968
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,767
This case is about money.

969
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,645
It wasn't about a service fee.
It was about unpaid loans.

970
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,981
Why should I have to pay that back?

971
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,482
If you keep this up...

972
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,860
<i>When asked for the money,
the victim was unable to repay.</i>

973
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,446
<i>He decided to fake an assault
and began recording</i>

974
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,864
<i>as if he were being attacked.</i>

975
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,741
You're going to hit someone over money?

976
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,244
You're going to hit me?

977
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,788
Stay still!

978
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,801
Why are you doing this?

979
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,221
Stop it!

980
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,889
Please don't...

981
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,683
However, the original trial

982
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,144
found the defendant guilty
of injuring the victim.

983
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,771
This ruling misinterpreted the facts.

984
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,732
We ask the court to overturn the verdict

985
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,027
and find the defendant not guilty.

986
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,532
Mr. Kim,

987
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,328
you may speak now.
Do you have anything to say?

988
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,210
No, I don't.

989
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,821
Okay, I'll head out now.

990
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,160
Thank you for believing me.

991
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,376
I never did.

992
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:36,963
All I did was build the strongest case
I could from the evidence.

993
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,675
Still, what you uncovered...

994
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,928
- It is the truth.
- Who knows?

995
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,849
Maybe I uncovered the real truth,
or maybe it's just a convincing lie.

996
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,143
Only you would know that.

997
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,732
And...

998
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:58,152
Thank you for being considerate
to Seungkook.

999
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,531
I was able to make my argument
without saying anyway.

1000
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,492
This is as far as my job goes.

1001
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:06,703
The verdict is for you.

1002
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,956
That's why we don't attend hearings.

1003
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:12,250
I'll get going now.

1004
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,120
HOLDING, REASONING

1005
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,128
Gosh.

1006
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:03,426
FACT CHECK BY NEXT WEEK

1007
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:11,309
SPECIAL HANDOVER NOTES

1008
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,993
Such a small world.

1009
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,083
ASK AHN JUHYEONG FOR DIFFICULT CASES

1010
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,087
It seems you've become a good lawyer.

1011
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,937
Let's go! Move it!

1012
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,148
You scared me. You should knock.

1013
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,193
Let's go! Move it!

1014
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,570
Hold on. I need to dry my hair.

1015
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,449
Hurry up! Your hair will dry on its own.
Hurry up, come on!

1016
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,244
It's winter. I'll catch a cold.

1017
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,247
Do they have no concept of time
or no concept of etiquette?

1018
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,166
- We're here!
- Hey.

1019
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,709
What?

1020
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:20,877
What's going on?

1021
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,045
Where's the new guest?

1022
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:24,673
She had things to sort out.
She'll meet us there.

1023
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,800
Is that so?

1024
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,427
What's with your face? Are you hungry?

1025
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,556
- No.
- Hurry. Juhyeong's hungry.

1026
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:34,725
- I'm not.
- I'm going as fast as I can go.

1027
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,645
- Are you hungry?
- I said I wasn't!

1028
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,573
Pretty.

1029
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,286
We'll have three glasses of beer,
one grilled chicken,

1030
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,413
- and sausage fries, please.
- Okay.

1031
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:59,207
You were hungry, right?
We'll have a pepperoni pizza too.

1032
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,877
- Okay.
- Fine, I'm hungry.

1033
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,670
That was quick.

1034
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,591
- Another glass, please!
- We'll get one more.

1035
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

1036
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:12,053
- You haven't even started yet?
- We just got here.

1037
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,180
Why did you have to order three dishes?

1038
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:15,640
You'll eat them all anyways.

1039
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,183
You didn't order what I wanted.

1040
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,227
We could've ordered just two
with the beer.

1041
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,395
You're arguing already?

1042
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,064
- She's wasting money...
- Thank you.

1043
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,903
- I seriously don't understand Munjeong.
- Thank you.

1044
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:28,778
Big cheers.

1045
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,530
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1046
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,699
Cheers!

1047
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,043
What's wrong with him?

1048
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:44,128
He's hungry.

1049
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,755
I see.

1050
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:05,710
Bottoms up!

1051
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:20,933
- I think it's her.
- You're right.

1052
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:22,685
Over here!

1053
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,155
Wait.

1054
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:20,034
Law and The City

1055
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:54,442
Law and The City

1056
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,153
<i>We were briefly together before.</i>

1057
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,532
- Hong Kong?
- My gosh!

1058
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,326
- Do you know me?
- He doesn't remember me?

1059
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:06,913
It's the same as mine.
Tracking someone down over unpaid loans.

1060
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:09,082
Well, we saw
and we were uncomfortable. Happy?

1061
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,669
It's totally different. I file lawsuits
and don't chase people to their homes.

1062
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,337
You call yourself a lawyer?

1063
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,714
<i>Law Group Hyungmin.</i>

1064
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,676
- Would you like to merge?
- You think I'm the bad guy.

1065
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,719
<i>You wonder why I took this case.</i>

1066
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,889
- You should at least feel uneasy about it.
- Hey, stop it.

1067
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,768
- What does she know?
<i>- So he's not insane? He's just a jerk?</i>

1068
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,278
