1
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,520
What are you going to do?

2
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,560
What do you think

3
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
Would Qin Yang kill someone?

4
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm not a psychologist, officer.

5
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
I told you,

6
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
I don't know him at all.

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,080
Besides,

8
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,120
judging whether someone would kill,

9
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,480
is there any standard for that?

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
There isn't, there isn't.

11
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
It's just a feeling.

12
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,120
Whoever did it knows in their heart.

13
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

14
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,480
Just kidding.

15
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,520
See you later.

16
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm leaving.

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
I need to meet you about something.

18
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,480
Tonight.

19
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,680
Aren't you afraid she'll report you for saying that?

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,400
Let her report me.

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
Wu Xinxin wasn't telling the truth.

22
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
I was testing her.

23
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
About what happened yesterday,

24
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,680
it can't be as simple as Qin Yang harassing her.

25
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Send me the address.

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
The driver woke up.

27
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,200
I can register you right now.

28
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
Zhou Guifang's case

29
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,400
I provided her with legal assistance.

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
The matter you mentioned to me on the phone,

31
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
I will ask about it.

32
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,520
Sorry to trouble you, Lawyer Luo.

33
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,840
After verifying Aunt Hu Yi's identity,

34
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,720
please help me get her contact information.

35
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
No problem.

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
Then I'll wait for your call.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Lawyer Luo,

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,920
I want to ask,

39
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,760
about Aunt Zhou's case,

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,840
how is it progressing?

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,120
How long will she be sentenced?

42
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
As for these questions,

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,760
I can't answer them for now.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,920
Sorry.

45
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm just too anxious.

46
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,480
Thank you anyway, Lawyer Luo.

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
You're welcome.

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
Alright, alright, alright.

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,640
I'll go find the driver.

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,400
Go register.

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,360
Go, go, go.

52
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm fine.

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
What, are you still afraid of me?

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,360
That I'll collude with the driver?

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
Don't worry, colleagues are watching.

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,880
I can't collude.

57
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Alright, I'll go.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,480
Hurry up and take care.

59
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll come find you in a bit.

60
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,760
That day...

61
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
That day, it was at our company's

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,320
Tongle Distribution Center.

63
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
After picking up the goods,

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,880
at five in the morning,

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,000
or maybe five thirty,

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,320
I was about to head into the city.

67
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,880
I drank a bit too much cola.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
I went to the restroom at the toll station.

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,400
What are you going to do?

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,560
Does he have any distinguishing features?

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,240
That person is quite tall.

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,120
Why don't you stand up so I can take a look?

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,080
His head is higher than yours.

74
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
His shoulders are broader than yours.

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
He's much more muscular than you.

76
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Anything else?

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Oh, right.

78
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
He has a scar on the outer corner of his right eye.

79
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,000
And, what do you call it...

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
That shape...

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,400
It's a...

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a scar shaped like an acute triangle.

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
The scar is really long.

84
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
Just looking at it is scary.

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,600
It really feels...

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
Alright, thank you.

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,800
That's all, right?

88
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,640
Let's eat.

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,960
Officer,

90
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,400
can you find my lost car?

91
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,200
I don't know.

92
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,160
That car is expensive, I can't afford to pay for it.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,760
The satellite tracker in your car was removed.

94
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
But

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
we can help you look for it.

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,480
Officer,

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
there's a

98
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
spare satellite tracker in my car.

99
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,240
What about your phone?

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
It can be activated remotely.

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,480
But I lost my phone.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
That

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,080
spare satellite tracker, what brand is it?

104
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,800
Network admin,

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,600
the driver put a spare satellite tracker

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
in the truck.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,560
It can be activated remotely.

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,960
I'll send you the model number, you know what to do, right?

109
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,680
Alright, I'm hanging up.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,800
It smells so good.

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
I could smell it from the hallway.

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,760
Ajun is here.

113
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Delicious.

114
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,080
Use your chopsticks, or your mentor will scold you again.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Hurry up.

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,600
Don’t I look good in my police uniform?

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,240
You look great.

118
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,360
Mentor.

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,040
Still picking food.

120
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,680
You’re not a kid anymore.

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Go wash your hands.

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,080
What are you showing off for?

123
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,480
A whole family of police officers.

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Haven’t had enough of wearing your uniform?

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
Tang Jun, have a seat.

126
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,160
Come, have a few more drinks with your mentor.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Here, mentor.

128
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,040
Did you report in today?

129
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,840
I’m off duty today.

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,440
Alright.

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,600
Let me, let me, mentor.

132
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
Hello, Lawyer Luo.

133
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
How did it go?

134
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,360
What did Aunt Zhou say?

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,240
Zhou Guifang said Hu Yi doesn’t have an aunt.

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,280
They don’t have any relatives.

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Thank you.

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Xiaopang.

139
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,320
Can you help me run this code?

140
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,800
See if you can activate this satellite positioning.

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,600
Yes.

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,960
Xiaoqiu

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
The lawyer went to the detention center and saw Aunt Zhou.

144
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,480
Aunt Zhou said they have no relatives in Luzhou.

145
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
They don't have any relatives at all.

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,280
What should we do now?

147
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm so worried I could die.

148
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,160
Aunt Zhou entrusted Xiaoyi to me.

149
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,200
Now Xiaoyi can't be found again.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,880
Her emotions are already unstable.

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,080
What if something happens to her?

152
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,160
Don't worry for now.

153
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,760
I'll report this situation.

154
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
My colleagues should be able to

155
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,480
find Hu Yi soon.

156
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
When there's news,

157
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll let you know.

158
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,840
How soon is "soon"?

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
You need to give me a timeframe.

160
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
What if something happens to her?

161
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,960
Ren Xiaoqiu

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Who did you argue with at work again?

163
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
You have such a bad temper every day.

164
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
Let me tell you,

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,480
I got the naming rights for Ruhai Real Estate back.

166
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,920
I managed to get them back again.

167
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,400
You need to pay more attention this time.

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Don't just say whatever comes to mind all day.

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
Did you hear me?

170
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,440
And another thing,

171
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,000
From now on, give your drafts to me for review.

172
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,000
For this case,

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
everyone needs to be careful.

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,200
Sun Bin is dead now.

175
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
The child in Hu Yi's belly

176
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,960
is naturally the Sun family's concern.

177
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,360
Help me keep an eye on it.

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

179
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,920
Who are you looking for?

180
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,760
Is Mr. Sun here?

181
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,120
Mr. Sun is not at home.

182
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
Mr. Sun, Mr. Sun

183
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm Ren Xiaoqiu, a reporter from Time Online.

184
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,960
I'd like to interview you.

185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Do you have a moment?

186
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
I know you.

187
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,160
You were at the scene.

188
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,440
You reported my son's name.

189
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
You published it, didn't you?

190
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,240
Sorry.

191
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
I have nothing to discuss with you.

192
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,480
Mr. Sun

193
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,720
After Sun Bin died,

194
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,040
did you see Hu Yi?

195
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,000
Drive, drive.

196
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,120
Mr. Sun, Mr. Sun

197
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
Mr. Sun

198
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,120
Mr. Sun

199
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,040
Excuse me, please make way.

200
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
I found something on Qin Yang's sleeve.

201
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,360
There was a water stain.

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
After testing,

203
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,560
it contained traces of cyanide.

204
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,920
Qin Yang was poisoned to death.

205
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
That's not the case.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Qin Yang didn't show any signs of poisoning.

207
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,280
But before he died,

208
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,200
he must have come into contact with cyanide.

209
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,320
You can go back, I'll drive myself.

210
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,080
Go get busy.

211
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
What are you doing here?

212
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,680
Someone wants to kill me.

213
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
They told me to kill you.

214
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,840
There's poison in the water.

215
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
Someone wants me to kill you.

216
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,280
He's watching nearby.

217
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,960
Don't look, look at me.

218
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,360
I don't want to either.

219
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,960
I can't do it.

220
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,960
Yell at me, yell at me, yell at me.

221
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
Yell at me.

222
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,320
Yell at me.

223
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,600
What are you doing?

224
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,560
How dare you lay a hand on me?

225
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,840
Get out.

226
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,240
Get out, now.

227
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Are you crazy?

228
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,080
Who did you mess with?

229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Who could I possibly mess with?

230
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,280
I just run my business honestly.

231
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,600
Tell me, who could I have messed with?

232
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,000
This must be about what happened back then.

233
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,280
You can't just ignore me.

234
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,840
All those things have been settled.

235
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,200
How is that possible?

236
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,840
After all these years,

237
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,760
I've always lived in fear.

238
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,720
Even now, I still have nightmares.

239
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,760
I dream that he comes for me.

240
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,560
Shut up.

241
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,040
Don't mention the past again.

242
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,680
How about this:

243
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,920
I have a place by the sea.

244
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,360
There's an old house.

245
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,680
If you're scared,

246
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,280
go stay there for a few days.

247
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,720
The backup satellite tracker has been activated.

248
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,240
It's showing up by the roadside in the eastern suburbs.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,720
Okay.

250
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,360
Got it.

251
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
Should we report this to Captain Ran?

252
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,440
Don't tell her.

253
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,200
She's sick in the hospital.

254
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll go over there.

255
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm hanging up.

256
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,440
Any updates?

257
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,640
No.

258
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,360
Cheng Tou.

259
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,040
Based on public reports and online data analysis,

260
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
we've already pinpointed the criminal hideout.

261
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,960
Guangmingli.

262
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
It's where Gao Ang lives.

263
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Attention, everyone.

264
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,720
Arrest the suspect immediately.

265
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,560
Yes.

266
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,000
This building.

267
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,320
Guard all entrances and exits of the complex.

268
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,120
Make sure they're all secured.

269
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

270
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
Cheng Feng, secure the scene.

271
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,720
You, go downstairs.

272
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,920
What's wrong with you?

273
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,280
Nobody move.

274
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,320
Put the gun down.

275
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't come any closer.

276
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,960
Don't touch the child.

277
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,880
Step back.

278
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
Let my son go.

279
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,920
Let my son go.

280
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,720
Don't move.

281
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
Put the gun down.

282
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,000
Put it on the ground.

283
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,200
Let my son go.

284
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,480
Step back.

285
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Step back.

286
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,320
Move back.

287
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,640
Back up.

288
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,480
Don't hurt the child.

289
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Put the child down.

290
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,760
You're back.

291
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,600
Going out for a walk?

292
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,600
Alright, alright.

293
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,800
Girl.

294
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,920
Hello.

295
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
Just moved in.

296
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,600
That's right.

297
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Okay.

298
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,280
I live upstairs in this building.

299
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,200
Hello.

300
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Do you need any help?

301
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,920
No, no, thank you.

302
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,080
You're too kind.

303
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,320
The data has been completely deleted by him.

304
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,440
By the way,

305
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
this telescope

306
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,160
is pointed directly at Uncle Gao's house.

307
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,880
This spot

308
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,640
is undoubtedly the best place to monitor him.

309
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Black eternal flower.

310
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,720
Uncle Gao might be his target.

311
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,720
This photo

312
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,480
was found in his house.

313
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,960
Let's go to Gao Ang's house.

314
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,600
Here we are.

315
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,840
Uncle Gao.

316
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,000
Xiaofeng is here.

317
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
You all came too.

318
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

319
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
Do you know this person?

320
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,520
Watch your tone.

321
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
What are you doing?

322
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,480
Can't I follow the proper procedure?

323
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,160
It's fine.

324
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,040
Do you know him or not?

325
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,720
He looks a bit familiar, but

326
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
I can't quite remember.

327
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,960
Is he familiar or can't you remember?

328
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,960
I can't quite remember.

329
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,440
Please think carefully.

330
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,800
This person

331
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
is very important to our case.

332
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,760
Uncle Gao

333
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,680
Here's the situation.

334
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,720
Please take a look.

335
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,680
The family in the west unit on the fourth floor across from here.

336
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,080
Do you remember them?

337
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,280
I don't really remember.

338
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,520
This neighborhood,

339
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,120
nowadays, most people are renters.

340
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,600
Nobody really knows each other.

341
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,840
They have a telescope at their place.

342
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,880
It's pointed right at us.

343
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,880
The boy in this photo

344
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,640
is very likely watching you.

345
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,960
I remember now.

346
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
I arrested him before.

347
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,080
His name is Wei Qin.

348
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,600
Over ten years ago,

349
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,160
he broke into a middle school.

350
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,760
He injured that boy.

351
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,560
Move aside.

352
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,280
Put down the stick.

353
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,040
Don't move.

354
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,640
Don't move.

355
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
Put the thing down.

356
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,880
Put it down.

357
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,560
Brother

358
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,920
Brother, brother

359
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,160
Drive, brother

360
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,240
Brother

361
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,000
Stop, stop, stop

362
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
Brother

363
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,800
When will you come back?

364
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,440
What will I do if you're not here?

365
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,120
Silly girl, don't cry

366
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,160
Wei Ping

367
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,720
Take good care of yourself

368
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,760
Don't cry

369
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,760
It's okay, it's okay

370
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,480
Alright

371
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,640
Brother

372
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,720
Drive, let's go

373
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,200
Brother

374
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,480
Brother

375
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
Brother

376
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
Brother

377
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,680
You're the one in charge.

378
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,080
What's wrong?

379
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,320
Those bastards

380
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,600
bullied my sister.

381
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,400
Aren't you going to arrest them?

382
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,920
Everyone has to take responsibility for their mistakes.

383
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,280
No one can get away.

384
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,200
Later,

385
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,800
the boy who was injured

386
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
was classified as having a serious injury, level one.

387
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,920
If I remember correctly,

388
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
Wei Qin was sentenced to ten years.

389
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,640
If, back then, it was only because

390
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,880
you arrested him,

391
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,600
he put you on his watch list.

392
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,680
That doesn't seem very reasonable.

393
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,400
You arrested him

394
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,120
not just because he was watching me, right?

395
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,880
You're making such a big deal out of this,

396
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,400
so it can't be an ordinary case, can it?

397
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
He's likely connected to several revenge killings.

398
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
And you

399
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
might be one of his targets for revenge.

400
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,840
Xiaofeng

401
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,200
You still haven't caught this person, have you?

402
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,560
Given the current situation,

403
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,640
I want to seek police protection according to the law.

404
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,800
Everything you learned as a police officer

405
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
is being put to the test now.

406
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,960
Uncle Gao, don't worry.

407
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,880
We will assign police officers to protect you.

408
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,160
Th-thank you.

409
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,240
I shouldn't be causing you trouble.

410
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,040
But after all,

411
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,720
I'm already half buried in the ground.

412
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,320
There are many things I can't handle anymore.

413
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,360
Thank you.

414
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,960
This is what we should do.

415
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,920
Then we won't disturb you any longer, we'll leave now.

416
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,640
Alright, go ahead.

417
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,040
By the way, Uncle Gao,

418
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,760
has Xiao Qiu

419
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,120
called you these past few days?

420
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,920
Well,

421
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
you know,

422
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,760
this child

423
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,000
never contacts me on her own.

424
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,560
Even when I message her, she rarely replies.

425
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,400
Is Xiao Qiu alright?

426
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,120
She's fine.

427
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
She's just been very busy these past couple of days.

428
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,480
And I haven't received any calls from her.

429
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,120
It's okay, I'll call her again later.

430
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,880
Alright, alright.

431
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,760
I'll be leaving now.

432
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,840
Take care of your health.

433
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,400
Okay.

434
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,480
I need to go to the bathroom.

435
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,720
I need to go to the bathroom.

436
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Stop messing around.

437
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Behave yourself.

438
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
Don't try any tricks with me.

439
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Behave.

440
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,480
Is this the person who stole your truck?

441
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,920
But there's no scar.

442
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,880
An acute triangle, right?

443
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,600
Looking at it this way,

444
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,680
like this,

445
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,600
It's him.

446
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,400
It was him, he was the one who hit me.

447
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,200
It was him.

448
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
Go to the welfare center.

449
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,560
Captain Ran.

450
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
I’d like to take some leave.

451
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,160
I haven’t been able to reach Xiao Qiu by phone.

452
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,280
She rarely does this.

453
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,480
I want to go to her place and check on her.

454
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,720
Alright, go ahead.

455
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,400
I’ll go talk to Xiao Pang.

456
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,560
Let’s go.

457
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,240
Get out of the car.

458
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,480
Let go of me.

459
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
Let go of me.

460
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,200
Where are you taking me?

461
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,360
Let go of me.

462
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,680
Move.

463
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,600
Let go of me.

464
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
Let go of me.

465
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
Let me do it.

466
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,960
Let go of me.

467
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,960
Go in.

468
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,040
Let me out.

469
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,440
Let me out.
