1
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,480
Bro

2
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
The lights on that boat are on.

3
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,400
Looks like they're about to leave.

4
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,120
It's him.

5
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Let's go.

6
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,960
We're heading out.

7
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,640
Hey

8
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,960
Bro

9
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
What are you doing?

10
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,280
Arresting someone

11
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't run

12
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
Come down

13
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,000
Get up

14
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Take him away

15
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
Come down

16
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,960
Come down

17
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Come down

18
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
If you keep chasing, I'll jump!

19
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,480
Don't come over here!

20
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
Don't come over here!

21
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,560
Stay back

22
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
I'll really jump!

23
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Stay back

24
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
If you come any closer, I'll jump

25
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,040
Jump, the waves are big today

26
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,800
Jump down, you'll die faster

27
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm really going to jump

28
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
Don't let go

29
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Officer, I didn't do anything

30
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
Don't arrest me

31
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,960
Take him over there

32
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,800
Move

33
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,160
Don't move, behave yourself

34
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,040
Officer, please listen to me

35
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Who are you calling "uncle"?

36
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,120
Squat down properly

37
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Take it back

38
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,880
Committing a crime in this terrible weather

39
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
You guys are real model workers

40
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,520
Take him away

41
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Take him away

42
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,840
What's going on here?

43
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,480
The boss is here

44
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
What happened?

45
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,400
Why is there garbled text?

46
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,640
We've been hacked, intercept quickly

47
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,240
Chengtou

48
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,200
From the moment of intrusion to cutting off the operation

49
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,040
How much time is needed?

50
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,720
Less than a minute

51
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,440
How much exactly?

52
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
Forty-two seconds

53
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,360
Apply new protection to all emails

54
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,720
Yes

55
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
Defenders of the people

56
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
You received the email, right?

57
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
The email contains an address

58
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,440
Decoding the garbled text can save him

59
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
Get ready

60
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Director Zhao

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,560
Director Chen

62
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,600
Director Wu

63
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,800
When did you receive the video?

64
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
At 9:25

65
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
A hacker infiltrated the branch's network system

66
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
It lasted forty-two seconds

67
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,760
They sent a video and a garbled email

68
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,480
A garbled email

69
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Yes

70
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,680
The email secretly contains the victim's location

71
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,640
But we can't verify its authenticity

72
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,680
We're decoding it

73
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,400
What about the source?

74
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,000
Is the video source clear?

75
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,920
The email and the video

76
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,400
Went through a virtual network pool

77
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
And were routed through overseas proxy servers

78
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Tracking the network address

79
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,000
We still need more time

80
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,400
Director Chen, it says inside

81
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
Judging from the video,

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,920
this is an extremely serious criminal case.

83
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,560
They used garbled emails

84
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
to reveal the crime location.

85
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,480
Whether it's real or fake,

86
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,720
this is an open provocation against the police system.

87
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,080
The provincial authorities are taking this very seriously.

88
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,240
They have decided to immediately set up the "909 Task Force."

89
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,440
Yunping.

90
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,120
Yes.

91
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,120
Has the major crimes team arrived?

92
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,440
They've all been notified and are on their way back.

93
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
This incident happened in your precinct.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
You will personally serve as the team leader.

95
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,480
Yes.

96
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,480
Old Wu.

97
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,120
Here.

98
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,560
Send key personnel from the information center to assist with the investigation.

99
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,240
Do it quickly.

100
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Yes.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is utterly brazen.

102
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
We must do whatever it takes

103
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
to rescue the victims

104
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
and catch the suspects.

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,880
Yes.

106
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,080
This case

107
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,560
involves cyber intrusion.

108
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,040
I now order

109
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
the Municipal Information Security Center

110
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,400
to assign technical experts

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
to join the task force

112
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
and assist in solving the case.

113
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
Hey, Jun.

114
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Out catching thieves again?

115
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,120
Catching thieves.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Lock them up.

117
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,240
Zhang Haonan, you handle the interrogation.

118
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,880
Bro.

119
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,640
What?

120
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,960
I...

121
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Don't tell anyone about my fear of heights.

122
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,680
Why are you a detective if you're afraid of heights?

123
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Sorry, bro.

124
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,480
Next time...

125
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I won't dare go up.

126
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Just handle it down here for me.

127
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,680
Did you hear me?

128
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
Bro, there's a big case here.

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,960
Take a look.

130
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,560
This is a matter for your major crimes unit.

131
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Did you touch my stuff?

132
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm talking to you.

133
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,360
Bro.

134
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
Who are you guys?

135
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,520
Taking someone else's spot.

136
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,040
And throwing other people's things in the trash.

137
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
Who are you cursing at?

138
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
We're from the city bureau's information security center.

139
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
We received orders from above.

140
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,760
We're here to carry out a mission.

141
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,520
What mission does your lousy IT department have?

142
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,800
Time is life right now.

143
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,440
I don't care who you are.

144
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
If you cause trouble again,

145
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
I'll file a complaint against you.

146
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Bro.

147
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,960
Move aside, brother.

148
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,160
There are still fifty minutes left.

149
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,040
After the killer cut off the victim's genitals,

150
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
they used a slow stream of water

151
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,880
to soak the towel covering the wound.

152
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,840
Most likely, they wanted the victim to bleed out gradually.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,920
Eventually, the victim would die from excessive blood loss.

154
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,640
Considering the time of the crime

155
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
and the victim's height and weight,

156
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
we need to find the victim before ten o'clock.

157
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
There are forty-eight minutes left now.

158
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,520
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

159
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,480
Make the most of your time.

160
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Yes.

161
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Long time no see.

162
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,280
Brother, I'm going to interrogate those relic traffickers.

163
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,160
Tang Jun.

164
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
Tang Jun.

165
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,440
My dad,

166
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,400
he gets nervous whenever he takes a photo.

167
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,960
He looks really bad in photos.

168
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,280
What are you doing here?

169
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm here to keep an eye on you.

170
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,880
It happened suddenly.

171
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,720
She was urgently transferred here from the Beipu branch.

172
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,760
She started causing trouble as soon as she got back.

173
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Ran Yue.

174
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,480
The city bureau leaders are here, so watch your temper.

175
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,320
Yun Ping.

176
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,840
Yes.

177
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,040
Go announce the formation of the special task force.

178
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,080
Yes.

179
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,040
Old Wu.

180
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,440
Wait for me outside.

181
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay.

182
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
How is your mother's health?

183
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
She's doing well.

184
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,920
The leaders have taken good care of us over the years.

185
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,640
About your father's situation,

186
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,560
The bureau still owes your family an explanation.

187
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,120
It's been weighing on my mind for many years.

188
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
Reporting to Director Chen,

189
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
All these years, I have never

190
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,520
given up investigating this case.

191
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,960
Unfortunately,

192
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,440
there hasn't been much progress.

193
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
There are no outsiders here.

194
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,520
You can still call me

195
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
Uncle Chen, just like when you were a child.

196
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,640
If a young woman gets any information,

197
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
don't take risks on your own.

198
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
Contact me anytime.

199
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
I'll send colleagues from the bureau to help you.

200
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,600
Uncle Chen, it's true I'm a woman,

201
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,960
but I'm also a police officer.

202
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,840
Alright.

203
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,160
A brave daughter from a family of generals.

204
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,040
Do your best, child.

205
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,440
If your father knew how outstanding you are,

206
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,120
he would be very proud.

207
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,560
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,920
Is everyone here?

209
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,880
Please have a seat.

210
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I have an announcement.

211
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,160
Due to the serious impact of this case,

212
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,440
the city bureau has decided to form the "909 Special Task Force."

213
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,160
That's the Information Security Center of the city bureau.

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,680
Key technician Cheng Feng.

215
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Head of the information team.

216
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,240
Task force members will assist us with the investigation.

217
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,280
Ran Yue.

218
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Captain of the Major Crimes Unit and task force member.

219
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,440
Later on,

220
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,320
members from both sides will get to know each other.

221
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's get to work.

222
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Firsthand information on the case

223
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
has already been distributed to the city's public security system.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,120
Police at all levels are simultaneously screening suspicious individuals.

225
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,280
The pressure is still on the information team right now.

226
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,840
The garbled email is now our only clue.

227
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,680
Cheng Feng

228
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,480
Here.

229
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,440
How long will it take to decode the email?

230
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Not sure.

231
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,640
We haven't figured out the pattern of the garbled text yet.

232
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,080
There's limited time for the rescue.

233
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,680
Hurry up and decode the email.

234
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,240
Yes.

235
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,040
Ran Yue

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,400
You're responsible for coordinating with each branch bureau

237
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
and maintaining close contact with each police station.

238
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,560
Act immediately when the information team provides the time and location.

239
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Yes.

240
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,160
Uncle Ping

241
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,080
Those relic traffickers have been caught.

242
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Day after day, you can't even keep yourself together.

243
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,520
You've been like this since your father passed away.

244
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
You're basically ruined.

245
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,920
Jun

246
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
Jun, the report is ready. Please take a look.

247
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Can I look at it like this?

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
Get out.

249
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,680
Turn on the lights for me.

250
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,680
Jun

251
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,960
Jun, Jun

252
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,160
Play the video for me.

253
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,520
Why are you looking at me? Play the video.

254
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,760
Play it for him.

255
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,560
Keep checking.

256
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Stop.

257
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Go back.

258
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,840
Play.

259
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,840
Stop.

260
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,120
See that? That's it.

261
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Do you see this light spot?

262
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Check this.

263
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,680
This light spot should be a reflection from a neon sign.

264
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,120
There's a large neon sign on the building across from the crime scene.

265
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,080
Keep playing.

266
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,520
Stop.

267
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,520
It's gone. The light spot disappeared.

268
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
There's a heavy rain warning today.

269
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,360
The government is on flood alert.

270
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,560
All high-rise buildings are required to turn off their lights before 9:30.

271
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,800
Find all buildings with neon signs.

272
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,080
Check the time they turned off their lights.

273
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
I need to screen them.

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
Three minutes before and after 9:20.

275
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,920
Buildings that turned off their neon signs.

276
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,120
Yes, working.

277
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,120
Captain Ran.

278
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,040
The ones that meet the criteria are Fuxing International in our district,

279
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,960
and Wuma Building,

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,880
as well as Jianhu No.1 in Beipu District,

281
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,560
and City Tower in Qilin District.

282
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,840
Sanyuan.

283
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,040
Sanyuan.

284
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,120
You and Dakuan,

285
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,640
the two of you,

286
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,480
hurry and find the photos of these four buildings for me.

287
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay.

288
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Jianhu No.1.

289
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,360
And Wuma Building.

290
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,120
City Tower, Fuxing International.

291
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,400
They're all office buildings, no need to check.

292
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,680
The one in the video is an apartment.

293
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Captain Ran, got it, got it.

294
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Captain Ran, it's this one.

295
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,400
The target is Wuma Building.

296
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
We're dealing with extremely violent criminals.

297
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,320
Be sure to stay safe during the operation.

298
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,680
Notify the SWAT team to assist with the arrest.

299
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,480
The situation is urgent, move out immediately.

300
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,400
Wake up.

301
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,760
I've been watching those artifact traffickers for two nights straight.

302
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,280
How can I wake up?

303
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,480
Later, you have to investigate downstairs.

304
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
Nine zero five

305
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,960
One two zero two

306
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,520
There must not be any mistakes.

307
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,600
Believe it or not.

308
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Action.

309
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,720
No.

310
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,720
905, no.

311
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,440
In the restroom.

312
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,480
This is Ren Xiaoqiu, reporting for Time Online.

313
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,160
Bringing you a live report.

314
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,280
Fifteen minutes ago, our station received a tip from the public.

315
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,880
A murder occurred on the twelfth floor of Wuma Building.

316
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,320
We can see now

317
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
that there are already many onlookers at the scene.

318
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,680
The police have also moved the victim's body

319
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,320
out of the building

320
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,720
and onto an ambulance.

321
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,080
Presumably, it will be rushed for autopsy.

322
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,240
According to reports,

323
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,840
the deceased owned four apartments in this building.

324
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,680
Sun Bin.

325
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,040
Sun Bin is the only son of Sun Ruhai, a well-known real estate developer in Luzhou.

326
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,280
The only son of Sun Ruhai.

327
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,360
He truly grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth.

328
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,720
Sun Ruhai made his fortune eight years ago through a demolition company.

329
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
Now he has established himself in Luzhou.

330
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
He has built his own business empire.

331
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,520
Sun Bin was recently summoned by the police for alleged rape.

332
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
Captain Ran, the victim's identity has been confirmed.

333
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
Sun Bin. The reporters are even faster than us.

334
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,000
This is the new forensic report.

335
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
The forensic team has made a new discovery.

336
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,280
Judging by the wounds on the victim,

337
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
the killer likely used their left hand to wield the knife.

338
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,000
Whichever hand, it doesn't matter.

339
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,880
That's your task force's problem.

340
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm leaving now.

341
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,040
My dad said that when you worked with him before,

342
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,640
you always rushed to take on cases.

343
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Your mentor remembered wrong.

344
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,000
The person's already dead, what's the point?

345
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
We're backtracking the IP address.

346
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
If you don't understand, don't talk nonsense.

347
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,240
By the time you're done, it'll be too late.

348
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
You're back. Good work, Xiaoqiu.

349
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Ren Xiaoqiu

350
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,480
Director Yin

351
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,960
Let me ask you,

352
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,480
why did you directly expose

353
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,360
Sun Bin's identity during the live report?

354
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,000
What were you trying to do by bringing up the old case?

355
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
To report the truth objectively.

356
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
The truth is, I was sitting in the studio

357
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,840
and had no idea how to smooth things over for you.

358
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,760
The truth is,

359
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,320
Sun Bin is the only son of the Ru Hai Real Estate owner.

360
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,480
They just called

361
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,040
and demanded to cancel all next year's advertisements.

362
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,560
Really? That just shows they're feeling guilty.

363
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,560
Are you out of your mind?

364
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,240
If our channel has no ads and no sponsors,

365
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,560
how are we supposed to survive?

366
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,560
Can you take responsibility for all this?

367
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ru Hai Real Estate isn't our only advertiser, there are others.

368
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,960
If you think that's not enough, I can find more.

369
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,440
But if we lose the truth in our news just for ads,

370
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,080
then we might as well turn into a drama channel.

371
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,400
Director Yin, is there anything else?

372
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,920
If not, I'll get back to work.

373
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
What are you looking at?

374
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,800
Get back to your own work.

375
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,720
Director Zhao

376
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Come in.

377
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,520
What's up?

378
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Director Zhao, I want to bring Tang Jun onto the task force.

379
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
You want Tang Jun?

380
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,720
He's like a big shot now.

381
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,840
No one can get him easily.

382
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,920
He wasn't like this before.

383
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,080
You think I don't know what he was like before?

384
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,160
He and your father shared a life-and-death bond as mentor and apprentice.

385
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,520
Your father was shot by a colleague's gun.

386
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
That gun is still missing to this day.

387
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,880
He's been holding a grudge and feels uneasy about it.

388
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,280
He's blaming me for it.

389
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
He thinks I've given up.

390
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
I've never stopped searching for that gun.

391
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,680
But I know

392
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,400
that while searching for the gun,

393
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,040
there are still many other things waiting for me to do.

394
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,040
That's right.

395
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,160
I hope your perspective can influence him.

396
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,480
In that case, I'll go to Captain Guo to request the person.

397
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,600
It's time for him to wake up.

398
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,920
Thank you, Uncle Ping.

399
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,760
What is it now?

400
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,920
Come back.

401
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,320
You didn't sell me out again, did you?

402
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
Why do you have to say things like that?

403
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,840
It's all for serving the people.

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,040
Hurry up and get back here.

405
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
I can't just go back.

406
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,480
The theft and robbery squad needs me.

407
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,280
There are so many thieves waiting for me to catch them.

408
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,960
The special task force needs you even more.

409
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,640
Stop talking nonsense and get back to the team.

410
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,680
Can't you just let me go back and take a nap?

411
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,600
Thank you, you've worked hard.

412
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,480
Mr. Sun.

413
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,680
Regarding your son's situation,

414
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,640
we deeply regret it.

415
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,720
It's my fault.

416
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,880
I didn't raise my child well.

417
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,560
He ended up provoking bad people.

418
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,160
He even risked his own life.

419
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,680
Anyway, thank you all for your hard work on this case.

420
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,080
Investigate as much as you can.

421
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,720
If you can't continue the investigation,

422
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
notify Lawyer Chu.

423
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,520
My son can't have died in vain.

424
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,760
Director Zhao,

425
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,640
regarding anything about the Sun Bin case from now on,

426
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,880
you can contact me directly.

427
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,280
Who is this?

428
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Sun something, the president of the Luzhou Chamber of Commerce, works in real estate.

429
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,160
Sun Ruhai.

430
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Officer Tang.

431
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,880
Catching criminals must be tough, right?

432
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,200
Who are you? Do we know each other?

433
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,520
Well, now we do.

434
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm Chu Hong, a lawyer.

435
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,320
I'll take my leave then.

436
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,520
That lawyer is quite pretty.

437
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,120
I'm asking you a question.

438
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
She's pretty.

439
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,600
How did she know my last name is Tang?

440
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,280
Come on, let's go to the meeting together.

441
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,080
I can't go.

442
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,320
I'm heading to the records room.

443
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,160
It seems Sun Bin has a criminal record.

444
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,960
I'll go too.

445
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Why are you going?

446
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,120
Didn't Captain Guo say I should go with you to the task force?

447
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,120
You're everywhere, aren't you?

448
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,560
The task force is dangerous.

449
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Can you handle it?

450
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,600
I can.

451
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Be careful.

452
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,640
No problem.

453
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Here we go again.

454
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Where's Chengtou?

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,480
Yan Zi.

456
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,640
You fix the firewall, I'll intercept.

457
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,400
Police, it was your incompetence that got him killed.

458
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,400
I'm not willing to accept this.

459
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
Then let's play another round.

460
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
Let's see if you can save the second person.
