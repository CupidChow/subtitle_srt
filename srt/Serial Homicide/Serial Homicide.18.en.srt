1
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Tang Jun

2
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
What do you want?

3
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Jin Fei

4
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
He's the one who killed my master, right?

5
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,120
I don't know.

6
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,800
I don't know him.

7
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,040
He's dead.

8
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,640
Right in front of me.

9
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
What?

10
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
Today, right in front of my master,

11
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
Say it.

12
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,280
That night eight years ago,

13
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,240
You,

14
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,320
Jin Fei,

15
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,040
and Sun Ruhai,

16
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,320
what deal did you make?

17
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,040
I've already told you.

18
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
They came to me.

19
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,320
It was just tea and a chat.

20
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
Still pretending to be clueless, huh?

21
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
You took bribes.

22
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
You pretended to lose your gun.

23
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,640
You teamed up with them to get my master killed, didn't you?

24
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,600
You're talking nonsense.

25
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,760
You're talking nonsense.

26
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
Look familiar?

27
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,960
How did you get this?

28
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
How did you get this?

29
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,840
Chengtou

30
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Chengtou

31
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
Chengtou

32
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Chengtou

33
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Chengtou

34
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,880
Speak.

35
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,880
What is the truth?

36
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I can't say.

37
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,840
If I say it,

38
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,320
both Xiao Qiu and I will die.

39
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
It's been eight years.

40
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,920
A full eight years.

41
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
What I deserved and what I didn't,

42
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
I've endured it all.

43
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
What more do you want from me?

44
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Fine.

45
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,040
Aren't you seeking revenge for your master?

46
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,440
Go ahead.

47
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,160
Shoot.

48
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,920
If you still won't talk,

49
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,840
I'll kill you right now.

50
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,080
Cheng Tou.

51
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
Cheng Tou, you're awake.

52
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,120
Where is Tang Jun?

53
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Cheng Feng.

54
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,040
Who gave you permission to act on your own?

55
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,200
How did you find Tang Jun?

56
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
Are you still in contact with him privately?

57
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,080
I'm warning you, Cheng Feng.

58
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
Tang Jun is currently wanted.

59
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
If you keep messing around,

60
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,160
the situation will escalate.

61
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
The situation has already escalated.

62
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,520
Tang Jun.

63
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Committed a crime with a gun.

64
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
Fled with a gun.

65
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,960
A gun.

66
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,120
Where did the gun come from?

67
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,200
It was Gao Ang's.

68
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
The gun that was lost eight years ago.

69
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,120
I just received a notice from the Tongde police.

70
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
A request for assistance in investigation.

71
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Last night,

72
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,160
a murder occurred in a villa area in Tongde.

73
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,680
Tang Jun

74
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,360
has been listed as

75
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,120
a major

76
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,040
criminal suspect.

77
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,560
Director Chen.

78
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,360
The person probably wasn't killed by Tang Jun.

79
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
When I rushed to the crime scene,

80
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,760
there was a third person present.

81
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,280
He

82
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,560
is the real key suspect.

83
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,440
Probably.

84
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Officer Cheng.

85
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,720
Police work requires evidence.

86
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,680
Evidence.

87
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
Okay.

88
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,440
May I ask what evidence you have?

89
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,560
What evidence do you have?

90
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,360
That can prove

91
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
Tang Jun

92
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
is the criminal suspect?

93
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,080
Cheng Feng

94
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,840
Evidence.

95
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,760
The task force found at his home

96
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Erinyes

97
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
the black everlasting flower and invitation from the organization.

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,080
This is evidence.

99
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,360
At the crime scene,

100
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,840
they found

101
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Tang Jun's fingerprints and footprints.

102
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
This is also evidence.

103
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,840
Witnesses confirmed

104
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,040
that the gun used in the crime

105
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,000
was in his hand.

106
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
This is further evidence.

107
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
If he is innocent,

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
Then why did he

109
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,200
about himself

110
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,560
keep silent about going to Tongde on his own

111
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,720
and say nothing at all?

112
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,880
If he’s innocent,

113
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,240
why did he knock you out

114
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
and flee with a gun?

115
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,080
Alright.

116
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
I will verify everything you said.

117
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
But Chief Chen,

118
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,240
if you judge without distinguishing right from wrong now

119
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
and decide Tang Jun is a suspect,

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
what is justice?

121
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
What is fairness?

122
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,120
Is our police force’s image of justice and fairness

123
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,880
in your eyes just

124
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,200
a façade for public relations?

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Cheng Feng.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,520
If you keep acting like this, you’ll be suspended.

127
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,880
Come back when you’ve thought it through.

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,640
Cheng Feng.

129
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,360
Cheng Feng.

130
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,120
Alright, Lao Zhao.

131
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,040
They're just kids.

132
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
Full of youthful energy.

133
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,760
That's perfectly normal.

134
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Seeing them

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,120
reminds me of

136
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,800
when I

137
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
first joined the police.

138
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,880
I was just like them.

139
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
Overflowing with a sense of justice.

140
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,080
Tang Jun.

141
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,560
All these years following Lao Ran,

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,320
I've watched him step by step

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,040
as he made his way forward.

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
I don't want to believe

145
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
he's the one who did this.

146
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,760
That's why

147
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,240
we need to find him even more.

148
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Let him explain everything face to face.

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
It's true that police have a sense of justice.

150
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,040
But we also need to be fair.

151
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,160
If Tang Jun

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,080
really made a mistake,

153
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360
acting on impulse

154
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,760
won't solve anything.

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Nanyang Branch.

156
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,200
Director Zhao

157
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
said

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,920
Gao Ang was

159
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,520
taken away by Tang Jun

160
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,560
Quick, contact the traffic police

161
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,440
and get the surveillance footage

162
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes

163
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,680
Yes

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
The traffic police sent over

165
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
the surveillance footage from all major roads in Luzhou

166
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,680
from the past hour

167
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,760
Because the road conditions are complicated

168
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,400
there are a lot of surveillance videos involved

169
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
We haven't found them yet

170
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,200
Tang Jun is very familiar with Luzhou's Sky Eye system

171
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,840
He must have avoided the surveillance areas

172
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,480
Wait a moment

173
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,520
Cheng Feng

174
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,280
Is this your car?

175
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
Where is this surveillance footage from?

176
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,360
The intersection of Daifeng Road and Qianye Road

177
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,280
Bailu Cemetery

178
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
He's going to my dad's grave

179
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
It seems Tang Jun

180
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
wants to resolve a long-standing issue

181
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
and put an end to it today

182
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,200
We must not let him do anything foolish

183
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,480
Yes

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,960
Special task force

185
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,000
everyone, move out

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,040
to arrest Tang Jun

187
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,720
Yes

188
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,680
Hello, the number you dialed

189
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,840
Why isn't he answering the phone?

190
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Not bad, you.

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,360
You even dared to talk back to Director Chen.

192
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
You embarrassed him in front of everyone.

193
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,920
He was wronged.

194
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,080
I just don't want him to be wronged.

195
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
The truth will come out eventually.

196
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,560
He's a police officer.

197
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,760
He couldn't have done that.

198
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
When I first met you,

199
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,280
you seemed so gentle and quiet.

200
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,720
I didn't expect you to have such a temper.

201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Old man.

202
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,000
Old man.

203
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
What's up with this old man?

204
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,200
He's not answering his phone either.

205
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,320
Old man.

206
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,200
Yifei.

207
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,120
We just got a report.

208
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
There was an explosion at Gao Ang's house.

209
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
You guys hurry over and check it out.

210
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,760
Roger that.

211
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,920
We're heading over right now.

212
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,160
Make way, make way.

213
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Special investigation team.

214
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,840
Xiao Qian

215
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,920
What's going on?

216
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,240
We just checked the surveillance footage.

217
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
We found that a few hours before the incident,

218
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,920
Tang Jun disguised himself as a deliveryman

219
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,600
and created a disturbance

220
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
to distract us.

221
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,640
Then he snuck into Gao Ang's house.

222
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,920
The delivery he was holding

223
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
was most likely a bomb.

224
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,680
Pull up the surveillance footage immediately.

225
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,320
Send it to Cheng Tou.

226
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,760
Yes.

227
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,240
Hurry.

228
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,440
Yifei

229
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,200
A body was found at the scene.

230
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,240
The victim's head was blown beyond recognition.

231
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,280
The limbs were mutilated.

232
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
The body was severely burned.

233
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,920
But based on the clothing left at the scene

234
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
and the physical characteristics,

235
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,240
the victim

236
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,880
should be

237
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,360
a young woman around twenty-five years old.

238
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,240
What?

239
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
Go contact Gao Ang right away.

240
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,080
If my guess is correct,

241
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
the victim should be his daughter,

242
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,160
Ren Xiaoqiu.

243
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,600
But the exact situation

244
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,800
still needs further investigation by the technical team.

245
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Go ahead.

246
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,400
Captain Ran

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
There was an explosion at Gao Ang's home in Guangmingli Community.

248
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,120
A woman killed in the explosion was found at the scene.

249
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Teacher Liao deduced

250
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,880
that it's most likely Gao Ang's daughter,

251
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Ren Xiaoqiu.

252
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,680
Kneel down.

253
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,840
Why didn't you say anything back then?

254
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,520
Why?

255
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
I was afraid of retaliation.

256
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,440
I was scared.

257
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,800
Afraid I'd end up like my senior.

258
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,840
Let me tell you the truth.

259
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,760
Within our organization,

260
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
there are people protecting Sun Ruhai.

261
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,240
Back then,

262
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
they used Xiao Qiu to threaten me.

263
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,400
They forced me to take bribes.

264
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,760
What's going on?

265
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,440
What's happening?

266
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,320
Sister-in-law.

267
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,800
This...

268
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
What is happening here?

269
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
They're going to take away Shi Song's body.

270
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,840
Officer

271
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,760
Why are you taking the body away?

272
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,640
I heard

273
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,360
Mr. Shi took medicine to commit suicide.

274
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
It's really sad.

275
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,240
Who are you?

276
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm Mr. Shi's assistant.

277
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,280
My surname is Sun.

278
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,960
Sun Ruhai.

279
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
The cause of death is suspicious.

280
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,240
We need to take the body back.

281
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
For forensic examination.

282
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,000
Officer

283
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,880
Look,

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
Mr. Shi passed away so suddenly.

285
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,200
Everyone is in chaos.

286
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,200
And the arrangements after his death

287
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,120
We still need to discuss them.

288
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
How to handle everything.

289
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,400
If you take the body away,

290
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,760
this

291
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,280
won't it make things even more chaotic?

292
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,000
Also,

293
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
if this gets out,

294
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,760
the impact on our company

295
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,640
will be huge.

296
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,320
Yes.

297
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,120
Officer Ran,

298
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,960
my husband committed suicide.

299
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,640
We won't pursue this matter.

300
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,720
We won't pursue it.

301
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
It was suicide.

302
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
Or was it murder?

303
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
The exact cause of death

304
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,280
isn't for you to decide.

305
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,640
Wait for our results.

306
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,080
Didn't you say you could handle it?

307
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,400
That there would be no worries?

308
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
How did this happen?

309
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
They took away Shi Song's body.

310
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,920
The one leading them

311
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
has the surname Ran.

312
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,480
Brother Gao,

313
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,280
this is some new tea sent by a friend.

314
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,520
Please have a taste.

315
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,960
I heard

316
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,720
your relationship with Officer Ran

317
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
is very good.

318
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,000
That's right.

319
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,200
Captain Ran is my senior.

320
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,560
That's great.

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
I happen to have a small matter

322
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
and would like to ask for your help.

323
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,800
Go ahead.

324
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,800
You see,

325
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,120
Mrs. Shi has already asked someone

326
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,520
to choose an auspicious date.

327
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,240
She wants

328
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,160
Mr. Shi

329
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,800
to have the funeral.

330
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,600
But Officer Ran

331
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,000
keeps holding on and won't let go.

332
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,560
If we miss the right date,

333
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,880
none of us will be able to explain it.

334
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Besides,

335
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
having Mr. Shi's body

336
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,240
kept at your place all this time

337
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,720
isn't appropriate, is it?

338
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,000
Mr. Sun,

339
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,440
once the truth comes out,

340
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,960
Mr. Shi will definitely be laid to rest.

341
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
It's just a

342
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
suicide case.

343
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,120
There's no need to make it so complicated.

344
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,240
There are suspicious points in this case.

345
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,200
Otherwise,

346
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,200
we wouldn't keep pursuing it.

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,600
Right.

348
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes.

349
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,440
The people's police serve the people.

350
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,440
We fulfill our duties responsibly.

351
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
Come on, come on.

352
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,480
Have some tea.

353
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,160
I heard

354
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,400
your niece Xiao Qiu

355
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,040
is about to take the college entrance exam soon, right?

356
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,520
It seems she's at

357
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,600
Luzhou No. 1 High School

358
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760
Which class is she in?

359
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
What do you mean?

360
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,160
Senior year

361
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,600
Class Six

362
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,560
That's right

363
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,160
Class Six

364
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,520
Brother Gao

365
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
If in the future, your niece

366
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
ever has any trouble

367
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,520
I will definitely

368
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
do my best to help

369
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Sun Ruhai

370
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
Are you threatening me?

371
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
We're friends

372
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,400
Between friends

373
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,960
we should help each other

374
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,960
Don't worry

375
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,640
Your niece

376
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,120
I will take good care of her

377
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,280
But

378
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,160
our boss Shi

379
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,800
when he can be laid to rest

380
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,720
depends on

381
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,200
Brother Gao

382
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,440
how you arrange things

383
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,320
What if I say

384
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,520
I can't help you with this?

385
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,360
Actually,

386
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,360
in this world,

387
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
everything

388
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,320
is business.

389
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,480
When you do business,

390
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,120
there's always

391
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,240
give and take.

392
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
Whether it works out or not,

393
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,560
if it's business,

394
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,760
and the negotiation falls apart,

395
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
then the relationship

396
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,960
falls apart too.

397
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,840
Brother Gao,

398
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,360
let me be honest with you.

399
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,520
Your superiors

400
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,880
are already doing business with me.

401
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,040
If you

402
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,280
keep investigating with Officer Ran,

403
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,840
and continue looking into this,

404
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,960
if things really get tense between us,

405
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,960
our relationship

406
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,080
will fall apart too.

407
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,280
Brother Gao,

408
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm a businessman.

409
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
I believe in repaying kindness.

410
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,840
This is just a small token.

411
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,240
Please accept it.

412
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,960
Who's taking pictures?

413
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
Brother Gao, Brother Gao,

414
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,120
don't be nervous, don't be nervous.

415
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,480
I'm the kind of person

416
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,960
who likes making friends.

417
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,560
Taking a photo

418
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,520
is just for the memory.

419
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Oh, right,

420
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,840
once the photo is developed,

421
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
I'll have someone deliver it to you.

422
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,000
Brother Gao,

423
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,800
this money—

424
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,120
if you don't take it,

425
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
I won't feel at ease.

426
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,840
Boss Ran,

427
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
we've already closed this case.

428
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,240
The official conclusion is suicide.

429
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,520
And that Shi Song

430
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,520
wasn't a good person to begin with.

431
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
Who Shi Song is

432
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,280
has nothing to do with this case.

433
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
But there are suspicious points about his death.

434
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
So I have to get to the bottom of it.

435
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,080
This Shi Song—

436
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,760
things are very complicated over there.

437
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,120
There might even be someone powerful protecting him.

438
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,600
I think we shouldn't get involved in this mess.

439
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,720
How can you say that?

440
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,560
I—

441
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,480
Did you take someone's money?

442
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
What money would I take?

443
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,080
Boss, I—

444
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
What I mean is—

445
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,400
What do you mean?

446
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
We're police officers.

447
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,560
If there are suspicious points in a case, we have to investigate thoroughly.

448
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,880
I'm determined to investigate this case.

449
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm going to get to the bottom of it.

450
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,640
I want to see for myself

451
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,120
just how deep and murky this water really is.

452
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
What did you just say?

453
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,560
Tang Jun, what are you doing?

454
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
Behind him,

455
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
there's someone protecting him.

456
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,040
If there really is someone,

457
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
I'll expose them too.

458
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,800
I'll investigate this case myself.

459
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,360
You don't need to get involved.

460
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,680
Later

461
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,960
When they saw Captain Ran was closing in on them,

462
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
they set a trap.

463
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,200
They stole my gun

464
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,760
and killed Captain Ran.

465
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,040
Okay.

466
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,160
Sweetie,

467
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,240
Daddy's home from work.

468
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,200
That's right.

469
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,440
I bought you lots of tasty snacks.

470
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,800
Is there anything else you want?

471
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,160
No.

472
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,800
Are you okay?

473
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,800
What happened?

474
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,520
You know,

475
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,160
No, no.

476
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,520
How could you not see such a big person?

477
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,120
I was just on the phone.

478
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,760
Sorry, sorry.

479
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,520
What happened?

480
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,640
Is the child okay?

481
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,640
Sorry, sorry.

482
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,000
What happened?

483
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,120
Is the child okay?

484
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Here, take this.

485
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,640
It's fine, it's fine.

486
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,360
Sorry, really sorry.

487
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,720
Let's go, let's go.

488
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,600
I really didn't mean it.

489
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Honestly.

490
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,280
Alright, let's go.

491
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,600
It's okay, it's okay.

492
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,560
Senior brother,

493
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,360
It's nothing.

494
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,360
If something's wrong, just say it.

495
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,920
I'm out of cigarettes.

496
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,800
I'll go buy a pack.

497
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,160
I'll talk to you when I get back.

498
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Wait a second.

499
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,120
Move aside.

500
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,560
Move, move, move!

501
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,760
Senior Brother.

502
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Senior Brother.

503
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,080
Someone, help!

504
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,480
Call an ambulance, quick!

505
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,560
I haven't touched a single cent of that money.

506
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,640
Who is the protector?

507
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,200
I don't know.

508
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,320
Really.

509
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,880
Captain Ran was also investigating back then.

510
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,920
But...

511
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,760
But he didn't find anything.

512
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,560
He just...

513
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,800
You just...

514
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,280
Watched my master with your own eyes...

515
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,600
...die without knowing the truth.

516
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,880
Senior Brother.

517
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
I'm sorry.

518
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm so sorry.

519
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,000
Don't move, put the gun down.

520
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,360
Put the gun down.

521
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,080
Put it down.

522
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,040
Tang Jun.

523
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,720
Put the gun down.

524
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,400
Holding a gun and taking a hostage.

525
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
Are you still a cop?

526
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Because of your recklessness,

527
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,440
someone has already lost their life.

528
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,640
Cheng Feng.

529
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,760
Cheng Feng.

530
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,360
Ren Xiaoqiu is dead.

531
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
You got her killed.

532
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,480
Cheng Feng.

533
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,880
Cheng Feng.

534
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,560
What happened to Xiaoqiu?

535
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
What happened to Xiaoqiu?

536
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:11,800
Yun Ping.

537
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,760
Tell me.

538
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,800
What happened to Xiaoqiu?

539
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,880
What happened?

540
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,520
Xiaoqiu.

541
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,920
She went to your house to look for you today.

542
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
She was caught in an explosion.

543
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
She unfortunately died.

544
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,600
She was looking for me?

545
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,440
Why was she looking for me?

546
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Old Gao.

547
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,520
Today is your birthday.

548
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,040
Happy birthday to you.

549
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Happy birthday to you.

550
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,520
Happy birthday to you.

551
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,240
Happy birthday to you.

552
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,760
Happy birthday, Dad.

553
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,840
Make a wish.

554
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,680
Make a wish.

555
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,480
Make a wish.

556
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,320
Alright.

557
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,760
Thank you.

558
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,360
Dad.

559
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
From now on, I'll celebrate your birthday with you every year.

560
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,840
Okay.

561
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Lao Gao.

562
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,960
Lao Gao.

563
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,160
Lao Gao.

564
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,840
Uncle Gao.

565
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,880
Uncle Gao.

566
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Quick, call an ambulance!

567
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,960
Lao Gao.

568
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,240
Tang Jun.

569
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,160
Tang Jun.

570
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,880
What are you doing?

571
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,560
Don't move.

572
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,720
Are you crazy?

573
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Put down the gun now.

574
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,320
It's not too late to let her go.

575
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,600
Open the car door.

576
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,320
Tang Jun.

577
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,080
Tang Jun.

578
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,160
Step back.

579
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,360
Get in.

580
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Drive.

581
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,920
Get in the car.

582
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,520
Go.

583
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,240
Xiao Qiu.

584
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,920
We're on the same side.

585
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,400
From the criminal investigation team.

586
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,920
We're on the same side.

587
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,480
We're on the same side.

588
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,160
We're on the same side.

589
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,200
Brother Feng.

590
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,640
Brother Feng.

591
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,280
Don't go up yet.

592
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,000
There are no outsiders here anymore.

593
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,960
How long do you plan to keep running?

594
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,080
Do you still trust me?

595
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,160
I trust you.

596
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,120
But what are you doing right now?

597
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,040
You're committing a crime.

598
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
You're a wanted person now.

599
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,040
How can I trust you?

600
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,240
Then do you still believe

601
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,640
that all police are righteous?
