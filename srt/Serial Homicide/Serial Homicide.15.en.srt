1
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,200
Director Su

2
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Should I be calling you Lu Junfei?

3
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,120
Dr. Lu

4
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,040
You are...

5
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,200
Dr. Lu

6
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
Life hasn't been going well for you lately, has it?

7
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Get in the car, let's talk.

8
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
If you help me with this,

9
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,440
we'll all be like brothers.

10
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,760
After it's done,

11
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,880
we'll give you a new identity.

12
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,120
From then on, you won't be Lu Junfei anymore.

13
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
This matter...

14
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,200
Is there any chance something could go wrong?

15
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,280
That depends entirely on you.

16
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,440
You don't want to spend your whole life in this hospital

17
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,920
taking care of those cats and dogs, do you?

18
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,080
I agreed to Sun Bin's offer.

19
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
They gave me a large sum of money.

20
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
And they arranged for me

21
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,960
an identity about the same age as me.

22
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,880
With that money

23
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
and this new identity,

24
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
I started Chaohe Medical Beauty.

25
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,200
How did you meet Meng Shan?

26
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,600
She approached me first.

27
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Is this your first time visiting our shop?

28
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,280
From now on,

29
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,640
you should come by often.

30
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,200
This gentleman is really handsome and straightforward.

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,080
Sir,

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,840
if you come often, you should get a drink card.

33
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,640
It's a good deal.

34
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,480
As for me,

35
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
I'll give you a few extra bottles.

36
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
About the drink card,

37
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
that's easy to arrange.

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,320
Here you go, sir.

39
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
Let me toast you.

40
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,320
Come on, come on.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Miss,

42
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,200
I see your facial skin

43
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,680
looks a bit tired.

44
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,360
Do you stay up late often?

45
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,720
You really know your stuff.

46
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
Come on, come on.

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,400
If you have time,

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,720
come to my place for a facial.

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
Whatever treatment you want,

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
I'll arrange it for you.

51
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,800
Chaohe,

52
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
I can't afford your place.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,080
Don't be so formal.

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,040
As long as you come,

55
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,160
I'll make sure the best doctor in the clinic

56
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
takes good care of you.

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,480
Later,

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
I also often went to that shop.

59
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,880
After a few visits,

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,200
I became closer to Meng Shan.

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
Meng Shan is really bold.

62
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,160
I really didn't expect

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,360
this woman to be so vicious.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,280
Officer,

65
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
you must catch her.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,640
She almost got me killed.

67
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,280
Tell us everything you know

68
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
about Meng Shan.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
Tell us everything.

70
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,960
To be honest,

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
I really don't know her well.

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
We only spent time together when we had time.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,160
It was an unspoken understanding between us.

74
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Neither of us would take the initiative

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
to ask about each other's personal life.

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,360
Oh, right.

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,200
This time when I went to pick her up,

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
I went to a place I'd never been before.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,600
A place I'd never been.

80
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
The exact location?

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,760
Before, whenever I picked her up,

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,040
it was always near her workplace.

83
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,480
But this time it was

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
a much farther place.

85
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Beipu District.

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,520
Wude Lane.

87
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,800
We've found a lead.

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,720
The ATM at Wude Lane in Beipu District.

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
After Meng Shan withdrew a large sum of money,

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,520
she went to the long-distance bus station.

91
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
Okay.

92
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,200
If you need to use the restroom,

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,480
go quickly now.

94
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
There won't be any more stops later.

95
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,280
Cheng Feng from the Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team

96
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,640
We have a suspect on the run

97
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,600
Requesting your police support

98
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Thank you

99
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,720
We're departing now

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,600
We're leaving

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,800
Let's go

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Is everyone here?

103
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,520
We're heading out

104
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,080
We won't be stopping in the back

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,960
Check inside the vehicle

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Let them through

107
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,040
What's going on?

108
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,000
Is everyone here?

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,720
We're leaving, get in the car.

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,040
Is everyone present?

111
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,600
We're about to depart.

112
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,920
Where are we going, Susan?

113
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
We haven't gotten the drink card yet.

114
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,200
Who is your handler?

115
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,520
Is Lu Junfei dead?

116
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,360
Answer the question.

117
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,120
I don't know who my handler is.

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
My handler has always been the one to contact me.

119
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,240
I have no way to contact my handler.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
The police are already watching you.

121
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
Male or female?

122
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920
They used a voice changer.

123
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,960
I couldn't tell.

124
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,760
The person who contacted me recently has changed.

125
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,000
He called himself the manager.

126
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
I am the manager.

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm your new contact.

128
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,560
The manager contacted me and said An Wenju is dead.

129
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,920
He told me to get ready to kill Lu Junfei.

130
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
Last night.

131
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,320
The order to kill Lu Junfei ahead of time

132
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,640
was also given by the manager.

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,360
Sun Ruhai's body

134
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,640
You can pick it up anytime.

135
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,920
The company called a hearse.

136
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,160
It's already downstairs.

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
Then we'll leave first.

138
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,320
Officer Ran.

139
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,200
Officer Tang

140
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,040
Perfect timing.

141
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
I have something to ask you.

142
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,120
This man—

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,960
At your—

144
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,080
Have you seen him at your company?

145
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,160
Well—

146
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
Neither of the two people in the photo are from our company.

147
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,080
The date on this photo is from many years ago.

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,160
I've been back in the country for less than five years.

149
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Our law firm has only been providing legal services for Mr. Sun

150
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,440
for just the past three years.

151
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,520
So,

152
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm not really sure.

153
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,760
Thank you.

154
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Officer Tang.

155
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
Who is he?

156
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
Is he connected to Mr. Sun's murder case?

157
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,840
We can't be sure yet.

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
I'll let you know once we can make it public.

159
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,200
Sorry, Officer Tang.

160
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,880
About Mr. Sun's case—

161
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,680
We've troubled you quite a bit throughout.

162
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
I was wondering—

163
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,400
Would you do me the honor of having a meal together?

164
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,360
Right now, we're

165
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
just cooperating as police and civilians.

166
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,480
As for having a meal,

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,280
let's talk about it another time.

168
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,280
The case will come to an end eventually.

169
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,440
When that time comes,

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,160
we won't have to cooperate as police and civilians anymore.

171
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Right, Officer Tang?

172
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,560
Yes, yes.

173
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,400
Goodbye.

174
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,040
Goodbye.

175
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Stop digging through the grass.

176
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,560
Let's go.

177
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,280
Detention center.

178
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,960
Let's go.

179
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,400
Yifei.

180
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,120
Arrived.

181
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Detention center.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,400
What does she mean?

183
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,480
Police-civilian cooperation.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Pleasure working together.

185
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,520
Is there a problem with my police-civilian cooperation?

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,440
This person is Jin Fei, right?

187
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Who is Jin Fei?

188
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,280
Jin Fei was Sun Ruhai's right-hand man back in the day.

189
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,000
Where is he now?

190
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320
I don't know.

191
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,680
He suddenly disappeared later.

192
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't know the details either.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
I joined after him.

194
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,840
I followed Sun Ruhai.

195
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,160
When did he roughly disappear?

196
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,760
The exact time—

197
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm not sure.

198
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,920
Oh, right.

199
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
From the Public Security Bureau—

200
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,200
When we collected Shi Song's body—

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
He was already gone.

202
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,480
It was me and Sun Ruhai who went.

203
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,080
Where were you?

204
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,680
Are you at the station now?

205
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm going home to take a shower.

206
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,440
I smell bad.

207
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,720
I just finished questioning that guy, Dabao.

208
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,760
I just got out of the detention center.

209
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,280
The person in the photo is named Jin Fei.

210
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,200
He was one of Sun Ruhai's men back then.

211
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,640
Thanks.

212
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,360
A leader under him.

213
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,720
According to Dabao, he wasn't close to Jin Fei.

214
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,080
He started working for Sun Ruhai after Jin Fei.

215
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,720
After something happened to my dad, Jin Fei

216
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
suddenly disappeared without a trace.

217
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
No one knows where he went.

218
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,320
Do you think it's just a coincidence?

219
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,680
Tang Jun.

220
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,880
Tang Jun.

221
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,000
Tang Jun, did you hear me?

222
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,600
Tang Jun.

223
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,480
Tang Jun.

224
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,360
Alright, alright, I got it.

225
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm hanging up now.

226
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,960
What is it?

227
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Your phone's been busy.

228
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,080
A new email just came in.

229
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,960
Take a look.

230
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,240
This

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,680
the leader of the Erinyes organization

232
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,320
and someone else

233
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,600
just like Susan said

234
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,440
there's also someone called the Manager

235
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,200
With Wei Qin's background

236
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,480
it's hard to control such a big operation

237
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
That Manager

238
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,720
is very likely

239
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,440
to be a higher-level figure

240
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,880
Indeed

241
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
This time they used

242
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,480
highly anonymous overseas proxy servers

243
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
to hide themselves even deeper

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Trying to confirm their network address again

245
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,160
is undoubtedly like looking for a needle in a haystack

246
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
This time

247
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,840
what are they talking about now?

248
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
Tiresias

249
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,480
was a prophet in Greek mythology

250
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,560
who, due to cowardice

251
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,640
kept silent despite knowing the truth

252
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,800
and angered the king

253
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,200
You suspect Gao Ang knew about your master's death

254
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,040
If he

255
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,400
also knew about the Shi Song case

256
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,200
back then

257
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,840
he might have had some reason

258
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,400
not to reveal the truth

259
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,400
Tang Jun

260
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Tang Jun

261
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
is

262
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,360
a coward

263
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,640
who kept silent out of fear

264
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,040
It's very likely they're talking about Gao Ang

265
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
Although Gao Ang didn't

266
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
directly kill the senior

267
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,680
he very likely

268
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,880
was an accomplice

269
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,600
Officer Tang

270
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,560
I saw the person from today's photo.

271
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,920
He came to attend Sun Ruhai's funeral.

272
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm following him right now.

273
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,280
Hurry over here.

274
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,160
Today is the day Sun Ruhai is being buried.

275
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,360
That Jin Fei from the photo

276
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,240
went to the cemetery to pay respects.

277
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,000
Sun Ruhai's lawyer is following him.

278
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Lawyer

279
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,920
Which lawyer?

280
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,120
Chu Hong

281
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,880
Yes.

282
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,840
It's that Chu Hong.

283
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,040
Alright.

284
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,120
You're really doing police-civilian cooperation.

285
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,080
Cut the nonsense.

286
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Go check that IP address quickly.

287
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,480
I'm going to meet Jin Fei.

288
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,160
Then be careful.

289
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,760
Go ahead.

290
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,160
Officer Tang

291
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
Where are you now?

292
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,520
It looks like they headed toward the Lutong Expressway.

293
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,720
Share your location with me.

294
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,760
I'll get there as soon as I can.

295
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay.

296
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Officer Tang

297
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,600
I think I've been spotted.

298
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,440
What's the matter, sir?

299
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,120
Why have you been following me all this way?

300
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,280
Sir

301
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
Maybe you've misunderstood.

302
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Your phone.

303
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,080
I'm asking, what's going on with you?

304
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,640
If you want to argue, do it at home.

305
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,200
Why are you running around so late at night?

306
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,840
You can go home if you want.

307
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
But you have to promise to quit drinking.

308
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,360
And also,

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,280
Every night before ten o'clock,

310
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
you must be home.

311
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,520
Got it.

312
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,280
Where are you?

313
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
I'll come pick you up now.

314
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,000
Alright.

315
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,320
I'll send you my location.

316
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Come pick me up here.

317
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,560
Okay.

318
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Sir

319
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,480
Is there anything else?

320
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,160
No, that's all.

321
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,160
Just a misunderstanding.

322
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
Officer Tang

323
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,160
I was really scared just now.

324
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,120
Luckily, you reacted quickly.

325
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,200
You called me.

326
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,040
How are you now?

327
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,840
He seems to have headed towards Tongde.

328
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
The license plate number is

329
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
Tong AR7900.

330
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,040
A silver-gray business van.

331
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,560
Okay.

332
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Thank you, Lawyer Chu.

333
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,040
Now, hurry and go to

334
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,000
a crowded place.

335
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,080
Stay safe.

336
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,960
Alright.

337
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,200
What do you do?

338
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,760
I'm from a mural painting company.

339
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,360
On the wall of the new ward

340
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
we need to paint a mural.

341
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,320
This is

342
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,720
the construction permit.

343
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,360
Bro

344
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,640
We got another email.

345
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,160
The killer might be about to make a move.

346
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,760
Nothing's going on with Wu Xinxin, right?

347
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
Right now, besides us in the whole building,

348
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
there's just a mural worker still working.

349
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,240
Nothing's up.

350
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,040
A mural what?

351
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
A mural.

352
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,080
The hospital just finished renovations,

353
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
so they hired someone to paint murals on the walls.

354
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,760
Alright.

355
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,960
Keep a close eye.

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,640
Got it, bro.

357
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,320
Wait a second.

358
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,280
What's he painting?

359
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
That is...

360
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Flowers, I think.

361
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,600
But they're black, right?

362
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,720
Black flowers.

363
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
You guys need to be careful.

364
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,200
Haonan

365
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,040
Haonan

366
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,040
Haonan

367
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Haonan

368
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,200
Haonan

369
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,240
How are Haonan and Xiao Ma?

370
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,280
What about the emergency room?

371
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,200
They were drugged unconscious.

372
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,200
It's not a big problem.

373
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,440
What about Wu Xinxin?

374
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,720
She was injected with a large amount of anesthetic.

375
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,560
She was saved.

376
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,360
She's alive.

377
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,760
I'm heading out for a bit.

378
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
Call me if anything comes up.

379
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,120
Officer Tang

380
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm working a case in Tongde.

381
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,600
I heard the gravel mine here

382
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,960
had a shooting incident.

383
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,400
They say it involved a police gun lost years ago.

384
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,720
This gun is connected to an old case from back then.

385
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm heading to Tongde now.

386
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
I'll contact you when I arrive.

387
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
Your dominant hand is your left, right?

388
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
The first victim, Sun Bin

389
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Was it you who killed him?

390
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes.

391
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
I killed him.

392
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,480
The utility knife used in the crime

393
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
is in the cabinet in the studio.

394
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
You can go look for it.

395
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,440
Why did you kill him?

396
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,320
I was avenging Zhou Guifang.

397
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
We are committing murder by exchange.

398
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
As the organizer,

399
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,560
I should be the first to act.

400
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Why kill?

401
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
He is a villain.

402
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,040
Our goal

403
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,600
is to help the weak

404
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,920
and punish these villains.

405
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,400
My code name is Manager.

406
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,960
Members of the Manager's organization

407
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,960
must be loyal to me.

408
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
If they are not loyal,

409
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,080
they will end up like Qin Yang.

410
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
Who is your enemy?

411
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,920
Wu Xinxin.

412
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,080
But

413
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,640
Qin Yang is useless.

414
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,160
So he didn't take action.

415
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,880
I had to kill him myself.

416
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,280
It's such a pity.

417
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,920
I've helped many people get revenge,

418
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
but I haven't

419
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,880
eliminated my own villain.

420
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
What grudge do you have against Wu Xinxin?

421
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,240
Athena Hotel.

422
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,280
Wu Xinxin's Athena Hotel

423
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,520
is secretly selling

424
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,560
soft drugs

425
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,360
and

426
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,480
tempting young people to use them.

427
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,160
Zhao Xun.

428
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,560
You're crazy.

429
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,800
This will ruin you.

430
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,360
What are you doing?

431
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Come back with me.

432
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,760
I don't want you to interfere.

433
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,480
I'm already an adult.

434
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,320
Come back with me.

435
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,560
Zhao Xun.

436
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,800
Come back with me.

437
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,320
Tell me,

438
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,280
does Wu Xinxin deserve to die?

439
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,720
To cover this up,

440
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,520
I gave Yin Hui

441
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,240
a painting.

442
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
Hello, Teacher Zhao.

443
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,040
I'm Yin Hui.

444
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,360
from Luzhou TV Station.

445
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,680
At the city’s

446
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,440
artist charity dinner,

447
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,480
we met before.

448
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,960
Is there something you need?

449
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,640
I heard

450
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,200
your son had an accident,

451
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,640
so I came to offer my condolences.

452
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
How did you know?

453
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,080
I also know about your son.

454
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,600
He didn't leave under honorable circumstances.

455
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,480
You don't want outsiders to know about it.

456
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,360
Don't worry.

457
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,720
I'll keep it a secret.

458
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,200
That's good.

459
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,480
Maybe

460
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,880
it's not the right time to talk about this.

461
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,560
But I sincerely want to be friends with you.

462
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,360
I really admire you.

463
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,160
I hope to own

464
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,280
one of your masterpieces.

465
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
I understand.

466
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,720
You want to use my son's death

467
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
to blackmail me.

468
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,280
No, not at all.

469
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,120
That's absolutely not what I mean.

470
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,240
It's just that

471
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,600
as a senior journalist,

472
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,280
I have a nose for news.

473
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,200
I believe the audience

474
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
would definitely be interested in you

475
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,840
and your relationship with your son.

476
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,840
Of course,

477
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:48,960
from

478
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,560
a friend's perspective,

479
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,000
I understand

480
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,280
the pain of losing your son.

481
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,960
I don't want anyone to rub salt in your wound.

482
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
This painting

483
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,000
is valued on the market

484
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,200
at about eight or nine hundred thousand.

485
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,200
It's

486
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
the painting you asked me about earlier.

487
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
So what's your relationship with Shi Song?

488
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,880
Shi Song?

489
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,200
Who's Shi Song?

490
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
You don't know Shi Song?

491
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,320
No, I don't.

492
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,040
You know Sun Ruhai, right?

493
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,920
Yes, I know him.

494
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,760
He’s Sun Bin’s father.

495
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,640
Why did you kill Sun Ruhai?

496
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,240
Did he have a grudge against anyone in your organization?

497
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,320
Who did he have a grudge against?

498
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,520
With whom?

499
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,560
He didn’t have a grudge against anyone.

500
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,040
But Sun Bin

501
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,840
was killed by me.

502
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,080
He kept sending people

503
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,320
to investigate secretly.

504
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,320
I was afraid

505
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,680
he would ruin my plans.

506
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,680
So

507
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,600
I ordered my assassin

508
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,440
to kill him and silence him.

509
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,240
Assassin?

510
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,920
Yes.

511
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,400
It was Wei Qin.

512
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,080
Didn’t you also capture him?

513
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,560
Wei Qin

514
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,760
trusted me completely.

515
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,920
Justice

516
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,640
is our belief.

517
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,240
We firmly believe

518
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
that evil

519
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,880
will surely be punished.

520
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,320
You use justice as an excuse to kill recklessly.

521
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,760
You are the real evil ones.

522
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,280
We are evil.

523
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,280
Then who is justice?

524
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
Is it the police?

525
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,880
You have already received

526
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,440
the seventh email, haven't you?

527
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,400
Don't think that just because I've been caught

528
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,880
the game is over.

529
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,640
Our plan

530
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,360
will never stop.

531
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Officers,

532
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,040
in your team

533
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,240
is there someone

534
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,760
missing today?

535
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,080
Where is Officer Tang Jun?

536
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,520
Where is he?

537
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,080
Didn't he show you

538
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,720
the eternal flower and the invitation he received?

539
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
Did he show them to you?

540
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

541
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,720
Hard to believe, isn't it?

542
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,720
This is the power of hatred.

543
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
Erinyes' plan

544
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,920
the final step

545
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,000
is

546
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,320
Tang Jun killing Gao Ang.

547
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,280
Cowardice

548
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,200
and silence

549
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,360
are both evil.

550
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
We will send him

551
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,680
to the underworld.

552
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,640
Officer,

553
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,240
what is justice?

554
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,800
what is evil?

555
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,160
There are still thirty-four kilometers to Tongde City.

556
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,200
You will pass three service areas.

557
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,520
Please pay attention to safety.

558
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Where are you?

559
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,240
On the way to Tongde.

560
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,760
There was a gunshot at Tongde.

561
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
It’s very likely the one Gao Ang had.

562
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,880
Come back first.

563
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,000
Zhao Lingjing said,

564
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,760
You’re part of the Erinyes Project.

565
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,960
Do you believe it?

566
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,040
If I believed it,

567
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,080
would I be calling you now?

568
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,280
Come back first.

569
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,680
Don’t shoulder everything alone.

570
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,080
I can’t go back.

571
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,920
If I go back,

572
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,120
we’ll lose this lead.

573
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,520
Once it’s lost,

574
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,440
we won’t get it back.

575
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Tang Jun.

576
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,520
Just trust me.

577
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,800
Tang Jun.

578
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,360
Do you know what’s going on with him now?

579
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,760
He went to investigate a case.

580
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
What case?

581
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,200
What’s this?

582
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,720
Zhao Lingjing’s statement.

583
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
Cheng Feng.

584
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,600
Not bad.

585
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,520
Leaking information.

586
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,480
Abusing power for personal gain.

587
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,560
Director Zhao.

588
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,680
I still trust Tang Jun.

589
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
After all, right now, besides Zhao Lingjing’s testimony,

590
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,440
there’s nothing else.

591
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,240
Shut up.

592
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,800
Da Kuan, Yi Fei

593
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,280
Come with me to search Tang Jun's house.

594
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,280
Xiao Pang

595
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
Track Tang Jun's phone.

596
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,680
It's Director Zhao.

597
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
You two go together.

598
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,880
Zhang Haonan stays behind.

599
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,400
Pull up the surveillance footage and arrest anyone you see.
