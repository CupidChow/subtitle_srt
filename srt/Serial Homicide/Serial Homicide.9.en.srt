1
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,600
Whose car is this?

2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,400
Why is it parked here?

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,440
Security!

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,360
Where's the security?

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
Always eating and sleeping, doing nothing.

6
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
Can't even keep an eye on the cars.

7
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,520
One eight.

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
Big bro

9
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
Why is it you guys again?

10
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
What do you want?

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Just the two of you?

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,960
What do you think?

13
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,120
Cut the crap

14
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,360
So sneaky

15
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Me

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm here to meet a woman

17
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,360
Should I announce it to the whole street?

18
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,520
Lao Luo, maybe we made a mistake

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,360
Let's go

20
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Sorry, man

21
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,040
Stop following me

22
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Crouch and come here

23
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,160
Don't move

24
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,840
Okay, okay

25
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
Take away

26
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,480
Get up

27
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Get up

28
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,080
Go

29
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,640
Renhe Road, 9:51

30
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,960
West Fifth Branch Road, 10:03

31
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
Jichun Road, 10:22

32
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
The latest time point

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,720
10:32

34
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,200
Wanliu Road

35
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Entered a blind spot

36
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,000
Sun Ruhai's car should be within this area

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Have colleagues from the old city go immediately

38
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Notify Captain Ran

39
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,880
Yes

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
You little brat

41
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,360
You hit pretty hard

42
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,360
You didn't hold back either

43
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,400
Speak

44
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Why did you kidnap Sun Ruhai?

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,240
I kidnapped my own boss?

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
Are you kidding?

47
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
September 18th

48
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,240
Parking lot, early morning

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,000
It was you, right?

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,800
Take a good look

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
Is that me?

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,720
This person is wearing my clothes

53
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,280
You drove the truck onto Tiannan Road

54
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
To pick up Big Scar

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
If that car follows

56
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,080
You crash into it

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
We can't let them go this time

58
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
If we're doing this, do it cleanly

59
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,960
Then why are you hiding?

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,360
When I woke up,

61
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,960
I saw the police had arrived.

62
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,120
What happened?

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
They said

64
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
the Public Security Bureau came looking for our boss, Sun.

65
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,000
I realized something might have happened,

66
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
so I thought I should hide for a bit.

67
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,960
I was still waiting for my boss to contact me.

68
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,840
Who would have thought

69
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,880
I'd end up waiting for you guys instead.

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you.

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
Put it in a small bag for you.

72
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
It wasn't Dabao who kidnapped Sun Ruhai.

73
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,120
It was Weiqin.

74
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,800
Weiqin stunned Dabao with a stun baton.

75
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
He took his clothes and access card.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
And kidnapped Sun Ruhai.

77
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,320
From this, it seems

78
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,760
Sun Ruhai is also a target of Erinias

79
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,160
organization's revenge.

80
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Officers,

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
there's no time to save the living.

82
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
Let's go find the dead.

83
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,960
Chengtou,

84
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,160
the network address has been found.

85
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Boss, two bowls of porridge.

86
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Brother

87
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
Please enjoy your noodles.

88
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Thank you.

89
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Cheng Tou

90
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,080
What does this mean?

91
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
In Greek mythology,

92
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,240
there was a king's daughter named Antigone.

93
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,640
She was buried alive by Creon

94
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,240
in the tomb of the Labdacus family.

95
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,840
Okay.

96
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,520
Sun Ruhai has been found.

97
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,400
Excuse me, make way.

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,680
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

99
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Old Liao

100
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Captain Ran

101
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,600
Time of death of the victim

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
is about one day ago

103
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,280
The inner walls of the box

104
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,680
are covered with scratch marks

105
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Fingernails are broken

106
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,800
Fingertips are cyanotic

107
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,280
Face is swollen and cyanotic

108
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,600
Superficial arteries in the neck are distended

109
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,520
Urinary incontinence

110
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,280
All of these are

111
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,320
signs of death by asphyxiation

112
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
signs of death by asphyxiation

113
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,760
He was buried alive

114
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,640
Captain Ran

115
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
This is our local police station

116
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
Director Chen

117
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,360
Hello, Director Chen

118
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm Ran Yue

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Hello, Officer Ran

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
Thank you for your hard work

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,640
This area belongs to our Xishan Village

122
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
About ten years ago

123
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,240
A developer

124
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,560
bought this place

125
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
Later, during the demolition

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
something major happened

127
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,120
and the project was halted

128
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,360
What happened?

129
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
What could go wrong with demolition?

130
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
Forced demolition

131
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,440
People died

132
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,880
Five villagers were crushed to death

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,640
So how was this handled later?

134
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,360
Later, the demolition company's boss died

135
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
The families were given some money

136
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,760
and the matter was left unsettled

137
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
At that time

138
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560
the person in charge of the demolition

139
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,040
was the current Ru Hai Real Estate's

140
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,960
Sun Ruhai

141
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Then

142
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
this piece of land

143
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,680
why is it still left unused?

144
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,560
This is the ancestral graveyard of Xishan Village.

145
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,520
The conditions for relocating the graves haven't been agreed upon.

146
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
So it's been left unused.

147
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,240
Ancestral graves.

148
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Take a call.

149
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,360
Speak.

150
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,040
Okay, got it.

151
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,760
People from Ruhai Real Estate

152
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,600
have received the news.

153
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll go back to the bureau to handle it first.

154
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,000
Haonan

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,560
Dakuan

156
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,600
You two go to Xishan Village to do some visits.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,560
Sanyuan

158
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
You go to the nearby shops

159
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,680
and check the surveillance footage.

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
See if you find anything.

161
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,960
If anything comes up,

162
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,280
call Tang Jun.

163
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,680
Okay.

164
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,200
Yes.

165
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,560
Let's go.

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,000
Officer Ran

167
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
I hope the police can solve the case soon.

168
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
The corresponding legal procedures

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,160
will be carried out at the same time.

170
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,720
There are a few more documents

171
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,240
that need your cooperation to sign.

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,240
Come with me.

173
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,280
Captain Ran

174
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Please wait a moment.

175
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,880
This

176
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,280
happened so suddenly.

177
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,960
President Sun's company

178
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,720
still has a lot of legal matters to handle.

179
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,800
I'll leave first.

180
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,800
Officer Ran

181
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
If you have anything else you need to know

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,920
about any situation

183
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,160
you can contact me anytime

184
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,640
We will do our best to cooperate

185
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Thank you

186
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,080
Now for a breaking news report

187
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,280
A well-known real estate company in Luzhou

188
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,920
Chairman of Ruhai Real Estate

189
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,640
Sun Ruhai

190
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,560
was murdered yesterday

191
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,400
The suspect is still at large

192
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,040
The case is still under investigation

193
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,160
Take whatever you need

194
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,080
Police

195
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Let me check your surveillance footage

196
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,680
Okay, sure

197
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,400
Hello, officer

198
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,960
Hello

199
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Have you seen this person?

200
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,080
No, I haven't

201
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,080
Take another look

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,800
No, I haven't

203
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,400
Someone is looking for you

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,000
Brother

205
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
Have you seen this person?

206
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,440
No, I haven't

207
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
Thank you

208
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,800
Have you seen this person?

209
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,240
Who are you? What are you doing?

210
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,480
Seems to live

211
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
on the second floor, room 208

212
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,520
Hello, boss.

213
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
Miss, have you seen this person?

214
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,680
Sir, have you seen him?

215
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,480
No.

216
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Hello.

217
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
Have you seen the person in this photo?

218
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,840
I haven't seen him.

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,400
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

220
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,760
I haven't.

221
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,080
I think I've found the target.

222
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
Target confirmed.

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,880
Do we know each other?

224
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,120
What?

225
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,000
Sorry.

226
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,920
I mistook you for someone else.

227
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,320
The target has entered Fen Alley.

228
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,120
Sanyuan

229
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Sanyuan

230
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,880
How are you?

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
Over there.

232
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,320
Call an ambulance quickly!

233
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
Sanyuan

234
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,760
An officer is injured on Fen Alley.

235
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,720
Come and support us quickly!

236
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,640
How is Sanyuan?

237
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,040
Out of danger now.

238
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,240
Head

239
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,920
Email

240
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,600
It should be the next warning.

241
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,880
What's going on?

242
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,320
In Greek mythology,

243
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,000
there was a person

244
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,160
who once treated livestock as his captives

245
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,880
and drove them into a tent to slaughter them wildly.

246
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,280
Isn't that a butcher?

247
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,720
It's the killer.

248
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Is someone going to kill the butcher,

249
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,960
or is the butcher going to kill someone?

250
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,840
Check the slaughterhouses.

251
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,800
Let's investigate them one by one.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,520
Yan Zi.

253
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,760
Notify all the branches.

254
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Ask them to assist in the investigation.

255
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,440
Yes.

256
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,400
There are three slaughterhouses in Luyu City.

257
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,560
The one in the west of the city is the largest.

258
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
This slaughterhouse has a very complete industrial chain.

259
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,400
The other two are relatively smaller.

260
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
The Beipu branch said

261
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
a doctor named An Wenju from Renxin Hospital

262
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,800
has gone missing.

263
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,240
His car is in the underground parking lot.

264
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
There are bloodstains in the car.

265
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
But the surveillance in the parking lot

266
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
was deliberately damaged.

267
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,560
Check the hospital parking lot

268
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,400
and the exit surveillance.

269
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes.

270
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,000
Stop.

271
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,920
It's this car.

272
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,040
Investigate it thoroughly for me.

273
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,600
Yes.

274
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,800
It's a car from the West City Slaughterhouse.

275
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,480
Brother.

276
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,200
Brother.

277
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I-I beg you, okay?

278
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,480
Brother, I'm begging you.

279
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
Hold on tight.

280
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,480
Big Brother

281
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,760
Big Brother

282
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,680
Big Brother

283
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,080
I'm begging you

284
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,960
Big Brother

285
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,880
Big Brother

286
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Big Brother

287
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,600
Stop

288
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,920
You go find someone

289
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160
West City Slaughterhouse

290
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,760
Suspicious individuals, items, and bloodstains found

291
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,040
Hurry and chase after them.

292
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,400
My motorcycle

293
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
My motorcycle

294
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,840
My motorcycle

295
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,720
Cheng Feng

296
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,960
Cheng Feng

297
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,160
Stay here

298
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,960
Wait for backup

299
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Hurry, hurry, hurry

300
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,120
Are you okay?

301
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,880
Over there

302
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,520
Hao Nan

303
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,480
Take people to search

304
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,280
Come with me

305
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,200
Da Kuan, you keep watch here

306
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,720
Stop

307
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,960
Captain Ran

308
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,600
An Wenju's body has been found

309
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,600
In the car

310
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,600
Bro

311
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Are you okay, bro?

312
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,920
Chase over there

313
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,520
Each team, search separately

314
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,160
Go

315
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,960
Don't move
