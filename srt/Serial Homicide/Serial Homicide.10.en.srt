1
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Go

2
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,840
Don't move

3
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
Call an ambulance

4
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Haonan

5
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,880
The situation is getting more and more complicated.

6
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,680
Starting from the Sun Bin case,

7
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,800
all the victims

8
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
and the suspects

9
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
what kind of connection do they have?

10
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
We need to investigate each one thoroughly.

11
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
What's going on with Song De?

12
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,160
Nothing serious.

13
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's wait for him to wake up.

14
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,640
According to Erinyes

15
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,920
the rules of reciprocal revenge,

16
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,480
An Wenju's real enemy

17
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,440
will definitely be assigned

18
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
other murder targets.

19
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,720
The killer could attack the next person at any time.

20
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
Before Song De wakes up,

21
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
fully investigate all of An Wenju's connections.

22
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,800
Your Director An Wenju

23
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,080
has he ever had any conflicts

24
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,160
with anyone?

25
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Well,

26
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm not really sure.

27
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
Director An,

28
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,840
he's

29
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
a pretty good person.

30
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
I've never heard of him having conflicts with anyone.

31
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Come in.

32
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,280
Head nurse,

33
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,040
I want to

34
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
ask if we can change my dad's doctor.

35
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
What's wrong?

36
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
It's this Dr. An.

37
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,760
He has too bad a temper.

38
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
The medicine he prescribed isn't very good either.

39
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,080
Okay.

40
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,480
I understand.

41
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll report it to the management.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,160
Alright, thank you.

43
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Director An, right?

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
He really has a bad temper.

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,640
He likes to scold people.

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,120
I heard

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
Just heard

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,880
he's also violent at home.

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
Domestic violence.

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
Yes.

51
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
A few years ago,

52
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
when he abused his wife,

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,240
it caused a huge stir in the hospital.

54
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
His son, An Keyi,

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,960
also made a scene at the hospital.

56
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,200
An Wenju,

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
come out here!

58
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,800
Come out here!

59
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
An Wenju!

60
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,000
An Wenju!

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,160
That brat has no manners.

62
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,960
This is a hospital.

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,480
Go home!

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
Do you think I'm scared of you like my mom is?

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,240
Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,040
An Keyi!

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
Keyi, I'm fine, I'm fine.

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,560
Keyi, Mom's here.

69
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
It's all because you spoiled him.

70
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,680
No, I'm sorry.

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
He's still young, he didn't mean it.

72
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,280
He's still young.

73
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,320
He didn't do it on purpose.

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
Sorry, let's go home.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,440
Keyi.

76
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,640
Go home.

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,400
Let's go home.

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,040
Mom is fine.

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,160
It's okay, Keyi.

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,400
My son is fine.

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,120
Not long after this happened,

83
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
they got divorced.

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
The An Keyi you mentioned

85
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
is that celebrity.

86
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,480
Yes.

87
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,880
An Keyi became a singer when he grew up.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
He became famous later.

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,360
Who are you looking for?

90
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,960
We are from the Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,000
We'd like to ask you about something.

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,360
Is it An Wenju?

93
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
That's my son.

94
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,080
He looks energetic, right?

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,560
Energetic.

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Very handsome.

97
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,480
Do you want him?

98
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,920
No.

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
We're on official duty.

100
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,600
You don't seem surprised about An Wenju being harmed.

101
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,280
Not surprised at all.

102
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,040
I divorced him a long time ago.

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
Keyi and I

104
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
have nothing to do with him.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,280
That beast.

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
It's better that he's dead.

107
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,080
You always have such a long face every day.

108
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
Who are you showing it to?

109
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,840
Is it like I owe you something?

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
Do I owe you?

111
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,760
No.

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Hurry up and eat.

113
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,760
Aren't you going soon?

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
Do you still have to work the night shift?

115
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,880
You're always hoping I leave early.

116
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,360
What?

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,320
Do you have something to do tonight?

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Did you make plans with someone?

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
You hope I work the night shift every day.

120
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,840
Is that right?

121
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,880
Stop.

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
Did I say you could leave?

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,240
Did I say you could leave?

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,200
Did I say you could leave?

125
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,120
Did I say you could leave?

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,800
Did I say you could leave?

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't hit me, I was wrong, I was wrong.

128
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
What did you do wrong? What did you do wrong?

129
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
I know I was wrong.

130
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,520
I know I was wrong.

131
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,240
I know I was wrong.

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,800
You pushed me.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
Cry, cry.

135
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,400
Look at you whining.

136
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm really annoyed.

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,160
I'll deal with you when I get back.

138
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,920
That day,

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,200
I was badly hurt.

140
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,760
I didn't have the strength to clean up.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
Later,

142
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,280
Ke Yi came back from tutoring class

143
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,880
and saw all of this.

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,760
Mom,

145
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,760
he hit you again.

146
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
Say something.

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
Keyi

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,800
Keyi

149
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,200
Keyi, don't.

150
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,960
Keyi, come back.

151
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,000
Keyi

152
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,960
After you divorced,

153
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,840
did An Wenju still keep in touch with you?

154
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
At first,

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,200
he did bother us.

156
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,720
But not in the past two years.

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Why did he stop contacting you?

158
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,160
Well,

159
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,560
it's probably nothing.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
He might have felt

161
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,320
that it was pointless to keep bothering us.

162
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,400
Later on,

163
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
because of Keyi's job,

164
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
we moved to another city.

165
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,400
He was extremely busy with work.

166
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,200
He traveled all year round.

167
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,600
Recently, it's also because

168
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
he wanted to take a break for a while.

169
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
So we

170
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,760
came back to Luzhou.

171
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,680
Is An Keyi not at home?

172
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
No, he's not.

173
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,640
He went out of town

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,280
to film a variety show.

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,960
I see.

176
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,640
According to our investigation,

177
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,680
An Keyi really hated his father.

178
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
He even threatened to kill him.

179
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,360
So now we suspect

180
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,720
that Keyi killed An Wenju.

181
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,280
Don't move, stay still.

182
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
Stay still.

183
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
Name.

184
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
You don't know me.

185
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,960
Name.

186
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
An Keyi.

187
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,840
Why did you run when you saw us?

188
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,000
I suddenly remembered I had something to do.

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,760
The last time you saw your father, An Wenju,

190
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680
when was it?

191
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,640
I don't remember.

192
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,720
It's been a long time.

193
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,680
This seems

194
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,280
to be An Keyi, right?

195
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
Jun.

196
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Investigate the scene.

197
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,400
Inside An Wenju's house,

198
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
a large number of An Keyi's fingerprints were found.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
This kid

200
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,440
is suspicious.

201
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,280
Plug this in.

202
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,720
This is you, right?

203
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
Going to An Wenju's house,

204
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
what were you doing?

205
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,280
He's dead.

206
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,200
I went back to get my childhood things.

207
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,160
To get my own things.

208
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
That's not illegal, is it?

209
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,040
Without permission,

210
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
entering anyone's home without authorization

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,560
is illegal.

212
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
What did you take?

213
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Personal belongings.

214
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,800
What things?

215
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,600
That's my privacy.

216
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,520
What does it have to do with you?

217
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,040
Have my mom and the lawyer arrived?

218
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
Behave yourself.

219
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,840
This is the police station.

220
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm not a criminal.

221
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm asking if my mom is here.

222
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,840
Sit down.

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
I want to make a phone call.

224
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,040
Sit down.

225
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,120
I said I want to make a call.

226
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
Sit properly.

227
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,560
Get lost.

228
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,520
Sit down.

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
Hurry up.

230
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,360
Sit down.

231
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,200
You, hurry up.

232
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,280
Sit properly.

233
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,160
I want to call my lawyer.

234
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,360
Behave yourself.

235
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,160
Give me my phone.

236
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Keyi.

237
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,960
Hand it to me.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Let him go.

239
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,600
What are you doing?

240
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,160
It's fine now.

241
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,840
Officer Tang.

242
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
What's going on?

243
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
All of a sudden,

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
he just went crazy.

245
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
If this doesn't work, send him to the hospital.

246
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,760
No.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,560
Keyi can't just show up at the hospital.

248
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,560
Pour some water.

249
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Officer Ran.

250
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,920
Ms. Xiang.

251
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,480
She can handle this issue.

252
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,840
Could we use this room

253
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
for a while?

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,920
Officer Ran

255
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,680
I am An Keyi's lawyer.

256
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,440
Once Keyi has calmed down,

257
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
I want to take him away.

258
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,240
But we now have evidence showing

259
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,360
that last night

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,280
An Keyi went to An Wenju's house

261
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,840
and took some items.

262
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,520
So

263
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
we still need to ask him some questions.

264
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
If you have enough evidence

265
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,760
to prove

266
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,640
that An Keyi is connected to An Wenju's death,

267
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,520
then you can officially summon

268
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,720
or even arrest him.

269
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
But you clearly don't have that now.

270
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,760
A son going to his father's house is not illegal.

271
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,600
An Keyi has already said everything he can.

272
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,280
Given his current physical and mental state,

273
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
he is not fit to stay and continue assisting with the investigation.

274
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
According to procedure,

275
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,760
I am allowed to take him away.

276
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,640
I think

277
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,760
you should be aware

278
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
of this rule, right?

279
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,040
Isn't that so?

280
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,160
Are all the people we arrest

281
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
your clients?

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,880
Maybe because I'm expensive.

283
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,480
Officer Tang

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,160
You know me, right?

285
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,480
I know you.

286
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,440
Chu

287
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,400
Hong

288
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,560
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

289
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,400
When I was a child, I lived in the old district,

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,640
in the Spring Community.

291
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,320
Elementary school

292
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,920
was at Luzhou No. 9 Primary School.

293
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,520
Chu Hong

294
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,920
Elementary school classmate

295
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,960
We were in the same class for two years in elementary school

296
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,520
Officer Tang, you have a good memory

297
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Later, my parents and I went abroad

298
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I remember you were a crybaby when you were little

299
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,880
And now you've become a top lawyer

300
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
Impressive

301
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
That's a bit of a dark past

302
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,040
I didn't expect it either

303
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,760
You were such a troublemaker as a kid

304
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
And now you've become a senior police officer

305
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,680
It's nothing worth mentioning

306
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,720
Well, um...

307
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,080
You two go ahead and talk

308
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,200
I didn't expect that after so many years

309
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,240
We could still meet again

310
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,920
And even work together

311
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,520
It's not cooperation

312
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
We're here to arrest people

313
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,760
You're here to take people away

314
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,640
We have different positions

315
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,480
We can't cooperate

316
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,600
If you didn't arrest people

317
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
Would I be able to take anyone?

318
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,880
Isn't that right, Officer Tang?

319
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,640
I think

320
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,760
We'll probably see each other often in the future

321
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,400
Say whatever you want

322
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,840
Goodbye, Officer Tang

323
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
Goodbye, goodbye

324
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,720
Da Kuan

325
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,680
Find Hao Nan

326
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,960
Keep watching An Keyi

327
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,480
Yes

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,880
Go investigate Song De

329
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,840
Lawyer Chu

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,680
The police

331
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,160
Will they keep bothering Keyi because of An Wenju's case

332
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,560
and continue to harass Keyi

333
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,640
or

334
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
is there anything we can do now

335
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,960
to

336
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,160
stop them from getting close to Keyi

337
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,560
If the media catches this or it spreads in the industry

338
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,440
Keyi's work will definitely be affected

339
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,400
Ms. Xiang

340
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,840
According to current laws in our country

341
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,080
cooperating with the police in investigations

342
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,960
is every citizen's duty

343
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,640
Keyi has nothing to do with An Wenju's death

344
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,880
The police handling the case

345
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,400
also need to rely on evidence

346
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,200
On this point

347
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,520
you don't need to worry too much

348
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,240
Keyi

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,520
As your lawyer

350
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,800
what I want to remind you is

351
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,240
no matter what you're facing right now

352
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,480
you must handle it very carefully

353
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,720
Don't be too impulsive

354
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
This isn't just because

355
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
you need to protect your artist's image

356
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,800
more importantly

357
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,400
you're still so young

358
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
there's a long road ahead of you

359
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
you need to take every step steadily

360
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,640
Understood, Sister Chu

361
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,120
President Wu

362
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,120
The new security staff

363
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,240
will protect your safety 24 hours a day

364
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,600
Don't worry too much

365
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,040
Injury

366
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
Keep your voice down, you're being too loud and restless.

367
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,880
You'll scare her again.

368
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,840
Brother Haonan

369
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,920
Director Zhao

370
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,000
The injury has healed.

371
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,120
How are things today?

372
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,200
Look.

373
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Smells so good.

374
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,560
Your sister-in-law made this soup for you.

375
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,600
It's really tasty.

376
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,760
Thank you, sister-in-law.

377
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,360
No need to thank me.

378
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,280
I'll get you a bowl.

379
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay.

380
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,840
What are you looking at?

381
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,120
An Keyi

382
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,080
My husband.

383
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,760
Handsome, right?

384
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,040
You changed boyfriends?

385
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,280
Uncle Ping

386
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
You don't understand.

387
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
You, as an elder, shouldn't worry about it.

388
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
Me, an elder?

389
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,120
Sanyuan

390
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,280
He seems to have

391
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
been brought to the station by me.

392
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,640
Did something happen to him?

393
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,920
Could it be that he...

394
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,120
...also got into trouble?

395
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,080
Don't overthink it.

396
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Your main task right now

397
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,280
is to focus on recovering.

398
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,320
Take care and recover.

399
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,760
Do you understand?

400
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,200
Yes.

401
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,960
Take care and recover.

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,560
Take care and recover.

403
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,520
The soup is still hot.

404
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,360
While it's hot,

405
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,240
eat it while it's hot.

406
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Earlier,

407
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,720
in the fan group,

408
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,760
I heard someone say

409
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,920
I heard someone say

410
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,240
that An Keyi

411
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,200
is...

412
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,760
No, no, that's not true.

413
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,760
Don't jump to conclusions.

414
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,440
It can't be true, right?

415
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,200
Is it hot? Did you burn yourself?

416
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
I'll do it myself.

417
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,040
Let me cool it for you.

418
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,000
Move, move, move aside.

419
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
As for Song De,

420
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,120
he doesn't talk much usually.

421
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,280
He doesn't interact much with anyone.

422
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,400
Don't be fooled by his appearance—

423
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,880
he may look big and rough,

424
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,160
but he's kind-hearted.

425
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,560
He's a good person.

426
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
A good person.

427
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,720
If it weren't for Song De,

428
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
I wouldn't be alive today.

429
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,000
I would've been gone long ago.

430
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
Uncle Gui

431
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
Uncle Gui

432
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,400
Uncle Gui

433
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
Uncle Gui

434
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,000
What about Song De?

435
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,480
Does he have any family here?

436
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,440
No wife, no children.

437
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,720
He's single.

438
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
I haven't heard of any relatives either.

439
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, right.

440
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,080
I just remembered.

441
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,360
Four or five years ago,

442
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,320
there was a woman

443
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
who came looking for Song De.

444
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
That woman

445
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,720
Who is she to him?

446
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,360
He said she's his younger sister from his hometown.

447
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,480
From what I see,

448
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,600
it doesn't look like it.

449
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,160
Looks more like a girlfriend.

450
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,120
Where is his hometown?

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
It's a fishing village.

452
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,720
Donggang Village.

453
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Stop!

454
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,320
Run!

455
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,280
Run!

456
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,920
Who are you? Let me go!

457
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,560
Are you okay?

458
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,120
Let me go!

459
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,640
Why are you hitting people?

460
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,200
Let him go! What are you doing?

461
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,800
Let go of me!

462
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
Let him go!

463
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,600
Who are you people?

464
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,600
Police.

465
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,960
So what if you're police?

466
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,120
This is our family business.

467
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,760
Officer,

468
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,120
Sorry.

469
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,800
Sorry.

470
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
They drank too much and started fighting.

471
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,160
It's fine, it's fine.

472
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
Go back and help him sober up.

473
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,560
Quick, take him inside to sober up.

474
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,680
Er Lin, let's go.

475
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,200
This isn't over with you.

476
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,920
It's not finished.

477
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,000
Always causing trouble for me.

478
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,760
The couple fights every day.

479
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,920
It's giving me a headache.

480
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,040
Who are you?

481
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
I'm the village chief here.

482
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
My surname is Song.

483
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
This way, please.

484
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,520
Dezi,

485
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,640
he's a pitiful man.

486
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,520
Actually,

487
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,280
he wasn't originally from our village.

488
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,840
When he was a child,

489
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,720
his aunt

490
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,520
didn't have any children.

491
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
He was adopted by her.

492
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,240
Later on,

493
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
his aunt had her own child.

494
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,120
So,

495
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,800
he became free labor for the family again.

496
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,640
In the end,

497
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
he never got married.

498
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,920
He ended up an old bachelor.

499
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,280
Be careful.

500
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,480
Amei,

501
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,960
Director,

502
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,280
please check the fishing nets at the village entrance.

503
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,040
Oh, okay.

504
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,840
Does he have

505
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,920
any relatives here?

506
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,640
No.

507
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,240
The elders have all passed away.

508
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,120
Does he come back often?

509
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,480
Not really.

510
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,640
What would he come back for?

511
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
He has no family or connections.

512
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,480
And no home here.

513
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,560
Be careful.

514
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,560
Look,

515
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,280
the house is about to collapse.

516
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,920
But,

517
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,680
Song De is a good person.

518
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
No matter who from the village goes to Luzhou,

519
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,880
as long as they ask him for help,

520
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
he will help them.

521
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,560
Does Song De have a sister in the village,

522
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
or

523
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,640
a girlfriend?

524
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
Speaking of that,

525
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,400
he actually did.

526
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,680
When he was young,

527
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,920
he dated Wang Yanfang from the village

528
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
for a while.

529
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,440
Later,

530
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,240
Wang Yanfang's father

531
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,400
thought Song De was too poor

532
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,360
and insisted she marry

533
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
Xue Erlin, who runs a small business in the village.

534
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,560
Xue Erlin.

535
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,400
In the blink of an eye,

536
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,560
more than ten years have passed.

537
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,880
Whenever Song De thinks about this,

538
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,320
he feels really miserable.

539
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,680
I guess

540
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,000
he doesn't want to come back

541
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
probably because of this.

542
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,000
Take us

543
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,080
to meet Wang Yanfang.

544
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,600
You've all met her.

545
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
She's the woman at the small restaurant at the village entrance.

546
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,840
Police, don't move!

547
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,520
Police, don't move!

548
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:20,920
Behave yourself.

549
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,720
It wasn't me.

550
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,600
I...

551
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,200
Behave, move.

552
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,800
Move.

553
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,320
I didn't do it.

554
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,920
Move.

555
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,440
Ma'am.

556
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,200
Officer.

557
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,040
My husband gets drunk and acts crazy.

558
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,080
I'm really fine.

559
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,480
Ma'am.

560
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,520
If you really are experiencing domestic violence,

561
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,120
you can contact our police department.

562
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,320
Or the women's federation.

563
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,680
We can all help you.

564
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,440
I don't need help.

565
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,120
Really.

566
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,280
Ma'am.

567
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,640
We were being too nosy.

568
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
Take two bottles of water.

569
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,280
Get them yourself.

570
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,640
Big sister

571
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,000
You and Song De are pretty close, right?

572
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,520
No

573
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,640
We're not close

574
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,160
How could that be?

575
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,200
Weren't you two

576
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,480
boyfriend and girlfriend before?

577
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,760
That was years ago

578
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,720
We haven't been in touch for a long time

579
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,840
So when was the last time

580
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,920
you talked?

581
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,040
What are you talking about?

582
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,720
Why did you stop talking

583
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,880
when I came back?

584
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,640
Go on, keep talking

585
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,520
You two cops

586
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,800
why do you have to meddle in everything?

587
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,960
Even things in the bedroom?

588
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,960
I'm warning you

589
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,240
Domestic violence is against the law

590
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,800
Did you hear me?

591
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,480
Officer

592
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm fine

593
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,960
Thank you for your concern

594
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,440
Finish your water and leave

595
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,280
Just go

596
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,640
We're leaving

597
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,960
All done?

598
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,960
Go

599
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Make me a couple of dishes

600
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Darn

601
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,440
He beats women and is still so arrogant

602
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,840
Her husband is here

603
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,920
We can't get anything out of her

604
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Let's try again tomorrow

605
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,040
Name

606
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
Huang Huahua

607
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,160
Occupation

608
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,000
Journalist

609
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,160
What is your relationship with Huang Huahua?

610
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,320
No relationship.

611
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,320
I don't know him.

612
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
I don't know him.

613
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,320
If you don't know him, why did you attack him?

614
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,640
What do you mean, attack?

615
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,400
He secretly took photos of me.

616
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,960
I just wanted to scare him.

617
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280
In our line of work,

618
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,360
following celebrities like this,

619
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,960
getting hit

620
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's all normal.

621
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,680
It's fine.

622
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,680
I'm not going to press charges against him.

623
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,840
That's easy for you to say.

624
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,120
This is a criminal case.

625
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,520
It's not up to you whether to press charges.

626
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,400
Officer,

627
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm begging you,

628
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
please don't make things difficult for me.

629
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,760
We entertainment reporters—

630
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,880
our relationship with celebrities—

631
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,840
is very delicate.

632
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,560
From

633
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
a certain perspective,

634
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,560
we're friends.

635
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,800
This An Keyi

636
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,960
is from our city, Luzhou.

637
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,160
She's the top trending star.

638
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,600
I

639
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,480
can't afford to offend him.

640
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,640
Let me put it this way,

641
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,920
the two of us

642
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,560
were just messing around.

643
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,160
It's nothing.

644
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,240
We were just playing.

645
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,120
I want to see my lawyer.

646
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,640
Do these two know each other?
