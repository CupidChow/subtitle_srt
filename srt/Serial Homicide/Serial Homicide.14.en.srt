1
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Ishimatsu

2
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,640
Ishimatsu

3
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,560
Is this person reliable?

4
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,880
Did I miss the person I was looking for?

5
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,640
It'll definitely work.

6
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
Take a look at these.

7
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,520
Shi Song

8
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
He has suffered from severe depression for a long time.

9
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,440
He has strong suicidal tendencies.

10
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,760
All of these are from you—

11
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
documents from when you accompanied him to see the doctor.

12
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,160
Remember this.

13
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
He committed suicide.

14
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
Call the police after sunrise.

15
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,320
Send him away.

16
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Okay.

17
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
Confirmed that Shi Song was no longer breathing.

18
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
I called the police.

19
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,000
But I didn't expect

20
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
that the process after calling the police

21
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,320
was not as

22
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,680
smooth as Sun Ruhai had imagined.

23
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,000
Because a police officer named Ran

24
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,240
Officer Ran,

25
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
I want to claim my husband's body

26
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
so he can be laid to rest as soon as possible.

27
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,600
There are suspicious points in Shi Song's case.

28
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
We are applying for an autopsy.

29
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,080
I think, as his wife,

30
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,720
you should want to know

31
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,520
the real cause of your husband's death.

32
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,080
Officer Ran,

33
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,520
my husband committed suicide.

34
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,600
I just want him to rest in peace soon.

35
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
He's already dead.

36
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,520
Why do you still have to cut open his body

37
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
and torment him?

38
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,360
Why can't you let him rest in peace?

39
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
Ms. Wu, Ms. Wu,

40
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,600
please calm down.

41
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
Here's the situation:

42
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,360
Shi Song's body

43
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,000
we will

44
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,400
notify you as soon as possible to claim it.

45
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,240
Alright?

46
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Please go back for now.

47
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Please, Ms. Wu.

48
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,840
Please.

49
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,520
Senior,

50
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,120
telling the family these things

51
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
they won't understand.

52
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,440
Sit.

53
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,400
What important matter

54
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,080
requires us to meet in person?

55
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,120
Let me ask you.

56
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
Have you dealt with that cop named Ran?

57
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
The body—

58
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,280
The body still hasn't been claimed.

59
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,000
Did something go wrong in the process?

60
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't worry.

61
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
Don't panic when something happens.

62
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,280
Isn't it true

63
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,760
that I'm handling things one by one?

64
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,240
Relax.

65
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,480
No matter how capable that Ran is,

66
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,800
I have ways to stop his investigation.

67
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,560
Look,

68
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
who's here.

69
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Don't worry.

70
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
Step aside for now.

71
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,360
Honored guest, welcome.

72
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Officer Ran.

73
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,240
Please come in.

74
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,160
Officer Ran

75
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm next door.

76
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I've prepared some light wine.

77
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,920
Let's

78
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,800
eat and talk at the same time.

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
You said you had information about Shi Song

80
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,120
that you wanted to report to us.

81
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,320
What information?

82
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
Officer Ran

83
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,680
No rush.

84
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Let's eat and talk.

85
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,720
Please, come.

86
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,240
Is there something you need?

87
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
Yes, yes, there is.

88
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,800
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

89
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Officer Ran

90
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,720
My elder brother

91
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,600
has been gone for many days.

92
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,480
The company

93
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,240
needs to resume work.

94
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,080
And my sister-in-law

95
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
also needs to be comforted.

96
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,560
Respect for the dead is most important.

97
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,600
As long as my brother isn't at rest,

98
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,200
everyone in the company

99
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
says that I, Sun Ruhai,

100
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
am not handling things well.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
So,

102
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,920
I want to ask

103
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,840
Officer Ran

104
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,880
Brother Ran

105
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,120
to show some leniency

106
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,400
and let my brother

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,080
be buried in peace.

108
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,480
I see.

109
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,160
Please wait a moment.

110
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
It's almost time,

111
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,440
the holiday is coming.

112
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,880
I prepared some mooncakes.

113
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,840
When you go home,

114
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
have them with your wife and niece.

115
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,120
Just

116
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,800
please

117
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
don't give them away to others.

118
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just a small token.

119
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,480
So much money,

120
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,880
are you trying to buy your own life?

121
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
Officer Ran,

122
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
I think you are

123
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,960
refusing a toast

124
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,400
and choosing punishment instead.

125
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,600
Have you ever seen a hunter?

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
I am one.

127
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Take a look.

128
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
The people in the photo,

129
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,240
do you know all of them?

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,400
This person

131
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,920
is one of Sun Ruhai's men.

132
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,920
What's his name?

133
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,840
I don't know.

134
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,480
I've seen this person.

135
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,240
He was a police officer with Officer Ran back then.

136
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,520
That's him.

137
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Captain Ran,

138
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,920
I've already verified it.

139
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,920
The time Wu Xinxin claimed the body

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
was the day after Captain Ran Haochuan's incident.

141
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,440
Gao Ang, Sun Ruhai

142
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,040
The time this photo was taken

143
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
was when Shi Song died

144
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,760
during the period when Master had his accident.

145
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
Gao Ang

146
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
can't possibly be unaware of this case

147
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,760
and the little tricks Sun Ruhai is pulling behind the scenes.

148
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,440
He can't be completely in the dark.

149
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
It's been so many years.

150
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
He hasn't been willing to reveal a single useful piece of information.

151
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
He must be hiding something.

152
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,880
I'll go see Gao Ang again.

153
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,880
Enough.

154
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,920
Stop looking for him.

155
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,040
What's the point of finding him?

156
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,600
It's useless.

157
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,840
It's been so many years.

158
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
He's already developed

159
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,840
an almost perfect set of excuses.

160
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,480
And about Shi Song's death,

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
we did find out

162
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
the records show he committed suicide due to depression.

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,520
It's useless.

164
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
It's no help at all.

165
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,040
Without solid evidence,

166
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,760
even if you look for him a hundred times, it won't help.

167
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
Tang Jun

168
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,840
Tang Jun

169
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,200
Let me tell you

170
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,240
I feel that Master

171
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,040
was investigating Shi Song's case back then

172
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
and that's why he was killed

173
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,040
This kind of case

174
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,360
was full of loopholes from start to finish

175
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,640
but it was covered up so perfectly

176
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
This has long surpassed

177
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,040
Sun Ruhai's capabilities

178
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,240
Are you saying

179
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,400
there's someone behind all this

180
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
This person

181
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
first helped Shi Song

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,240
then helped Sun Ruhai

183
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
And now

184
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,840
he's probably manipulating something

185
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,560
to keep us from seeing the truth

186
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,120
But we're getting closer to the truth

187
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,880
The closer we get to the truth

188
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,440
the more afraid I become

189
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,360
What are you afraid of

190
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm afraid I'll miss something again

191
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,840
Based on the clues we have so far

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,680
the entire

193
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,400
Erinyes Revenge Plan

194
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,120
is most likely rooted in

195
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,160
Shi Song's death

196
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
Those responsible for Shi Song's death

197
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,800
are a few directly involved individuals.

198
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Currently, aside from Wu Xinxin who has been rescued,

199
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,880
the anesthetist

200
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,080
has not yet been located.

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,960
The others

202
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,560
have all been killed.

203
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,560
According to

204
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,720
Wu Xinxin's statement,

205
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,240
the anesthetist who caused Shi Song's death back then

206
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,240
is very likely

207
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,680
the same person responsible for Song De's child's

208
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
death.

209
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
That is,

210
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,000
Lu Junfei.

211
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,400
Sun Bin was in charge of bribing the anesthetist

212
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
and was placed on the revenge list.

213
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,840
This is understandable.

214
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,280
But what about Yin Hui and Shi Song's deaths?

215
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,360
How are they connected?

216
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,480
Here's the situation, Director Zhao.

217
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,320
From the investigation into Shi Song's death,

218
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,920
we found that Wu Xinxin had

219
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,240
an alibi for the night Shi Song died.

220
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
She was not present.

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,920
The witness was actually Yin Hui.

222
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,600
Based on the evidence we have,

223
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,840
this is clearly false testimony.

224
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,000
So why was Wei Qin monitoring Gao Ang?

225
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Why is that?

226
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
Is it simply a personal vendetta

227
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,560
or is Gao Ang also involved in the Shi Song case?

228
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,400
This is also

229
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,480
a major point of suspicion in the case.

230
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,160
According to Wu Xinxin's statement,

231
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
Gao Ang

232
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,440
did not take part in the killing of Shi Song.

233
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,720
Could Gao Ang be Sun Ruhai's informant?

234
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
That's unlikely.

235
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,120
He was imprisoned after losing his gun.

236
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,600
He doesn't meet the conditions

237
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,760
for having colluded with Sun Ruhai for years.

238
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,920
Regardless of whether Gao Ang

239
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,560
is directly connected to the Shi Song case or not,

240
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,000
we can't rule out

241
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,520
that Gao Ang is still in danger.

242
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,240
So,

243
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,320
we'll assign more people to continue protecting Gao Ang

244
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
to prevent him from being harmed.

245
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,440
Understood.

246
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,440
Shi Song—

247
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,840
does he have any other relatives

248
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,680
or anyone

249
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,800
who might seek revenge for him?

250
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,480
There really is.

251
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,960
Shi Song's parents passed away early.

252
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
He also has a younger sister.

253
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,120
Her name is Shi Rong.

254
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
But according to our investigation,

255
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,120
Shi Rong has been abroad all this time.

256
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,160
She hasn't entered the country in the past ten years.

257
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,600
Even after Shi Song died, she didn't come back.

258
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,080
This

259
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,320
in itself is suspicious.

260
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
I will request from my superiors

261
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,120
to apply for international assistance

262
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,240
and get in touch with Shi Rong

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,000
as soon as possible.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,960
Besides that,

265
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
our most urgent task now

266
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,560
is to find Lu Junfei as soon as possible

267
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,920
to prevent him from being killed.

268
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,880
He is not only

269
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,360
Erynieus's next target,

270
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,880
but also a key witness

271
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,920
in solving the Shi Song case.

272
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Brother Su,

273
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm really sorry.

274
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,080
I might have to go back to my hometown tomorrow.

275
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,800
It'll probably take at least ten days or half a month.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Otherwise,

277
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,160
let's meet tonight instead.

278
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah.

279
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
Then I'll wait for you tonight.

280
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,960
Okay, sure.

281
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,760
She's coming out.

282
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,400
Let's go.

283
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,120
Follow her.

284
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,200
Follow her.

285
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
Get out of the car, let's go.

286
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,040
Thank you.

287
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,400
Let's go.

288
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Who are you?

289
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,280
Police.

290
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,120
Officer, is there something you need?

291
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,120
Where did this come from?

292
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,920
This one?

293
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
My friend just gave this to me.

294
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,440
Susan.

295
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,080
Why aren't you going home yet?

296
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,480
Isn't it the end of the month?

297
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm sorting out the accounts.

298
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,800
You don't need to.

299
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,960
You're definitely our top salesperson again.

300
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,080
Amy.

301
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,120
Haven't you always liked this?

302
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
It's yours.

303
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Really?

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,080
Thank you, Susan.

305
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,800
Try it on.

306
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,560
Okay.

307
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,920
It looks great, Susan.

308
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,840
Let me treat you to dinner after work.

309
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,120
Why are you being so polite?

310
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,080
I still have some accounts to finish.

311
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,240
How about you help me by getting a milk tea downstairs?

312
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
I'll transfer you the money.

313
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,080
Sure.

314
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,680
Okay.

315
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,080
Where's Mengshan?

316
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,400
She just asked me to buy two milk teas.

317
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
And then she herself...

318
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,040
Is she crazy?

319
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,200
Mengshan might represent

320
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Aphrodite from Greek mythology.

321
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,680
She might be the next avenger.

322
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,640
We lost track of Mengshan.

323
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,120
What are you even doing?

324
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,200
Ranyue

325
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
We've found Shi Rong.

326
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,000
She is still abroad right now.

327
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,880
Cheng Feng

328
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,800
Connect the video from the information center.

329
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay.

330
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,600
It's ready.

331
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,120
Hello, officer. I'm Shi Rong.

332
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm really sorry.

333
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I just finished class.

334
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
Sorry to keep you waiting.

335
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,280
At this time in China,

336
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
you must have already finished work, right?

337
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,120
We haven't yet.

338
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,960
Let me introduce myself first.

339
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm from the Criminal Investigation Team of Nanyang Branch, Luzhou City.

340
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,480
Ranyue

341
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,600
About your brother, Shi Song,

342
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,800
we have some questions

343
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,880
and need your assistance.

344
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,360
Okay, Officer Ran.

345
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,720
Shi Rong

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,960
After you went abroad at sixteen,

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,040
there have been no records of you returning to China.

348
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,360
I'd like to ask,

349
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,520
all these years,

350
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,200
why have you never come back to China?

351
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,040
My brother was my only family.

352
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,680
After he passed away,

353
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,760
I had no ties left in my home country.

354
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,960
Besides,

355
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,400
I hadn't finished my studies yet.

356
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,440
So,

357
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
I never went back.

358
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
I mean no offense,

359
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,160
but I would like to ask,

360
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,760
when your only brother, Shi Song, passed away,

361
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,200
why didn't you return to your country

362
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,360
to attend his funeral?

363
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,040
That is also my greatest pain.

364
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,120
At that time, I had undergone a major surgery.

365
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,160
My health was very poor.

366
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,800
They were worried about my condition,

367
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,960
so they kept it from me

368
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
that my brother had already passed away.

369
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,600
When I recovered,

370
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,280
I learned the news of my brother's death.

371
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,600
He had already been cremated.

372
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
I should have gone back to see my brother one last time.

373
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,600
If it weren't for my brother,

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,360
I wouldn't be where I am today.

375
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
So regarding your brother Shi Song's cause of death,

376
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,040
have you ever had any doubts?

377
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
To be honest,

378
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
when I first heard the news,

379
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,400
I didn't believe it.

380
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
My brother and I depended on each other for more than ten years.

381
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,160
He worked his way up from nothing to build a life for himself.

382
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,680
I don't believe someone like him would just commit suicide.

383
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,480
But

384
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,160
the police told me at the time

385
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,800
that my brother died by suicide.

386
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,000
They also provided

387
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,720
a diagnosis stating he had severe depression.

388
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,080
So I thought

389
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,480
maybe because he had no family in the country,

390
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,120
my brother was all alone.

391
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,520
He bore too much.

392
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,920
The pressure must have been overwhelming.

393
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,920
Alright.

394
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,320
We have no further questions.

395
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,280
Thank you for your cooperation.

396
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,080
Wait.

397
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,480
My brother didn't commit suicide.

398
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Right?

399
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,000
We are still investigating.

400
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,040
Officer Ran,

401
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,200
if my brother was a victim,

402
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,640
I hope this matter

403
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,440
can bring us a fair result.

404
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,160
Rest assured.

405
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,320
This is our duty.

406
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,120
Alright.

407
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,960
Thank you.

408
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Officer.

409
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,440
Shi Rong

410
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,160
Since she left the country at sixteen,

411
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,040
there have been no records of her re-entering.

412
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,000
What she just said

413
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,800
matches our investigation.

414
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Everything checks out.

415
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,400
It seems

416
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,840
there are others who want to avenge Shi Song.

417
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Come in.

418
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,800
Captain Ran,

419
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,840
this is based on the surveillance of Meng Shan,

420
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,960
a list of people

421
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,160
she has frequent contact with.

422
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,840
Okay.

423
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll be going now, Captain Ran.

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
Su Yun

425
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,080
Yun

426
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,440
How do you pronounce this character?

427
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,840
Yun.

428
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,960
Su Yun.

429
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Are you kidding me?

430
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,800
Why would I lie to you?

431
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,560
Yun.

432
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
Skilled in both literature and martial arts.

433
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,440
It also means wealth.

434
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,760
A beautiful blessing.

435
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,960
Su Yun.

436
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,440
Dizzy.

437
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,680
Dizzy all night.

438
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,800
That's a good name.

439
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,440
The list of people who had close contact with Meng Shan.

440
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,960
This Su Shan is good.

441
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,400
They're all men.

442
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
Where should I look?

443
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,880
Look here.

444
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400
This.

445
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,920
Su.

446
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,160
Yun.

447
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,880
Dizzy all night.

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,920
Wasn't he in

449
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,000
Xishan Village?

450
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,400
Wasn't he killed during the forced demolition?

451
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,720
Same name.

452
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,840
Such a rare surname.

453
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,600
And given name.

454
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,960
Can still have duplicates.

455
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,120
That's such a coincidence.

456
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,160
Haonan.

457
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,680
Pull up the information on Xishan Village.

458
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,200
Okay.

459
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,680
Check out this Su Yun.

460
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,120
Today

461
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,840
Why aren't you wearing your wig today?

462
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,120
Just wanted a different vibe.

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,520
Wearing that every time

464
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
gets boring.

465
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,360
Yes, master.

466
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,240
Su Yun

467
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,120
Born in 1974.

468
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,400
Lived in Xishan Village from birth until registering there in 2014.

469
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,360
Made a living as a farmer.

470
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
A genuine farmer.

471
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,120
One of the victims of the Xishan Village demolition accident.

472
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,360
However,

473
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,200
no death certificate was found.

474
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,600
The Su Yun that Meng Shan interacted with

475
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,360
runs a

476
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,400
large plastic surgery hospital called Zhaohe.

477
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,440
Eight years ago,

478
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,200
he changed his registration from rural to urban resident.

479
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,440
His registered address moved from Xishan Village

480
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,120
to the High-tech District's

481
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,960
Xincheng Jiayuan.

482
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
It's a high-end property.

483
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,040
In just a few years,

484
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,840
he went from

485
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,560
being a farmer to

486
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,840
the founder of a plastic surgery hospital.

487
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,320
That's an inspiring story.

488
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
The ID numbers of these two people named Su Yun

489
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,960
are identical.

490
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,240
He most likely stole

491
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
the identity of Su Yun from Xishan Village.

492
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,600
Sorry.

493
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,160
The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

494
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,280
Please try again later.

495
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
Director Su didn't answer the phone.

496
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,680
If it's convenient,

497
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,520
you can leave your contact information.

498
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,440
When Director Su returns,

499
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,680
I will definitely pass on the message.

500
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Do you know where he went?

501
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,360
I'm not sure about that.

502
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,680
Thank you.

503
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,960
Xiao Zhou,

504
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,320
Will Director Su come tomorrow?

505
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,760
There's a rhinoplasty surgery tomorrow.

506
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
I want Director Su to do the anesthesia.

507
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll confirm it for you as soon as possible.

508
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,880
Director Su's schedule.

509
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,920
Alright.

510
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,000
Contact me once it's confirmed.

511
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,320
Director Su can do anesthesia, right?

512
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,040
Yes.

513
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,800
Director Su used to be an anesthesiologist.

514
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,720
When our hospital's anesthesiologists

515
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,680
are too busy,

516
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,080
we always ask Director Su for help.

517
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,880
Where does he live?

518
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,320
Well,

519
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm not at liberty to disclose that.

520
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,440
Let me tell you,

521
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
he could be in serious danger right now.

522
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,640
Found him.

523
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,600
He's at Xincheng Jiayuan.

524
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,400
Head to Xincheng Jiayuan.

525
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,320
Director Zhao.

526
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
It's confirmed that Su Yun's identity was misused.

527
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,360
He is the anesthetist in the Shi Song case.

528
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,280
We're heading to his residence.

529
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,960
Conduct a search immediately.

530
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,480
Yes.

531
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,000
The door is open.

532
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,520
No one is here, or they're dead.

533
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,240
It's dangerous.

534
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,320
No one's here.

535
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,240
I want to order something.

536
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,720
What are you looking for?

537
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,720
You must have the wrong place.

538
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
I was referred by a friend.

539
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,920
A friend?

540
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,760
Who?

541
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,720
Boss Su.

542
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,760
Su Yun.

543
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,280
Oh, Boss Su.

544
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,160
I know him well.

545
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,200
Big client.

546
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,880
You want the Blue Bomb too, right?

547
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,600
It's expensive.

548
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
But the effect is definitely good.

549
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
As long as it works.

550
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,720
I'll pay extra.

551
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,560
No problem.

552
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,760
Go to the transformer box in the middle of Fuxin Middle Road.

553
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,960
I'll bring it to you.

554
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,800
Alright.

555
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,600
See you there.

556
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,760
Got it.

557
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Police

558
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,360
Stop

559
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,480
What are you guys doing?

560
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,520
Why are you running?

561
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,080
If you chase me, of course I'll run.

562
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,200
I'm not stupid.

563
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,080
About you selling illegal goods,

564
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,440
we'll talk about that later.

565
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,080
First, tell me

566
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,520
about you and Su Yun.

567
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,720
How did you do business?

568
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,440
He's my big client.

569
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,240
I always

570
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,200
deliver the goods to his door.

571
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,120
Where do you deliver them?

572
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,680
Xincheng Jiayuan 108.

573
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,880
Is that the only address?

574
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes, just this one.

575
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,320
Every time, I leave it at his door in the underground parking lot.

576
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,560
Give me his phone number.

577
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,200
That's the client's privacy.

578
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,120
Officer, what are you doing?

579
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,480
You took it.

580
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,000
You...

581
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,720
Aren't you not arresting me?

582
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
When did I say I wouldn't arrest you?

583
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,240
I said we'd talk about it later.

584
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,840
Someone will come to pick you up soon.

585
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,120
You'll go to the station.

586
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,120
Get your phone back there.

587
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,520
Man,

588
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,440
you're really not playing fair.

589
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,240
At Su Yun's place,

590
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,400
there's a high chance there's

591
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
a hidden, separated space.

592
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
It can only be accessed from the underground garage.

593
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,360
Where is the person?

594
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,840
Meng Shan, Meng Shan.

595
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
Meng Shan.

596
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,480
You watch him.

597
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know.

598
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,360
It's Meng Shan.

599
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Director Su.

600
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,200
Should I be calling you Lu Junfei?
