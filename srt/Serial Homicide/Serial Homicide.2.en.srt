1
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,480
Brother

2
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
Brother, brother, brother

3
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
Brother, wake up, wake up

4
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,160
Found it

5
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,000
You two, rare guests

6
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,640
No

7
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Isn't your head like a file cabinet?

8
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,280
You still need to come to me?

9
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,520
A good memory is not as reliable as a bad pen

10
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
In that regard, you're just like Old Ran

11
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,640
The soy milk's gone cold

12
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,680
You rascal

13
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,480
You snatched that steamed bun and still complain it's burnt

14
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm not complaining

15
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,800
I like it cold, it's good for cooling down

16
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,120
Brother

17
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Sun Bin was suspected of rape three months ago

18
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
He was released later due to insufficient evidence

19
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,280
It's him.

20
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,880
Are you okay, bro?

21
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
What could possibly happen?

22
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm not dying. Take it.

23
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,120
Let's go.

24
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,560
My fried dough stick.

25
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880
My guess was right.

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
The passwords for these two emails

27
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,000
are arranged symmetrically.

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,040
It's an improved encryption of the Polybius cipher.

29
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
They changed the four 5x5 matrices

30
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
into 6x6 matrices.

31
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Then they added numbers.

32
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,440
As long as we find the pattern in the numbers,

33
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,960
we can decode the garbled text.

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,080
Right, we'll design the corresponding code

35
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
and algorithm

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
to find the pattern in these numbers.

37
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Then, based on these patterns,

38
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
we can form a string

39
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,640
or several strings of letters.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
First, determine the language family of these passwords.

41
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,120
Then use the language family to crack the passwords.

42
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,720
Network admin.

43
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,200
Have you cracked that code yet?

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,080
Cheng has made a major breakthrough.

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
We'll crack it soon.

46
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,920
We'll crack it soon.

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
So, you haven't cracked it yet.

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Ranyue.

49
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Get me a girl.

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,760
What did you say?

51
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,640
I need to go to a woman's house.

52
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
There's a girl I need to question.

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,040
Perfect, Sanyuan, you go.

54
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,960
What?

55
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,520
What are we doing, Captain?

56
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,760
Taking you to do something useful.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,960
Sanyuan, go with Jun to investigate someone.

58
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Heading out for fieldwork? Got it.

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Grab a youtiao later.

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,960
Take it to Old Zhang in the archives room.

61
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,920
You two should bring one as well.

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
We're eating.

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,000
Xiao Wang, take it to Old Zhang in the archives room.

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,760
Cheng Feng, Tang Jun speaks without thinking.

65
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,720
Don't mind him.

66
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Xiao Pang.

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
Run the 07A code.

68
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,120
Try to find a pattern.

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,840
Yes.

70
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,560
The Yan Zi 101 algorithm is yours to handle.

71
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,040
At home.

72
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,840
May I ask who you're looking for?

73
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,160
We're from the Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

74
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,840
Are you Hu Yi?

75
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Yes, I am.

76
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Is there something you need?

77
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,440
We're here to ask you a few questions.

78
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,480
Would you like some fruit?

79
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
No, thank you.

80
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,920
Have some.

81
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,080
It's really good.

82
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
Well, thank you.

83
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,320
Miss Hu, this might be a bit abrupt.

84
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,320
But the reason we're here today

85
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,400
is mainly to ask you about

86
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
your relationship with

87
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Sun Bin.

88
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,640
your relationship with Sun Bin.

89
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Is Sun Bin dead?

90
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,680
This morning's news—

91
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Didn't you see it?

92
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,480
I never watch the news.

93
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
I know he's dead.

94
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
I killed him.

95
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,080
But

96
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,240
I didn't use this knife.

97
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
This knife is fine for cutting fruit.

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,960
But for cutting flesh,

99
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
it's not fast enough.

100
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
I cut Sun Bin open.

101
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,520
I cut him into several pieces.

102
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
Put them in the meat grinder.

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
All cut up.

104
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
Have some fruit.

105
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Thank you.

106
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,280
I killed him.

107
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,760
I strangled him with a rope.

108
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,880
He became weak.

109
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,480
I pushed him

110
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,880
into the water.

111
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Pushed into the water.

112
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,480
The water is so cold.

113
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,440
The water is so cold.

114
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,440
It's raining.

115
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
It's raining.

116
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,560
Let me help you cut the fruit.

117
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,400
Come.

118
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,280
It's raining.

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
Give me the knife.

120
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,520
He wants to kill me.

121
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,520
He wants to kill me, he wants to kill me.

122
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,680
Don't be afraid.

123
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,560
No one will kill you.

124
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
Don't come over.

125
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
Don't come over.

126
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,760
Don't be afraid.

127
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,640
I killed him.

128
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,240
No one is going to kill you.

129
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,040
I killed him, I killed him.

130
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,440
Xiaoyi.

131
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
Xiaoyi.

132
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,200
Are you okay?

133
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,280
Mom is here, don't be scared, come.

134
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,680
Who are you?

135
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
What do you want?

136
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
Sorry, we're the police.

137
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,520
Police.

138
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680
Where are your credentials?

139
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,080
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

140
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
What's wrong with the police?

141
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,640
Can the police just break into private homes?

142
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,480
We showed our credentials when we came in.

143
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,240
She was fine at that time.

144
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Then suddenly she became like this.

145
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,280
Xiaoyi, Xiaoyi.

146
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
Xiaoyi, Xiaoyi.

147
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
Who is the patient's family member?

148
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
Doctor, I am her mother.

149
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
What are you all doing here?

150
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,520
Doctor.

151
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,520
We are police officers.

152
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
Police need to leave too.

153
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
Only the family member stays.

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
Doctor, actually we are—

155
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,720
This is a hospital room.

156
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,360
A place for treatment.

157
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,080
If you have business, go find the right person.

158
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,200
Leave.

159
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Everyone out. Out, out.

160
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Come out, come out.

161
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,880
What’s going on?

162
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Don’t cause trouble for others.

163
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,440
She was a bit shaken.

164
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
Shaken by what?

165
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,520
She was frightened.

166
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
If anything happens to Hu Yi,

167
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,360
I will definitely file a complaint against you.

168
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,280
Go ahead, complain about me.

169
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Fine.

170
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,160
I’ll take you.

171
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Ask Auntie to come with me to the station.

172
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,560
Why should we?

173
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
To cooperate with the police investigation.

174
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
Isn’t that the right thing to do?

175
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,440
Auntie.

176
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
What did the doctor say?

177
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,920
Nothing serious.

178
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,160
Just a bit shaken.

179
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,960
You’re lucky.

180
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Lucky.

181
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,760
Thank you.

182
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
Bro, I'm going to get some documents.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,720
Go ahead.

184
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,880
Xiaoqiu.

185
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
Cheng Feng, what are you doing here?

186
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,880
I'm here at the precinct to assist with a case.

187
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
You know each other?

188
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
My fiancée.

189
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,960
Ren Xiaoqiu.

190
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
Fiancée?

191
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,880
One of us, then.

192
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,720
What's going on?

193
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,080
Fiancée.

194
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,560
Nice.

195
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
Ren Xiaoqiu.

196
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,960
And you are?

197
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm Ran Yue.

198
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,840
We know each other, too.

199
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
We're all on the same side.

200
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Auntie, do you know each other?

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,760
You're not one of them, are you?

202
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,440
Zhang Haonan.

203
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,680
Did you bring it?

204
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,520
Alright, alright, bro.

205
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Bring Auntie and come with me.

206
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Auntie, this way.

207
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,680
Here's the situation.

208
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,760
It's about Sun Bin's case.

209
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,560
We need to talk to Hu Yi about some details.

210
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,040
And get some information from her mother.

211
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
If you know them well,

212
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,480
please provide as much information as you can.

213
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,640
Okay.

214
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,280
Yifei.

215
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,640
Here.

216
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,400
You and Dakuan, come talk in my office.

217
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,440
Yes.

218
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,320
It's fine.

219
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,160
Go ahead.

220
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,040
It's all my fault.

221
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,080
I was having dinner with Ran Da.

222
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,360
I stepped out to buy a pack of cigarettes.

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,280
I heard gunshots.

224
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,520
I ran out to check.

225
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Ran Da was already lying on the ground.

226
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Don't cover him.

227
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Don't cover him.

228
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,960
Don't cover my dad.

229
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,880
Ran Yue.

230
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,120
Don't cover my dad.

231
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
Don't cover him, don't cover him.

232
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,320
I said don't cover him.

233
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,760
Sister-in-law.

234
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,920
Sister-in-law.

235
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,320
Sister-in-law, be careful.

236
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Deputy Zhao.

237
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,080
Captain Ran Haochuan's death is related to Gao Ang.

238
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Is there enough evidence?

239
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,720
Lao Gao

240
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Come here for a moment.

241
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,760
Gao Ang

242
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
After examination,

243
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,480
the bullet taken from Captain Ran Haochuan's body

244
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,680
came from your issued gun.

245
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,240
We are now summoning you according to the law.

246
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,080
My gun...

247
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,040
What on earth is going on?

248
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,960
Say something.

249
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,280
My gun...

250
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,560
My gun went missing a couple of days ago.

251
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,960
I was talking about this with Captain Ran over dinner.

252
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Gao Ang

253
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
Why? What exactly happened?

254
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,160
Ran Yue

255
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,280
Say something.

256
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
Why didn't you report the missing gun?

257
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,960
Say something.

258
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,240
Take him away.

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
Say something.

261
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Say something.

262
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,040
Auntie

263
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,400
Sorry, please have some water first.

264
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
It was all a misunderstanding just now.

265
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Please don't be nervous.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,520
We just want to ask you about some things.

267
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,960
Just a few simple questions.

268
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
Go ahead and ask.

269
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,520
Hello.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,920
Your daughter—

271
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
What is her relationship with Sun Bin?

272
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,280
What relationship could there be?

273
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,600
My daughter has nothing to do with that animal.

274
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,360
She doesn't know him.

275
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,440
She doesn't know him.

276
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,320
They don't know each other at all.

277
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,800
A few of Hu Yi's classmates know Sun Bin.

278
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,320
A few months ago,

279
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,720
those classmates invited her

280
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,520
to attend Sun Bin's birthday party.

281
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Hu Yi couldn't resist their persistent persuasion and went.

282
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,720
Unexpectedly,

283
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,000
no one expected that Sun Bin, that animal,

284
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,200
actually put drugs in Xiao Yi's drink.

285
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,560
Here.

286
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,880
Drink.

287
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,960
Take it.

288
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,760
Have a sip.

289
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,320
Come on.

290
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
Drink.

291
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
Come on.

292
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,880
Drink.

293
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,080
Then he dragged her to the apartment

294
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,320
and raped Xiao Yi.

295
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
Xiao Yi.

296
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Xiao Yi.

297
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
What's wrong?

298
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,760
What's wrong, child?

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,560
Later, we called the police.

300
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,960
The forensic doctor examined Xiao Yi.

301
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
The police also arrested Sun Bin.

302
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
At that time, Xiao Yi was interviewed by a reporter.

303
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,240
The incident was reported truthfully.

304
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,160
Back then, to protect her,

305
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,880
I used a pseudonym.

306
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,360
At first, the evidence was solid.

307
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,400
She had a good chance of winning the case.

308
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,840
That jerk was definitely going to jail.

309
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
But who could have expected

310
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,880
the temptation of money would be so great?

311
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,840
The two girls who went to the birthday party with her

312
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,960
suddenly changed their statements in court.

313
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,600
They said Hu Yi set up Sun Bin

314
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
to seduce him for breakup money.

315
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,600
In the end,

316
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,440
Sun Bin was found not guilty of rape.

317
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,680
My report

318
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,440
was also labeled as fake news

319
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,160
and forcibly removed from the entire internet.

320
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
The Sun family spent a lot of money

321
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,920
to have reports use Hu Yi's real name.

322
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
They spread rumors online that she tried to seduce for money and failed,

323
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,240
and then falsely accused Sun Bin.

324
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,440
They just open their mouths,

325
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,120
and say all kinds of filthy things.

326
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,520
They insulted my daughter online.

327
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,440
That's how Hu Yi was driven mad by them.

328
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,720
I killed him.

329
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,320
He deserved it.

330
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,400
He'll never bully me again.

331
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,720
I killed him.

332
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,200
Killed him.

333
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,680
Darn it.

334
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,560
He deserved it.

335
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
He won't bully me anymore.

336
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,120
Won't bully me anymore.

337
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,160
Won't bully me anymore.

338
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,160
She is a victim of power and public opinion.

339
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,720
But why should she be the victim?

340
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
Just because she's beautiful?

341
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
Because she rejected him.

342
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
She hurt his pride.

343
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,640
Does she deserve to suffer for that?

344
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,800
Later,

345
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,040
Whenever I had time, I would go see her.

346
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,480
As time went by,

347
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,840
we became friends.

348
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
Reporter Ren is a good person.

349
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,840
Thank you.

350
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,720
September 9th.

351
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
From 8 to 11 p.m.

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,080
What were you doing?

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,880
At the house where I work part-time.

354
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,600
They were going on a trip today.

355
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,840
So the lady of the house asked me last night

356
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,240
to help them pack.

357
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,880
I worked three extra hours.

358
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,920
I didn't finish until 10:30.

359
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
Because the weather was bad,

360
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,640
they paid me for an extra hour.

361
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,840
What about Hu Yi?

362
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,280
You don't suspect Xiao Yi of murder, do you?

363
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
Impossible.

364
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
She's just talking nonsense.

365
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,160
She imagines killing this person every day.

366
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,200
But she could never actually kill someone.

367
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,800
Xiaoyi, she...

368
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,600
She's actually very timid,

369
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,040
a very cowardly child.

370
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,800
Where was Hu Yi last night?

371
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
Now, every day when I go to work,

372
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,960
I always

373
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,840
leave Xiaoyi with our neighbor, Grandma Chen.

374
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,160
I ask her to look after her for me.

375
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,000
That day, I

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,920
didn't pick her up until after 10:30.

377
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,320
Grandma Chen can vouch for this.

378
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,320
Officer,

379
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,760
um...

380
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
How did Sun Bin die?

381
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
Why are you asking about that?

382
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm just saying, someone like him...

383
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,160
He—he—he's not even human, he never did anything decent.

384
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,560
He must have had a lot of enemies.

385
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,640
He deserved to die, he had it coming.

386
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,960
Officer, can I go now?

387
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,320
I still have a job to do.

388
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
It's an assignment from my company.

389
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,640
If I don't go, I'll get fined.

390
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,880
That's fine.

391
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,160
Please check the statement in a moment.

392
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,160
We'll print it out for you.

393
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,840
Okay.

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,840
No problem.

395
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,360
Just sign it and you can leave.

396
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
Okay, thank you.

397
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,360
You're welcome.

398
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,120
Thank you, too.

399
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,960
Master

400
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,760
Master

401
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,720
Take a look

402
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,160
How's my new camera?

403
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,080
It's good

404
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,120
It's clear, see?

405
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,360
Take a photo of me

406
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Why take a photo? I won't

407
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Just one, just one

408
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,960
I don't want to

409
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,840
Come on, just one

410
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,240
Just like this

411
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,560
How about "Serve the People"?

412
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,440
That's good

413
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,440
Qiangzi

414
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,440
Take a photo of the two of us

415
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,760
Come on, Master, come here

416
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Fix your clothes

417
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,320
Alright

418
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,320
Look sharp

419
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Make sure it's a good one

420
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
Fifteen minutes ago, our station received a tip from the public.

421
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,040
A homicide occurred on the twelfth floor of Wuma Building.

422
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,600
We can now see

423
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
that there are already many onlookers at the scene.

424
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,760
The police have also carried the victim's body out of the building.

425
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,000
It will likely be sent for an urgent autopsy.

426
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,280
According to reports,

427
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,480
the deceased was

428
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,720
Sun Bin, the owner of four apartments in the building.

429
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,440
Sun Bin was the only son of Sun Ruhai, a well-known real estate developer in Luzhou.

430
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
He was the only son of Sun Ruhai.

431
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
He truly grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth.

432
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,000
Sun Ruhai.

433
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
How do you know him?

434
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,520
He made his fortune through a demolition company.

435
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,160
Now he has established himself in Luzhou.

436
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,760
He has built his own business empire.

437
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,240
A childhood friend.

438
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,560
Not long ago, Sun Bin was suspected of rape.

439
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,360
Boss,

440
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,960
give me another serving of the same noodles he's having.

441
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,560
Add a fried egg and a tofu skin.

442
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,760
And an order of chicken feet.

443
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,160
Alright.

444
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
You're really not shy about it.

445
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,800
Whenever you come to our place for a meal,

446
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,320
have you ever been polite?

447
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Come on, we're not kids anymore.

448
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,120
Why are you still hung up on the past?

449
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,560
Between the two of us, who's really the one who can't let go of the past?

450
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
No matter what happened before, we have to face it.

451
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,160
Ajun,

452
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,040
not catching the killer

453
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,160
can't be your excuse for giving up now.

454
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,120
I still have my mom.

455
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,560
I can't get stuck in a rut.

456
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,560
If I were like you every day,

457
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,640
how would my mom be able to go on?

458
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Have I ever blamed you?

459
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,520
Yes.

460
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,480
Your attitude is blaming me.

461
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,800
You blame me for being cold-hearted.

462
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,640
Acting like nothing happened after your own father died.

463
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,640
Right?

464
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,240
Thank you.

465
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,920
Enough.

466
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Stop being so sentimental.

467
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
Hurry up and eat your noodles.

468
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,520
All these years,

469
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
I've never given up

470
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
on finding that missing gun.

471
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,600
Why investigate it?

472
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,200
Why not just investigate Gao Ang directly?

473
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,560
We're all detectives.

474
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,200
Can't you tell if someone's telling the truth?

475
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,920
Everyone pretends not to hear or see.

476
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,600
There are so many suspicious points right there.

477
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
And you just pretend not to see them, right?

478
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,040
I've said it long ago.

479
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,840
Did anyone listen to me?

480
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,360
About Uncle Gao's case,

481
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,560
his colleagues already investigated it back then.

482
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,120
He also served three years in prison.

483
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,960
He's already paid the price for his mistake.

484
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,040
Is three years enough?

485
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,960
My mentor lost his life.

486
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
His life.

487
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,960
Time and space online will continue.

488
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,600
This was at 10 p.m. tonight

489
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,720
during the rebroadcast of "Time Online" on the general channel.

490
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,160
The perpetrator hacked into the TV station's broadcast system

491
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
and forcibly inserted this video.

492
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,800
The video lasted less than a minute,

493
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,360
but since the staff on duty had never dealt with

494
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,160
this kind of situation before,

495
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
the video was directly

496
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,160
broadcast to all citizens of Luyu City.

497
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,160
The woman in the video

498
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,840
is the host of "Time Online"

499
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,960
and the program director, Yin Hui.

500
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,200
Just like in the Sun Bin case,

501
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,760
the perpetrator deliberately placed a clock

502
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
to prove to us that this was a live broadcast.

503
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,200
After the incident, we tracked Yin Hui's phone,

504
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,240
but there was no signal.

505
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,920
We also checked her residence, but no one was there.

506
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,360
Based on the Sun Bin case,

507
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,080
her life may be in danger.

508
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,840
Ding Yifei, Da Kuan

509
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,360
Here.

510
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,120
Go to the TV station and see if there are any new leads.

511
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes.

512
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Ran Yue, Tang Jun

513
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,400
Here.

514
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Go to the TV station and Yin Hui's home

515
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,560
and collect all nearby surveillance footage.

516
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Yes.

517
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,240
She has been

518
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
pretty normal at the station lately.

519
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Who is this person?

520
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,160
Our news department reporter, Ren Xiaoqiu.

521
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,520
At 8 p.m. on October 29th,

522
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
where did Yin Hui go after that?

523
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
She probably got off work.

524
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,760
What did they do after 8 p.m.?

525
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,360
Who else was there?

526
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,720
No one else.

527
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:48,800
How is it?

528
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,760
It's been solved.

529
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Cheng Tou

530
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,000
What does this mean?

531
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,120
It's French.

532
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,720
The translated meaning is

533
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,160
Legend has it that there was no fire on Earth.

534
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,320
People lived in great hardship back then.

535
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,880
I want to take you away from suffering.

536
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
At midnight.

537
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,560
This sentence is the original French version from a Greek myth.

538
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,800
It's hinting at Yin Hui.

539
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,160
I've checked the information.

540
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,520
Eight years ago, she was the host of a late-night show.

541
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,320
This sentence was their slogan.

542
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,320
At midnight.

543
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,600
Twelve o'clock.

544
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,640
The time of the crime.

545
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,960
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team

546
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,320
Captain

547
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,960
What happened?

548
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,120
An apartment in Xinhua Lane caught fire.

549
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,400
Someone died in the fire.

550
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,600
It seems to be

551
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,160
Yin Hui
