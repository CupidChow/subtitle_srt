1
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
Do these two know each other?

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
No, they don't.

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,760
Take another good look.

4
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,760
I really don't know them.

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,960
Who are these people?

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Captain Ran.

7
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,000
How's it going?

8
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,160
This Huang Huahua

9
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,280
is the most relentless gossip reporter in Luzhou.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,440
He's a real old hand.

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,720
We can't get anything out of him.

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
According to Erinius'

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,760
logic of exchange murders,

14
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
there's at least one more killer now

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,000
getting ready to avenge Song De.

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
But judging by the current situation,

17
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
An Keyi

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,560
doesn't seem like the next person to commit a crime.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Huang Huahua says he doesn't know Song De.

20
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,840
But based on what we know so far,

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,400
we really can't find any connection

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,280
between these two.

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Captain Ran.

24
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,680
An Keyi's mother and Lawyer Na Chu are here.

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,280
They said Huang Huahua agreed to sign a letter of understanding.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
They want to take An Keyi away.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,920
Why is it her again?

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,600
Keyi.

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Keyi.

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,640
About what happened today,

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
shouldn't there be an explanation?

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,240
Are you speaking as a mother

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
or as a manager?

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,480
Keyi.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,360
How can you talk to your mother like that?

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
If you're speaking as my mom,

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
let me tell you,

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm fine.

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,320
Don't worry.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,280
If you're speaking as my agent,

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,680
what's going on with the case?

42
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll have Sister Chu explain everything to you.

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
Any losses I caused the company because of this,

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,280
I'll pay for them myself.

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,040
Don't you get it yet?

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,000
This is a critical time for your career.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,320
If you don't make a transition in the next year or two,

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,280
in a few years,

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
younger boys will take your opportunities.

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,400
I've told you this many times.

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,840
And I've told you many times too.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,720
I don't want to do this anymore.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,880
I want to study abroad.

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm not stopping you from studying.

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,080
But—

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
But now isn't the right time.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,480
Do you understand?

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,160
In your eyes, it's never the right time.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
You're just like that old jerk.

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm just your money-making tool.

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Keyi.

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Keyi.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,880
Sorry about that.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Sorry you had to see that.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,160
It's okay.

66
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,040
Don't be too upset.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
Keyi,

68
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
he's just a bit childish.

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,200
No,

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
I'm just doing this for his own good.

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
You saw it yourself.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,920
Calm down.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
You know,

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,960
it's been hard for the two of us to get this far.

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,600
It hasn't been easy.

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Ke Yi

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
Ke Yi

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
Ke Yi

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Ke Yi

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Hello.

81
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,480
Who are you looking for?

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,280
Huang Huahua.

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,680
Do you have an appointment with President Huang?

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,800
Huang Huahua.

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,880
Sister Xiang.

86
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
I couldn't stop her.

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
It's fine, you can leave now.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,120
What brings you here?

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,960
Where is An Keyi?

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
Why are you looking for me if you want An Keyi?

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,880
Stop pretending with me.

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Keyi's phone location

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
shows he's here right now.

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
Huang Huahua.

95
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,320
You've been following our Keyi lately.

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,400
What are you trying to do?

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
Where exactly are you hiding him?

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,520
Sister Xiang.

99
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
If you're here as a guest,

100
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,280
you're welcome.

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
But if you're here

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,400
to make trouble,

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,200
then I'll have to ask you to leave.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Fine.

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,320
You're not handing him over, are you?

106
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm calling the police.

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,240
Thank you for your hard work.

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Captain Ran.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
Xiang Linlin reported that

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,560
An Keyi has been kidnapped.

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,560
Huang Huahua.

112
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,640
Huang Huahua kidnapped my son.

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,680
I see.

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,920
Let me go over everything from the beginning for you.

115
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,000
First of all,

116
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,440
the news of An Wenju's death

117
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,640
has been kept strictly under wraps.

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,800
We were afraid the news would spread.

119
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,960
and cause negative public opinion.

120
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,440
which could affect Keyi.

121
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,200
But this Huang Huahua

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
has been following Keyi recently.

123
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,600
I suspect

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Huang Huahua found out about this.

125
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,480
So he tried to blackmail Keyi.

126
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
Keyi refused.

127
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,120
So he kidnapped him.

128
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,720
That's basically what happened.

129
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
Do you have any evidence?

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,080
Ke Yi's phone location

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,000
is right here.

132
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,160
This...

133
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,840
So,

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,440
you...

135
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,720
monitoring An Ke Yi?

136
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,400
He...

137
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
He—he's not being monitored.

138
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Mainly,

139
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
it's because of our family situation.

140
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,080
So Ke Yi

141
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,520
has always been

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,480
rather withdrawn since childhood.

143
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,000
Later, he became an entertainer.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,040
That made his stress even worse.

145
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,440
So he has some

146
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,720
bipolar issues.

147
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
I...

148
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,840
What I just told you

149
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
you'll keep it confidential, right?

150
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I was also worried about his safety.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
That's why I installed a tracker.

152
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,200
So,

153
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,120
I usually know where he goes.

154
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,600
Captain Ran,

155
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
An Keyi's phone has been found.

156
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
What did I say?

157
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
It's him, it's Huang Huahua.

158
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
An Keyi's phone

159
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,640
was found in your company's restroom.

160
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
Can you explain this?

161
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,720
Yes, yes.

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,920
Yesterday, An Keyi

163
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,760
came to our place.

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
Maybe

165
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,720
he dropped it here.

166
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,080
Why did he come here?

167
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
To discuss cooperation.

168
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,440
To make friends.

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,280
Ms. Xiang Linlin said

170
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,320
you extorted An Keyi.

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,280
Is that true?

172
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,080
Stop joking.

173
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
He's a big celebrity.

174
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm just a small-time reporter.

175
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,400
Why would I

176
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
extort him?

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,440
Besides,

178
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
doing something illegal like that

179
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,920
I wouldn't do it, right?

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Huang Huahua,

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,080
so far,

182
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,200
you're the last person

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,040
we know who saw An Keyi.

184
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,640
And his phone was found here with you.

185
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,520
We can take you in at any time.

186
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,960
Let's have a proper talk.

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
No, no, no.

188
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Wait, look at me,

189
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,200
I still have a lot to deal with.

190
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,240
Alright.

191
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,280
You go to Donghai Hotel.

192
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,840
Look for a guest with the last name Wang.

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,960
Named

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,600
Wang Yang.

195
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,640
That's all I know.

196
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
Who is it?

197
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
Hello, waiter.

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
Are you Wang Yang?

199
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,840
You are...

200
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,960
Police.

201
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,600
Since you all saw it today,

202
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
I have nothing to hide.

203
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,280
There is some bad blood between me and Huang Huahua.

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Keyi

205
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
You are

206
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,400
Teacher Keyi, you really are so important that you forget things easily.

207
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm Huang Huahua.

208
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
When I returned to Luzhou two years ago,

209
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I interviewed you.

210
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
Is there something you need?

211
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,080
I came to see you on purpose this time.

212
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,040
I heard your agency contract is about to expire.

213
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
I wonder if you're interested

214
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,680
in working with me.

215
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,280
Sorry,

216
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
I don't plan to change companies.

217
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,600
Thank you for your kindness.

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,200
I've met Director An.

219
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,920
Who?

220
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,920
Your father.

221
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,360
Director An Wenju.

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,200
He was the one who contacted me.

223
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,120
You know,

224
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,400
in Luzhou,

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
among entertainment reporters,

226
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,240
I have a bit of a reputation.

227
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Your father and I

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,520
talked a lot about you.

229
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Especially

230
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,920
Designer Wang.

231
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,200
Why do you want to collude with that old man?

232
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,800
Collude?

233
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,320
Don't say it like that.

234
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,440
If someone takes a photo of you like this,

235
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
it wouldn't look good.

236
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
As for Director An,

237
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
he just wants more money.

238
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
But I'm different.

239
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,240
I have a more long-term vision.

240
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,160
If you work with me,

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
don't be fooled by how small my company is right now.

242
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
I'll do everything I can to promote you.

243
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll give you the best resources.

244
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
It won't be worse than what you have now.

245
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,320
There's money to be made.

246
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
We can all make money together.

247
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,000
Think it over.

248
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,520
As long as you agree,

249
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,960
as for Director An,

250
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,520
I'll handle it for you.

251
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
These past few days

252
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,120
I did see that jerk An Wenju recently

253
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
You jerk, you scumbag

254
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,280
You brat

255
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,960
You dare hit me

256
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm your father

257
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,360
Are you even fit to be a father

258
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,000
All these years giving you money wasn't enough

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Now you go and expose my secrets

260
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,160
You forced me

261
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
You forced me

262
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,240
Let go of me

263
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,040
Look at you, you punk

264
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
You're so rich

265
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
I asked you for two million

266
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
You wouldn't even give me money to open a hospital

267
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,760
I had to find my own way

268
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,560
Huang Huahua

269
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
Huang Huahua can give it to me

270
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Right

271
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,400
You're shameless

272
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Don't hit me

273
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm telling you

274
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
There's surveillance at my house

275
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,280
You dare hit me

276
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
A celebrity son wants to hit his own father

277
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,880
Do you believe I'll expose your secrets

278
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,600
Do you believe it

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,240
If you dare to expose this,

280
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,240
I'll go down with you.

281
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,960
Isn't it money you want?

282
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,400
I'll give it to you.

283
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
You deserved those punches too.

284
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,040
It's all because of Huang Huahua.

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,320
He threatened Keyi, saying he'd expose me.

286
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
That's why Keyi had a conflict with him.

287
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,400
What do you mean?

288
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
You're the person involved, aren't you?

289
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,960
Before I publish this,

290
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,480
of course I have to let you see it first.

291
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,600
What are you trying to do?

292
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,520
Keyi,

293
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,680
about switching companies,

294
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,280
have you thought it over?

295
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,560
If you ruin my reputation,

296
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,480
even if you sign me,

297
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320
you still won't make any money.

298
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
You don't even get that?

299
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,480
Times have changed.

300
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
Controversy and gossip

301
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,400
make things more talked about.

302
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,160
Other agencies don't dare to sign you,

303
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,280
but I do.

304
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
When the time comes,

305
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
I'll package you and Designer Wang

306
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
and launch you together.

307
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,280
That way you'll get even more popular.

308
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,360
And make more money.

309
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm warning you,

310
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,280
he's not in the industry, don't drag him into this.

311
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,560
What's this about in or out of the industry?

312
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,080
Aren't we all the same?

313
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,920
What are you doing?

314
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I'll kill you.

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,680
Police! Don't move!

316
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,360
Police! Don't move!

317
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,320
Be honest.

318
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,120
It wasn't me.

319
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,640
Walk honestly.

320
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,000
Go.

321
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:38,800
I didn't do it.

322
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,160
Go.

323
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,640
I don't know what case you're investigating.

324
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,400
And I don't know what you're suspecting me of.

325
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,120
I do hate An Wenju.

326
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
But I didn't want him to die.

327
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
After all, he's my father.

328
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
No matter what,

329
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,200
if you have evidence,

330
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,400
then arrest me.

331
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
If not,

332
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,880
please stop bothering me.

333
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,760
And don't bother Wang Yang either.

334
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
He has nothing to do with any of this.

335
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,280
Last night,

336
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
why did you go to Huang Huahua's company?

337
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,880
To negotiate with him.

338
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,960
I wanted to get the photos back.

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,560
But Yi has already transferred two million

340
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,360
to An Wenju's account.

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
If you don't believe me, you can check.

342
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,480
He had no reason to kill anyone.

343
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,640
No reason to give up

344
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,200
the good life he has now

345
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
to do something that harms others and doesn't benefit himself.

346
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,280
What are you doing?

347
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,120
I'm getting rid of trouble.

348
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,320
Getting rid of what? Stand properly.

349
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,080
An Keyi, you're not behaving.

350
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
You're ruining your own future.

351
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
It's all because you're hanging out with this little brat, right?

352
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,320
I asked you to make clothes for him.

353
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,920
But you're pushing him into the fire.

354
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,520
Ms. Xiang, Ms. Xiang.

355
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,160
Ms. Xiang, please control your emotions.

356
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,160
Officer Ran.

357
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,640
Today I accompanied Ms. Xiang here.

358
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,400
We want to voluntarily hand over

359
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
An Keyi

360
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,080
at An Wenju's house

361
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,120
a surveillance video recording card we obtained.

362
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,320
I guarantee that the contents of this card

363
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
have not been

364
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
edited or technically altered in any way.

365
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,720
I believe

366
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,840
you have the means to verify this.

367
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,520
In this video

368
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,440
An Keyi is being blackmailed by An Wenju

369
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,560
and goes to confront An Wenju

370
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,360
and the entire conflict is recorded.

371
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
We're submitting this evidence today

372
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,600
in hopes of proving our innocence.

373
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,560
Also,

374
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,720
we are willing to cooperate

375
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,960
with the police investigation.

376
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,960
As for me,

377
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,560
I've always been straightforward.

378
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
Ke Yi's status is special.

379
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
Recent events have caused quite a stir.

380
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
So I sincerely ask

381
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,680
that you all

382
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,920
keep today's matter

383
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,240
strictly confidential.

384
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,240
Because this will

385
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,200
seriously affect Ke Yi's work

386
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
and the agency's interests.

387
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,120
Understood.

388
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,840
We understand.

389
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
This isn't just An Keyi's privacy.

390
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
It's also part of our case.

391
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,120
We won't disclose it to the public.

392
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,880
That's good.

393
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
That's good, that's good.

394
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Officer Ran,

395
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,680
may I take An Keyi

396
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,120
and this gentleman with me?

397
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,920
You may.

398
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Ms. Xiang,

399
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,920
your bag.

400
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,640
Ms. Xiang,

401
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,440
you've helped An Keyi plan his career.

402
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,120
His career is very successful.

403
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
I think

404
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,040
you must be very proud of that.

405
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
But

406
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,360
don't forget

407
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
An Keyi is your son.

408
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
He already has a father like that.

409
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,920
I think what he needs now is a mother

410
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,040
not a manager.

411
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Officer Ran,

412
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,560
this probably isn't within your job scope.

413
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,600
Ke Yi,

414
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,280
let's go.

415
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,120
Officer Ran

416
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Thank you on Ke Yi's behalf.

417
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,680
This gentleman

418
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,200
Mr. Wang

419
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,160
Please put this away quickly.

420
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,560
Let me do it.

421
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,120
Stop looking.

422
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,840
Let's go.

423
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
Is it okay to leave this here?

424
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Okay.

425
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680
You two can sit wherever you like.

426
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,040
Come over and have some water.

427
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,280
Thank you.

428
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
No, thank you.

429
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
You even helped me tidy up.

430
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Let's keep things separate.

431
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,960
You want to ask about Song De, right?

432
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,440
That's right.

433
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,040
This is my son.

434
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,200
His name is Liangliang.

435
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,360
Family of Xue Liangliang.

436
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,200
Th-th-this...

437
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,480
Xue Liangliang's mother's match is not compatible.

438
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,200
Then...

439
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,440
What about me?

440
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,320
What's your name?

441
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,480
Xue Erlin.

442
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,120
Xue Erlin.

443
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,360
Let me put it this way.

444
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,800
For acute lymphoblastic leukemia bone marrow matching,

445
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,560
the most likely matches are immediate family members.

446
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,360
Check if the patient has any siblings.

447
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,240
If not,

448
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,640
see if you can find the patient's

449
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,480
biological father.

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,680
Wh-what...

451
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,480
What father?

452
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,920
Biological father.

453
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
Later, you should go and register.

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
Check the bone marrow matching database

455
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,600
to see if there are any possible donors.

456
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,720
However,

457
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,680
the success rate for that match will be much lower.

458
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,560
If you need anything,

459
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,920
come to the department office and find me.

460
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,360
Erlin.

461
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
There's someone

462
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,880
who might be able to save Liangliang.

463
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,240
Who?

464
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,600
Song.

465
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
Song De.

466
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,720
You...

467
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,520
You...

468
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
Liangliang is sick.

469
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Nurse

470
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,280
How is my son?

471
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
The patient has stopped breathing on his own.

472
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,200
We are trying to resuscitate him.

473
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
What? How could this happen?

474
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Didn't you say the match was successful?

475
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,960
We are trying to save him.

476
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,080
Please, I'm begging you.

477
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,200
Nurse, please save my son.

478
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,240
He's only eight years old.

479
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,360
Please, please save him.

480
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Don't waste any time.

481
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,760
We will do our best.

482
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,040
Please, save him.

483
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,040
Save him.

484
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,840
Please save him.

485
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,600
He's only eight.

486
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Please save him.

487
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,760
In the end, he couldn't be saved.

488
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,160
It was an anesthesia problem.

489
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,640
Liangliang passed away just like that.

490
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,720
What are you doing here?

491
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I came to see Liangliang.

492
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,320
This is my home.

493
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,600
Get out.

494
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,520
Get out.

495
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,320
Get out.

496
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,480
Get out.

497
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
Get out.

498
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,200
You're not welcome here, get out.

499
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,480
This is my home.

500
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,080
I'm telling you,

501
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,880
Get lost.

502
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Get lost.

503
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,880
Get lost.

504
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,320
I'm telling you,

505
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
Liangliang is my son.

506
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,760
Stop fighting.

507
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,640
Move aside.

508
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Stop hitting.

509
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,960
It's all my fault.

510
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,560
Stop hitting.

511
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,160
Since then, Er Lin

512
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,760
has been drinking every day.

513
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,720
He gets violent when he's drunk.

514
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,480
But I don't blame him.

515
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,520
This is the punishment I deserve.

516
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,960
Do you still remember that anesthetist?

517
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
Do you remember his name?

518
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,880
Lu Junfei.

519
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,680
I'll never forget, even if I die.

520
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,000
Look up someone for me.

521
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,520
An anesthetist from Honghua Hospital.

522
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,040
His name is Lu Junfei.

523
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,000
You're back.

524
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,160
Captain Ran.

525
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,680
I was just looking for you.

526
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,080
We've found the anesthetist.

527
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,720
That incident back then—

528
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,160
Cheng Tou.

529
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,880
After the medical accident,

530
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,840
his anesthetist license was revoked.

531
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,800
He was later fired by the hospital.

532
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,760
I heard

533
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,320
he went to work at a pet hospital.

534
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,840
He does anesthesia for pet surgeries.

535
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
The new encrypted email hasn't arrived yet.

536
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,800
Find him quickly.

537
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,160
Cheng Tou.

538
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,760
We've tracked down the IP address of the fifth email.

539
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,520
Upload it.

540
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,080
Yes.

541
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,200
This—

542
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,880
A small internet café near Binhai Road.

543
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,960
Bro, should I go arrest him?

544
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,720
Arrest who?

545
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,160
He's long gone by now.

546
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,080
Check the surveillance footage.

547
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,080
Medical support

548
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,000
Yan Zi

549
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,120
Send the surveillance images to everyone immediately.

550
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,880
Compare them with the nearby street surveillance footage.

551
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
See if we can track him down.

552
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,280
21:35

553
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,680
From Binhai Road to Xieli Road

554
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,720
21:42

555
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,120
Entered Datong Metro Station, Entrance C

556
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,840
Yan Zi

557
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,120
The metro station's surveillance

558
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,400
We lost sight of him after he entered the station.

559
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,160
There are blind spots in the metro station's surveillance.

560
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,680
He's very familiar with these surveillance systems.

561
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,400
He probably used those blind spots.

562
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,880
He quickly boarded a train.

563
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,240
That guy is pretty bold.

564
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
He even dares to stroll around and take the metro.

565
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,360
Keep searching.

566
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,600
Check every street corner carefully.

567
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,560
Captain Ran

568
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,520
The safe at Sun Ruhai's company has been opened.

569
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,280
Inside, besides some cash

570
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,520
receipts

571
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,520
and contracts

572
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,800
there's also this photo.

573
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,720
I think you all need to see it.

574
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,920
Gao Ang, that bastard.

575
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,000
Move aside.

576
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,480
Jun.

577
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,440
Tang Jun.

578
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,880
Get up.

579
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,360
Come on.

580
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,240
Explain this.

581
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,360
This is...

582
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,920
When was this?

583
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,240
I don't remember.

584
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Stop pretending.

585
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,680
Did you see the date on it?

586
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,200
Five days before my master died.

587
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,040
Now this Sun Ruhai is a big problem.

588
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,880
You had tea and chatted with him.

589
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,040
Let me ask you.

590
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,520
Was the person my master wanted to investigate him?

591
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
You suspect I'm colluding with Sun Ruhai?

592
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,600
That's right.

593
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,760
Tang Jun.

594
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,000
Uncle Gao

595
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,160
Tang Jun is not calm.

596
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
Our case-handling procedures

597
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,280
You should know them.

598
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,920
Coming to see you

599
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,040
is also to understand the situation.

600
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,560
This Sun Ruhai

601
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,920
do you know him?

602
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
I guess you could say I know him.

603
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,960
Back then,

604
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,360
he was involved in demolition work.

605
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,240
People like them

606
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,080
just want to get to know more police officers.

607
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,160
They think it makes things easier.

608
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,040
He did invite me for tea a few times.

609
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,600
But which time the photo was taken,

610
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,640
I really can't remember.

611
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,680
I never promised them anything.

612
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,400
Besides,

613
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,120
at that time I was working under your father.

614
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,760
You know what kind of person your father is.

615
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
How could he allow me to

616
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,240
get too close to those troublemakers?

617
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,240
Because of this

618
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
Senior even criticized me

619
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,160
I remember

620
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,040
I remember my master questioned you

621
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,600
So you took his dirty money

622
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
My master wanted to investigate him

623
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,680
And you helped him get my master killed

624
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,440
Isn't that right about my master

625
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,120
Tang Jun

626
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,960
Stop talking nonsense

627
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,920
Officer Xiao Wang from your team died, right

628
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,360
You must feel terrible

629
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,360
Now you know what it's like to lose a brother

630
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
It feels like your heart is being torn apart

631
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,640
How could I possibly harm my big brother

632
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,960
Yes

633
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,400
They called me in for questioning

634
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,320
Senior scolded me, I deserved it

635
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,560
I lost my gun, I went to jail, I deserved it

636
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,320
But you can't just make things up

637
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
If you slander me again

638
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
I'll file a complaint against you

639
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,920
Don't forget, you're a police officer

640
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Remember how senior taught you back then

641
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,560
Don't mention my master

642
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,040
Tang Jun

643
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,800
Are you okay

644
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,920
You

645
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,760
I told you

646
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
I won't let you off

647
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I'm watching you closely

648
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,600
Uncle Gao

649
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,600
Please calm down.

650
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,080
Tang Jun has a really bad temper.

651
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
Especially when it comes to his master.

652
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
Senior brother

653
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,040
In his heart, he's just like

654
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,840
a father to him.

655
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,840
He just can't get over it.

656
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,800
I understand.

657
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,160
Please don't be angry.

658
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,400
I'll head out now.

659
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,680
I still have some work at the bureau.

660
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,840
Xiaofeng

661
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,120
About what happened today,

662
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,760
don't worry.

663
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,920
I won't tell Xiaoqiu.

664
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,080
Alright.

665
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,600
Thanks for your hard work.

666
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,960
Here.

667
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,160
Have this to cool off.

668
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,040
Calm down.

669
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,480
You brat.

670
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
I know.

671
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,960
You all talk about me behind my back.

672
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,040
Cold-blooded.

673
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
Heartless.

674
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
My dad's case has gone unsolved for so many years.

675
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,600
Even you, as his apprentice, still can't let it go.

676
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
But I, his own daughter,

677
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
act like nothing happened.

678
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,160
Who told you that nonsense?

679
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
I know what I'm doing.

680
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,600
I still remember the day I got into the police academy.

681
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,120
My dad told me then,

682
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Being a police officer

683
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,080
comes down to three things.

684
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,680
Being a police officer,

685
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,440
it's just three things.

686
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,440
When facing a case,

687
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,200
stay calm.

688
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,840
When facing temptation,

689
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,600
resist it.

690
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,560
When facing life and death,

691
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,000
be rational.

692
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,040
Impatience.

693
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,760
Rashness.

694
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
Those are big taboos for a police officer.

695
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,960
Being impatient and rash is a big taboo.

696
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,640
Can you control that bad temper of yours?

697
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,000
You flare up at the slightest thing.

698
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Like a powder keg.

699
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,040
Got it.

700
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,080
Song De is awake.

701
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,720
Okay, got it.

702
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,280
Where are you going?

703
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,040
To investigate the case.

704
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,080
And also,

705
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,680
help me apologize to Cheng Feng.

706
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,480
Tell him yourself.

707
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,880
Criminal Investigation Unit.

708
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,400
This is why you killed An Wenju, isn't it?

709
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,680
Who is your target for the exchange?

710
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,960
This child.

711
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
His name is Liangliang, right?
