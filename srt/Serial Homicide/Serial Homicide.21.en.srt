1
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
Officers, listen to me.

2
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,200
Why are you handcuffing me?

3
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,600
I—

4
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
I don't sell

5
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,040
illegal drugs anymore.

6
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,920
If you don't believe me,

7
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,640
search me.

8
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,600
These days,

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,240
selling drugs doesn't make money.

10
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,040
But risking your life pays well, right?

11
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,320
Hiring a killer is a serious crime.

12
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
You know that, right?

13
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,400
I—

14
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm your informant.

15
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
You're our informant?

16
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
Yes, an informant.

17
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,920
Officer Tang's informant.

18
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,880
Tang Jun?

19
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,320
Yes.

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,440
Officer Tang Jun.

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm helping him catch criminals.

22
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Who are you catching?

23
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
Of course, we're after the big fish.

24
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,080
The one who wants to kill Officer Tang.

25
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
The mastermind behind it.

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,200
We're taking action today.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,440
Don't waste my time here.

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
You'll ruin something important.

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,200
When?

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,760
Where?

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,640
How about you uncuff me first?

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,080
Stop talking nonsense.

33
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
To-today—

34
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,400
Today at 4 p.m.

35
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,160
Sunshine Shopping Center.

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,320
On the plaza.

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,600
Behave yourself.

38
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,360
Officer.

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,600
Officer.

40
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Sunshine Shopping Center Plaza

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,920
Action

42
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
What are you doing here?

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,400
What exactly are you trying to do?

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
I almost caught him.

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,840
Why did you alert him?

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,880
We didn't expect to be discovered either.

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
But have you thought about

48
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,760
who this person is?

49
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,960
It's like this every time.

50
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
It was the same at the abandoned shipyard.

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,840
Before you arrived,

52
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,920
the killer was already there.

53
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Have you considered

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,080
that this person is right among us?

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
It's someone from our own team.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
But you still can't act on your own.

57
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,600
Do you have a death wish?

58
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,480
As long as I can catch him,

59
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,800
my life doesn't matter.

60
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,840
Tang Jun.

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Director Zhao.

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
Who gave you permission to act on your own?

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
We found

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,280
the hitman broker the anesthetist mentioned.

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
We learned Tang Jun was coming to meet the person who tried to kill him.

66
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,960
We came to make the arrest.

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,760
Did you catch him?

68
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,840
Do you know

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,560
what the most important task is right now?

70
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,680
It's to stop Erinius from killing again.

71
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
It's to catch Tang Jun.

72
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,760
Hurry!

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Bring him back to me!

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes, sir!

75
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,160
Lost him.

76
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
We lost track.

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
He's too cunning.

78
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,920
Tang Jun is a disgrace to the police.

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,320
What do you mean?

80
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Who told you to say that?

81
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,760
Let go.

82
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,360
Who told you to talk about him like that?

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,800
Let go of me!

84
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
Who told you to say that?

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm going to file a complaint against you.

86
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Release me.

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,120
What's going on?

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
You guys go back first.

89
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,240
Director Zhao—

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,960
I'll go report to him.

91
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,920
Director Zhao,

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,440
Although this case is important,

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,240
but

94
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,040
you should also take care of your health.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,520
Don't worry.

96
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
We've already arrested several suspects.

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
This case

98
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,920
is connected to a homicide from a few years ago.

99
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
They're related.

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,280
Everything is linked together.

101
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,560
But I promise

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
to solve the case as soon as possible.

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm not trying to rush you.

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,280
So, your visit today

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,000
isn't just to tell me to take care of myself, is it?

106
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,680
What,

107
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
after working together for so many years,

108
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
can't I just come over to chat with you?

109
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Of course.

110
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,720
By the way, about Tang Jun,

111
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,520
rest assured,

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
we will definitely arrest him.

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
Even though he used to be my subordinate,

114
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,080
we will handle everything according to regulations.

115
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,600
We absolutely won't be lenient.

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,680
I know.

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,760
After all, Tang Jun is also a police officer.

118
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
How could he knowingly break the law?

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Director Chen,

120
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
I've worked with you

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
for such a long time.

122
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,960
You know what kind of person I am.

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,160
He's one of ours.

124
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,360
Although we can't be sure he's the culprit,

125
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,200
he is definitely involved in this case.

126
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,440
He can't escape responsibility anymore.

127
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,520
I'm just making a deduction.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,360
Director Zhao, look at you.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,480
Director Chen.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,760
This is a matter for our own branch.

131
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,160
I'll handle it myself.

132
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,240
Alright.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,480
Have some tea.

134
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,080
Future Financial Street.

135
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,080
Haonan.

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,080
Yifei.

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Come with me.

138
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,760
What's wrong, Chengtou?

139
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,840
I've found a network address.

140
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,280
Officer Cheng.

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
What a coincidence.

142
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,360
I can see you even outside the station.

143
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,880
Why are you here?

144
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Just having coffee.

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,640
Isn't it obvious?

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,520
By the way.

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
My law firm

148
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,520
is in the office building across the street.

149
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Do you want to come up and have a seat?

150
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,520
No need.

151
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,640
I have other things to do.

152
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
Alright, I'll get back to work too.

153
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,560
See you next time.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,640
Haonan.

155
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,400
Keep an eye on her.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,320
Chengtou, we've received another new garbled email.

157
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Chengtou.

158
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
Chu Hong has entered Dongshi Building.

159
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Okay.

160
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,040
Don't alert them.

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Stay downstairs and keep watch.

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Don't act on your own.

163
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,520
If anything happens,

164
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
report immediately.

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,360
Alright.

166
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,160
Head

167
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,400
The email has been unlocked.

168
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,320
Laomedeon

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
Laomedeon in Greek mythology

170
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
was not only a deceiver of people

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,360
but also an evildoer who deceived the gods.

172
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,640
I’ll take a call.

173
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,240
How are you?

174
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,680
I’m fine.

175
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
We just received an email.

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,760
The email specifies someone to be killed.

177
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,640
That person is very likely

178
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
the one we’re looking for.

179
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
Can you take his voice

180
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,080
and do a voice comparison?

181
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,640
Comparison.

182
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,920
Compare with whom?

183
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,280
I’m at the shopping mall.

184
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,640
I saw his back.

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,320
I suspect

186
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
it’s someone close to us.

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,680
Come in.

188
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,200
Director Chen.

189
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,280
Director Zhao.

190
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,440
Is there something you need?

191
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,320
I request to leave the 909 task force.

192
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,520
And transfer back to the City Bureau Information Security Center.

193
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Why?

194
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,040
My fiancée died because of the 909 case.

195
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,960
I still can't calm my emotions.

196
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm afraid

197
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
my personal feelings

198
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,720
are affecting my work now.

199
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,840
So

200
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,520
I can't continue to fulfill my duties.

201
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,560
As the head of the information team of the 909 task force,

202
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,440
I request to be transferred.

203
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Stop making trouble and leave.

204
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
I understand.

205
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Young people,

206
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
when someone you love

207
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
passes away suddenly,

208
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,440
it's normal for your emotions to be a bit unstable.

209
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,880
But Cheng Feng,

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,040
right now,

211
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,040
we have a strong enemy ahead.

212
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,120
We can't let our guard down.

213
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,560
Boss,

214
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
one bowl of noodles, please.

215
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,840
Middle section of Jin'an Road

216
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,360
Fugitive suspect Tang Jun spotted

217
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,000
Middle section of Jin'an Road

218
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,600
Fugitive suspect Tang Jun spotted

219
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,480
Caught him

220
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,240
Good

221
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,480
Director Chen

222
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,360
Tang Jun has been caught

223
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,600
That's great

224
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,280
The 909 special case

225
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,120
Finally, there's a new breakthrough

226
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
Now

227
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,880
I can also

228
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,160
report to my superiors

229
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,440
Yunping

230
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,560
Keep up the good work

231
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,120
Arrest as soon as possible

232
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,320
the mastermind behind the scenes

233
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,840
and completely destroy this organization

234
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
When the time comes

235
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
I'll throw a celebration for you

236
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,960
But Director Chen

237
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,120
Because Tang Jun is involved in the 909 case

238
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,920
I want to transfer him

239
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,520
back to Nanyang Branch for interrogation

240
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,320
You know Tang Jun's temper

241
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,280
aren't you aware of it?

242
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,120
Nanyang Branch is like his home

243
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
If he goes back home

244
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
he'll act out and make trouble

245
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
What can you do about him then?

246
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,440
Yes

247
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,840
Better keep him at the city bureau

248
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,680
An unfamiliar place

249
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,640
will be good for him

250
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,520
Director Chen, I still

251
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,400
It's settled

252
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,840
As for Tang Jun

253
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,360
I'll help you get him to talk first

254
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,760
He's just a young man.

255
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,960
His beloved.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Passed away suddenly.

257
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
His emotions are a bit unsettled.

258
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,280
That's perfectly normal.

259
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,960
Our formidable opponent is ahead.

260
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
We can't let our guard down.

261
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,240
I was at the shopping mall.

262
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
I saw his silhouette.

263
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,120
I suspect

264
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,360
it's someone close to us.

265
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,560
Can you take his voice

266
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,840
and do a voice comparison?

267
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,360
Compare.

268
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,600
Compare with whom?

269
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Chen Tingyue.

270
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,520
Chen Tingyue.

271
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,360
Go and stop Tang Jun immediately.

272
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,080
Hurry!

273
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,920
Yes.

274
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Hello, Director Zheng.

275
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,520
I'm from Luzhou Public Security Bureau.

276
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,720
Nanyang Branch, Zhao Yunping.

277
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,520
There's something

278
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,480
I need to report to you.

279
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,680
What are you doing here?

280
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,160
We're from the Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Unit.

281
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
We're following orders from our superiors.

282
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,920
We're here to take over.

283
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
The suspect, Tang Jun.

284
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
We haven't received any orders.

285
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,920
Alright.

286
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,680
Yes.

287
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,480
Understood.

288
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,320
He's yours now.

289
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,400
Thank you.

290
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,120
Director Zhao

291
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,680
Tang Jun has brought him back.

292
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,840
Reporting to Director Zhao

293
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,960
Operation Lure the Snake is complete

294
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,240
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team

295
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,800
Tang Jun

296
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,240
Requesting reinstatement

297
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,960
Reinstatement approved

298
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,400
Help me one more time

299
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Contact Director Zhao

300
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,320
I want to find him

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,800
Director Zhao

302
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,440
What exactly are you trying to do?

303
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,600
Within our Luzhou police department

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,800
there's a mole.

305
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,560
The year my mentor died,

306
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,360
Shi Song's death,

307
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,120
and also

308
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
the current Erinye incident,

309
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,480
are all connected to this person.

310
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
I want to root him out.

311
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,080
How will you do that?

312
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,800
You plan to do it on your own?

313
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,040
Everything we do now

314
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,680
is under this person's watchful eye.

315
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,960
This is the only way I can keep going.

316
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Issue a warrant for my arrest.

317
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,560
If he finds out

318
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,560
that I've taken off my police uniform,

319
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
and left the police force,

320
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,120
he'll do whatever it takes to kill me.

321
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,600
This way,

322
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,680
he'll be forced to reveal himself.

323
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,320
Do you realize

324
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,480
how dangerous this is?

325
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,720
If anything goes wrong,

326
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
you might not even be able to save your own life.

327
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,160
You could even die at the hands of your own people.

328
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,600
As long as I can catch this mole,

329
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,920
this disgrace to the police,

330
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,320
it will be worth dying for.

331
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,120
Director Zhao

332
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,160
The code name for this operation is

333
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
"Draw the Snake."

334
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,240
That's pretty bold.

335
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
Goodbye, Uncle Ping.

336
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,320
Jun.

337
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,040
Director Zhao

338
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,720
Every time we go to arrest Tang Jun,

339
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,720
you always send Cheng Feng and me.

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,080
You know the two of us would never hurt him.

341
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,320
Right?

342
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,520
Close the door.

343
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,680
Alright.

344
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,560
Uncle Ping

345
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,520
Director Zheng

346
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,040
According to the order from the provincial department,

347
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,080
Deputy Director Chen Tingyue of the Luzhou Public Security Bureau

348
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
is suspected of premeditated murder,

349
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,880
instigating others to commit murder,

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,040
accepting large bribes, among other charges.

351
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
A special task force is now approved to be established.

352
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,080
Arrest Chen Tingyue immediately.

353
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
Go ahead.

354
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,120
What?

355
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,480
Where?

356
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,200
Attention all units,

357
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,240
proceed to Dongshi Building.

358
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,080
Attention all units,

359
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,240
proceed to Dongshi Building.

360
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,080
Roger.

361
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,000
Did you guys know?

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
The one who jumped was the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau.

363
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,440
He must have done something that the higher-ups found out about.

364
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,080
He was afraid of implicating his wife and kids.

365
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
If you ask me,

366
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,040
he just knew too much.

367
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,920
Make way.

368
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,320
Don't crowd around, let the police do their job.

369
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,760
Director Zhao

370
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Director Chen jumped.

371
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,400
Director Zhao

372
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,160
Boss Han from Dongshi Building is here.

373
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,040
He wants to see you.

374
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,720
Nice to meet you, President Han.

375
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,160
Director Zhao.

376
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,040
Hello.

377
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
May I ask, President Han,

378
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,720
is there something you need?

379
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
Hello, Director Zhao.

380
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,960
I am Mr. Han's assistant.

381
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,640
Mr. Han, as one of Luzhou City's

382
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,160
first foreign entrepreneurs to be invited to invest,

383
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,040
founded Dongshi Group.

384
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,240
The company is developing rapidly.

385
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,960
It has made significant contributions to Luzhou City's GDP

386
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,200
through its hard work.

387
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,240
However, today's jumping incident

388
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
has had a very negative impact on Dongshi Group.

389
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,160
It has caused serious negative effects.

390
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,000
Both in the stock market and in society,

391
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
the effects are not positive.

392
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,600
Therefore,

393
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,880
we hope the police

394
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,840
can resolve this matter as soon as possible.

395
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
We will do our utmost

396
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,080
to cooperate with all police work.

397
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Of course.

398
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,080
Solving the case

399
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,160
is our responsibility as the police.

400
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
Then,

401
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,080
thank you, Director Zhao.

402
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,560
You're welcome.

403
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,600
Please rest assured.

404
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,360
Any findings at the scene?

405
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,680
Captain Ran.

406
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,840
We are conducting a step-by-step investigation.

407
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,880
Reviewing surveillance footage from the time of the incident.

408
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,440
At that time,

409
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,200
it was noon.

410
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,080
There was a large flow of people.

411
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,440
So it's difficult to investigate.

412
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,400
Another team

413
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,120
is questioning witnesses.

414
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,440
We need to wait for the interviews

415
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,360
before we get any results.

416
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,440
Also,

417
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
we found this item

418
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,600
on Director Chen.

419
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,360
Gloves

420
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
By the time you read this letter,

421
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,080
I will already be free.

422
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,200
Rather than saying "already,"

423
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,000
it's more accurate to say "finally."

424
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,840
All the sins of my life

425
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,560
will come to an end at this moment.

426
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,040
All of this

427
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
stems from my unbearable desires.

428
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,200
I lost myself in the face of power and money.

429
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,720
I became

430
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,240
the protector of Shisong Demolition Company.

431
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,360
Step back.

432
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,040
Step back.

433
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,960
Push.

434
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,080
I had already intended to repent.

435
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,640
To start over as a new person.

436
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,240
But unexpectedly,

437
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,840
the forced demolition case in Xishan Village eight years ago

438
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,640
dragged me back again

439
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,160
into an abyss of no return.

440
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,520
Brother,

441
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
you can't just stand by and watch your younger brother

442
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,160
at this critical moment

443
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,960
get ruined by this mess in Xishan Village, can you?

444
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,840
How many times have I told you?

445
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,400
You can't just act so recklessly.

446
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,560
Five lives are at stake.

447
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,520
What do you expect me to do?

448
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,040
Figure it out yourself.

449
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,360
Shisong came to see me.

450
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,240
He asked me to help him settle the Xishan Village matter.

451
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,480
But

452
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,400
this involves five lives.

453
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,120
I can't do anything about it.

454
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,040
My conscience

455
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,000
won't let me cover for him anymore.

456
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
I refused Shisong.

457
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,320
But he threatened me.

458
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
The incident where someone was killed

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,040
You help me take care of it.

460
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,560
Besides this one million,

461
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,600
I'll also give you ten percent of the relocation company's profits.

462
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,400
That's for you too.

463
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,720
Shisong,

464
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,360
this matter has too much social impact.

465
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I can't handle it.

466
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,080
Now you want

467
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,320
to wash your hands of it?

468
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Don't forget,

469
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
we're in this together.

470
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,480
Shisong

471
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,680
What do you mean?

472
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,280
About the Xishan Village matter,

473
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
you have to help me settle it.

474
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,360
I'm telling you,

475
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,120
if you can't handle it,

476
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,040
I'll be done for.

477
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,840
Think about it.

478
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,400
It's been so many years.

479
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,760
We've been dealing with each other all this time.

480
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,520
You and I have been in the same boat for a long time.

481
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Every single transaction,

482
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,960
I remember them all clearly.

483
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm telling you,

484
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,080
if I go down,

485
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,960
will you be any better off?

486
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,400
If you

487
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,760
want to go down with me this time,

488
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,120
I'll go all the way with you.

489
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,680
I can't just sit here and wait for death.

490
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,600
So,

491
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,720
I found someone close to Shisong,

492
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,760
that subordinate who has long harbored disloyalty.

493
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,440
Sun Ruhai.

494
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
The Xishan Village matter

495
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,240
can't be covered up.

496
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
Someone has to take the fall.

497
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,480
Guess what,

498
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,080
Shisong

499
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,760
who do you think Shisong will make take the blame?

500
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,720
That old bastard Shisong,

501
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,160
he's thrown me under the bus.

502
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,640
You'd better think about how to get yourself out of this.

503
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,480
It's raining outside.

504
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,160
This umbrella of mine

505
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,200
is only so big.

506
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,320
Not many people can be protected.

507
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,160
Someone has to go out and get wet.

508
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Don't you think so?

509
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,160
Sun Ruhai

510
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,040
quickly followed my plan

511
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,200
and killed Shi Song

512
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,880
then staged it as a suicide

513
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,720
Shi Song had suffered from severe depression for a long time

514
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,680
and had strong suicidal tendencies

515
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,000
these are all things you

516
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,640
learned from accompanying him to his medical appointments

517
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,440
remember that

518
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,960
he committed suicide

519
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,120
what I didn't expect

520
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,440
was that Ran Haochuan noticed something suspicious

521
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,320
and refused to let go of the case

522
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,400
Ran Da

523
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,880
what's wrong

524
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,880
if you were going to commit suicide

525
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,400
before doing it

526
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,240
would you still remember

527
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,800
to give yourself an insulin shot?

528
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
the cause of death is suspicious

529
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,160
we need to take the body back

530
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,320
for forensic examination

531
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,200
they took Shi Song's body away

532
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,800
the one leading them

533
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,520
is named Ran

534
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,080
Ran Haochuan is very stubborn

535
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,640
if he gets hold of this, it'll be trouble

536
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,320
about the autopsy

537
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,040
I'll try to delay it on my end

538
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,440
you find a way to deal with Ran Haochuan

539
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,600
Chief Chen

540
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,920
Ran Haochuan is just too tough

541
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,880
I can't get through to him

542
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,600
if this gets exposed

543
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,280
the consequences will be unimaginable

544
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
I'll have to take another risk

545
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,760
then get rid of him

546
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,080
kill a cop

547
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
Cops are people too.

548
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
Find a reliable guy.

549
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,680
Figure something out.

550
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
Get an expensive gun.

551
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,040
Use his gun for the job.

552
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,160
I'll go.

553
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Alright.

554
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,480
After it's done,

555
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,720
get rid of the gun.

556
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,920
Then find a place to lay low for a while.

557
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,560
The rest

558
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,040
I'll take care of.

559
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,040
Understood.

560
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,040
Brother Gao,

561
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,840
I'm a businessman.

562
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,400
I believe in repaying kindness.

563
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,720
This is just a small token.

564
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,080
Please accept it.

565
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,840
Who's taking pictures?

566
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,560
Brother Gao, Brother Gao,

567
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,080
Don't be nervous.

568
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,920
Relax.

569
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,240
Me, I

570
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,920
like making friends.

571
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,400
Let's take a photo

572
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,480
as a keepsake.

573
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,640
Oh, right,

574
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,840
once the photo is developed,

575
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
I'll have someone bring it to you.

576
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,960
Daughter

577
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,240
Dad's off work.

578
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,040
Yeah.

579
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,120
I bought you lots of tasty food.

580
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,400
What else do you want?

581
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,800
No.

582
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
Are you okay?

583
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,560
What's wrong with you?

584
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,680
No, no.

585
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,800
How did you get so big?

586
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,040
I just called.

587
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,640
Sorry, sorry.

588
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,160
What's going on?

589
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,680
Is the child okay?

590
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,520
Gao Ang

591
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,400
became the scapegoat.

592
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,360
Captain Ran Haochuan's death

593
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,440
is related to Gao Ang.

594
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,160
Gao Ang

595
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,440
After examination,

596
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,760
the bullet taken from Captain Ran Haochuan's body

597
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
came from your service gun.

598
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,600
You are now being summoned according to the law.

599
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,600
Eight years have passed.

600
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,760
I thought everything

601
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
had already faded away.

602
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,160
The 909 case broke out suddenly.

603
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
Sun Bin, Yin Hui.

604
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,160
Sun Ruhai was attacked one after another.

605
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,320
I know.

606
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,720
It must be because of what happened back then.

607
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,720
Someone is avenging Shi Song.

608
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,040
But I don't know who this person is.

609
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,480
I don't know either.

610
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,200
Whether this person will find me.

611
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,080
So,

612
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,480
I must find this person in advance.

613
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,240
I am closely following the progress of the 909 case.

614
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,040
Tang Jun has become a suspect.

615
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,400
What's going on?

616
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,280
But this person who calls himself Erinias

617
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,480
is like a ghost.

618
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,160
He seems to be right beside me.

619
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
Everywhere.

620
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,840
Yet leaves no trace.

621
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,960
Impossible to touch.

622
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,880
All of this

623
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,000
makes me afraid.

624
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,160
But the person who scares me even more

625
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,600
is Tang Jun.

626
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
Tang Jun realized

627
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,840
the 909 case is connected to an old case from eight years ago.

628
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,000
Eight years ago, you and Sun Ruhai, and Gao Ang

629
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,040
were involved in some shady dealings.

630
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
He is desperate to uncover

631
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,880
the mystery that has been hidden for eight years.

632
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,880
Now that things have come to this,

633
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,800
I have no choice but to act again.

634
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,360
and get rid of Tang Jun.
