1
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team

2
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,480
Captain

3
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,600
What's wrong?

4
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,960
There's a fire in an apartment at Xinhua Lane.

5
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Someone died in the fire.

6
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
It seems to be

7
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,920
Yin Hui

8
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,960
Yin Hui, thirty-five years old, single.

9
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Started out as a reporter.

10
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,320
Very capable at her job.

11
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
Her career advanced smoothly.

12
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,680
She was just promoted to deputy director of the channel last month.

13
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,000
You could say she's a pillar of the TV station.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
According to her supervisor,

15
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,360
Yin Hui has very high emotional intelligence.

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,080
She's good at dealing with people.

17
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
She doesn't make enemies easily.

18
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Although we can't confirm any connection between the Sun Bin case and the Yin Hui case yet,

19
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,280
whether there's any definite link,

20
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
but judging from various signs,

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,880
it's highly likely it's the same person or group.

22
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
These two cases have now

23
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,360
caused a very negative impact in society.

24
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,080
The city bureau has given us orders

25
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,120
to solve the case within a set time.

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
So, is there any connection between Yin Hui and the first victim, Sun Bin?

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,120
Is there any link between them?

28
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
On the surface,

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,720
The only connection between the two should be

30
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
Ru Hai Real Estate, owned by Sun Bin's father,

31
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,080
is the sponsor of Yin Hui's program.

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,160
It's highly likely that these two know each other.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,280
At 3 p.m. on the day of the incident,

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,120
the surveillance in the victim's building and the parking lot

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
were deliberately damaged.

36
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,920
They hadn't been repaired at the time of the incident.

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,280
So we can't provide any clues for now.

38
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,280
But according to the TV station's parking lot surveillance,

39
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Yin Hui drove away at 6 p.m. that evening.

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,440
When her car reached the main gate,

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,000
a woman got into her car.

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,600
According to confirmation from TV station colleagues,

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
that woman

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,960
is a field reporter for the same program as Yin Hui.

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,400
Ren Xiaoqiu.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,520
She said

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
a citizen saw

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Just say what happened directly.

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,800
After seeing Yin Hui's news, a citizen

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
reported it to the police station.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
She said that around 6:30 last night,

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
she saw Yin Hui and Ren Xiaoqiu having an argument.

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
They were arguing fiercely.

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
How could she be sure it was Yin Hui and Ren Xiaoqiu?

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,600
She said

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
she recognized them as being from Time Online.

57
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
the anchor and the field reporter.

58
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,800
Please stop for a moment.

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,360
The case involving Ren Xiaoqiu and Yin Hui being harmed.

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Please assist with the investigation.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,720
Around 6 p.m. yesterday,

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
the surveillance footage shows

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,600
you were in the TV station's underground parking lot

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
and got into Yin Hui's car.

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Yes.

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
But according to your colleagues,

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
your relationship with her is usually not very good.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
I heard you two had an argument a few days ago, right?

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,200
So why did you get into her car?

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
I hoped she could withdraw

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
the script that was supposed to be recorded today

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,120
for "Time and Space Online."

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm leaving.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,280
Okay, bye.

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,080
Bye.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
Sorry, Xiaoqiu.

77
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
It's fine.

78
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,400
At Yuehai Pavilion.

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
Alright, alright.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
Mr. Sun, please wait a moment.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,200
See you in a bit.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Bye.

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,200
Director Liang, you approved this script, right?

84
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
You know about this.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Hu Yi tried to get breakup compensation

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,840
by deliberately seducing Sun Bin.

87
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,600
There's no evidence for that at all.

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
She's already been hurt once.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
What are we doing now?

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Are we going to hurt her again?

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,800
Which word mentions her?

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,000
Show me where it says "Hu Yi."

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
Then why isn't Sun Bin using an alias this time?

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Just to please the advertisers,

95
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,240
we use this kind of bottomless reporting to distract the public.

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,920
When did we become so low?

97
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,120
Ren Xiaoqiu.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,240
I thought society and the workplace had already taught you a lesson.

99
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,200
Why are you still speaking so recklessly?

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
The program director is Yin Hui, not you.

101
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Do you understand?

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
She's the director, but you come straight to me.

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
What do you call this?

104
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,840
This is called overstepping your authority.

105
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,320
A big taboo in the workplace.

106
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,000
If you have something, communicate directly with her.

107
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,240
Do you understand?

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
Can you learn this?

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,880
When you leave, close the door for me.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,680
Director Yin, where are you? I need to talk to you.

111
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
It's after work now. If you have something, talk to me tomorrow.

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,000
Director Yin.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,080
I really have something urgent to discuss with you.

114
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
Crazy, doesn't want to live anymore.

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Director Yin, this script can't be aired.

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm in a hurry, let's talk tomorrow.

117
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,600
Then I'll chat with you for a bit on the way.

118
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,680
Get in the car.

119
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,440
This episode is about to be recorded.

120
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,480
If you cancel me now, what will I record tomorrow?

121
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,600
As long as you agree to withdraw this article,

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm willing to use the suburban chemical plant

123
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,680
explosion case

124
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,480
to exchange with you.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
You know,

126
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
I've investigated this case for two years.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,200
I really envy your innocence.

128
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,440
You spend two years investigating one case.

129
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
How many two-year periods do you have in your career?

130
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,040
Who even cares about the results of your investigation?

131
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,640
You should be well aware

132
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,120
that this report itself is a lie.

133
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,800
Truth is the bottom line of journalism.

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,520
It's also my bottom line.

135
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,800
Honey, help me out too.

136
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,840
I serve the company, not you.

137
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,080
Sponsorship is the company's bottom line.

138
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,720
Who's more important, you or the company?

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,120
So just for a bit of money,

140
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,040
you twist the truth and destroy people.

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,080
Don't think that just because you don't hold a knife

142
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
you're innocent.

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,280
You're targeting a young woman.

144
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Heaven is watching.

145
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
That's all.

146
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,120
That's all.

147
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,840
Some citizens reported

148
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,320
that you two had a heated argument on the coastal highway.

149
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Can you explain?

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Everyone has a different understanding of what an argument is.

151
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,200
Maybe I spoke to her too loudly.

152
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,720
So people misunderstood.

153
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,440
And then?

154
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,240
Later

155
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
When the negotiation failed, I left.

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,280
What time did you leave?

157
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,760
About

158
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Before seven, I think.

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,480
Where did you go?

160
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
I went home.

161
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,000
What time did you get home?

162
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
A little after seven.

163
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
But according to

164
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,080
the security guard in your neighborhood,

165
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,080
you came home at 12:30 a.m.

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,040
I got hungry while working on my draft at night.

167
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,000
So I went to the convenience store after midnight.

168
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Maybe

169
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
he didn't notice when I came home earlier.

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,320
He didn't notice.

171
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,200
Then why didn't the surveillance cameras catch it?

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm a bit tired.

173
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
I want to rest for a while.

174
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
That's fine.

175
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,000
Take the opportunity to think carefully.

176
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,280
Is there anything else you want to tell us?

177
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,640
Yin Hui and Ren Xiaoqiu

178
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,720
Their main conflict

179
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,600
is now mainly focused on Hu Yi.

180
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Next, we might use Hu Yi as a breakthrough point.

181
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,520
My intuition

182
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
is that she was with Hu Yi last night.

183
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,280
Uncle Gao

184
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,080
Ran Yue

185
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,720
Why are you here?

186
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
My daughter was brought here by you.

187
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
I have the right to come here and find out what's going on, don't I?

188
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Your daughter?

189
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes.

190
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,560
Ren Xiaoqiu used to be called

191
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Gao Xiaoqiu.

192
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,840
This is the criminal investigation team.

193
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
You’re familiar with this place, aren’t you?

194
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
Only police officers and suspects come here.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Which one are you?

196
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Tang Jun.

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,640
Do you know what it means to avoid conflicts of interest with relatives?

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
You treat this place like your own home.

199
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
You come and go as you please.

200
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,240
Stop messing around, Tang Jun.

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,120
I was the one who called Gao.

202
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,320
Gao.

203
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,280
Come to my office.

204
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,680
Sorry for the trouble.

205
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,480
It’s fine, come on.

206
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,040
Ran Yue, you come too.

207
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,160
Gao Ang.

208
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,320
I know there’s something fishy going on.

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Are you going to talk or not?

210
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,960
I’ve said everything I should.

211
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
I haven’t held anything back.

212
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,560
What did my mentor say to you in the office?

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,680
Who are you colluding with?

214
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Whose dirty money did you take?

215
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,600
Nonsense.

216
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,520
You’re slandering me.

217
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,280
I heard it with my own ears.

218
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,320
A few days later,

219
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,280
my mentor was shot dead with your gun.

220
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,000
And you still say it has nothing to do with you.

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Tang Jun.

222
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,760
Captain Ran was killed by my lost gun.

223
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
But who stole the gun,

224
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I really don’t know.

225
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,680
Whose case was my mentor investigating before he died?

226
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I don’t know.

227
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,280
Gao Ang, you caused my mentor’s death.

228
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,000
You killed a good police officer.

229
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
I won’t let you get away with this.

230
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,400
I will never let you get away with this.

231
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,680
I didn't tell you that Ren Xiaoqiu is Gao Ang's daughter.

232
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,960
Because I was afraid you'd react like this.

233
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
That's your dad.

234
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,320
He's not my dad.

235
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
If he dies, so be it.

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
You don't even care.

237
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,960
Why should I care about him?

238
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
I don't care.

239
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,960
Tang Jun.

240
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,880
Listen to me carefully.

241
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,680
Ran Haochuan is my father.

242
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,400
There's not a single day I don't think about him.

243
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,680
There's not a single day I don't want to personally catch

244
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,760
the person who killed him.

245
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
But what are we?

246
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,080
We are police officers.

247
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,120
If you want to prove you're right,

248
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,080
you have to do everything you can to find evidence.

249
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,880
Not just sulk here day after day.

250
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,280
Captain Ran.

251
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,720
Brother.

252
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,200
We just received a report from the TV station.

253
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,080
They said Yin Hui's office was robbed.

254
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
What's going on?

255
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,920
They kept rambling and never got to the point.

256
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,000
It made me anxious just listening to them.

257
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,880
You two go to the TV station.

258
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,040
I didn't make myself clear, did I?

259
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,760
Let's go.

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,120
This is all that was recorded.

261
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
The rest of the surveillance footage was destroyed.

262
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,520
Wait, wait.

263
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Rewind, rewind.

264
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Brother, look.

265
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,880
Don't shout.

266
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
There's a reflective strip on the clothes.

267
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,880
I see it.

268
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
Everything has been rummaged through.

269
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,560
But valuables and cash weren't taken.

270
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,040
What are they looking for?

271
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,800
What are they searching for?

272
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,400
Haonan.

273
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,160
What did you say was hanging there?

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
Ren Xiaoqiu, if you keep refusing to talk,

275
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,560
we'll have to go find Hu Yi.

276
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
Why are you looking for Hu Yi?

277
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
We suspect you were with her last night.

278
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,320
Don't worry.

279
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
We'll question her with the help of a psychiatrist.

280
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,840
We'll conduct the interview with her.

281
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,960
I want to see Cheng Feng.

282
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,760
I have something to say to him.

283
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
No.

284
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,000
You're considered a police family member too.

285
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,640
Our rules

286
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
You should know them.

287
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
Cheng Feng is your fiancé.

288
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,920
He's also an officer working on this case.

289
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,000
According to regulations,

290
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
he has to recuse himself.

291
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,560
Xiaoqiu.

292
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Your father

293
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,400
was also a police officer.

294
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,520
You should trust us.

295
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,320
As long as you tell the truth,

296
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
whether you tell me

297
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,040
or tell Cheng Feng,

298
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
it's the same.

299
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,200
That's right, I argued with Yin Hui yesterday.

300
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Why do you keep holding on to

301
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,160
Sun Bin's case and won't let go?

302
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,320
Does this do any good for Hu Yi?

303
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,640
Do you really want her unborn child to grow up

304
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,600
and be mocked for having a rapist as a father?

305
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,520
How did you know Hu Yi was pregnant?

306
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Did you think secretly taking her to prenatal checkups

307
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,960
would keep it hidden from everyone?

308
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,120
It's true that you're a bit naive.

309
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,560
Let me remind you,

310
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,600
Sun Bin is dead now.

311
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,840
The Sun family will naturally take care of Hu Yi's unborn child.

312
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,520
It's not your place to get involved.

313
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,360
When you were helping Sun Bin get acquitted,

314
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,480
did you ever think about

315
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,960
showing some mercy to Hu Yi?

316
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,320
Now you want to treasure the child and fight for custody?

317
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
How is this any different from killing a mother?

318
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
You're overthinking it.

319
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,360
What exactly is your relationship with the Sun family?

320
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,000
She's already lost her mind.

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What more do you want from her?

322
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,160
Do you really want to drive her to her death?

323
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
You've gone crazy being a reporter.

324
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
Yin Hui.

325
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Yin Hui.

326
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,600
Yin Hui.

327
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,200
Yin Hui.

328
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,240
Yin Hui, you'll get what's coming to you.

329
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,640
Hello, are you a family member of Hu Yi?

330
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,400
This is the psychiatry department at Renxin Hospital.

331
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,480
Hu Yi is not feeling well right now.

332
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,640
Our hospital doesn't have an obstetrics and gynecology department.

333
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Please take her to another hospital as soon as possible.

334
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,480
Isn't Hu Yi's mother at the hospital?

335
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
We can't reach her.

336
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,760
We found your number by checking the records.

337
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,560
Okay, I'll come over right away.

338
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,320
Yin Hui told me

339
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
that Sun Ruhai has been paying close attention to the baby in Hu Yi's belly.

340
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
That's why I argued with her.

341
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,800
After that,

342
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
I took Hu Yi to Yinglai Maternity Hospital.

343
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
She was upset yesterday.

344
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,520
She was in a bad state.

345
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,320
She had a lot of tests done last night.

346
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,360
It wasn't until Aunt Zhou rushed over after work

347
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,640
that she had just finished.

348
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,040
What time did Zhou Guifang arrive at the hospital?

349
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
A little after eleven, but before twelve.

350
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
Does she often get off work this late?

351
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
No, not really.

352
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,040
Ran Yue,

353
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,240
about Hu Yi's pregnancy,

354
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,360
can you keep it a secret for me?

355
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Of course.

356
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
This is her personal privacy.

357
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,240
Thank you.

358
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,840
Xiao Qiu,

359
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,840
no matter what,

360
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,120
you are a good reporter.

361
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
To be honest with you,

362
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,080
Yin Hui is the backbone of our channel.

363
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,640
Now that something has happened to her,

364
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,840
our channel has become a complete mess.

365
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,520
Backbone? Please.

366
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,080
She’s just like a mop handle.

367
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,920
How is Yin Hui’s relationship with others?

368
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,360
Yin Hui has a high emotional intelligence.

369
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,920
She’s very good at dealing with people and knows her boundaries.

370
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,240
What about outside of work?

371
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
She has a really bad temper.

372
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,840
If anyone says she’s nice,

373
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,760
they’re definitely involved with her.

374
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,320
Sister Yin is actually quite capable at her job.

375
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,040
It’s just that she tends to lose her temper on site.

376
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,920
Even Director Liang has to give way to her.

377
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,720
Why should we provoke her?

378
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
Just go along with her.

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,640
Does she have any grudges with anyone?

380
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,160
I don't know about that.

381
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,040
That's her private life, after all.

382
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,040
But Yin Hui has a wide social circle.

383
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,880
She’s connected with many business resources.

384
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,360
The programs she’s in charge of

385
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
are the most profitable on our channel.

386
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Two years ago, there was actually a man

387
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
standing at our station’s entrance

388
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,000
holding a sign and cursing her.

389
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,240
It seemed to be because of some episode back then.

390
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,240
Which episode?

391
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,760
It was too long ago, I can't remember.

392
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,920
Anchor Yin cares a lot about her public image.

393
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,240
She often goes to the control room herself to choose shots.

394
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,920
But that's normal.

395
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,320
She’s a public figure, after all.

396
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,920
It’s natural to care about her image.

397
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,360
That’s understandable.

398
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,920
How is Yin Hui’s relationship with Ren Xiaoqiu?

399
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,920
The two of them?

400
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,960
How should I put it?

401
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,960
They don’t see eye to eye.

402
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,720
There’s some friction at work.

403
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,040
That’s normal.

404
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,640
Sister Xiaoqiu treats us very well.

405
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,040
She takes special care of us.

406
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,560
She’s a very good journalist, an excellent one.

407
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,760
Ren Xiaoqiu is a simple person.

408
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,840
She always talks about journalistic ethics.

409
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,840
Still follows what she learned in school.

410
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Is that funny?

411
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,360
This spot

412
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
What used to hang here?

413
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,360
This one

414
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,720
I don't remember.

415
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,920
It probably wasn't anything special.

416
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,360
Otherwise, I would remember it.

417
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,440
Yin Hui's office

418
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,560
Was there ever a painting or photo hanging on the wall?

419
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,960
Once, when I was cleaning her office,

420
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,520
I accidentally got a painting dirty.

421
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,960
She really scolded me harshly.

422
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,160
She said some really nasty things.

423
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,440
What painting?

424
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,640
It was a small, unremarkable painting.

425
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,560
It didn't look valuable.

426
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,320
Auntie

427
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,840
Take a look, was the painting placed here?

428
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,640
Yes, it was hanging here.

429
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,840
Where's the painting?

430
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,720
Brother

431
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
Ren Xiaoqiu's whereabouts last night have been verified.

432
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,080
She didn't have time to commit the crime.

433
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,280
Got it.

434
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
Also, the property where Yin Hui was killed

435
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,560
is owned by a company called Haisheng Charity.

436
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,840
The legal representative is Tian Haisheng.

437
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,080
He went out of town before the incident.

438
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,680
He just got back today.

439
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,040
He's at his own home now.

440
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,040
Send me the address.

441
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm heading over now.

442
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,560
Officer

443
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,440
Officer

444
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,920
I found a photo of Anchor Yin's office.

445
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,600
Cheng Feng

446
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Check this out.

447
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
The painting behind her

448
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,400
Okay.

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,240
They're here.

450
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,960
Please have a seat.

451
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
He'll be down in a moment.

452
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
Hello.

453
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,080
You two are...?

454
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,360
Hello, Mr. Tian.

455
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,440
We're from the criminal investigation team at the Nanyang precinct.

456
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,240
We're here to ask you a few questions.

457
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,320
Are you investigating...

458
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
the fire incident at Xinhua Lane, right?

459
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,640
Please, sit down.

460
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,400
I've heard about it.

461
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
That's why I came back early.

462
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,560
Mr. Tian,

463
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
On September 10th, between 8 p.m. and midnight,

464
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,760
where were you?

465
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,520
I was in Haihong.

466
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,760
I went to Haihong to celebrate my father-in-law's birthday.

467
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,040
When did you come back?

468
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,840
Today.

469
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,880
What time today?

470
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,040
Today.

471
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,040
At noon, noon.

472
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Noon.

473
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,560
How did you get back?

474
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
I drove.

475
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,920
It's not far, just over two hundred kilometers, right?

476
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,040
Sorry, my stomach hurts a little.

477
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
I'm going to use the restroom.

478
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,520
Mr. Tian, may I use your bathroom?

479
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,640
It's over there.

480
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

481
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,520
Mr. Tian.

482
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,000
Mr. Tian.

483
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,440
What is your relationship with Yin Hui?

484
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,760
Why is she staying in the apartment under your name?

485
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
You mean Yin Hui?

486
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,480
As for her...

487
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,040
He and Yin Hui

488
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
have an improper relationship.

489
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,320
That apartment

490
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,080
was bought behind my back

491
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,240
under the company's name

492
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,600
for their affair.

493
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
Family scandals shouldn't be made public.

494
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,840
Officer,

495
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,040
Yin Hui and I

496
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Yin Hui

497
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,680
have already agreed to break up.

498
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,440
I haven't been to that apartment for several months.

499
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,280
As for whether she's living at her own place

500
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,720
or at that apartment,

501
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,240
I really don't know.

502
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Check this car.

503
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,080
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

504
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
.

505
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,960
AYH555

506
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,400
At 2:45 a.m. today

507
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
passed through the Luzhou toll station.

508
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,040
Mr. Tian

509
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,760
Luzhou toll station

510
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
is only about ten kilometers from your home.

511
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,280
Why did it take you more than ten hours?

512
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,240
I... I...

513
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,520
I stopped to take care of something else along the way.

514
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,160
That's right.

515
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
I went to the TV station for some business.

516
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,560
What did you take?

517
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,520
Take him away.

518
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,480
Hello.

519
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm the manager here.

520
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
May I ask what you need from me?

521
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,040
Police.

522
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,680
I have a question for you.

523
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,840
Have you seen this painting?

524
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,760
I haven't seen it.

525
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,360
I remember when I came here last week,

526
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,280
there seemed to be a similar piece on display.

527
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,160
Do you remember?

528
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,440
You're talking about Chunshu, right?

529
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
That one is by Zhao Lingjing.

530
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,560
It's Mr. Zhao's work.

531
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,480
Because it's quite valuable,

532
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,240
after the exhibition, we placed it in a special section.

533
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,480
Can you take me to see it?

534
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,520
Of course.

535
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,680
Please follow me.

536
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,840
Mr. Zhao is known for being aloof and proud.

537
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,920
Everyone in the industry knows this.

538
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,440
He hardly ever sells

539
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,080
or gives away his paintings.

540
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,320
So it's very difficult to get one of his works.

541
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,320
The paintings in our gallery

542
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,040
were also obtained through a charity auction.

543
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,960
But whether the one you have is by Mr. Zhao,

544
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm not entirely sure.

545
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,120
Can you help me contact him?

546
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,680
Mr. Zhao has a studio.

547
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
I'll write down the address for you.

548
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,640
Thank you.

549
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,520
Go ahead.

550
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,960
What were you doing at Yin Hui's place?

551
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,080
He's always messing around outside.

552
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,680
He's capable of that.

553
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,240
But as for murder,

554
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,840
he doesn't have the guts.

555
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,320
Officer, there's something you don't know.

556
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,760
Usually, I...

557
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,440
He acts all high and mighty.

558
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,640
But I can't afford to offend my father-in-law.

559
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
Tian Haisheng is just a coward.

560
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,160
He built his life by marrying me.

561
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,120
Whether it's business or social connections,

562
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,520
it's always my dad helping him.

563
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,080
He has control over my lifeline.

564
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,960
So with Yin Hui and me,

565
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,440
we can only be together in secret.

566
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,680
I know he has a mistress outside.

567
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,560
That Yin woman works as a TV anchor.

568
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,240
I can't be bothered to care about him.

569
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,880
We each do our own thing.

570
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
If my father-in-law finds out about this,

571
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,800
then...

572
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,560
he'd probably kill me.

573
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,520
This time, coming back to Haihong with me,

574
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,240
was just to kneel and beg my dad for forgiveness.

575
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,840
Yesterday, I heard she died in Xinhua Lane.

576
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
It gave me quite a scare.

577
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
By midnight,

578
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,160
he got the news that the woman had died.

579
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
He rushed back overnight.

580
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
Nothing anyone says matters.

581
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,320
The reason I went to her office

582
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
was to look around

583
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,440
to see if there was anything about the two of us.

584
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,440
I searched all over,

585
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,120
but found nothing.

586
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
I didn't take anything.

587
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,160
Didn't take anything.

588
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,640
What time did you come back?

589
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,960
Three o'clock.

590
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Just a little after three.

591
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,640
Does this painting look familiar?

592
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,280
Yes, yes.

593
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,760
Familiar, familiar. There's another painting too.

594
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,040
Don't try to fool me.

595
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,480
What did you bring back?

596
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,520
I didn't pay attention.

597
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
Brought a painting.

598
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Why would a big boss like you steal a painting?

599
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,840
This painting is—

600
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
I bought it at an auction to give to her.

601
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,440
I was afraid of exposing our relationship.

602
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,840
Besides, I paid for it myself.

603
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,680
So this can't be considered stealing, right?

604
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,560
Whose painting is it?

605
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,840
I don't remember.

606
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,760
Yin Hui liked it.

607
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,720
So I gave it to her.

608
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,600
Anyway, it was pretty expensive.

609
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,560
Which auction was it?

610
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,280
How would I know what the painting was for?

611
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
He acted like a thief.

612
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
He hid in that room and tore up the painting.

613
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,840
He shredded those papers.

614
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,840
Bag.

615
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,760
It's all here.

616
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,680
That little brat died mysteriously at his place.

617
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,080
A human life is at stake.

618
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,640
What if it drags me and my dad into this?

619
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,840
Right?

620
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
These

621
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,160
are records of Tian Haisheng and that woman

622
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,760
colluding over the years

623
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,240
to use Haisheng Charity to make money.

624
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,440
First, they find people in need of donations.

625
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
Then Yin Hui

626
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,560
reports their stories.

627
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,040
Then they use the Haisheng Charity platform to raise funds.

628
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
After the recipients get the donations,

629
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,640
they widely publicize their good deeds.

630
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
This way, they gain a good reputation through deception.

631
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,240
Then they use various methods

632
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,880
to force the recipients to give up most of the donations.

633
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,280
Those people,

634
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,040
just to get some money, have no choice but to agree.

635
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,560
If they refuse, they get retaliated against.

636
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,640
That woman would use the media to spread rumors.

637
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,640
She'd say the recipients' stories are fake.

638
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Look at this.

639
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,080
This wasteful woman.

640
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
Watch your language.

641
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,680
If I'd known it would turn out like this,

642
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,040
I never should've gotten involved with Yin Hui.

643
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,920
She's so scheming.

644
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,880
She kept a record of every transaction.

645
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,960
She was planning to keep something as leverage.

646
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,040
Officer,

647
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,040
she threatened me, saying

648
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,240
if I dared to break up, she'd send me to jail.

649
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,080
I-I-I went to her office

650
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,760
just to

651
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,720
get these records back.

652
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
In the end, I still got caught.

653
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,960
She brought all this on herself.

654
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,520
She deserved to die.

655
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,840
Yes, I painted this for Yin Hui.

656
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,560
Are you close with Yin Hui?

657
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,680
I heard you never sell your paintings.

658
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,000
Or give them away.

659
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,640
Not close.

660
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
We have some mutual social connections.

661
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,640
We've met a few times.

662
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,640
She kept asking me to paint something for her.

663
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
She mentioned it several times.

664
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,640
If I keep refusing, it would be embarrassing.

665
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,920
I see.

666
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,680
Sorry for the trouble, Teacher Zhao.

667
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,480
Sorry to disturb you so late.

668
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,560
I'll be leaving now.

669
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
No need to see me out.

670
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,840
Why was this line crossed out?

671
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,840
Qin Yang

672
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,080
I think I remember a news report.

673
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,040
The person involved had this name.

674
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,920
Let me look it up.

675
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,560
Found it.

676
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,360
Two years ago, Qin Yang

677
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,080
to raise money for his terminally ill daughter's surgery

678
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,280
sought help from a charity organization

679
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,160
and held a public charity fundraiser.

680
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,520
But Yin Hui exposed him for allegedly using this to scam donations.

681
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,360
This led the public

682
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,320
to pay attention to and criticize Qin Yang's family.

683
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,240
The charity organization was called Haisheng Charity.

684
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,320
Yin Hui faked donations.

685
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,040
Framed a good person.

686
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,760
Qin Yang, because of this incident,

687
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,280
went to the TV station to cause a scene.

688
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,920
Later, the police detained him for provoking trouble.

689
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Administrative detention.

690
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,240
Right.

691
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,200
When I was at the TV station gathering information,

692
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,320
the staff also mentioned

693
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,880
two years ago

694
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,920
someone caused a scene at the TV station entrance, cursing Yin Hui.

695
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,240
It was obviously suspicious.

696
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,880
Suspicious.

697
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,520
If it's suspicious, bring them in for questioning.

698
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Um...

699
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,120
Who should we look for?

700
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,920
Hello.

701
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,960
Does Qin Yang live upstairs?

702
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,280
He moved out a long time ago.

703
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
We're from Nanyang Substation.

704
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,440
We're here to ask you some questions.

705
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,920
Have some tea.

706
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,440
Thank you.

707
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,080
That family was really unlucky.

708
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,960
After that report came out,

709
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,680
he could only bring his daughter back from the hospital.

710
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,320
Later, since they couldn't continue her treatment,

711
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,680
she died at home.

712
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,520
In the end,

713
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,400
his wife had a breakdown.

714
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,360
She turned on the gas and killed herself.

715
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,960
She even set the house on fire.

716
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,280
His wife

717
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,040
was holding their child's body

718
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
and they both burned to death inside.

719
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,040
As for Qin Yang,

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,440
he was actually a decent person.

721
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,800
I thought he was too pitiful.

722
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,680
Since he really couldn't pay, I just let it go.

723
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,160
After that, he moved out.

724
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,320
Look at my house now,

725
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,160
I still can't rent it out.

726
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Do you know where Qin Yang went after that?

727
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,840
No, I don't.

728
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,920
Oh, right.

729
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,840
He came by a while ago.

730
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,760
He said he found a job and gave me some money.

731
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,480
He also gave me a bunch of hotel toiletries.

732
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,120
Look.

733
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,440
Honestly, they're pretty useful.

734
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,640
Police

735
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,880
Hello

736
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,280
Where is this person?

737
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
This should be our boss's driver.

738
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,240
Is he here?

739
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,040
I don't know.

740
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Please wait a moment.

741
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,720
Manager Qian, please come to the front desk.

742
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
The police are here and want to ask you something.

743
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Please wait a moment.

744
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Hello, officer.

745
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,160
Hello

746
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,760
Is there something you need to know?

747
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,040
Where is this person?

748
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
He hasn't come to work yet.

749
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,040
He's our boss's driver.

750
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,240
He usually comes in the afternoon after picking up the boss.

751
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,840
He's a pretty honest person.

752
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,520
Did he do something wrong?

753
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,160
Do you know where he lives?

754
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,120
That place is hard to find.
