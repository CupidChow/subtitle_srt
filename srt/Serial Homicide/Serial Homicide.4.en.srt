1
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,720
Qin Yang

2
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Go block him.

3
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,440
Stop.

4
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
Let go.

5
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Name

6
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,120
Qin Yang

7
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Occupation

8
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,320
Driver

9
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,560
Workplace

10
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
Hotel

11
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Which hotel?

12
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,920
Athena Garden Hotel

13
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Do you know why we're looking for you?

14
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
I didn't scam any donations.

15
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,960
I didn't, I never received any money.

16
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm a victim too.

17
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,960
You police can't wrongly accuse innocent people, right?

18
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
Yes.

19
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
We police never wrongly accuse good people.

20
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Then why did you follow Yin Hui?

21
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Yin Hui

22
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Yin Hui

23
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,440
She's a shameless liar.

24
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,240
She caused the death of my wife and daughter.

25
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
I wish I could drink her blood and eat her flesh.

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
She's dead.

27
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,160
She's dead.

28
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
She was murdered.

29
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,120
You know about this, right?

30
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,160
Of course I know.

31
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,160
I killed her.

32
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
I spent a lot of money

33
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,960
to hire a master from abroad

34
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,480
to put a curse on her.

35
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,920
Good riddance.

36
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,760
She should've died long ago. It's about time.

37
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,040
The master didn't lie to me.

38
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,560
Thank you, master.

39
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
She's finally dead.

40
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
She got what she deserved.

41
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,520
I gave her a chance.

42
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,520
But she didn't cherish it.

43
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,360
Then there was nothing I could do.

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,360
Qin Yang

45
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,240
Can you really face us?

46
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,200
Pay back the money!

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,040
Pay back the money!

48
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Give me back the money that saved my life!

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
Pay back the money!

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,520
Come out and pay back the money!

51
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,400
Pay back the money!

52
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
Pay back the money!

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,880
You saw it too.

54
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,240
This has too much impact on the hospital.

55
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
You should leave quickly.

56
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
Write an IOU for the unpaid medical bills.

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,600
Settle it later.

58
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,280
Director.

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
We can't leave right now.

60
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
The child needs surgery.

61
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,760
If we leave now, the child won't survive.

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
How am I supposed to handle this situation?

63
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Director, we're innocent.

64
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,800
You know that.

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Innocent, innocent.

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,400
This is a hospital.

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,680
It's not a court.

68
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,520
We will find a way to solve this.

69
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,360
We will find a way to solve this.

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,840
That definitely won't work.

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,880
Director.

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,520
Director, I'm begging you.

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Quick, close the door.

74
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,120
I can't do anything in this situation either.

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,160
I suggest you transfer to another hospital.

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
We can't handle it anymore either.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,640
Let's leave it at that.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,600
Director, director.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Process their discharge papers.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,440
Director.

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,600
You can't do that.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Doctors should have compassion.

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,640
You can't ignore the child.

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,000
Director.

85
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,840
Pay back the money.

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,360
Pay back the money, pay back the money.

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,520
Pay back the money, pay back the money.

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Scammer, pay back the money!

89
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
How can you do this?

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
Back then, you pretended to interview me.

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
You did a report.

92
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,400
You contacted Haisheng Charity to raise money for me.

93
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,520
At that time,

94
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,400
I truly thought you were a good person.

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,520
Once you gained enough fame,

96
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
You said I was scamming donations.

97
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
What did I do to be called a scammer?

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,920
Now you openly take the charity funds.

99
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,400
I have to take the blame.

100
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
What are we supposed to do?

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,000
What about my daughter?

102
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
Go explain to those people for me.

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
Calm down.

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
You didn't lose out.

105
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Didn't Tian Haisheng give you some money privately?

106
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
It's not much, but you don't have to pay it back.

107
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,400
You can use the money for your daughter's treatment.

108
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,120
I just realized now.

109
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,840
You're in cahoots with them.

110
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
You're colluding with Tian Haisheng.

111
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
Pretending to be charitable is just a front.

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
It's all just to scam money.

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,200
Now the donors

114
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,680
are all asking me to refund their donations.

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,400
My daughter has no hospital to go to now.

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm going to report you.

117
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,000
Report us? Sure, go ahead.

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
You can do it anytime.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
But let me kindly remind you of something.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
First,

121
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,560
everyone has already seen

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
that you took the charity check.

123
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
If you report us,

124
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,640
it shows you have a guilty conscience.

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,000
Second,

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
I think everything

127
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,000
should have

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,320
priorities.

129
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,200
Right now, your daughter's illness is the most urgent matter.

130
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,800
I can try to help you arrange a hospital.

131
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,640
You can take a car up there.

132
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,600
Close the car door properly for me.

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Xiaoyang has such a good appetite.

134
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
Come on, open your mouth wide.

135
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
Eat a little more.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
You need to eat more to get better quickly.

137
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
Xiaoyang, you’re amazing.

138
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,800
Oh, right.

139
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,040
Eat a bit more, okay?

140
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,600
You’re awake.

141
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Look, Daddy bought this for you.

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,120
When you get better, Mommy will take you to the aquarium.

143
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,640
And to the amusement park.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,560
Wherever you want to go, Mommy will take you.

145
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,720
I won’t complain about the tickets being expensive anymore.

146
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
In a little while.

147
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,360
We’ll do the prettiest little braid.

148
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
Look at your little mouth, food is spilling out.

149
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,080
Xiaoyang.

150
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Honey.

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Honey.

152
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,600
Xiaoyang is already gone.

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,400
I know.

154
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,120
I just want to say what’s on my mind.

155
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
Xiaoyang loved looking pretty the most.

156
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,360
She liked princess dresses.

157
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Go buy one for her.

158
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,320
Okay.

159
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,320
I’ll go buy a dress for Xiaoyang.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,560
The prettiest dress.

161
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
Honey.

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,200
Bad people will get what they deserve, right?

163
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,560
I’m tired.

164
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,560
I’ll sleep for a while.

165
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,360
At that time, my wife

166
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
was holding our daughter

167
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
and just wouldn’t let go, no matter what.

168
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,600
And then, guess what happened?

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,520
My wife

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,440
turned on the gas

171
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
and started a big fire.

172
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
The fire was huge.

173
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,520
You all need to get out of here.

174
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Look, look! There's a fire upstairs!

175
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,080
How did it catch fire?

176
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
Why are you pushing?

177
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,480
That fire burned everything

178
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
to nothing.

179
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,880
Everything was gone.

180
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
So

181
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,600
you want to burn Yin Hui to death too?

182
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
I did want to burn her to death.

183
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
I even dreamed about it.

184
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,560
But I wasn't the one who killed her in the fire.

185
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,760
Please come in.

186
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
Please have a seat.

187
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,840
Bring a few cups of coffee over.

188
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,520
Officers.

189
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
What do you need from me?

190
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,000
Ms. Wu.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,200
We're here to learn about Qin Yang.

192
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
Qin Yang?

193
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,480
To be honest,

194
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I don't really know him well.

195
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,920
He just started working for me.

196
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,600
It's only been three months.

197
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,640
The company does have a personnel registration form for him.

198
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,440
You can ask my assistant for it.

199
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,880
Then tell us about these past three months.

200
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
It's been okay.

201
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,680
You can't expect too much from a driver.

202
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
He was punctual.

203
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
He drove safely.

204
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,600
Didn't talk much.

205
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
That's about it.

206
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,280
Officer,

207
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,400
did he do something wrong?

208
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
I heard you took him away.

209
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,480
We just need him to cooperate with the investigation.

210
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,960
On the night of September 10th,

211
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,240
what time did Qin Yang get off work?

212
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,440
That's a tough one for me.

213
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
I have so much to deal with every day.

214
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,160
What time the driver gets off work,

215
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I really can't remember.

216
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Please try to think carefully.

217
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,760
This is very important for him.

218
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,040
Oh, right.

219
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,680
On September 10th,

220
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,480
wasn't it Mr. Guo's birthday?

221
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,240
Yes, Mr. Wu.

222
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
The event ended at one o'clock that day.

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,120
So Qin Yang took me home, it was about

224
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
half past one.

225
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,760
Please check again.

226
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,080
From 8 to 10 p.m. on September 9th,

227
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
where were you?

228
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,960
Where was Qin Yang?

229
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,560
On September 9th, Mr. Wu went to Wenlu Mountain.

230
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,960
He stayed overnight and enjoyed the hot springs.

231
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Qin Yang drove the car.

232
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,440
At the time you mentioned,

233
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,480
we should have been at Wenlu Mountain Resort.

234
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,160
Did you leave the resort at all?

235
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,560
No, I shared a room with him.

236
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,160
After nine o'clock, we didn't do anything else.

237
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,160
We stayed in the room the whole time.

238
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,440
Later, we went outside.

239
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,880
We soaked in the outdoor hot springs.

240
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,600
We returned to Luzhou the next morning.

241
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,840
Alright, got it.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,640
Da Kuan and the others

243
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,440
checked with the property management at Wu Xinxin's community.

244
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
The surveillance footage shows

245
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,800
Wu Xinxin's car

246
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
entered the parking lot at 1:23 a.m. on September 11th.

247
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
It drove into the parking lot.

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Qin Yang got out and opened the door for Wu Xinxin.

249
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,840
After Wu Xinxin left,

250
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,440
Qin Yang smoked a cigarette outside the car.

251
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,760
He left the parking lot at 1:35 a.m.

252
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
The times all match up.

253
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,640
I still think

254
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
there's something wrong with Qin Yang.

255
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
It is pretty strange.

256
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Lift up your shirt.

257
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Hang in there.

258
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,160
Still afraid?

259
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,160
What?

260
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Shoot.

261
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,360
Go take another look at their house.

262
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,480
What's wrong?

263
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,560
This thing

264
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,480
I've seen the exact same one at Hu Yi's house.

265
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Preserved flower

266
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
Preserved flower

267
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,480
This kind of flower is chemically treated

268
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
so it won't decay for a long time.

269
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,560
Are these things all black?

270
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,160
They're usually the original color of the plant.

271
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Black is very rare.

272
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Since it's so rare,

273
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,280
both Qin Yang's and Zhou Guifang's homes have it.

274
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,360
That's quite a coincidence.

275
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Jin Chen

276
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,200
Captain Ran, we've found the igniter in the Yin Hui case.

277
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,120
Come on, let's cook something special.

278
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,480
You came here just to play on the computer.

279
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
The programming expert volunteered to help.

280
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
It's more important than you.

281
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,640
Nothing is more important than eating.

282
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
This is the latest model of robot vacuum on the market.

283
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
It can be controlled remotely.

284
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,040
Remotely?

285
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,960
How remote are we talking?

286
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,440
Like, when you're at the station,

287
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
just tap the app on your phone,

288
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,240
and it will start running at your home.

289
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,440
The robot found at the scene

290
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
was modified to add a remote control device.

291
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,000
This one right here.

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,080
The culprit first remotely directed the robot

293
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
to the spot where they wanted the fire to start.

294
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
Then they used the remote device

295
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,680
to cause a short circuit inside the robot.

296
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,240
Even the tiniest spark

297
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
would ignite the gasoline-filled room.

298
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,480
So you see,

299
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,440
this high-tech stuff

300
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
isn't always a good thing.

301
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,720
That robot vacuum,

302
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
is it this brand?

303
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,280
Yes.

304
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,040
No matter the living conditions at Zhou Guifang's home,

305
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,240
or the financial situation,

306
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
a robot vacuum at this price point showing up

307
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,400
is definitely suspicious.

308
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,680
But we can't rule out the possibility of coincidence.

309
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Zhou Guifang.

310
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,080
Qin Yang's black preserved flower.

311
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,480
Zhou Guifang, Yin Hui, robot vacuum.

312
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,360
That's too much of a coincidence.

313
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
Too many coincidences become inevitable.

314
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,760
What's the situation with Cheng Feng's electronic lock?

315
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,360
There's no sign the electronic lock was forced open.

316
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,840
I've contacted the manufacturer.

317
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,080
The lock was burned out.

318
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,920
We'll send it in for inspection tomorrow.

319
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,360
Any leads on the software side?

320
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,560
Tang Jun.

321
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,960
Tomorrow, you go with Cheng Feng.

322
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Afraid he'll lose it?

323
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,560
Unless there's a special situation during fieldwork,

324
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
there must be at least two people.

325
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,720
This rule—

326
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
You're familiar with it, right?

327
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,280
Alright.

328
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
Everyone's worked hard lately.

329
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,600
It's my treat.

330
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,520
Let's go for a late-night snack.

331
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Don't bother.

332
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,680
Not tired?

333
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,920
Let's take your car.

334
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,840
My car has driving restrictions.

335
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,800
Let's go.

336
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
We all have tasks to do.

337
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,720
We can't drink alcohol.

338
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
Let's use soft drinks instead.

339
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,320
Everyone's been working hard lately.

340
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,040
Come on.

341
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Here's a toast to both of you.

342
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,520
Say whatever's on your mind.

343
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,720
Why are you being so polite?

344
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,880
Not giving me any respect, huh?

345
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,720
Tang Jun.

346
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,800
If there were any misunderstandings before,

347
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
please forgive me.

348
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,040
No need.

349
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,960
Come on, Cheng Feng.

350
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,760
Can't you act a bit more like a man?

351
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,840
Why are you always so awkward? Who are you trying to impress?

352
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
You're actually right.

353
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
I really am awkward.

354
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,720
Who is he?

355
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,920
Gao Ang's son-in-law.

356
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,160
Who is Gao Ang?

357
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,080
The person who caused our mentor's death.

358
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,360
Let me tell you, Ran Yue.

359
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,320
It's been eight years.

360
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,840
I often dream about investigating this case.

361
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,520
Waiter.

362
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,720
Bring me a bottle of wine.

363
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,560
Sure.

364
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,280
You have to report to your superior before drinking.

365
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Did you know that?

366
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,360
Aren't you the superior?

367
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,400
You know,

368
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,360
my parents died when I was little.

369
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,480
My mentor took good care of me.

370
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,080
It was him

371
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040
who taught me how to be a good police officer.

372
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,200
He was like a father to me.

373
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
He's gone.

374
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,760
It's been eight years.

375
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,680
I've never been able to give myself an explanation.

376
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,840
Every time I go out on duty, I'm afraid I might die out there.

377
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm afraid if I die, no one will investigate his case.

378
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm afraid if I die, I won't have the face to see him.

379
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,880
I know.

380
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,440
I don't have solid evidence.

381
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,000
But I'm sure.

382
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
He's definitely involved in something.

383
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,880
I've said it before.

384
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
I absolutely won't let him go.

385
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,040
When the time comes,

386
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,640
I hope you

387
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,880
won't think I'm being heartless.

388
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,120
I don't know what Uncle Gao did back then.

389
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,280
I only know he paid the price for his mistakes.

390
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,080
Xiaoqiu was also affected by this.

391
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,320
Her relationship with him became very strained.

392
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,280
She even changed her surname to her mother's.

393
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,400
Tang Jun.

394
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm a police officer too.

395
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,160
If you really have evidence against Uncle Gao,

396
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,760
not just you,

397
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,680
I would arrest him myself.

398
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,840
But no matter what,

399
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,440
this has nothing to do with me or Xiaoqiu.

400
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,640
There are plenty of good daughters out there.

401
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,440
Why choose Gao Ang's daughter?

402
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,560
Ren Xiaoqiu is a good girl.

403
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,080
If you've found her, you should cherish her.

404
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,040
Unlike you,

405
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,680
you don't know how to cherish a good girl even when she's right beside you.

406
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,160
I'm going to the bathroom.

407
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,680
What does he mean?

408
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,440
He misunderstood our relationship.

409
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
Did you understand what I just said?

410
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,760
Don't make that face.

411
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,640
How can the task force work together in the future?

412
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,680
Alright, don't worry about my attitude.

413
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,640
I promise you,

414
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,440
I won't hold up anything.

415
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,240
What about you?

416
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,360
I haven't rested well these past few days.

417
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,480
Go back and get some good rest.

418
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,720
Don't forget to apply the medicine.

419
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,280
This is the electronic lock system.

420
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,280
Here are all the records since it was installed.

421
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,080
There are two registered fingerprints.

422
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,320
What's this?

423
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,320
This is the record of temporary passwords.

424
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,960
It means that during this period, the owner

425
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,760
used our electronic lock's software

426
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,440
to generate temporary passwords.

427
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
If some guests need temporary access,

428
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,760
they also use this password.

429
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,440
Of course, the validity period of the temporary password

430
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,680
can be set freely.

431
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
Please print out a copy of this.

432
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,880
Okay.

433
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,480
This password follows a pattern.

434
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,320
It updates every three days.

435
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,120
According to Tian Haisheng's statement,

436
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,040
that apartment was where he and Yin Hui met in private.

437
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,720
No third person knew about it.

438
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,080
But

439
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,160
someone else who could regularly use this password

440
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
there's one more person.

441
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,040
The cleaner.

442
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Get in the car.

443
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,280
Have you seen the cleaner at Yin Hui's house?

444
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Is it this person?

445
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,840
I don't really remember.

446
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,960
Miss Yin has very high standards for cleaning.

447
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,640
She wasn't satisfied with the person we arranged.

448
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,320
She always hires someone from outside.

449
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Manager Li from the engineering department just repaired the pipes.

450
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,720
He found this on Miss Yin's floor.

451
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,360
Give it to me.

452
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,240
Hello?

453
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,720
Part of Yin Hui's phone chip has been recovered.

454
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,120
Many apps on the phone are locked with passwords.

455
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,840
Send it to me first.

456
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Can this be unlocked?

457
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,920
It's pretty secure.

458
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
This is easy.

459
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,560
Most people use the same password for their apps.

460
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,680
So by programming to compare these apps,

461
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
we can unlock them quickly.

462
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm coming, I'm coming.

463
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,080
Officer

464
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Didn't we finish asking about Sun Bin last time?

465
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,120
Do you know him?

466
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
No, I don't.

467
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,240
September 10th

468
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,000
After leaving here

469
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Where did you go?

470
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,240
I went out to work.

471
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,160
It was a job assigned by the company.

472
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
Which company assigned you the job?

473
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,720
Several housekeeping companies assigned me jobs.

474
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,920
I can't remember clearly.

475
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,120
Where did you go?

476
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I forgot.

477
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
And after you finished working?

478
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Where did you go then?

479
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,440
I really don't remember.

480
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,040
I don't remember anything.

481
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,840
Let me help you recall.

482
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
September 10th

483
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
We invited you to assist with the investigation.

484
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,720
But you

485
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,880
kept checking the time.

486
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,640
Because you received

487
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,600
a work order.

488
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,480
You remember this, right?

489
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
That order

490
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
told you what time

491
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,120
and where to go.

492
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,080
Zhou Guifang

493
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Since we've invited you here again today,

494
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,840
you should know why.

495
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,040
We already have all the details of your movements on September 10th.

496
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,520
All your activity that day.

497
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Now we're giving you a chance to speak.

498
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,160
This is your opportunity.

499
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,000
Only by telling the truth

500
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,200
can you quickly

501
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,360
clarify the responsibilities that aren't yours

502
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,120
and clear your name.

503
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,760
If you try to take chances,

504
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,560
you'll only face greater legal risks.

505
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,440
Do you understand?

506
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,560
That order

507
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,040
was for me to go on the night of the 10th

508
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,240
at seven o'clock

509
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,720
to Room 301, Building 15, Xinhua Lane

510
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,440
After I left here

511
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,320
I went home to get some things

512
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
and then hurried to that place

513
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,040
That place has an electronic door lock

514
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,160
so I entered using a temporary password

515
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
After I went in, I replaced the robot vacuum

516
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,120
and hid behind the curtains

517
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,960
Yin Hui came back at seven thirty

518
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,800
I used a towel soaked in ether

519
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,080
to make her pass out

520
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,640
I tied her to a chair with an iron chain

521
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,120
and used a camera

522
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,600
to record everything

523
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,480
At eleven o'clock

524
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,120
I poured gasoline on her and on the floor

525
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,800
What happened after that

526
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,480
I... I don't know

527
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,720
The next day

528
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,560
I heard that Yin Hui's house caught fire

529
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Yin Hui

530
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,440
was burned to death

531
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,400
I was terrified

532
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,080
Officer

533
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,800
Please believe me

534
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,120
I really didn't set the fire

535
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,880
He... he

536
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,400
He said he would guarantee my safety

537
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,920
He

538
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,440
Officer

539
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,000
Who is he
