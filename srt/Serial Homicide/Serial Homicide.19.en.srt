1
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,040
There are no outsiders here now.

2
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,000
How long do you plan to keep running?

3
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Do you still trust me?

4
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,200
I trust you.

5
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,160
But what are you doing now?

6
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,080
You're committing a crime.

7
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
You're a wanted person now.

8
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,080
How can I trust you?

9
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,160
Then do you still believe

10
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,400
that all police are righteous?

11
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
My mentor believed.

12
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
He lost his life.

13
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm about to catch

14
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,160
the person who killed my mentor.

15
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
I can't see him.

16
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
But I know

17
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
he's right here among us.

18
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
This time,

19
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,240
no matter how dangerous it is,

20
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,640
no matter the cost,

21
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
I will find out the truth.

22
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
Don't worry.

23
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,360
I once swore an oath too.

24
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,840
I will never forget

25
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,040
that I am a police officer.

26
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,760
I also won't forget

27
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,960
the responsibility on my shoulders.

28
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,800
Help me one more time.

29
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
Cheng Feng.

30
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
The results are out.

31
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
It really is

32
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,680
Ren Xiaoqiu.

33
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
Who is it?

34
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,880
Cheng Feng

35
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,800
Why are you here?

36
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm here at the precinct to assist with a case.

37
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,120
You know each other?

38
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,040
My fiancée.

39
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,840
Ren Xiaoqiu

40
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,080
Xiaoqiu

41
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
I still have something urgent to do.

42
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,480
I need to head back for a bit.

43
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,120
Goodbye.

44
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,120
Goodbye.

45
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,280
She called me that day.

46
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,160
Hello, the number you dialed—

47
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,280
I didn't answer.

48
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
My condolences.

49
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Cheng Tou.

50
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Cheng Tou.

51
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
The bomb at the scene—

52
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,920
was made very professionally.

53
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
He connected the bomb's detonator

54
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,600
to the light switch.

55
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,440
The blast was precisely targeted.

56
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
So I suspect

57
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
the perpetrator must have

58
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,360
expertise in directional blasting.

59
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,240
And is very familiar with the Gao family’s electrical system.

60
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
The explosives were made by the perpetrator.

61
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,880
There were still traces at the scene

62
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,320
of a large amount of unburned carbon and nitrate powder.

63
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
Go home and have a good talk with your dad.

64
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Wait.

65
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm not going, I'm not going.

66
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
One, two, three, I'm leaving.

67
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm off.

68
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,920
Sorry.

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,040
It's fine, it's fine, let me do it.

70
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,840
Sorry.

71
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,360
Sorry.

72
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,440
It's okay.

73
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Officer Cheng.

74
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,280
Long time no see, Officer Cheng.

75
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Long time no see.

76
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,360
Charcoal is pretty scarce these days.

77
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,400
Are you planning to—

78
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,840
have a barbecue?

79
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,600
My house is right here.

80
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,200
You can come over for barbecue tonight.

81
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
No need, my house is just up there too.

82
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,920
Maybe next time.

83
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Thanks.

84
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,800
Cheng Feng from the Criminal Investigation Team

85
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,080
Could you please help me check

86
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
Chen Xiaonan's family information

87
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
Ruhai Real Estate President's Office

88
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
Chen Xiaonan

89
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,040
Xishan Village

90
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,120
Haonan

91
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,720
Help me look up Xishan Village from that year

92
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
the case file for the forced demolition

93
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,520
Okay

94
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,720
Cheng

95
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,040
That's her

96
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,200
She's here

97
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,720
She's coming, she's coming

98
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,880
Officer Cheng

99
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Officer Ran

100
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
You, you all

101
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,400
Come in, come in

102
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
Please come in

103
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,400
Please have a seat

104
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
Please, sit down

105
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,840
Take a seat

106
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,200
Sorry about this

107
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,920
In my home

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,760
I only have water

109
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
I hope you don't mind

110
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,680
Thank you

111
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,680
Excuse me.

112
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,440
May I use your bathroom?

113
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,200
Sure.

114
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,760
It's just through that door, turn right.

115
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,840
Yesterday at 3 p.m.

116
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,840
What were you doing?

117
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,840
I was working from home at the time.

118
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
I didn't go out.

119
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,640
I did go out.

120
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,760
I was rushing to finish some documents.

121
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,360
Then,

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,120
I suddenly heard a very loud

123
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,840
explosion in the building.

124
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
So I went out to take a look.

125
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,400
I found that

126
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
there had been an explosion in the building.

127
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Officer Cheng,

128
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
that explosion,

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,720
it wasn't caused by someone, was it?

130
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,880
Why are you asking so many questions?

131
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,760
What do you want to know?

132
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
I'm just curious.

133
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,360
After all, we're all neighbors.

134
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
It's natural to be scared.

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,640
Cheng Feng,

136
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
we still have things to do.

137
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,560
Thank you for your cooperation.

138
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
No problem.

139
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,640
We're leaving now.

140
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,840
Take care on your way out.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,280
I didn't get any useful information.

142
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,680
Not necessarily.

143
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,960
What's this?

144
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
The air from her apartment.

145
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,880
In the floating dust sample from Chen Xiaonan's home

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
there are indeed traces of carbon and nitrate.

147
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,560
Dad

148
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,960
Chen Xiaonan is wanted

149
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,480
Stop

150
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,240
Rewind

151
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,720
Five thirty-two

152
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,440
Captain Ran

153
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
Chen Xiaonan left at five thirty-two

154
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,440
She had luggage with her

155
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,520
She’s probably trying to escape

156
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,240
Understood

157
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,520
If there’s any information about Chen Xiaonan

158
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
Report to the police immediately

159
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Okay

160
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
Officer

161
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Did Sister Xiaonan do something bad?

162
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,480
She

163
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,160
Is always very polite to us

164
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,760
And

165
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,560
Always brings us food and drinks

166
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,640
She doesn’t seem like a bad person at all

167
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,760
What makes someone good

168
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,560
And what makes someone bad

169
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
Driver

170
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
To the airport

171
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,040
Alright

172
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,840
The taxi driver reported it.

173
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Chen Xiaonan is heading to the airport.

174
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,760
Intercept and arrest immediately.

175
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Sir, please drive faster.

176
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
We're already going fast.

177
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Go even faster.

178
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,320
Any faster and we'll be speeding.

179
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Lu AF0336, pull over.

180
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,120
Lu AF0336, pull over.

181
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,160
Lu AF0336, pull over.

182
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,600
Police.

183
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Police, don't move.

184
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,040
Get out of the car.

185
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,720
Get out of the car.

186
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,760
Get out of the car.

187
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
Chen Xiaonan.

188
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,040
You are suspected of involvement in the Guangmingli community explosion case.

189
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,880
You are now being summoned.

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,960
Please cooperate.

191
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,720
We meet again.

192
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,520
Guo Xiaonan.

193
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,520
No one has called me that in a long time.

194
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,280
Is that so?

195
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,120
Your father, Guo Chuncheng,

196
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,520
during the forced demolition case in Xishan Village years ago,

197
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,440
died with his eyes open.

198
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,960
As his only daughter,

199
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,760
you swore to avenge him.

200
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,800
It was because of this

201
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,720
that the Erinyes organization

202
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,040
took advantage of your weakness.

203
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,680
They persuaded you to become their weapon.

204
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,400
They killed Sun Ruhai for you.

205
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,720
So,

206
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,400
your target in the murder exchange

207
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,080
was Gao Ang.

208
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
But do you know

209
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,560
that you killed

210
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,320
a kind and innocent girl?

211
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,720
You killed a righteous and outspoken journalist.

212
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,040
Because of her,

213
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,040
the Sun Bin rape case

214
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,200
was brought to light.

215
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,720
And also because of her,

216
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
Sun Ruhai's

217
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,120
forced demolition case could be brought up again.

218
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,600
You should be grateful to her.

219
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,880
But you killed her.

220
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,680
I never intended to harm Ren Xiaoqiu.

221
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,760
I never thought she would die because of me.

222
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
When she went to Gao Ang's house,

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,520
it was already too late for me to stop it.

224
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,280
Officer Ran

225
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,200
A life for a life.

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,120
I'll accept whatever sentence I get.

227
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,640
A life for a life.

228
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
A life for a life.

229
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
Fighting evil with evil.

230
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,440
This is your jerk

231
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,720
organization's underlying logic.

232
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,280
How to sentence me,

233
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
that's up to the judge.

234
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,240
Go ahead, speak.

235
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,200
Who gave you the order?

236
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,320
I don't know.

237
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,320
All I know is

238
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,320
our organization's leader

239
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,560
is codenamed "Manager."

240
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,840
I've never met him.

241
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,200
How do you contact him?

242
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,520
Every time,

243
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,880
every time,

244
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,560
he contacts me in a different way.

245
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,880
Is it a man or a woman?

246
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,080
I don't know.

247
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,120
He uses a voice changer.

248
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
I can't tell.

249
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,040
Speak.

250
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,720
Cheng Feng.

251
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,480
What else do you know?

252
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,320
Tell me everything.

253
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,920
Cheng Feng, you go out first.

254
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,480
Say it.

255
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
Take him out.

256
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,840
Speak.

257
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,800
Take him out.

258
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,600
Speak.

259
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,440
Speak.

260
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,920
Get out.

261
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,480
Cheng Feng, Cheng Feng.

262
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,000
Let go.

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Cheng Feng, you're a police officer.

264
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,720
Listen to me.

265
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,840
According to the regulations,

266
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,840
You need to recuse yourself.

267
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,440
Trust me.

268
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,800
The law will give Xiao Qiu justice.

269
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm fine.

270
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,040
Chen Xiaonan has already confessed.

271
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
She is indeed

272
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,520
a member of the Erinyes plan.

273
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,440
This organization

274
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,960
claims to punish evil and promote good

275
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,920
and uses ritualistic killings

276
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,560
to judge those they consider guilty.

277
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,240
So far,

278
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,160
Sun Ruhai,

279
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,040
Wu Xinxin,

280
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,520
Lu Junfei, An Wenju,

281
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
and Yin Hui—

282
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,240
these victims

283
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,360
are all connected to

284
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,840
the Shisong murder case from years ago.

285
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,040
So if someone set this up

286
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,600
to avenge Shisong,

287
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,160
then there must be someone

288
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,760
who knows all the details of Shisong's murder.

289
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
If nothing unexpected happens,

290
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,080
this person

291
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,880
is the true mastermind

292
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,000
behind the entire Erinyes plan.

293
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,920
Where is Wu Xinxin now?

294
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,360
She's being held in the detention center.

295
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,680
Find a way to get her to talk.

296
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
Yes.

297
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,760
Wu Xinxin,

298
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
please think carefully.

299
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,920
Back then, when you and Sun Ruhai

300
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,320
and An Wenju plotted to kill Shisong,

301
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
was there anyone else who might have known?

302
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,560
No one else could have known.

303
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,280
That night,

304
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,520
to make it easier to commit the crime,

305
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,000
I sent everyone away.

306
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,960
Even the housekeeper, Aunt Zhang,

307
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,040
I found an excuse to send her home.

308
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
So it's impossible for anyone else to know.

309
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Aunt Zhang.

310
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
What do you need?

311
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,040
From the Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

312
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,960
Police.

313
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,400
What's the matter?

314
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm a model citizen.

315
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,920
I've never done anything

316
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,280
sneaky or illegal.

317
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,160
Is your mother here?

318
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,040
The old lady?

319
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,920
I cut ties with her a long time ago.

320
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,080
She used to

321
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,200
work as a nanny for a big boss.

322
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,440
Then the boss died.

323
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
She left their house.

324
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
She didn't bring back a single cent.

325
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,040
She gave birth to me but never raised me.

326
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,800
Look at those rich kids.

327
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
They live such carefree lives.

328
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,360
I'm about to become a "negative generation" myself.

329
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,120
Negative as in below zero.

330
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,520
Where is she now?

331
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,560
She moved into a nursing home by herself.

332
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,440
At that

333
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,760
one near Sunshine Wharf.

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,880
So you just let her fend for herself in the nursing home?

335
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,800
What else could I do?

336
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,520
What right does that old woman have

337
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
to expect me to see her off at the end?

338
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,880
The evening breeze gently brushes Penghu Bay

339
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,080
White waves chase the sandy shore

340
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,800
There are no coconut groves basking in the setting sun

341
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,800
Just a stretch of deep blue sea

342
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,720
That is Zhang Cuifang

343
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,280
She was the one, seven years ago,

344
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,920
who was entrusted to us and brought here

345
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,320
It wasn't this bad when she first arrived

346
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,760
Three years ago

347
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,360
she suddenly had a fall

348
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,360
After that

349
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,720
her health

350
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,920
started to decline

351
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,240
Two years ago

352
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,240
she was also diagnosed with

353
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,680
Alzheimer's disease

354
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,960
So now

355
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,640
she doesn't recognize anyone anymore

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Cactus

357
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,880
The girl who brought her here

358
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
do you still have her contact information?

359
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,880
There was also an old captain

360
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,280
He hasn't come since that time

361
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,320
But the yearly fees are always transferred in advance

362
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,200
Officer Ran

363
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Officer Cheng

364
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Lawyer Chu

365
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
What a coincidence

366
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,400
Let me do it

367
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,440
This one's already dirty

368
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
I come here

369
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,440
as a volunteer.

370
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,760
Are you looking for Aunt Zhang?

371
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,960
Is there something you need?

372
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,560
We have an old case

373
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,400
and want to ask Aunt Zhang about it.

374
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,800
But seeing her current condition,

375
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm afraid she can't provide

376
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,760
any valuable clues.

377
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,440
She's had a hard life.

378
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,200
No one has visited her all these years.

379
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,400
She's all alone.

380
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,640
Are you close with Aunt Zhang?

381
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,640
I've helped her clean her room before.

382
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,520
Lawyer Chu,

383
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,600
she's beautiful and kind-hearted.

384
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,640
She often comes to our nursing home to help out.

385
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,640
All the elderly here really like her.

386
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,680
Grandpa Lu,

387
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,800
sing another one, please.

388
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,640
Sing another one, please.

389
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Grandpa Lu, what would you like to hear?

390
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
I want to hear

391
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,880
that one...

392
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,360
"Surging Waves,"

393
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,560
"Flowing Waves,"

394
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
That's too difficult.

395
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
That's beyond my ability.

396
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Can you pick another one?

397
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,800
Just sing one, please.

398
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,520
Alright, alright.

399
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll sing, then.

400
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,120
I'll excuse myself for a moment.

401
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,800
The one you want to hear is

402
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
"Shanghai Bund."

403
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,480
Director,

404
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
can I take a look at the transfer records?

405
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,960
No problem.

406
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,040
Come with me.

407
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,480
You two, please have a seat first.

408
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,680
Get that Zhang Cuifang...

409
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,480
Print out a copy of the transfer record.

410
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,680
Officers,

411
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,160
This is Zhang Cuifang's transfer record.

412
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,200
These are all foreign virtual accounts.

413
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,040
And each account is different.

414
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,720
Could it be that Zhang's mother has relatives abroad?

415
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,520
Does she have other relatives overseas?

416
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,040
According to her son,

417
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
It's unlikely, given their family situation.

418
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,680
The only possibility

419
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,320
is

420
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,160
Shi Rong.

421
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,040
That's right.

422
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,480
Although right now

423
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,840
we can't find any information about this girl,

424
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
I suspect

425
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,240
this girl is Shi Song's younger sister.

426
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,280
Shi Rong.

427
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,800
Shi Rong was indeed

428
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,760
sent abroad by her brother a long time ago.

429
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,360
Hello.

430
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm here to pay

431
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,280
the fees for next quarter.

432
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,640
Alright.

433
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,760
Many of the elderly in this nursing home

434
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,120
have no relatives.

435
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,360
My law firm

436
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
has set up a charity fund here

437
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,000
to pay for

438
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,720
some of their expenses.

439
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,640
Also,

440
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,440
it's to ensure

441
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,280
their most basic living needs.

442
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,040
That girl—

443
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,840
have you found out anything about her?

444
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,360
Lawyer Chu,

445
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,320
you should know our rules.

446
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,000
We can't disclose too much.

447
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,680
Understood.

448
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,880
I'll let you get back to work.

449
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Lawyer Chu,

450
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,480
the total is 26,000 yuan.

451
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,040
Please open your payment code.

452
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,800
It's done.

453
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,560
Director,

454
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,680
Aunt Zhang,

455
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,280
when she was brought to the hospital,

456
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,400
did you see the person who brought her?

457
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,000
We were acting on a request.

458
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,400
She was brought directly from home

459
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,720
to the nursing home.

460
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,800
Have you seen this person?

461
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,400
No.

462
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,000
Jun.

463
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
This road

464
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,000
is Siping Street in the old city.

465
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,560
The surrounding area is all demolition zones.

466
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,800
There aren't many residents.

467
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,040
There’s very little surveillance.

468
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,600
There are a lot of blind spots.

469
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,160
If you go down this road

470
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,560
you’ll reach the abandoned shipyard.

471
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,240
Judging by Jun’s movements,

472
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,960
he’s probably heading to the abandoned shipyard.

473
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,120
This

474
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,320
should be reported to Director Zhao.

475
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,400
Found him.

476
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,480
Good.

477
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,000
Make the arrest.

478
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,760
Director Chen.

479
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,600
Xiao Tang has been found.

480
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,680
Found him.

481
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
He’s heading toward the old shipyard in the old city.

482
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,040
This kid is really slippery.

483
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,320
That area is complicated.

484
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,880
There’s little surveillance.

485
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
It’s a good place to hide.

486
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,920
Director Chen.

487
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,000
I’ll go deploy the police.

488
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,800
Requesting approval.

489
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,840
Approved.

490
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,680
Yes.

491
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,440
Xiao Pang.

492
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,520
Where are Ranyu and Cheng Feng?

493
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Director Zhao.

494
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,480
Captain Ran and Cheng

495
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,600
went to the nursing home.

496
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,800
They should be back soon.

497
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,960
Director Zhao.

498
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,320
We’ve found Tang Jun’s trail.

499
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Ranyu.

500
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,720
Take your team immediately

501
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,600
to the abandoned shipyard in the old city to make the arrest.
