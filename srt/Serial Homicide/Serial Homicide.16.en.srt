1
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,960
Come.

2
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,120
Every single one counts.

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,760
Go.

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,240
Every single one counts.

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,320
Come.

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,920
It's you.

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
Every single one counts.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,120
Try touching me.

9
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,120
Big Brother.

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,280
Big Brother, don't.

11
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
I was wrong, Brother Fei.

12
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Please forgive me, Big Brother.

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,320
Big Brother.

14
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,600
Please forgive me, Big Brother.

15
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Brother Fei.

16
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,480
I told you to destroy the gun.

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
You hid it.

18
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,480
The gun wasn't destroyed.

19
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,120
Now someone has died because of it.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
What should we do about this?

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,120
Brother Fei.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,800
I know I was wrong.

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,080
You saw it too.

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,120
They all bullied us.

25
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
I acted on impulse.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,720
I just...

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
I really didn't mean it.

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,600
Big Brother.

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,680
Brother Bie, help me.

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,240
Brother Bie.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,040
Brother Bie.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,680
Help me.

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,360
Brother Bie.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,040
Brother Bie.

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,960
Go away.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Help me, Brother Bie.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,560
Give me a chance.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,080
Brother Fei.

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,960
Brother Bie.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,920
Brother Bie.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,080
Big Brother

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,080
He's not breathing.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200
Let's bury him.

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,320
Okay.

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
Do it cleanly.

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
Understood.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,920
Da Kuan, Yi Fei

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
Come with me to search Tang Jun's house.

49
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Xiao Pang

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,920
Track Tang Jun's phone.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,760
It's Director Zhao.

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,800
You two go together.

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Zhang Haonan, stay here.

54
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,440
Pull up the surveillance footage.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
Arrest him on sight.

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,040
Do you believe it?

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,120
If I believed it,

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
would I be calling you?

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Come back first.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,280
Don't shoulder everything by yourself.

61
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,560
Officer Tang

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm at Tongde now.

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,480
Okay.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
I just finished at the Tongde courthouse.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
We're over by Mingnan Alley.

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
Let's meet at Qi Hong Clinic.

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
It's about the gravel yard case.

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,280
It's a bit complicated.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,240
I'll tell you in person.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
I'm hanging up.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,760
Okay.

72
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
Haonan

73
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
The traffic command center

74
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,040
has already located Jun's vehicle.

75
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,760
The route and live footage

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,160
have been sent to us.

77
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,760
Heading toward Tongde.

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,960
Set up a roadblock.

79
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,440
Drive away, now! Go!

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,480
Okay.

81
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,720
No one.

82
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,080
Chase.

83
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
Hurry.

84
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,960
Go.

85
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,000
Stop.

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,840
Stop.

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,760
Don't run.

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,520
Officer Tang.

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
Get in the car.

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,160
What's going on here?

91
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Hurry up.

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
He ran away.

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,640
Yes.

94
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,680
They only found

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,480
on a roadside in Chaoyang District, Tongde City

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,200
Tang Jun's abandoned car.

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
The first victim, Sun Bin.

98
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,840
Did you kill him?

99
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,120
Yes.

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,520
I killed him.

101
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
The utility knife used in the crime

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,440
is in the cabinet in the studio.

103
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,960
You can go look for it.

104
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,520
What's wrong?

105
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,680
Why did you kill him?

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
I still feel like something's off here.

107
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,920
I was avenging Zhou Guifang.

108
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
What's off about it?

109
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,320
Zhao Lingjing definitely didn't tell the truth.

110
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
He must be hiding some important information.

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,680
Where exactly did things go wrong?

112
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,920
If only Tang Jun were here.

113
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
He's the one with all the clever ideas.

114
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,640
Let's go see him again.

115
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,280
It's a bit chaotic.

116
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,280
Officer Tang.

117
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't worry.

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,280
This clinic.

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,960
It’s run by a good friend of my dad’s.

120
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
It’s very safe.

121
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,840
That sand and gravel mine case—

122
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,120
What’s the situation with it?

123
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,280
That day,

124
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,000
they say two groups were fighting over the sand and gravel mine.

125
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
They started fighting after a disagreement.

126
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,360
One of them, a thug named Maoxie,

127
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,000
suddenly pulled out a gun.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
He shot one of the other group’s guys

129
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
and killed him.

130
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,520
After that,

131
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,720
didn’t the Tongde police also release

132
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,800
a police bulletin about it?

133
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
They say

134
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,600
that gun

135
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,480
was a lost firearm from a case eight years ago.

136
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,920
How do you know all this so clearly?

137
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,400
My client

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
did some business with the sand and gravel mine in Tongde.

139
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,840
Plus, he’s

140
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
a well-known figure in the area.

141
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
So I’ve heard some inside information.

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,200
I’m just

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
reporting the situation to you, Officer Tang.

144
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,680
Officer Tang,

145
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,280
let me get you some water.

146
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,440
Please, have a seat.

147
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Alright.

148
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Zhao Lingjing

149
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
I'm asking you

150
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,320
Eurynius

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,240
The principle is to exchange murders

152
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,080
Right?

153
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
Yes

154
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
Then according to your logic

155
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,400
Why didn't Tang Jun carry out the exchange murder?

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,640
You guys investigating the case

157
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,680
have gotten confused

158
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,200
Tang Jun is the final link in the whole plan

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,160
Is there still room for an exchange?

160
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,000
As long as Tang Jun kills Gao Ang

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
all of this

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
will be over

163
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Officer Tang

164
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
I couldn't reach you by phone

165
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,720
I couldn't find you anywhere

166
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
I lost my phone

167
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,400
I have a phone here

168
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
I don't use this number often

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
You can use it for now

170
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,920
Thank you

171
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,520
That guy Maoxie

172
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
What's his background?

173
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,720
He seems to be

174
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,080
just a team leader at Yuanshan Gravel Mine.

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,440
Can we find him?

176
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,200
It might be difficult.

177
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Because after he fired the gun that day,

178
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
he disappeared.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
He probably ran away.

180
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,360
Does he have any

181
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,600
family or anything?

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
I heard

183
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
he has no parents.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
But I heard he might have an older brother.

185
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,320
But they've basically lost contact.

186
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,880
Can we leave through the back door?

187
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,880
I'm going to the gravel mine.

188
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
I'll go with you.

189
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,120
Why are you going?

190
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,480
It's dangerous.

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,880
What's there to be afraid of?

192
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,480
Don't I have

193
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
your protection, Officer Tang?

194
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,320
Can you act?

195
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Act?

196
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,840
There's definitely something wrong with Zhao Lingjing.

197
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
The Erinias Plan

198
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,360
At first, they went to great lengths for the exchange murders.

199
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,880
Such tightly connected exchange murders,

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
should end in a closed loop.

201
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
What caused this plan

202
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,440
to break at the last link?

203
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,440
We need to figure this out.

204
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
Any news from Tang Jun?

205
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,560
Cheng Tou

206
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,600
I don't believe it.

207
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
Jun isn't a suspect.

208
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Every time we investigate a case,

209
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
or make an arrest,

210
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,880
he's always at the front.

211
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,960
Whenever something happens, he steps up right away.

212
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
Someone like him

213
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,120
couldn't possibly be a suspect.

214
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't believe it either.

215
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,400
Since neither of us believes it,

216
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,960
let's find out the truth

217
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,320
and clear his name.

218
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,640
Hey.

219
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Hey, what about me?

220
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
What are you doing?

221
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,320
Who are you?

222
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,480
You're on my turf.

223
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
And you ask who I am?

224
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,680
Don't get physical with me.

225
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm here looking for someone.

226
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,920
Looking for someone?

227
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
Who are you looking for?

228
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,560
My younger brother.

229
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,440
Mao Xie.

230
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,000
He was working here with you.

231
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,240
He suddenly disappeared.

232
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you going to hand him over,

233
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,400
or should I call the police to search?

234
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Brother

235
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Did you know he committed a crime?

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,520
Yeah, I know.

237
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,560
Otherwise, why would I be looking for him?

238
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,560
If you know, then it's easier to talk.

239
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,600
Think about it.

240
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,800
He got into such big trouble.

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,040
Could he really stay with me?

242
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
He ran off a long time ago.

243
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Where did he go?

244
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,520
I really don't know.

245
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,600
Big brother

246
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,280
Big brother

247
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,480
Please, tell us.

248
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
Where is our younger brother?

249
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,880
Our brother is only in his twenties.

250
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
He's in the prime of his youth.

251
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,840
How could someone just disappear like that?

252
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,440
Please, we're begging you.

253
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,280
Tell us where our brother is.

254
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,080
Calm down.

255
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,800
Our elderly mother

256
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
cries at home every day.

257
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,440
Please, tell me.

258
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,240
Where is our brother?

259
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Wait, calm down, calm down.

260
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
You look a bit familiar to me.

261
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,840
Don't try to chat me up like that.

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,240
What now?

263
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,520
You haven't found him.

264
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
I could get you in trouble too.

265
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
I don't think you're in charge here.

266
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
Get Jin Fei out here.

267
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
He's your boss, right?

268
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,800
Brother

269
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
Let's talk somewhere else

270
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,040
Alright

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,240
Let me be honest with you

272
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
He got into trouble here with me

273
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,040
If the police catch him

274
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,960
He'll be done for

275
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,720
If this gets out of hand

276
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,400
It won't be good for anyone

277
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,000
Your brother's been with me

278
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,600
He's been doing a good job

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,280
So the boss arranged for him

280
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,600
To go abroad and lay low

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Once things settle down

282
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,240
We'll find a way to bring him back

283
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,240
This money

284
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,640
You take it for now

285
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,360
Go home and reassure your mother

286
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
It's nothing serious

287
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,440
He'll be back after a while

288
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Alright then

289
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,560
Then we'll

290
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,640
Go back and try to talk to her

291
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,480
See you

292
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,400
You guys

293
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
How did you know our boss's name?

294
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
We came looking for someone

295
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Had to find out some details first

296
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,600
I heard

297
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,840
Tang Jun has become a suspect.

298
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,320
What happened?

299
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,200
The task force at his home

300
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,760
found items from the Erinius organization,

301
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,520
including a black everlasting flower and an invitation.

302
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,320
Now we suspect

303
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,680
but it's only suspicion.

304
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
that he has already become a member of the organization.

305
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,920
He has always

306
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
been fixated on Ran Haochuan's death.

307
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,600
He can't let it go.

308
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,720
I understand.

309
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,200
After all, that was his mentor.

310
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,160
Yes.

311
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,720
But as a police officer,

312
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,120
you need evidence to handle a case.

313
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,680
You have to stick to the facts.

314
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
You can't act recklessly.

315
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
We are now making every effort to apprehend him.

316
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,080
I hope he himself

317
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,920
can realize his own mistakes.

318
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,360
The steaming noodles are here.

319
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,920
Here.

320
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,720
Have some.

321
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm not eating.

322
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,120
Let me borrow the car.

323
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
You're going to the gravel quarry again?

324
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,480
The situation

325
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,800
is probably not that simple.

326
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,920
Shibie was so eager to get us to leave.

327
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm afraid Maoxie is in grave danger.

328
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,920
I'll go take another look.

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
See if there's anything else to find.

330
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,800
No, that's too dangerous.

331
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
When we went there today,

332
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,040
didn't you see it too?

333
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,760
Did you forget what I do for a living?

334
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
I know what I'm doing.

335
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,080
Here.

336
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,160
The keys.

337
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Then be careful.

338
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,360
Thank you.

339
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,680
Hello.

340
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
The Double Ninth Festival is here.

341
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,160
May I ask how you plan to celebrate?

342
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
We plan to take the elders

343
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,760
and the children to visit Egret Island.

344
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,200
Egret Island is a great choice.

345
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,840
Let me tell you, young lady,

346
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,960
my son

347
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,240
and my daughter-in-law

348
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
are truly very filial.

349
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,400
You know,

350
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,160
I must have done a lot of good in my previous life

351
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
to have such wonderful children.

352
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,600
Love is mutual.

353
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I believe, sir,

354
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,000
you must treat them very well too.

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,040
As for my mother-in-law,

356
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,920
she is the best mother-in-law in the world.

357
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,360
Alright, thank you.

358
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,560
Wish you a happy festival.

359
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Happy festival!

360
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,600
Xiao Qiu

361
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,440
Xiao Qiu

362
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,160
Xiao Qiu

363
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,520
Hello

364
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,360
I am a reporter from Time Online

365
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,280
The Double Ninth Festival has arrived

366
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,520
Do you have any plans?

367
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,680
I really miss my parents

368
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,840
But because work is too busy

369
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,720
I can't go back to spend the holiday with them

370
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Did you prepare any gifts for them?

371
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,320
I sent them a massage chair

372
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,680
I hope that during their busy days

373
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,560
they can enjoy some relaxation

374
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,720
Alright

375
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
Thank you for accepting our interview

376
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Nine and nine return to one

377
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,560
The beginning of everything

378
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,640
All things are renewed

379
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,120
Dear viewers

380
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,560
As the Double Ninth Festival arrives

381
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,840
Let us take this opportunity to wish

382
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
all the elderly watching on TV

383
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,040
a happy holiday

384
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,680
Xiaoqiu,

385
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,040
what brings you here?

386
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,200
I've been cooped up at home for too long.

387
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,760
Just

388
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,840
came out to get some fresh air.

389
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,360
You're already an adult,

390
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
but you have no sense of safety at all.

391
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,160
I heard

392
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,480
you might be on Erinyes'

393
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,360
revenge list.

394
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,560
Coming out alone

395
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,560
is really dangerous.

396
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,120
What revenge list?

397
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,080
All my life,

398
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,880
I've been way too cautious.

399
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,560
There's no way I have any enemies.

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,960
Suit yourself.

401
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Cheng Feng,

402
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,440
come pick me up in a bit.

403
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,600
You,

404
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,600
do you want to join us for a late-night snack?

405
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,760
What,

406
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
you don't want to go?

407
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,160
No, no,

408
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,040
I want to go.

409
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,920
I want to go.

410
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,840
Let's go.

411
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,840
Alright then.

412
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,320
That's strange.

413
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,640
How did you know I was here?

414
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Did you forget what your dad used to do?

415
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Are you blind?

416
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,760
Watch your mouth.

417
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,920
This girl’s got quite an attitude.

418
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,200
Hey, little brother, it’s okay, it’s okay.

419
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,240
What do you mean, it’s okay?

420
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
Let her go!

421
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,120
What are you doing?

422
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,840
Let go!

423
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,920
Let go of me!

424
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,000
Let go of me!

425
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
Let go of me!

426
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Police! Don’t move!

427
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,640
We’ll take you to the hospital.

428
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,520
I’m fine.

429
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,320
How are you fine?

430
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,240
Hurry, go to the hospital!

431
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Why are you here?

432
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,160
I was worried about you.

433
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,160
Why does he have so many injuries?

434
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
He was beaten to death.

435
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,840
Get in the car.

436
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,480
It's me.

437
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,920
Where did you go?

438
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,600
I'm in Tongde.

439
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,560
At the sand and gravel quarry.

440
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,680
I found Mao Xie's body.

441
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,480
The one who killed people with the expensive gun.

442
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,480
Check this out.

443
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,640
I think there's something wrong.

444
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay.

445
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,680
Also,

446
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,040
Look into Chu Hong.

447
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,760
Does she have a case in Tongde?

448
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,040
Chu Hong?

449
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,320
The lawyer?

450
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,160
That's right.

451
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,760
She's with me.

452
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
You suspect her?

453
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,200
Hard to say.

454
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,040
Alright.

455
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll check.

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,160
Thanks.

457
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,040
Xiao Qiu.

458
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,880
Uncle Gao.

459
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,920
I have something urgent to do.

460
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,040
I need to go back first.

461
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,880
Okay.

462
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,880
Go ahead.

463
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,840
You go take care of your business.

464
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,280
Later, Xiao Qin, Yezi, and I

465
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
will take the old man back.

466
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,720
Don't worry, Captain Cheng.

467
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,760
We'll definitely get

468
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
Sister Xiao Qiu and Uncle Gao home safely.

469
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,800
Then take good care of Uncle Gao.

470
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,120
Goodbye.

471
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,120
Goodbye.

472
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,800
It's not easy being a police officer's family, is it?

473
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,520
Whenever there's a mission, it's day and night nonstop.

474
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,760
Sacrificing the small family for the greater good.

475
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,680
Weren't you like that too back then?

476
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Back then

477
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,160
You and your mother really suffered a lot.

478
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
It's all in the past.

479
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,720
I think Mom, wherever she is now,

480
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,560
has probably let it go too.

481
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,280
Yangfan Cement Factory

482
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,000
I went to Luanxin.

483
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,000
The receptionist confirmed it.

484
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,160
Lawyer Chu

485
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,960
did indeed go on a business trip to Tongde.

486
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600
Okay, I understand.

487
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,800
I also looked into

488
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,640
the gravel yard you mentioned.

489
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,200
The legal representative is Jin Fei.

490
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,600
There are no issues with their finances or taxes.

491
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,200
And there’s no criminal activity.

492
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,720
But there is something odd.

493
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,240
They supply goods all year round only to a company called

494
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Yangfan Cement Factory.

495
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
And this cement factory

496
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
supplies cement year-round to Sun Ruhai’s real estate projects.

497
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,240
They provide cement.

498
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,440
There’s an old news article.

499
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
I’ll send it to you.

500
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,560
Okay.

501
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,880
This person

502
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,360
is one of Sun Ruhai’s subordinates.

503
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,760
The person in the photo is called Jin Fei.

504
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
He was considered

505
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,680
one of Sun Ruhai’s top men back then.

506
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,640
Did you get it?

507
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,160
This game

508
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,320
is way too big.

509
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,480
What do you mean?

510
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,600
I'm going to meet Jin Fei.

511
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,520
There's always infighting at the quarry.

512
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,400
It's too chaotic.

513
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,360
Come back first.

514
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,080
We'll handle any problems together.

515
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
Stop fussing.

516
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,400
And also,

517
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,360
about this matter,

518
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,840
don't tell Ran Yue.

519
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
You go first.

520
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
Where are we going?

521
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,440
I'll take you back to the clinic first.

522
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
In four hours,

523
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,160
call me.

524
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,400
If I don't answer,

525
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,320
call Cheng Feng.
