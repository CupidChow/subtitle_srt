1
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
How much is it for one room?

2
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,880
One hundred.

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,520
Open one room.

4
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,640
Bro.

5
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,480
Want to play?

6
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Are you safe right now?

7
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,400
Why did you act on your own?

8
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,000
He caused Xiaoping's death.

9
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
We will help you get your revenge.

10
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
But you broke the rules.

11
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,840
The police are already protecting him now.

12
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
We're in a passive position.

13
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,960
So what should I do now?

14
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Complete your mission.

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Don't worry.

16
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
We will never let go of

17
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
anyone who is guilty.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,720
Go in.

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,880
Let me out.

20
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,200
Let me out.

21
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,360
Hu Yi

22
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,160
Hu Yi

23
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,160
It's me.

24
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm Sister Xiaoqiu.

25
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,720
It's me, I'm Sister Xiaoqiu.

26
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm Hu Yi.

27
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm Sister Xiaoqiu.

28
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Sister Xiaoqiu.

29
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
It's okay now, it's fine.

30
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Wei Qin and Wei Ping are siblings.

31
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,600
They are...

32
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,880
They came in 2004.

33
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,840
When they arrived, one was ten years old

34
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,040
and the other was five and a half.

35
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,800
Their health was very poor at that time.

36
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
Malnourished.

37
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
Thin and small.

38
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
It was heartbreaking to see.

39
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,560
Well,

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
it's these two.

41
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
Everyone, stop for a moment.

42
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,880
Stop for a moment.

43
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Today,

44
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,120
we have two new friends joining us.

45
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
They are brother and sister.

46
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,400
The older brother is Wei Qin.

47
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
The younger sister is Wei Ping.

48
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,120
What should we all do?

49
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,280
Welcome.

50
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,400
Welcome, welcome.

51
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Come on, lift your heads.

52
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,760
Take a look at what they look like.

53
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,480
That's right.

54
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,840
Lift your heads and see what they look like.

55
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Take a look.

56
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,440
Look.

57
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,360
Lift your heads and see what they look like.

58
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,160
Look.

59
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,640
This child, Wei Ping,

60
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,840
has a gentle nature.

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
She is very quiet.

62
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,320
She is often bullied by other children.

63
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,040
She is so thin,

64
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
she can't eat much.

65
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,560
Let me help you.

66
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
Wei Qin, how dare you hit me!

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,280
Just watch, I'll beat you to death!

68
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,320
What are you looking at?

69
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,000
Go!

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
Hit him!

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,320
Hit him!

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,560
Hit him!

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
Hit him!

74
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
Hit him!

75
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,320
Hit him!

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,560
Hit him!

77
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
Hit him!

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Hit him!

79
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,880
Oh, right.

80
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,960
We heard

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,240
Wei Qin

82
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,040
later beat up a boy.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
Yes.

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
That was

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,680
probably in 2012.

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,760
Wei Ping was thirteen at the time.

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,440
She was studying at No. 48 Middle School.

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,720
That boy

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,240
was her classmate.

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Wei Qin beat him

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,960
so badly he was disabled for life.

92
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
At that time, Wei Qin

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,160
was already eighteen.

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,920
He was sentenced to ten years.

95
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,520
Why did Wei Qin beat that boy?

96
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,880
It's really quite pitiful.

97
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
That child, Wei Ping,

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
at school,

99
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,120
was always bullied by that boy.

100
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,440
She was bullied terribly.

101
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,760
It's said

102
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,520
he even secretly took some indecent photos.

103
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,240
I don't know exactly what happened at school back then.

104
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm not sure about the details.

105
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
At that time, Wei Qin

106
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,640
had already left the welfare home, right?

107
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,120
Here,

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
once you turn eighteen,

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
you can usually leave.

110
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,520
Before that,

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,120
Wei Qin was studying at a

112
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,520
some kind of technical school.

113
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Which technical school was it?

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,160
Here,

115
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,200
we have

116
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
records of all that information.

117
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,520
It's this one,

118
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,560
Luzhou Information Technology School.

119
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,720
That's the school.

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,520
And what about Wei Ping?

121
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,400
A few years after Wei Qin was locked up,

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
Wei Ping committed suicide.

123
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,160
At that time, I was on sick leave at home.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,120
I don't know exactly what happened.

125
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
If only I

126
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
hadn't been sick,

127
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,320
maybe

128
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,600
I could have talked to her and helped her.

129
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
Director Zhang

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,360
Do you know

131
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,440
if anyone

132
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,240
is close to Wei Ping?

133
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Like classmates or friends?

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,400
Could you give us her contact information?

135
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,400
I remember

136
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,800
there was a classmate who was quite close to her.

137
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Named

138
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,440
Zhang

139
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Zhang... what was her full name?

140
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,680
Zhang Xiaohua.

141
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
The two of them got along very well.

142
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,400
Wei Ping,

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
yes,

144
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,280
our relationship

145
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,320
was pretty good.

146
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,800
Back then, those middle school students

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,960
all looked down on us

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
kids from the welfare home.

149
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,640
So we stuck together and played.

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
I just didn't expect it.

151
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,960
That Wei Ping would commit suicide.

152
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did they bully Wei Ping?

153
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,720
Do you even need to ask why?

154
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,000
That group of people,

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,480
rely on their privileged family backgrounds

156
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,120
and want to show off their superiority.

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
They act like bullies at school every day.

158
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,680
Wei Ping doesn't like to talk,

159
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,040
and is timid.

160
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
She's the perfect target for bullying.

161
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
The ringleader who bullied Wei Ping

162
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,560
wasn't he crippled by Wei Qin?

163
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,120
You're talking about Li Yan, right?

164
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,120
Yes.

165
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
He was crippled by Wei Ping's brother.

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,440
But he was also acting under someone else's orders.

167
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,200
There's a girl named Chu Ni who's the most hateful.

168
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,120
She

169
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,480
is actually the real mastermind behind it all.

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm so tired.

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
What?

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I feel

173
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
so tired.

174
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Xiaohua,

175
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
it feels like

176
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
so many mountains

177
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,440
are pressing down here.

178
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,480
I can't breathe.

179
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,840
I really miss my brother.

180
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
After Weiqin was arrested,

181
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,160
they bullied Weiping even more.

182
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
That morning, I got up

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
and was going to ask her to go to school with me.

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,040
But she wasn't in her bed.

185
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
Hurry, Weiping!

186
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,920
We're late!

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Why didn't the alarm go off?

188
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
I clearly set it last night.

189
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,320
Hurry, Weiping!

190
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
Ah

191
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,520
It was a wrist-cutting

192
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
When she was found

193
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,920
the best time for rescue had already passed

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
Wei Qin

195
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,400
as the prime suspect in the murder of Qin Yang

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
has already been put on a nationwide wanted list

197
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,720
Given the current situation

198
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
we have received these three

199
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
garbled emails

200
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,280
all sent from Wei Qin's residence

201
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
from the same network address

202
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,880
we can basically conclude

203
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,040
Wei Qin

204
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,080
his role in the entire Erinyes

205
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
revenge organization

206
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,440
is much greater than Zhou Guifang's

207
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
he should be

208
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,960
a core member of this organization

209
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,080
Also

210
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Gao Ang, who has always been under Wei Qin's surveillance

211
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,640
should also be

212
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,960
a part of their revenge organization

213
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,400
Qin Yang's murder

214
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,200
is

215
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,880
a mystery in the progress of the whole case

216
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,360
Only by capturing Wei Qin

217
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
can we solve this mystery

218
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
So capture him at all costs

219
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,960
This person is vicious and cunning

220
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,600
Be extremely cautious during the arrest

221
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,920
Ensure your own safety

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,520
Yes

223
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes

224
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes

225
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Chief

226
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
Ren Xiaoqiu is missing

227
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,280
Wu Ma

228
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Mr. Wu

229
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,960
Open the door.

230
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,920
I'm at the door.

231
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
Wu Ma, why didn't you bring your key?

232
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
I left in a hurry and forgot.

233
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Mr. Wu

234
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,200
No one else knows about this place.

235
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,600
You don't need to worry too much.

236
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,840
Changing the environment is just to change your mood.

237
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,520
I'll get everything you need ready as soon as possible.

238
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
So you can live more comfortably.

239
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,760
Cheng Feng

240
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
When was the last time you contacted Ren Xiaoqiu?

241
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
What time was it?

242
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
Yesterday at 5:30 in the afternoon.

243
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,560
Xiaoqiu called me and said she couldn't find Hu Yi.

244
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Then she hung up in a hurry.

245
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
We haven't been in touch since.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,840
I only saw it today.

247
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,520
There was a missed call from after 7 last night.

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,800
Yin Hui said

249
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
Sun Ruhai has always been concerned about

250
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,680
the child in Hu Yi's belly.

251
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,920
That's why I argued with her.

252
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,520
Sanyuan

253
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,400
Check it out.

254
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
After Sun Bin was killed,

255
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,720
his father left an address.

256
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,280
Okay.

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,720
It's Oak Bay Villa.

258
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,480
Number 101.

259
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,840
Cheng Feng

260
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,520
Follow him, don't let him mess around.

261
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,200
Hello, who are you looking for?

262
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,600
The police are here to speak with Mr. Sun.

263
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,160
Why are you in such a hurry?

264
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,120
What's going on?

265
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
Mr. Sun, the police are here to see you.

266
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,080
I thought my son

267
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
was rather rough.

268
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
I didn't expect

269
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,400
you young people are all the same.

270
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,360
Go downstairs.

271
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,120
Please have a seat.

272
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,240
Mr. Sun,

273
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm here to ask you about someone.

274
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
Who are you looking for?

275
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,160
Ren Xiaoqiu.

276
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,120
The reporter.

277
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,440
Did Ren Xiaoqiu come here yesterday?

278
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,520
Let's talk while sitting. Please sit.

279
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,440
Yes.

280
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,200
Yesterday afternoon,

281
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,240
she came by.

282
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,960
Just like you,

283
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,520
she was rather pushy about interviewing me.

284
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,800
I turned her down.

285
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,880
What time did she come?

286
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
What time did she leave?

287
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
We only spoke

288
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,200
two or three sentences.

289
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,520
It was less than a minute in total.

290
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,040
Between seven and nine last night,

291
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,640
what were you doing?

292
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,840
What is the relationship between Reporter Ren and Officer Cheng

293
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,640
exactly?

294
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,000
Officer Cheng,

295
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,680
you

296
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,560
seem very nervous.

297
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,440
She's my girlfriend.

298
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,400
I thought you came here to tell me

299
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,920
about the progress of my son's case.

300
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
I didn't expect you were here to look for your girlfriend.

301
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,920
As for me,

302
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,120
last night I just

303
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,840
had dinner,

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,840
watched the game,

305
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,760
Italy scored a goal,

306
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,160
and the whole world was cheering.

307
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,800
We have evidence from last night

308
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,240
that Ren Xiaoqiu was still at Oak Bay Community at eight o'clock.

309
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,120
If you still don't tell me,

310
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,920
don't stop me, don't stop me.

311
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,520
Entertaining important guests.

312
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,160
Police, police!

313
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,680
Sorry.

314
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,200
What's wrong with you?

315
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,760
Sorry.

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,200
Sorry.

317
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
Police, police, police!

318
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,560
You police nowadays

319
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,880
why are you all so unruly?

320
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,240
Sorry, Mr. Sun, for disturbing you.

321
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,360
Let's go.

322
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,600
Come on, let's go.

323
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,160
Wait.

324
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,960
Officer Cheng

325
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
If I were the criminal

326
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
you would have made a big mistake

327
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
This is called alerting the enemy

328
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,480
Young man

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,080
Sometimes

330
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
you need more experience

331
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
I'll talk to him later

332
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,440
Sorry

333
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,240
Sorry

334
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm leaving

335
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,280
Sorry

336
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,400
Sorry for disturbing you

337
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
Let go

338
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,320
Go

339
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,200
Let go

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
Let go

341
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,480
Let go

342
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,760
Do you think fieldwork is just playing house?

343
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,120
Can you outsmart this old fox?

344
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,360
He's right

345
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,840
This is exactly alerting the enemy

346
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,520
Why don't you just stick to your computer

347
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
and be the network administrator

348
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,080
Why are you running around?

349
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,680
Why did you come here?

350
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
If I hadn't come

351
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,560
how would you wrap things up?

352
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,880
Are you going to search the scene?

353
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,480
Do you have a search warrant?

354
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,280
Come with me somewhere

355
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,240
Let's go

356
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,720
Are you stupid?

357
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,560
Your brain doesn't work

358
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,360
And your eyes don't work either

359
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,200
Nanyang Branch Criminal Investigation Team

360
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,800
Hello

361
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I have a few questions for you

362
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,760
Do you remember

363
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,960
this person

364
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,480
Has this person ever been treated here?

365
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,120
I don't really remember

366
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
Check the medical records

367
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,760
Is there anyone named Hu Yi?

368
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,000
Is the director okay?

369
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
It's fine, it's fine

370
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,440
Hello

371
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
We didn't find any medical records for this patient

372
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,400
That doctor

373
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
Who is it?

374
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
That's our director

375
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Director

376
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,840
Yes

377
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,800
What's their name?

378
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,800
Her name is Guo Aihua

379
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Guo Aihua

380
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,480
Dr. Guo

381
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,080
What are you doing?

382
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,760
Dr. Guo

383
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,720
Director Guo has a surgery

384
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,160
Come out, come out

385
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,760
I'm looking for that doctor

386
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,600
Director Guo has a surgery

387
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,320
Come out

388
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,200
Wait for her to come out

389
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,040
She can't get away

390
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,880
Yan Zi

391
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,200
Check the director of Aihua Women and Children's Hospital

392
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,000
Guo Aihua

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,960
Yes

394
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,960
Captain Ran

395
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,840
Ren Xiaoqiu's phone signal has appeared

396
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
It's moving

397
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
Are you crazy or what?

398
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Do you even know how to drive?

399
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,040
Police.

400
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,960
We need to search your car, please cooperate.

401
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,720
W-What's going on?

402
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,680
I-I'm just a taxi driver.

403
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,080
I follow the law.

404
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,360
I haven't done anything.

405
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,760
Captain Ran.

406
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,800
Get out of the car.

407
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,920
What's happening?

408
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,520
I really don't know, officer.

409
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
Could it be...

410
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,760
A passenger?

411
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,360
Left something in my car?

412
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Between 8:00 and 8:30 tonight,

413
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,400
did you pick up anyone near the High-tech Zone?

414
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
High-tech Zone...

415
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,560
I remember now.

416
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,640
On Minhan Road,

417
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,280
I picked up a man.

418
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,200
He was wearing a mask.

419
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,080
I couldn't see him clearly.

420
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,480
Downtown.

421
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
He said he wanted to go downtown.

422
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,280
We drove less than a kilometer,

423
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,520
then he suddenly said he didn't want to go.

424
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
He insisted on getting out.

425
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
Wasn't he just messing with me?

426
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,480
What's wrong with you?

427
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,040
Didn't you say you wanted to go downtown?

428
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,400
If I'd known it was just a few steps...

429
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
Where on Minhan Road?

430
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
At the intersection of Minhan Road and Keji Road.

431
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,720
Hello.

432
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,960
You all

433
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,320
are from the Criminal Investigation Unit,

434
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
what brings you here?

435
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,160
We need to confirm something with you about a case.

436
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,200
Do you remember

437
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,800
a patient named Hu Yi, who was a maternity patient?

438
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
The patient's information.

439
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,760
As long as your paperwork is in order,

440
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,040
you can check with the hospital administration.

441
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,040
The patients you handled,

442
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,520
are they all registered in the hospital records?

443
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,720
Yes.

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,200
Sorry, officer,

445
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,680
I have another surgery coming up.

446
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
I need to go prepare now.

447
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,640
Dr. Guo,

448
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,440
she looks a bit familiar,

449
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,560
but I can't remember where I've seen her before.

450
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,480
Cheng Feng,

451
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,800
we found Xiao Qiu's phone.

452
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,120
It was in a taxi.

453
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,040
Where is she?

454
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
We haven't found her yet.

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,280
Someone deliberately left the phone in the taxi.

456
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,720
We're looking for this person.

457
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,600
Tang Jun is with you, right?

458
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,920
Yes.

459
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,960
Head back to the station first.

460
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,000
There's something off about that Guo Aihua.

461
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,200
Let's go back to the station first.

462
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,320
Guo Aihua

463
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,240
Forty-five years old

464
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,480
Divorced fifteen years ago

465
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,760
Has been raising her son alone

466
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,520
She used to work at the municipal hospital

467
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,720
as an obstetrician and gynecologist

468
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,080
Because of her excellent medical skills

469
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,560
she is quite well-known in the field

470
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,760
Five years ago, with the rise of private hospitals

471
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
an investor provided her with funding

472
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,360
and she opened this

473
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,680
Aihua Women and Children's Hospital

474
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Does everyone remember

475
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,160
the case cracked in Luzhou half a year ago

476
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,720
the overseas romance scam case

477
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,160
I know

478
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,000
It was the Security Information Team

479
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,160
that assisted in solving it

480
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,840
In this romance scam case

481
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,800
just in Luzhou alone

482
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,480
more than twenty women were scammed

483
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,200
That's right

484
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Guo Aihua was one of the victims

485
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,240
She was scammed out of

486
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,400
over one million yuan

487
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,520
Afterwards, she realized something was wrong

488
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,160
and reported it to the police

489
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,040
Yes

490
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,880
She even helped us lure the scam group

491
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,840
to Luzhou

492
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,640
so we could catch them

493
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,320
No wonder she looked so familiar

494
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,720
Was the money recovered?

495
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,760
Only a small portion was recovered.

496
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
But this incident

497
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,480
had an impact on Guo Aihua

498
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,960
that was more than just about money.

499
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,560
Her reputation suffered greatly.

500
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,440
The investors

501
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,080
also withdrew their funding from the hospital.

502
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,720
Does she have a son?

503
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,920
Studying in the United States?

504
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,440
Yes.

505
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,720
He’s attending high school in the United States.

506
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,160
And it’s a private school.

507
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,960
A private school?

508
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
She must be wealthy.

509
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Guo Aihua is quite well-known in Luzhou.

510
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,520
She has connections in both business and politics.

511
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,120
It’s very likely she knows Sun Ruhai.

512
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,760
A woman who was scammed by a romance fraud,

513
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,120
and has been a single mother for many years,

514
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,320
how do we find a breakthrough?

515
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,160
Do any of you three have a partner?

516
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,520
We're doomed.

517
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,240
There's no empathy at all.

518
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Who says so?

519
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,840
I have a boyfriend.

520
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,000
Come on, come on.

521
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,520
Your sister-in-law,

522
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,880
made some braised ribs for you.

523
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,560
To make your lives a little better.

524
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,400
Come on.

525
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600
A mother,

526
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,680
is a symbol of great love.

527
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,960
Some people,

528
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,720
they just

529
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,840
can be both a father and a mother.

530
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,680
Taking care of a bunch of kids.

531
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,560
That's a good mother.

532
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,920
You rascal,

533
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Come on, what are you waiting for?

534
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,640
Hurry up and come over.

535
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,160
Come, here are some chopsticks.

536
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,360
Hello, Director Guo Aihua.

537
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,760
You are...

538
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,320
I'm the chief of the Nanyang branch.

539
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Zhao Yunping.

540
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
This is our Criminal Investigation Unit's Sanyuan.

541
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
Please show your ID to the director.

542
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,920
We came today

543
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,360
because we'd like to have a chat with you.

544
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,160
If you don't mind,

545
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,800
if it's convenient for you,

546
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
could we speak in private?

547
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,880
Sure.

548
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,640
This way, please.

549
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,400
Director Guo, I saw online

550
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
that you attended

551
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
the Luzhou Medical Investment and Financing Summit.

552
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,960
Managing

553
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,480
such a large hospital on your own

554
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,720
is really not easy.

555
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,240
You must need funding.

556
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,160
A hospital this big has so many employees.

557
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,840
Staff need to be paid.

558
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,560
Equipment needs funding.

559
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,240
Operations also require expenses.

560
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,720
As a woman,

561
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,280
I really admire you.

562
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,760
You're short on money, aren't you?

563
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm not.

564
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
Women's and Children's Hospital.

565
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,360
Women and children.

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,960
Mothers go through life and death.

567
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,960
Children come into a new world.

568
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,920
Do you have children?

569
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,640
A boy or a girl?

570
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,680
A boy.

571
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,400
How old is he this year?

572
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
He's eighteen.

573
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,200
Then he's not much younger than me.

574
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Let's sit down and talk.

575
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,000
Please, have a seat.

576
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,520
Do you still remember when your child was just born?

577
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,960
I remember it very clearly.

578
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Ten years ago.

579
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,800
My child is ten years old this year.

580
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
Ten years ago, I was still young.

581
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,720
At the door of the operating room,

582
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,760
I was like a silly kid.

583
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Just waiting there.

584
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,240
I was so anxious.

585
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
My head was covered in sweat.

586
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,840
Soon, the doctor brought the baby out.

587
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,920
And placed the baby in my arms.

588
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,880
Guess what?

589
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,400
I didn't dare to move.

590
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,240
The baby was so tiny.

591
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,160
The baby's head was only this big.

592
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,400
About the size of my palm.

593
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,120
I didn't know how to hold a baby.

594
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,240
I supported the head with one hand.

595
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,160
And the bottom with the other.

596
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
I just kept looking at the baby like that.

597
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,280
He didn't open his eyes either.

598
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,800
His little face was all wrinkled up.

599
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Guess what?

600
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,320
I thought he was beautiful.

601
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Beautiful.

602
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm just a father.

603
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,200
No matter how much empathy I have,

604
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,160
I still can't truly

605
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
understand the hardships of a mother.

606
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
You've seen Hu Yi.

607
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,360
She's so thin and frail,

608
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,360
yet she's suffered so much.

609
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,120
You don't know

610
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,400
that when she can't sleep at night,

611
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,160
she goes to the living room

612
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,240
and picks up a knife from the fruit plate,

613
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,120
waving it in the air.

614
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
She's not mentally ill.

615
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,360
She's afraid.

616
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,320
She's protecting her child.

617
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,160
She's already been through so much trauma.

618
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
She's afraid her child

619
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,800
will also get hurt.

620
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
So she treats the knife

621
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,760
as the safest tool.

622
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
A girl like her—

623
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,840
isn't she pitiful?

624
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,160
A mother like her—

625
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,120
isn't she great?

626
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,760
Director Zhao,

627
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,120
I was forced.

628
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,200
Really.

629
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,040
Director Guo,

630
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,280
come with me to see a patient.

631
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,160
Sorry for the trouble.

632
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,200
Director Guo,

633
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,360
please think carefully.

634
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,800
The place where Sun Ruhai hid Hu Yi—

635
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,000
that place—

636
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
does it have any distinctive features?

637
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,880
Pick up.

638
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,600
Hello.

639
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,720
Tonight at eleven o'clock,

640
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,400
someone will go to Aihua Women and Children's Hospital

641
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,320
to take Guo Aihua to the location where the hostage is hidden.

642
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,800
to give Hu Yi a physical examination.

643
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,400
We have reason to suspect

644
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
that the mastermind behind this is Sun Ruhai.

645
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,920
Based on our current clues,

646
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,560
the hiding place is most likely near the High-tech Zone.

647
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,120
We will be at Aihua Women and Children's Hospital

648
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,680
and set up surveillance along the route to the High-tech Zone.

649
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,320
Team A, led by Da Kuandai, will wait at Aihua Hospital.

650
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,800
Team B, led by Ding Yifei,

651
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,160
will be at the entrance of the Jiànshè Road tunnel

652
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,200
to support Team A's vehicles.

653
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,600
Continue tracking.

654
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,760
Team C, led by Tang Jun,

655
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,880
will be at the intersection of Minhan Road and Keji Road

656
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,840
waiting at the crossroads.

657
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,720
The three teams will take turns tracking

658
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,600
to avoid being exposed.

659
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,560
The command vehicle will be near the center of the High-tech Zone.

660
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,560
Each team should report their status at any time.

661
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Team A's vehicle is in position.

662
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,840
Team B is in position.

663
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
Team C is in position.

664
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,000
Ran's team is ready.

665
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,920
Testing.

666
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,200
Speak.

667
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,280
Try it.

668
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,960
Ran's team.

669
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,880
Ready.

670
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,480
My colleague,

671
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,640
will take you back to the hospital in a bit.

672
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Don't be nervous.

673
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,240
Just act as you normally do.

674
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,960
Our people

675
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,560
have always been by your side, so don't be afraid.

676
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
The tracker will also send

677
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
your real-time location to us.

678
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,560
Okay.

679
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,880
Let's go.

680
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,840
The target has been picked up.

681
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,520
The target vehicle has exited Jiayi Road.

682
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,800
Heading towards the High-Tech Zone.

683
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,560
Copy that.

684
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,120
Boss, the car behind us—

685
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
has been following us.

686
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,440
The target vehicle is approaching the tunnel.

687
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,160
Understood.

688
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,320
Don't follow too closely.

689
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,080
Team A, pull out.

690
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,840
Team B, take over.

691
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,600
Roger.

692
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
It's fine, let's go.

693
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,280
Team B has taken over.

694
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,400
The target car is heading into the High-Tech Zone.

695
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,560
Go for it.

696
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,240
Boss.

697
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,680
The car behind is chasing us.

698
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,400
Keep going, take the side road.

699
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,320
The target car has entered the side road.

700
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,240
Turn there.

701
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,040
Catch up quickly.

702
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,280
Stop the car.

703
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,680
Don't stop, keep going.

704
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,360
Pass him.

705
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Captain Ran, I think we've been spotted.

706
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,080
Turn around, go.

707
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,160
They've turned around.

708
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,040
Turn around, turn around!

709
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
You're trying to trick me, aren't you?

710
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,680
No, I'm not.

711
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,080
Show me your hands.

712
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,400
Captain Ran, the target is gone.
