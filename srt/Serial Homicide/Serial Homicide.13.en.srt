1
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Wu Ma

2
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,000
The person is gone.

3
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Someone has fainted here.

4
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Please make way.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Call 120 quickly!

6
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,120
Jun Ge

7
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
Weiqin got on the bus wearing a mascot costume.

8
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
They headed toward Siji Road.

9
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,240
What's the license plate number?

10
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't notice.

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
A white bus.

12
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
It's full of children.

13
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,000
He’s already gotten out of the car.

14
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,120
She still dares to run around outside.

15
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
She’s probably gone crazy from being cooped up inside.

16
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Let’s go, follow her.

17
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
Stay close to her.

18
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,680
Pass her, pass her!

19
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,200
Jun, Jun!

20
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,680
Wu Xinxin is acting strange today.

21
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,320
She wants to shake us off.

22
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400
Where are you?

23
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,320
Here.

24
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
Fengqi Road.

25
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
Contact the bureau.

26
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Request backup.

27
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
Hurry, keep up!

28
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Don't move.

29
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Why are you arresting us?

30
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,080
Jun.

31
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
Wu Xinxin tricked us.

32
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,040
She's now driving a

33
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,760
black Buick.

34
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,520
License plate number:

35
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
Lu A0L001.

36
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
Heading toward the Nanhuai Road exit.

37
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
She's out of our sight.

38
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Xiaopang, Yanzi.

39
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
Track Wu Xinxin's phone.

40
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,240
Yes.

41
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,680
Yes.

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,760
Chief.

43
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Found it.

44
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
The target is on Nanhuai Road.

45
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,520
Heading west.

46
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,480
She's going to the airport.

47
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,120
Police

48
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,760
Don't move

49
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,000
Someone is hurt

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Call an ambulance

51
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,080
Brother, my car

52
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
My car

53
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,840
Brother

54
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,720
Get in the car.

55
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,360
Chase him.

56
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Let go of me.

57
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
Release me.

58
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,280
Go.

59
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,960
Have you confessed?

60
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Since you arrived until now,

61
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,200
you haven't said a single word.

62
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Get out.

63
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,160
Why did you kill?

64
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Are you proud of killing people?

65
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,200
This is your sister, right?

66
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,800
Don't mention my sister.

67
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,160
Do you think your sister

68
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
would want to believe her own brother

69
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
is a murderer?

70
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,600
I told you,

71
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
don't mention my sister.

72
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,720
When you dream,

73
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,520
do you dream of your sister?

74
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
I said, don't mention my sister.

75
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,400
What would your sister say to you?

76
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,640
What would your sister say to you?

77
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
Did you hear me?

78
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,640
Don't mention my sister.

79
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,880
Do you dare to tell your sister what you've done?

80
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,600
Don't mention my sister.

81
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,120
Don't mention my sister.

82
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,160
Would she accept you as her brother, who kills without remorse?

83
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
I'm telling you,

84
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,840
don't mention my sister.

85
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,600
Do you dare to use your bloodstained hands

86
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,160
to touch your sister?

87
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,280
Don't mention my sister.

88
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,920
Did you hear me?

89
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,640
Would she be happy for you?

90
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Don't mention my sister.

91
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,240
The data from your computer

92
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,000
has already been fully recovered by us.

93
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,320
Whether you admit it or not,

94
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,720
you planned

95
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,320
and organized the murder.

96
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,680
This is already a solid fact.

97
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,720
Very soon,

98
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,320
you'll be able to see your sister.

99
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
I want a lawyer.

100
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,200
That's allowed.

101
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,000
I want the best one in Luzhou.

102
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
The one from Sun Ruhai's firm.

103
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,960
Lawyer Chu.

104
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,720
The suspect has requested to see a lawyer.

105
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,040
That's his legal right.

106
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
As for us,

107
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,840
we're notifying you according to procedure.

108
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,360
As for whether you meet him or not,

109
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,640
the decision is yours.

110
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
My fees are very high.

111
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm afraid he can't afford it.

112
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,240
Then why did you come?

113
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,840
You came but don't plan to see him?

114
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,360
And also,

115
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,240
those reporters outside,

116
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,520
you called them here, didn't you?

117
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,120
You know he's a major criminal,

118
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,480
and want to use this opportunity

119
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,200
to advertise your law firm.

120
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,080
Promote it a bit.

121
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Officer Tang,

122
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
you're as sharp as ever.

123
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
But I'm warning you,

124
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
given the current situation,

125
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,280
any information

126
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,640
must not be disclosed to outsiders.

127
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,080
Don't worry, Officer Tang.

128
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,520
Regarding the case,

129
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,800
I won't say a word.

130
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
I understand the rules.

131
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Besides, when it comes to those reporters,

132
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,520
the less I say,

133
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,080
the more valuable the advertisement becomes.

134
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Take your trash with you.

135
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll drop you off here.

136
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,840
Officer Tang.

137
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,280
If you have time, can I invite you for a coffee?

138
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Maybe another time if I'm free.

139
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,440
If I have time, I'd rather get some sleep.

140
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,320
Alright.

141
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,280
Goodbye, Officer Tang.

142
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,080
Goodbye.

143
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,520
Take care.

144
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,880
Looks like you do have time.

145
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,640
Then I'll go have coffee.

146
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,360
Captain Ran.

147
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,800
Wei Qin has started talking.

148
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,320
Look.

149
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
There's no time left.

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
Sun Ruhai.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,880
Sun Bin.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,880
Qin Yang.

153
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
I killed them all.

154
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,080
I'm the one you're looking for.

155
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,240
Erinyes.

156
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,080
As for me,

157
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
I've gathered

158
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,720
everyone who harbors hatred.

159
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,000
We punish criminals together.

160
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,840
We

161
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,560
take revenge for each other.

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,040
Officers,

163
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
you should actually thank me.

164
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,120
There are many criminals out there you can't deal with.

165
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
We can help you with that.

166
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,080
This is a society ruled by law.

167
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,680
We don't need you to be the judge.

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Do you have any other revenge targets?

169
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
No.

170
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,520
Except Gao Ang.

171
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,200
What grudge do you have against Gao Ang?

172
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,960
He caused my sister's death.

173
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,320
He caused your sister's death.

174
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,880
Back then,

175
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,680
that little witch who bullied my sister,

176
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,240
her dad was an official.

177
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,080
Gao Ang let her go.

178
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
Get in the car.

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Officer Gao,

180
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,400
sorry to trouble you.

181
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,040
They're just kids.

182
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
It's normal for them to fight and mess around.

183
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,520
In the future,

184
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,480
just let me know if there's a problem.

185
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,280
Let go of me!

186
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,840
Let's go.

187
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,800
Hurry up, go!

188
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,200
Call your brother again if you dare!

189
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,760
Call the police to arrest me again!

190
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,440
Filthy witch with no parents!

191
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Take her clothes off for me.

192
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,760
Later on,

193
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I heard

194
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,040
the Discipline and Inspection Committee investigated her dad.

195
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,400
Her dad committed suicide.

196
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,640
That little witch and her mom also got into a car accident.

197
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,600
They all died.

198
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,880
People like that,

199
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,600
even heaven won't let them go.

200
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
Now,

201
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,680
only that useless cop Gao Ang is left.

202
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
Gao Ang

203
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,120
didn't kill your sister.

204
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,160
Turning a blind eye is the biggest crime.

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,720
Officer,

206
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,720
if he hadn't turned a blind eye to that girl back then,

207
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,920
my sister wouldn't have been bullied.

208
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
My sister wouldn't have been bullied.

209
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,520
She wouldn't have died.

210
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,440
You are doing a murder swap.

211
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
In your part of the plan,

212
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
who is going to kill Gao Ang?

213
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,880
I will.

214
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,920
Gao Ang.

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,120
I have to do it myself.

216
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,040
How is it?

217
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,720
See for yourself.

218
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,320
Your father-in-law is really something.

219
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
What are you looking at?

220
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Wei Qin has already confessed.

221
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,840
He also said

222
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,320
he wants to kill Gao Ang.

223
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,000
Wei Qin didn't tell the truth.

224
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
What do you mean?

225
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,480
Erinyes

226
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
is a very typical

227
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,960
ritualistic serial murder case.

228
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,240
The perpetrator places great importance on the ritualistic process

229
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,160
and the form.

230
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,360
For example, Sun Bin was castrated,

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,200
Yin Hui was burned,

232
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,840
Sun Ruhai was buried alive,

233
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
An Wenju was electrocuted.

234
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,920
All of these are closely related

235
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,880
to the evil deeds they committed.

236
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
Erinyes has another characteristic:

237
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
murder by exchange.

238
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,720
They won't easily break this pattern.

239
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,680
Otherwise,

240
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,000
they would rather not kill.

241
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Wei Qin said he wanted to kill Gao Ang himself.

242
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,360
Theoretically speaking,

243
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,440
he is lying.

244
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,040
Even if he wants to do it himself,

245
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,360
the organization wouldn't allow it.

246
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,360
Besides,

247
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,240
all of Erinyes' emails

248
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,440
borrow passages from Greek mythology.

249
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,960
Given Wei Qin's educational background,

250
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,240
it's hard for him to do that.

251
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,880
So,

252
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,320
Wei Qin has an accomplice out there.

253
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,800
His accomplice has arrived.

254
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
The police are already watching you.

255
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,640
I am the administrator.

256
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Your new contact.

257
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,560
Find a way to shake off the police.

258
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
The mission has been moved up.

259
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,040
What does that mean?

260
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,960
Is it the woman seeking revenge or the woman being harmed?

261
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,240
Both are possible.

262
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,960
Athena's email.

263
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,680
It points to the avenged person, Wu Xinxin.

264
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,120
The email about the grave.

265
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
Revealed the method and location of the revenge.

266
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
Driving the livestock back to the tent.

267
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
It means the revenge will take place at the slaughterhouse.

268
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,200
We must accurately

269
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,840
determine what the email is referring to.

270
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,440
Only then can we possibly save the victim.

271
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,520
Otherwise,

272
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,480
it will be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

273
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,680
In Greek mythology,

274
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
there is a goddess

275
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,240
named Aphrodite.

276
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
She is tall.

277
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,480
Her features are gentle.

278
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
Her blonde hair is soft.

279
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,560
As if a beautiful crown rests on her head.

280
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,600
She is the embodiment of beauty

281
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,120
and sensuality.

282
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,800
She is also the goddess of desire.

283
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,840
Don't kill me.

284
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Don't kill me.

285
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Don't kill me.

286
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,560
Don't kill me.

287
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,440
Don't kill me.

288
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,120
Ms. Wu.

289
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,280
Ms. Wu.

290
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,000
Honey.

291
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,720
I was wrong.

292
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm begging you.

293
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,160
Let me go.

294
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,480
I was wrong, I really was.

295
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,160
Don't kill me.

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,760
Ms. Wu.

297
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,760
Don't be afraid.

298
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,640
It's us.

299
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,160
Ms. Wu.

300
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,160
Come closer.

301
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
At this point,

302
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
you have to tell us everything you know

303
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,400
and tell us everything.

304
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,960
Only then can we help you.

305
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,200
Don't tear down my house.

306
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
You can't tear it down.

307
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,320
How are we supposed to live?

308
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,760
This is our own house.

309
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,160
How can you just decide to demolish it?

310
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,240
Go back, go back.

311
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,520
No one can touch our house.

312
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,600
Who dares touch my house?

313
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,160
You'll have to go over my dead body.

314
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,800
If you want to tear it down, you'll have to get through us first.

315
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,000
They pushed.

316
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,280
Number fourteen.

317
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,560
Come over here.

318
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,160
You can't tear it down.

319
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,720
They're here to tear down our house.

320
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,040
They're really coming.

321
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,640
I'm not afraid of you.

322
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,120
Number nineteen

323
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,680
Push quickly

324
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,240
There are still people inside

325
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,240
There are still people over there

326
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,480
Don't demolish it

327
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,600
There are people inside

328
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,720
Brother

329
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,040
You can't just stand by and watch your younger brother

330
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,560
at this critical moment

331
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
get ruined by this mess in Xishan Village, right?

332
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,720
How many times have I told you

333
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,160
you can't be so reckless

334
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,640
Five lives

335
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
What do you expect me to do?

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,080
Figure it out yourself

337
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:12,920
Brother

338
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,000
Big brother

339
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,920
Big brother

340
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
Those people from Xishan Village

341
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
have been blocking the company entrance

342
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
And you still have the nerve to talk

343
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,120
It's five lives at once

344
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,800
The higher-ups said

345
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,960
this can't be settled at all

346
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,560
What do you want me to do?

347
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,280
Big brother

348
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,280
Xishan Village

349
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
We've hit a tough situation this time

350
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,560
If we don't show them we're serious

351
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
we can't proceed with the demolition

352
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,160
Sun Ruhai

353
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Looks like you've grown some wings

354
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,240
Is that right?

355
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,080
Fine

356
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,000
Then this case

357
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,360
is yours to handle

358
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
If you can't handle it

359
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
this mess

360
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,600
you take the fall

361
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,280
The people above

362
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,160
refers to

363
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,800
I don't know

364
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
How could Shisong possibly

365
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,720
tell me about something like this?

366
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,240
He never treated me like a person

367
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
This matter in Xishan Village

368
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,880
You have to help me settle it

369
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm telling you

370
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,120
If you can't handle it

371
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,040
I'll be dead

372
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,640
Think about it

373
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,360
It's been so many years

374
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,800
Back and forth between us

375
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
We've long been in the same boat

376
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,440
I remember every single thing clearly

377
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,520
I'm telling you

378
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,840
If I die

379
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,960
Will you be okay?

380
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,600
If you

381
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,040
want to go all out this time

382
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,360
I'll see it through to the end

383
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,440
Shisong's suicide

384
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,560
happened

385
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,240
not long after the Xishan Village incident, right?

386
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,600
He didn't commit suicide

387
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,040
He was murdered

388
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,120
Who killed him?

389
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,120
Sun Ruhai

390
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,800
Are you crazy?

391
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm not doing this

392
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,720
Don't you want to end

393
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,440
the nightmare of Shisong abusing you as soon as possible?

394
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,480
Shisong,

395
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,560
he only has one younger sister studying abroad.

396
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,280
If he dies,

397
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
you are

398
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
the primary heir to his estate.

399
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
Shisong has powerful connections.

400
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,320
Aren't you afraid they'll come after you?

401
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,760
If I wasn't confident,

402
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,480
I wouldn't have

403
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,040
asked you to meet me here today.

404
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,840
About the Xishan matter,

405
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,120
Shisong can't cover it up anymore.

406
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,520
His so-called connections

407
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,240
now see him as a thorn in their side.

408
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,040
Let me be honest with you.

409
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,720
This whole thing

410
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,040
was actually his idea.

411
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
It has to be done.

412
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,760
If we do it,

413
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,440
it benefits both of us.

414
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,400
If we don't,

415
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,520
neither of us will ever have peace.

416
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,480
I can't bring myself to do it.

417
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,200
Don't worry.

418
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,520
I won't make you do it.

419
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,800
Then what do you want me to do?

420
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,920
You just need to

421
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,840
make sure Shisong falls asleep.

422
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,960
I'll handle

423
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,960
everything else.

424
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,880
Just think about it—

425
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
once this is done,

426
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,840
you, Wu Xinxin,

427
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,280
can do whatever

428
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,720
you want.

429
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,360
After I agreed to Sun Ruhai,

430
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,240
the plan was quickly set in motion.

431
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,120
Have a glass of water.

432
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,440
Where are you going?

433
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
I'm just going to take a shower.

434
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,920
Ishimatsu

435
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,120
Ishimatsu
