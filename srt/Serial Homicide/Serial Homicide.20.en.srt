1
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,280
Look, is he moving?

2
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
It looks like he is.

3
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,080
It’s probably muscle spasm.

4
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,400
The neuromuscular blocking agent isn’t working.

5
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,840
I’ll give him a bit more.

6
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Here.

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Get ready for surgery.

8
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
The patient has lost consciousness.

9
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,560
Prepare for resuscitation.

10
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,120
Defibrillator.

11
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,240
Found it.

12
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,200
Okay.

13
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,920
Apprehend the suspect.

14
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,560
Chief Chen.

15
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,600
Xiao Tang has been located.

16
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,480
Found.

17
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,640
He headed toward the old shipyard in the old town.

18
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,000
This guy is slippery.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,280
That area is complicated.

20
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,800
There’s little surveillance.

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
It’s a good place to hide.

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,760
Chief Chen.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
I’ll deploy officers.

24
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
Requesting approval.

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,520
Approved.

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,240
Xiao Pang.

28
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,360
Where are Ran Yue and Cheng Feng?

29
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,760
Chief Zhao.

30
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,400
Captain Ran and Cheng.

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,480
They went to the nursing home.

32
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
They should be back soon.

33
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,760
Chief Zhao.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
We’ve found traces of Tang Jun.

35
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Ran Yue.

36
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,520
Take your team immediately.

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Go to the abandoned shipyard in the old town and make the arrest.

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,520
Xiao Pang, Yan Zi.

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
Keep monitoring the surveillance.

41
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,560
Yes, sir.

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,880
I hope they’ll remain objective.

43
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,120
Don’t let personal bias cloud their judgment.

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
Your worry is unnecessary.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Trust these young officers.

46
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Let’s hope so.

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Stop!

48
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,200
Move.

49
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,600
Haonan.

50
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,600
Let's go.

51
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,640
You guys, get on the boat.

52
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,200
Yes.

53
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,280
Talk.

54
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,560
Who sent you?

55
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Damn it!

56
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,440
Okay, I'll talk.

57
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,680
It was CC.

58
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
CC sent me.

59
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,720
Why does CC want to kill me?

60
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,360
I don't know.

61
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,200
I get paid to do the job.

62
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,640
He's on Madiexiang Road in the old city.

63
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,520
At an adult store.

64
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,680
Stop!

65
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,440
Ajun.

66
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,680
How long are you going to keep lying?

67
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Come with us.

68
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
There's someone inside.

69
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,080
Check him out.

70
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
Tang Jun.

71
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
Tang Jun.

72
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,480
Officer Ran.

73
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,640
Arrest him first.

74
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,680
Officer Ran.

75
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
Downstairs.

76
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,880
Officer Ran.

77
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,960
He's still alive.

78
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
Take him to the hospital.

79
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,280
Okay.

80
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,600
You two.

81
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,360
Good work.

82
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,160
Thank you.

83
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,400
You guys,

84
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,120
What are you even doing here?

85
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
So many officers on the case,

86
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
and you still let him escape right under your noses.

87
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,040
Where's Zhao Yunping?

88
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Darn it.

89
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,240
He went to the detention center to interrogate Zhao Lingjing.

90
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Really?

91
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,760
Did he find anything?

92
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,120
Actually, Zhao Lingjing's plan was

93
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,920
We'll step out for now.

94
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,920
What was it?

95
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,800
Tell me.

96
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
Zhao Lingjing's plan was to have

97
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,720
Tang Jun kill Gao Ang.

98
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,600
If that didn't work,

99
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,320
then Chen Xiaonan

100
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,520
would make a bomb instead.

101
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,440
So,

102
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,120
So what?

103
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,480
What are you still hesitating for?

104
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,320
Bring Tang Jun in as soon as possible.

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,520
Otherwise,

106
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,200
you can start worrying about your job as Chief.

107
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Yes, yes.

108
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Chief Chen, please don't be angry.

109
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,800
Please, have a seat.

110
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Sit down, let me explain.

111
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,840
Sit, sit.

112
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,560
No need to get so worked up.

113
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,680
If it's confirmed that Tang Jun

114
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,520
is a suspect,

115
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,080
I'll bring him in immediately.

116
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
Right away.

117
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,120
I'll arrest him as fast as possible.

118
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
Don't be upset.

119
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,080
I'll hurry.

120
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,040
As soon as possible.

121
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,120
The higher-ups are watching this case closely.

122
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
If we don't solve it,

123
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,800
none of us will have it easy.

124
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,640
Yes.

125
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,160
The neuromuscular blocking agent isn't working.

126
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,560
I'll give him a higher dose.

127
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,680
Here.

128
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Prepare for surgery.

129
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
The patient has lost consciousness.

130
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,400
Prepare for resuscitation.

131
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,280
Defibrillator.

132
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
During the resuscitation,

133
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
the patient suffered sudden cardiac death.

134
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Unfortunately,

135
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
the resuscitation failed and the patient died.

136
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,280
He's dead.

137
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,360
Officer Ran,

138
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,400
the patient is dead.

139
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's dead.

140
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,000
We've lost another lead.

141
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
Who is trying to silence Tang Jun?

142
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Hang in there.

143
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm sorry.

144
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,000
About Xiao Qiu,

145
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
it's not your fault.

146
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
If it weren't for

147
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,400
me distracting my colleagues

148
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
and taking Gao Ang away,

149
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,640
the killer wouldn't have

150
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,960
had a chance to get into Gao Ang's home.

151
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,040
Xiao Qiu

152
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,680
wouldn't have been hurt.

153
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,400
I don't blame you for this anymore.

154
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you trust me?

155
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Cheng Feng,

156
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
I'll do whatever it takes

157
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
to bring the killer to justice.

158
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
About the fatal accident,

159
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,240
I need you to handle it for me.

160
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,800
Besides this one million,

161
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,640
the demolition company

162
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,760
will give you ten percent of the profits.

163
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,680
I'll give that to you too.

164
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,920
Shi Song,

165
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
this incident has too much social impact.

166
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,880
I can't handle it.

167
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
So now you want

168
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
to wash your hands of it?

169
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,520
Don't forget,

170
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,120
we're all in this together.

171
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
The manager sent an email to my inbox.

172
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
There's a new message.

173
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,680
Download it from my email.

174
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
See if you can find any clues.

175
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,920
Okay.

176
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,560
Yan Zi,

177
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,680
I sent you a file.

178
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,040
See if you can extract the original audio.

179
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,440
Alright.

180
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,240
Xiao Pang,

181
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,040
Try to trace the sender's IP address.

182
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,080
Got it.

183
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,800
Jun's email account

184
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
has its IP address encrypted.

185
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,000
It's hard to trace.

186
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,960
Hurry up.

187
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,720
Officer Ran,

188
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,840
inside the victim's body,

189
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
a large amount of neuromuscular blocking agent was injected.

190
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
The dosage

191
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
far exceeded the normal

192
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,280
amount used in general anesthesia.

193
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,320
It's estimated

194
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,400
the victim died from

195
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,280
anesthetic failure.

196
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,080
Anesthetic failure.

197
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
The victim woke up during surgery,

198
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,280
which is called anesthetic awareness.

199
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,400
The chance of this happening

200
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,720
is only 0.1%

201
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
to 0.2%.

202
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,160
After anesthetic failure,

203
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,840
the anesthesiologist

204
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,600
gave the victim

205
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
an even higher dose of neuromuscular blocking agent.

206
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
blocking agent.

207
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,240
But the victim

208
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,880
would still feel intense pain,

209
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,320
but couldn't call for help

210
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,080
or struggle.

211
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,480
So,

212
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,040
we still can't determine

213
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,200
if this was a medical accident

214
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,680
or a deliberate act.

215
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,760
That's right.

216
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,720
On one hand,

217
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
the victim himself

218
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,560
had very poor tolerance to anesthesia,

219
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
which led to his death.

220
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,040
On the other hand,

221
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,320
it's highly likely

222
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
the anesthesiologist made a mistake.

223
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
But the exact cause

224
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,520
needs further investigation.

225
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,840
Cheng Tou,

226
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,240
we need to look into this anesthesiologist.

227
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,520
This is too much of a coincidence.

228
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
We just got some clues,

229
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
and the person involved died from a medical accident.

230
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
Died on the operating table.

231
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,120
It seems

232
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,920
reasonable enough.

233
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,520
Do you think there's a chance he was silenced?

234
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,440
The mastermind thinks a corpse can't talk,

235
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,520
but actually,

236
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,240
a corpse never lies.

237
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Tang, Tang, Tang.

238
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,920
Officer Tang.

239
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
Let me ask you something.

240
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
At the shipyard,

241
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
who tried to kill me?

242
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,560
What?

243
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,560
Kill you?

244
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,160
Who would dare do that?

245
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Stop pretending.

246
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,560
Wait, wait, wait.

247
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,400
Okay, okay, calm down.

248
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,240
I'll talk, I'll talk.

249
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
Please put the gun down first.

250
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
Don't, don't, it might go off.

251
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,960
I don't know who that person is.

252
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,600
He always called me.

253
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
I've never met him.

254
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
The money was always packed.

255
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
It was sent by express delivery.

256
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,880
Call him.

257
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,640
Tell him he withheld information.

258
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,880
He didn't say

259
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,160
the target was a police officer.

260
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,880
We need to renegotiate.

261
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
Officer Tang.

262
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,080
This...

263
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,560
Isn't this a bit much?

264
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,240
Is it?

265
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,640
Fine.

266
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,840
I'll negotiate.

267
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,760
I'll do it.

268
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,800
I said, boss,

269
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,040
I'm CC.

270
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,160
You asked me to send someone to deal with the police.

271
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,280
You're throwing me into the fire.

272
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,880
You called the wrong person.

273
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,560
Forced demolition,

274
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,320
corruption,

275
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,320
bribery,

276
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
vice crimes.

277
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,120
Any one of these

278
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,160
could put you away for life.

279
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
You dare threaten me?

280
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,600
What do you want?

281
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,760
What do I want?

282
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,720
Of course, I want more money.

283
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
Otherwise, why would I return the recording?

284
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,840
How much?

285
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,360
One million.

286
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Alright.

287
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
How do we make the deal?

288
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,400
Captain Ran.

289
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,600
I've confirmed it.

290
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,640
This anesthesiologist has

291
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
late-stage glioblastoma.

292
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,360
But the oncology doctor said

293
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,600
he's already given up treatment.

294
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,920
And about his illness,

295
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,280
he hasn't told anyone.

296
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,040
The CT scan report

297
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,880
I've sent it to you.

298
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,680
I've seen it.

299
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,280
Find this anesthesiologist

300
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,440
and bring him in for questioning.

301
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,440
Yes.

302
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,480
Name.

303
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Hu Zhi'ang.

304
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,480
Have we met before?

305
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
No.

306
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,040
Hu Zhi'ang.

307
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,280
Regarding the suspect

308
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
who died suddenly during surgery,

309
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,680
I hope you can cooperate with us.

310
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,720
It was a medical accident.

311
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
I didn't want this either.

312
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,280
The nurse noticed his fingers moving.

313
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,920
Look, is he moving?

314
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
It seems like he is.

315
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,920
It was probably muscle spasm.

316
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
That's when I considered anesthetic awareness.

317
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,840
So I gave the patient

318
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,160
an extra dose of

319
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,040
neuromuscular

320
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,320
blocking agent.

321
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,400
Officer,

322
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,800
you can ask around.

323
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
In this situation,

324
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,520
during surgery,

325
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,640
it's permitted.

326
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,280
I didn't break any rules.

327
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
I was just unlucky.

328
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
The patient died.

329
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
All I can say is

330
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,680
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,160
You're sick.

332
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
And it's serious.

333
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
That's not true.

334
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,880
Why did you give up treatment?

335
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,560
I'm all alone.

336
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
No wife or kids.

337
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,400
To this world,

338
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,280
what do I have to hold on to?

339
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Listen,

340
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,560
Officer,

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,480
when dealing with a late-stage cancer patient,

342
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,080
shouldn't you at least show

343
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,080
some basic respect

344
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,680
and understanding?

345
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
My head hurts so much right now.

346
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,120
I need to rest.

347
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,360
I'll tell you one last time.

348
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,120
If you confess your crimes to us,

349
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,760
the law might be lenient.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,520
If you keep pretending,

351
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,520
you know what will happen.

352
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
Glioblastoma.

353
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,200
Late stage.

354
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,920
It's already a death sentence.

355
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,600
Isn't it?

356
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,840
See for yourself.

357
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,000
You know what you're holding, right?

358
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,800
You've been addicted to online gambling for years.

359
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,280
You owe so much money.

360
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,280
You could've stopped in time.

361
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,240
But you never changed.

362
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,480
The money you owe us,

363
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
when will you pay it back?

364
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,280
Please, stop hitting me.

365
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,360
Can you give me a few more days?

366
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,560
I'm really out of options.

367
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,040
If I had money,

368
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,800
I'd pay you back right away.

369
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,720
Stop pretending you're broke.

370
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Doctors don't have money.

371
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Please, stop hitting me.

372
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,920
Please, stop hitting me.

373
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,040
Luzhou Middle School.

374
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,160
Class 6, Grade 8.

375
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,160
Right?

376
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Three days.

377
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,840
If you don't pay us back in three days,

378
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,640
we won't come for you anymore.

379
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,800
We'll go after her.

380
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,480
Xingyao.

381
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Long time no see.

382
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,000
You've got skills.

383
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,640
Why worry about paying off your debt?

384
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,360
Me,

385
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,400
I've got connections.

386
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,360
I guarantee you'll make quick money.

387
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
There's a job right now.

388
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,080
It's about this amount.

389
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,360
Pretty generous, right?

390
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,720
Are you in or not?

391
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,360
It's up to you.

392
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm in.

393
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
Where's that shop?

394
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
In the old town.

395
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,320
On Madiexiang Road.

396
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,080
A shop that looks like

397
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,880
a small adult products store.

398
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,560
Mengmeng Adult Store.

399
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,920
How do you know?

400
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,480
You and the owner of that shop,

401
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,720
CC,

402
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,160
what's your relationship?

403
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,520
He's my twin brother.

404
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,920
But

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
we were separated as kids.
