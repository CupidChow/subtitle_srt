1
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,760
It really wasn't me who started the fire.

2
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,720
He... he said,

3
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,960
he would guarantee my safety.

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,160
He...

5
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,560
Officer,

6
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
who is he?

7
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,600
He... he... I...

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't say.

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,920
He... he'll kill my daughter.

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,960
Please calm down for now.

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
We believe

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,120
modifying the robot vacuum,

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
forcing orders through the app,

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,760
controlling the livestream remotely—

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,560
none of these were done by you.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Tell me,

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,920
who is he?

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,360
Who is the person behind all this, directing you?

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,600
He really will kill my daughter.

20
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,000
He doesn't care about his own life.

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,360
Please trust our police department.

22
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Only we can protect Hu Yi.

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,160
Let me say this to you officially again:

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Only we can protect Hu Yi.

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,800
If we don't catch him,

26
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Hu Yi will really be finished.

27
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,760
Speak.

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
Who is he?

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,800
Tell me who he is.

30
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,760
No.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,760
I don't know him.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
One day, I received a package.

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,280
Inside was a

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
glass dome

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,240
containing a black flower.

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,160
And there was a letter.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
I hesitated during that time.

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
Even though I dreamed

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
of getting justice for my daughter.

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,000
I wasn't afraid, even if killing was against the law.

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,000
But

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
who would take care of my daughter?

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
So later,

44
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,520
why did you accept this task?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
Kill you.

46
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Kill you.

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
I killed you.

48
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
I killed you.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
Kill you.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,960
Kill you.

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,560
I killed you.

52
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Kill you.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Xiaoyi.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,400
Don't come over.

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
I killed him.

56
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
I killed him.

57
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,200
Child.

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
I killed him.

59
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I killed him.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,240
I killed him.

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,160
I killed him.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
He said if I accepted the invitation,

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,920
I should put the black eternal flower on the balcony.

64
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,960
As soon as I put it on the balcony,

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,400
he called me.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
Download an app called Blue Sky Clean.

67
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
Register your identity.

68
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,040
Every day, follow the assigned orders.

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Wear the company's uniform to work.

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Who are you?

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,200
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
Stop looking.

73
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,560
You can't see me.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
Since you've accepted the invitation,

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,760
you have to follow my arrangements.

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,440
I can help you get revenge.

77
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,920
I can also get rid of you and your daughter.

78
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,080
September 8th.

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,400
The night before Sun Bin died.

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,920
He contacted me.

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,400
He told me on September 9th

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,640
between eight and ten o'clock

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,160
to make sure to find a time witness.

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
I guessed he was helping me get revenge.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,720
Sure enough, the next day

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,120
Sun Bin died.

87
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
When did you take the assignment?

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
On the night of the 9th.

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,760
I was already asleep.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,600
He

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,480
He called again.

92
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,080
He told me to watch the news.

93
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,320
He said he had already helped me get revenge.

94
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
And then

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
he explained in detail

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,920
the task he had arranged for me.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,080
Early the next morning

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,040
I received

99
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,280
a glass bottle,

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,080
a robot vacuum,

101
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,640
and a delivery order from Blue Sky Cleaning.

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,880
Mom.

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,920
Xiao Yi.

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,000
How are you?

105
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,200
Did you sleep well?

106
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
I was really scared.

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
So I went to find Reporter Ren.

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,720
I wanted to entrust Xiao Yi to her.

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,080
In case something happened to me, you know?

110
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,840
Then,

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,840
you all came to my house.

112
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
You've never met him, right?

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,800
No, he always uses strange phones

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,320
to call or text me.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,440
Officer,

116
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
can I call Reporter Ren?

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
Xiao Yi is alone in the hospital right now.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm really worried.

119
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,280
Don't worry.

120
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,040
We will contact Ren Xiaoqiu.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
According to Zhou Guifang's statement,

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,320
there is a mastermind behind this.

123
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
But right now,

124
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,960
we can't determine their identity or gender yet.

125
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,760
This person calls themselves Erinyes.

126
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,120
Erinyes.

127
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Erinyes is

128
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,280
the goddess of vengeance in Greek mythology.

129
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,880
Her main task

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,640
is to hunt down and punish

131
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,880
those who have committed heinous crimes.

132
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
No matter where the sinner escapes,

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,480
she can find them

134
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,000
and inflict painful punishment.

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,720
So we infer

136
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,680
this must be an organized

137
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,920
and premeditated serial revenge murder case.

138
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,640
The black everlasting flower

139
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
is a token for joining Erinyes.

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,080
We found the same thing at both Qin Yang's and Zhou Guifang's homes

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,680
and discovered the same item.

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
From this, we deduce that Qin Yang

143
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
is also very likely

144
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,760
to be involved in this revenge scheme.

145
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,280
Sun Bin

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
Zhou Guifang is the enemy.

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,640
Sun Bin was murdered.

148
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,040
Zhou Guifang has a solid alibi.

149
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,640
Qin Yang and Yin Hui are enemies.

150
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,880
Yin Hui was murdered.

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,000
Qin Yang also has a perfect alibi.

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,640
But the killer

153
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
is Zhou Guifang.

154
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,960
From this, we infer

155
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
that the method of killing in their revenge plan

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,920
is very likely

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
murder by exchange.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,680
Are you saying that Qin Yang

159
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,920
might also kill for this revenge organization

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,240
and target other people?

161
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
It's possible.

162
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,760
Is someone watching Qin Yang?

163
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,680
Yes, we're watching. No unusual activity so far.

164
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
The packages Zhou Guifang received

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,720
Have they been tracked?

166
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,280
They were all local deliveries.

167
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,840
And fake names were used.

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,680
No phone numbers were left.

169
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,080
The location was different each time.

170
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,280
There are no leads so far.

171
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
Utterly brazen.

172
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,520
Extremely cunning.

173
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
They have no regard for the law.

174
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,440
Committing crimes under the banner of punishing evil.

175
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Their methods are shockingly brutal.

176
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,680
As long as people like this remain at large,

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
it's a disaster for ordinary people.

178
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
Let's work harder.

179
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
We must catch the suspect as soon as possible.

180
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,960
And take down this organization.

181
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,120
This

182
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,200
is what truly means punishing evil.

183
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
Yes.

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
What's up, Jun?

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Take it out.

186
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,200
What?

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Snacks.

188
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,440
Which one do you want?

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,480
I...

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,440
I want to borrow some from you.

191
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,360
What's that one?

192
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,920
This is a new product.

193
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,520
I haven't even tried it yet.

194
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,960
It's a new product?

195
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,960
I'll buy you a box tomorrow.

196
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,680
Thanks.

197
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Eat something.

198
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,560
If you don't eat on time,

199
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,160
your stomach will end up like your dad's.

200
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,240
You need to take care of it.

201
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
You get annoyed if I say too much.

202
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,080
But if I say too little, you don't listen.

203
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Forget it.

204
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll take you home.

205
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,400
Go home for what?

206
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,160
The case isn't solved yet.

207
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
I'll be fine after I eat something.

208
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,960
If you get sick, it'll be even harder to catch anyone. Come on.

209
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm not going back.

210
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,520
Get up.

211
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,880
Come on, come on.

212
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
Xiao Yi.

213
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,360
Hello, nurse.

214
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,560
Excuse me, where did the patient in bed forty go?

215
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
Her aunt took her away.

216
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,520
Aunt?

217
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,200
How are you?

218
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
I'm okay, I'm used to it.

219
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
What about your injury?

220
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,480
It's healed.

221
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
If you're not feeling well, say something. Don't force yourself.

222
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,960
Why are you looking at me?

223
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
You care about me quite a bit.

224
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
It's called friendship between colleagues, you know?

225
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Gibberish.

226
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
Cheng Tou.

227
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,760
Cheng Tou, the email.

228
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,120
Captain Ran.

229
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,320
There's another new email, just decrypted it.

230
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,280
It's a sentence.

231
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,520
Meet with the female warrior trapped in the skull.

232
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,320
What does that mean?

233
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,120
This phrase is from Greek mythology.

234
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
It refers to Athena.

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
It should be a warning that the killer will strike again.

236
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,760
Athena.

237
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,520
Athena Garden Hotel.

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
Qin Yang is there.

239
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,960
Captain Ran

240
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,760
Where's Qin Yang?

241
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,760
He just started working at the hotel.

242
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
Find Qin Yang immediately.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
He might make a move.

244
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
Got it. Let's go.

245
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
What are you doing?

246
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,040
How dare you touch me!

247
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,120
Get out! Get out of here!

248
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
Are you crazy?

249
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,160
Captain Ran

250
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,760
The two of them just had an argument.

251
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,200
There are other guests present.

252
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,400
Should we go over there?

253
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,800
Don't alert them yet.

254
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,160
About the argument,

255
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,400
Notify the police station to handle it.

256
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,200
Understood.

257
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,360
Is this Erlong Road Police Station?

258
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,160
Athena Garden Hotel gym.

259
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,600
There's been a dispute.

260
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,360
Please come and handle it.

261
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
What's wrong?

262
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,920
He...

263
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,080
He dared to touch me!

264
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,280
Drag him out of here!

265
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
You really are crazy!

266
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,160
Go.

267
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,400
What's going on?

268
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,680
He harassed our boss.

269
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Let go of your hand.

270
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
He harassed our boss.

271
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Let go.

272
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,960
Did you call the police?

273
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
I didn't.

274
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,360
What's happening?

275
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,480
He's my driver.

276
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,920
I was working out just now.

277
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,400
He was being inappropriate with me.

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
So I had my assistant take him out.

279
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,160
Is that true?

280
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
Why are you laughing? I'm asking you a question.

281
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,240
Forget it.

282
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
Officer,

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,720
Look,

284
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
This isn't a big deal.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,560
We can handle it ourselves.

286
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
We won't trouble you.

287
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320
What are you saying?

288
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,520
Since I received the report,

289
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,440
I have to take care of it.

290
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Take him back.

291
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,720
Let's go.

292
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,680
Go.

293
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,160
You come with me to the station too.

294
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,800
Make a statement.

295
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,640
Explain what happened.

296
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,600
Sorry, officer.

297
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,200
I have a meeting soon.

298
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
It won't take long.

299
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Are you driving yourself,

300
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
or will you ride in my police car?

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,880
I have my own car. Let's go.

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,800
Let's go.

303
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,240
Yi Fei and the others have come out.

304
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,840
Captain Ran, bro.

305
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
What's going on?

306
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,920
It seems like

307
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,960
Qin Yang was getting physical with Wu Xinxin.

308
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,720
Then Wu Xinxin got angry and kept yelling at him.

309
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,920
Nothing else happened.

310
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,480
They went to the police station.

311
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
Let's go back.

312
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,160
Got it.

313
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,960
Let's go.

314
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
The executor has already left.

315
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Follow the rules.

316
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
What are you doing?

317
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm delivering a package.

318
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,440
Who is it for?

319
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,920
Zhao Yunping.

320
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,320
Okay, just put it over there.

321
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,200
Director Zhao.

322
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,640
When was it delivered?

323
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Just after seven o'clock.

324
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,800
Director Zhao.

325
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
This was just delivered by the logistics company.

326
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,480
They said it's for you.

327
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Pry it open.

328
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Excuse me, please move aside.

329
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,000
Please move aside.

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,880
Thank you for your hard work.

331
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,600
What's going on?

332
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,320
Judging from the traces at the scene,

333
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,120
the killer probably took advantage when the victim was closing the door to enter the house.

334
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,240
Forced their way in.

335
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,880
Pushed him against this wall.

336
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
No blood was found at the scene.

337
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,080
But there are clear shoe scuff marks on the floor.

338
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
The victim probably struggled fiercely before.

339
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Or resisted.

340
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,280
From this wall

341
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,400
to the doorway, there are drag marks.

342
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,040
They were probably left when the killer took the victim away.

343
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,480
But what we can't determine right now is

344
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,080
whether the victim was unconscious or already dead at the time.

345
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,080
We can't rule out the possibility of a second crime scene.

346
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Okay, I'll head back right away.

347
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,400
Mr. Liao's results are out.

348
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Look here.

349
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
This mark on the neck

350
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
is not from a rope

351
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,800
or any other object.

352
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,040
It was caused by strangulation with bare hands.

353
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,680
The killer is very strong.

354
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,600
Are there any fingerprints?

355
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,680
No fingerprints.

356
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,720
They wore gloves.

357
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,880
Dominant hand.

358
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,120
Was it the left or right hand?

359
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,280
The marks are more obvious on this side.

360
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,600
It should be the right hand.

361
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,760
At the entrance of our bureau

362
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,240
a logistics container truck was caught on camera.

363
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,800
The license plate is fake.

364
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,880
But today, Beipu District received

365
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,480
a report from Yunde Logistics Company.

366
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,080
They said one of their container trucks of the same model

367
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,200
in the early hours today

368
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
entered the Tongle Service Area

369
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,920
and then lost its satellite signal.

370
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,600
The company also can't reach the driver.

371
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,480
The local police found something in the restroom at the service area.

372
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,680
They discovered the driver, who had been knocked unconscious, inside a stall.

373
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,800
He is still in the hospital and hasn't woken up yet.

374
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,440
According to surveillance verification,

375
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,920
he is likely the murderer of Qin Yang.

376
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,280
He hijacked the container truck.

377
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,080
The last sighting of the truck was on Ji'an West Road.

378
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
After that, it entered a surveillance blind spot.

379
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,600
Once the driver wakes up, get information from him as soon as possible.

380
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,440
Understood.

381
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,440
We originally suspected

382
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,000
that the "909 case" was orchestrated by

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
the person who calls themselves Erinyes.

384
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,560
They organized a murder exchange scheme.

385
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,040
But based on this theory,

386
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,800
someone would be avenging Qin Yang.

387
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,640
Then Qin Yang should also be avenging someone else.

388
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,320
But now,

389
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,840
Qin Yang has been killed.

390
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,400
This doesn't seem to match our theory.

391
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,800
I don't think there's a problem.

392
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,760
According to Zhou Guifang's statement,

393
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
the mastermind had threatened her before.

394
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
If she failed to complete the task,

395
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,000
she and Hu Yi would be killed.

396
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
So,

397
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,040
it's very likely that Qin Yang was killed for failing to complete the task.

398
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,400
He was killed in retaliation.

399
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,560
Based on the third email,

400
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,000
the person they wanted to kill

401
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,960
was not Wu Xinxin.

402
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,640
It was also someone connected to the hotel.

403
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,000
What's Wu Xinxin's background?

404
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
She's thirty-eight years old.

405
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,760
She graduated from Luzhou Media College.

406
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,320
But there's something odd.

407
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,800
Yin Hui was her senior at school.

408
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,040
Senior?

409
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,520
Yes.

410
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,720
After they both graduated,

411
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,640
they interned as hosts at this TV station.

412
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,560
But Wu Xinxin

413
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,920
worked there for less than two years

414
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,320
before marrying someone five years older than her,

415
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,720
the real estate developer Shi Song.

416
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,600
After that, she left the TV station.

417
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,200
And less than three years after their marriage,

418
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
Shi Song committed suicide due to depression.

419
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,680
Afterwards, Wu Xinxin inherited

420
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,360
Shi Song's property

421
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,600
and this garden hotel.

422
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,400
And for the next eight years,

423
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,360
she has been running this garden hotel.

424
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
She's been mingling in wealthy business circles for years.

425
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,840
But she has never remarried.

426
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,040
And there's no word of her having any steady

427
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,600
or even casual boyfriends.

428
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Although there's no confirmed connection,

429
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,600
we still need to

430
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,000
keep a close eye on her activities.

431
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Then let's go meet her.

432
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Ms. Wu,

433
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,840
these two officers are here to see you.

434
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,400
Didn't I tell you

435
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm not feeling well today and don't want to see anyone?

436
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,760
We know.

437
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
He told us.

438
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
But this is very important.

439
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,160
We need to talk.

440
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
Is this about Qin Yang again?

441
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,120
Let's talk over here.

442
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,040
I've heard about what happened with Qin Yang.

443
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
But on my end,

444
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,840
I don't have anything to offer.

445
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,800
And I've already said,

446
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm really not familiar with him.

447
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,640
Not familiar.

448
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
That afternoon when Qin Yang had the incident,

449
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,800
why did you two have a conflict?

450
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,800
I don't know how HR picks people.

451
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,800
This person,

452
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,240
usually seems very honest and quiet.

453
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,920
But he actually tried to touch me while I was working out.

454
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,760
So I got angry.

455
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
But it wasn't a big deal.

456
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,400
We explained everything clearly at the police station later.

457
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,040
I didn't hold it against him.

458
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,760
After coming back from the police station,

459
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,600
where did you go?

460
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Officer,

461
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,840
what do you mean by this?

462
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,200
Are you suspecting me?

463
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,440
I wouldn't kill someone over something like this, would I?

464
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,240
Answer the question.

465
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,000
I went straight home.

466
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
I was in a bad mood that day.

467
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,200
I canceled my plans for the evening too.

468
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,600
I stayed at home the whole time.

469
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
The housekeeper

470
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,600
and my assistant

471
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
can both vouch for me.

472
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,000
Before the incident happened to him,

473
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,360
did you notice anything unusual about him?

474
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,200
Or

475
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,120
did he mention anything special to you?

476
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,040
Nothing seemed off.

477
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,280
Officers,

478
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,160
I have something to do soon.

479
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,080
You've pretty much asked everything, right?

480
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes, we're done. Let's go.

481
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,720
Miss Wu,

482
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,040
do you think

483
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,240
Qin Yang would kill someone?

484
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,840
I'm not a psychologist, officer.

485
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,440
As I said,

486
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,640
I don't know him at all.

487
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Besides, judging whether someone would kill

488
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,800
is there any standard for that?

489
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,360
No, there isn't. No standard.

490
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,240
It's just a feeling.

491
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,240
Only the person who did it knows for sure.
