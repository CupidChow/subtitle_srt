1
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,120
Did you get it?

2
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,560
This move is way too big.

3
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
What do you mean?

4
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm going to meet Jin Fei.

5
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,960
There's constant infighting at the quarry.

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,720
It's too chaotic.

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Come back first.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,520
Whatever happens, we'll handle it together.

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
Stop being so fussy.

10
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,960
And also,

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,800
about this,

12
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,120
don't tell Ran Yue.

13
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
You go first.

14
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Where are we going?

15
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I'll take you back to the clinic first.

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
In four hours,

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,560
call me.

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
If I don't answer,

19
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
call Cheng Feng.

20
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Captain Ran.

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
It was Tang Jun who called, right?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,720
The phone.

23
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,640
It's him.

24
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
Did something happen to him?

25
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,960
No.

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,320
If nothing's wrong, why are you so nervous?

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,000
Captain Ran,

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
This is about a case from eight years ago.

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,160
He doesn't want to drag you into it.

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Tang Jun has his own ideas.

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,600
What we can do now

32
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
is to trust him.

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Eight years.

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,400
It's been eight years.

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,560
All these years,

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,720
to find my father's killer,

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
he's endured so much.

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
He's suffered a lot.

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't want him to keep going on like this.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,600
For these eight years, not a moment has passed

41
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,480
without me wanting to catch my father's killer.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,320
To bring peace to my father's soul.

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,960
But whatever problems there are, we can face them together.

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Right?

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,480
He doesn't want you involved.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,560
Because you matter to him.

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,120
Captain Ran,

48
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Let me give you some advice.

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,920
You can be his armor,

50
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,480
but don't become his weakness.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
Let's all take a break.

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Have some late-night snacks to recharge.

53
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,680
Yours.

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Little Fatty.

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Thank you.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
That's right.

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,160
Yan Zi is right.

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
You need to eat to have energy to work.

59
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,720
How about this—

60
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
Let me show you something cool.

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,200
Watch closely.

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,840
Isn't it funny?

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,680
Don't overthink it.

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,920
There must be some misunderstanding in this matter.

65
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Jun would never join that organization.

66
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,840
Yes, yes, exactly.

67
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,280
This must be Erinius

68
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,880
casting an illusion on us.

69
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,840
As long as we can solve this mystery,

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,760
we'll be able to clear Jun's name.

71
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,640
Captain Ran,

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,280
Captain Ran,

73
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,200
Captain Ran,

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
Let me say a few words.

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,120
Everyone has been working hard lately.

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm just like all of you.

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,840
I believe

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,840
there's more to Tang Jun's situation than meets the eye.

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,480
The mystery of the 909 major case hasn't cleared yet.

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,280
We all need to work together.

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,920
Let's catch the culprit together.

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,880
That's right.

83
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
United as one,

84
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,280
we are unstoppable.

85
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,960
Yes.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,440
United as one,

87
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,680
we are unstoppable.

88
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,760
United as one,

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,640
we are unstoppable.

90
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,480
Are you okay?

91
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Me? I'm fine.

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
By the way,

93
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
it's already so late.

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Why don't you

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
go upstairs

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
and have some supper?

97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,000
How about it?

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe next time.

99
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Alright.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
Then let's do it next time.

101
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,920
Well,

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Old man

103
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,400
I

104
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm hungry

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,320
I knew you were hungry

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
And you said you weren't hungry

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Comrades

108
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,560
I'm taking my daughter upstairs for a late-night snack

109
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
Let's go together

110
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
No need, no need

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Thank you

112
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Alright, alright

113
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Let's go

114
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,280
Let's go

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,560
Xiao Qiu

116
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
Come

117
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,960
Come in

118
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,880
Come in

119
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey, daughter

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,200
You, you, you

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,600
You

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,360
Make yourself at home

123
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
There's food on the table

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,640
Have a bite first

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,560
Dad

126
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll make something delicious for you

127
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,840
Xiao Qiu

128
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Sweet and sour ribs

129
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
Here it comes

130
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,640
Come

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,280
Eat

132
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,120
Mom

133
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Why isn't Dad back yet?

134
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Dad

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
He went to catch the bad guys

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,560
Once he's done

137
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,720
He'll be back soon

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,280
My dad is a police officer

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,080
That's right

140
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,160
Come eat

141
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,320
Here it comes.

142
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,320
This is the last dish.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,960
Take a look.

144
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,000
Dad made this for you.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,560
Your favorite sweet and sour ribs.

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,160
Old man.

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,680
When did you learn to cook sweet and sour ribs?

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
I learned it from your mom.

149
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,400
I was busy with work before.

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,400
I never had the chance to make it.

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,360
Try it.

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,160
How is it?

153
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,560
Does it suit your taste?

154
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,360
Here.

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,280
You have one too.

156
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,000
Dear,

157
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,600
Let me report to you.

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
Our daughter came home today.

159
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,200
I’m so happy.

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,880
I made for her

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
your signature dish.

162
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
Sweet and sour ribs.

163
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Eat up.

164
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,800
What’s wrong?

165
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
Is Dad’s cooking not good?

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,600
It’s delicious.

167
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,800
Daughter,

168
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
In this life,

169
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,200
I’ve let you and your mom down.

170
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
I’ve let down my identity as a police officer even more.

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Old man.

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,680
Stop drinking.

173
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,440
It’s fine.

174
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,800
Let me finish what I have to say.

175
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,960
In my whole life,

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,920
the mistakes I've made

177
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,760
can't be changed.

178
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
Every wrong has its source, every debt its debtor.

179
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,280
What I've done

180
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
I have to take responsibility for.

181
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,920
No one can escape that.

182
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,560
Actually, in my life,

183
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
the one I worry about most is you.

184
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
You're not a kid anymore.

185
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,600
When

186
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
I see you

187
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,240
married to Cheng Feng,

188
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
I'll feel like I've fulfilled my duty.

189
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,240
It would also be

190
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
an answer to your mother.

191
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Old man,

192
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,520
you're drunk.

193
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm not drunk.

194
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm just too cowardly.

195
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,640
Dad.

196
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,200
Why are you still here?

197
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I can't leave.

198
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,400
My brother is dead.

199
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,520
Give me an explanation.

200
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,240
What exactly do you want?

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I want to see Jin Fei.

202
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,920
Your boss.

203
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,400
Wait a moment.

204
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,200
Brother.

205
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,120
Mao Xie's body was dug up by his brother.

206
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,560
He insists on seeing you.

207
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,080
Let's bury them together.

208
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,360
Sun Ruhai sent me.

209
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,720
Bring him over.

210
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Okay.

211
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,160
Mr. Jin

212
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
Hope you've been well.

213
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,120
Thanks to you.

214
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,560
I heard

215
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
that Gao Ang's missing gun

216
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
has fired again.

217
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
It's caused quite a stir in the city.

218
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,080
The police in Luzhou are watching you.

219
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
They should have found you by now.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You said that person was a cop.

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Mr. Jin,

222
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
if you walk the dark path too often,

223
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,600
you'll eventually run into ghosts.

224
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
You should admit what needs to be admitted.

225
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,800
Once you admit it, keep completely silent.

226
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,120
Don't let the ghosts haunt you.

227
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,760
It's bad for everyone.

228
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,200
Will you handle it yourself,

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
or do you want me to help you?

230
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,800
You choose.

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
Can you spare my life?

232
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,960
Mr. Jin,

233
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,200
your daughter is doing well overseas.

234
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,560
All these years,

235
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,400
the brothers have taken good care of her.

236
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,640
Rest assured.

237
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,360
Mr. Sun

238
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Don't worry.

239
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
Everything abroad

240
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,720
has been arranged by me.

241
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
You sending my daughter abroad

243
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,960
is the greatest favor you could give me.

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I will repay your kindness.

245
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,560
That's right.

246
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,280
This day has finally come.

247
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Sorry, the number you have dialed

248
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,440
is temporarily unavailable.

249
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
Officer Cheng

250
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,440
This is Chu Hong.

251
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,040
Lawyer Chu

252
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,040
Why are you calling?

253
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,560
Did something happen to Tang Jun?

254
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,920
Tang Jun

255
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
He went to Yuanshan Gravel Quarry

256
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
to find that boss named Jin Fei.

257
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,200
He told me

258
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,000
if he doesn't come back in four hours,

259
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
I should come to you.

260
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,600
But I'm really worried.

261
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,440
So I'm calling you now.

262
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,720
Tang Jun went to see Jin Fei.

263
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,760
By himself?

264
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,600
Yes.

265
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,840
He went alone.

266
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,440
He wouldn't let me go with him.

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,640
What do you think—

268
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,960
Alright.

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,120
I understand.

270
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,840
Brother

271
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
You should go back first.

272
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,240
Brother

273
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,640
This—

274
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,680
Go on.

275
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,720
You came for this, didn't you?

276
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,360
Why do you have this gun?

277
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,960
Eight years ago, you, Sun Ruhai, and Gao Ang—

278
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,720
What did you all do?

279
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,520
Sit.

280
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,960
Since you've come to me,

281
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,920
I'll tell you about it.

282
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,600
Eight years ago, Shisong Demolition Company

283
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,160
killed five villagers in Xishan Village.

284
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,240
But Sun Ruhai got away unscathed.

285
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,960
Do you know why?

286
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
It was Shisong

287
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,280
who took the fall with his life.

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,520
Shisong died.

289
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
The protection from above could cover you.

290
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
We thought

291
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,080
we could get away with calling it a suicide.

292
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
But that cop named Ran wouldn't let it go.

293
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
If this matter got exposed,

294
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,360
everything hidden behind it

295
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,880
would all be revealed.

296
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,800
There was no other way.

297
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,880
Those above had no choice but to have him killed.

298
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,680
We found Gao Ang.

299
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,080
We gave him a sum of money.

300
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,200
He took this gun.

301
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,240
When I found Officer Ran,

302
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,640
he was eating noodles.

303
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,400
He didn't even swallow his last bite.

304
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,280
You killed my mentor.

305
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,880
That's right.

306
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,760
With this very gun.

307
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Now, a life for a life.

308
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,920
I should settle the score now, right?

309
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,840
Put the gun down, put the gun down!

310
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,240
Who?

311
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,080
The car's been stolen.

312
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,480
Catch him, don't let him get away!

313
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,360
Officer Tang!

314
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Are you okay?

315
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,280
I'm fine.

316
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,880
Tang Jun!

317
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,920
Give me the car keys.

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,360
Hurry!

319
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,960
Stop chasing.

320
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,480
I've already notified the Tongde Police Department.

321
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,080
We can't do anything.

322
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,600
It's out of our jurisdiction.

323
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
Leave it to them.

324
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,360
I'm going to find Gao Ang.

325
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,680
I'll go with you.

326
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,440
What are you doing?

327
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,400
It's for your own good.

328
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,520
Thank you.

329
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,120
Lawyer Chu.

330
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,760
Take this thing off me.

331
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,400
I've already gotten in your car.

332
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,560
And I agreed to go back with you.

333
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,360
I've been handcuffed for hours.

334
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Are you afraid I'll jump out of the car?

335
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,360
I don't know how crafty you are.

336
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,480
Until we get to the station,

337
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,880
I won't take them off.

338
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,080
Let me ask you,

339
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,720
Why do you have black preserved flowers at home?

340
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,360
You suspect me too?

341
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,760
During the interrogation,

342
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,640
Zhao Lingjing said it himself.

343
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
You're the last link in the serial murder case.

344
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,920
I don't know either.

345
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
Why I was chosen to join their organization.

346
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Two nights ago,

347
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,240
I received a package.

348
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
After I opened it,

349
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,680
there was a black preserved flower and an invitation inside.

350
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,280
According to their

351
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,600
rules for exchanging murders,

352
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,880
a new round of murder plans has just begun.

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,840
The Erinyes Plan

354
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,680
is very likely

355
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,960
still ongoing.

356
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,200
I

357
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,800
am definitely not the last link.

358
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,800
I think so too.

359
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,680
Zhao Lingjing's testimony

360
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,840
is probably half false.

361
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
So, in that case,

362
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,040
Jin Fei's death

363
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,560
has another cause.

364
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,080
Jin Fei shot himself.

365
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,120
I saw it with my own eyes.

366
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,000
I can testify to that.

367
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
I'm certain

368
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,880
he was also involved in Shi Song's death eight years ago

369
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,640
and was one of the killers in my master's murder.

370
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,720
In the whole incident,

371
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,880
he played a role in fueling the situation

372
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,600
and was a key figure.

373
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,280
But afterwards,

374
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
he disappeared without a trace.

375
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,560
He hid the expensive gun

376
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,480
for a full eight years.

377
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,800
If it weren't for Crab's murder,

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,160
he might have kept hiding it.

379
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
But because of Crab's death,

380
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,720
he was forced into the spotlight.

381
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
Behind him,

382
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,280
there must be a

383
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,720
darker force

384
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,800
pressuring him,

385
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,480
making it impossible for him to survive.

386
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,320
As for the source of this force,

387
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,520
I believe

388
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,480
it's not Erinius.

389
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,120
So you're saying

390
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,800
Jin Fei's death

391
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,040
was an accident in this plan.

392
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,560
It's possible.

393
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,040
I think you're right.

394
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,560
Erinyes never fights unprepared.

395
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,880
And right now, there's no direct evidence

396
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
to prove

397
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,640
that Jin Fei had an enemy for a revenge killing.

398
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,280
And you've also proven

399
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,680
that Jin Fei committed suicide.

400
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,320
So

401
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,480
he really wasn't

402
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
a target of Erinyes' revenge.

403
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,120
Officer,

404
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,520
I really wasn't the one who called the police.

405
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,240
I just went upstairs to deliver food,

406
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,120
and when I came back down,

407
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,080
my bike was gone.

408
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,080
What's your phone number?

409
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,680
One nine one

410
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,560
three three four two

411
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
eight nine zero one.

412
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,440
When you were delivering food just now,

413
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,960
did you see anyone suspicious?

414
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,120
Suspicious people?

415
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,560
Oh, right.

416
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,040
When I was coming downstairs just now,

417
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,680
I did see two men

418
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,920
coming down from this building.

419
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,160
I deliver food in this neighborhood a lot,

420
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,240
so I'm really familiar with it.

421
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,440
When I saw those two,

422
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
their faces looked unfamiliar.

423
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,000
And then

424
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
so I paid extra attention to them.

425
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,800
One of them

426
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,040
seemed to call the other one by the name...

427
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,040
Officer Tang

428
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,240
Are you okay?

429
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
I'm fine.

430
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,120
Tang Jun

431
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,240
What's his name, Tang...?

432
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,560
Tang what?

433
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,040
I can't remember.

434
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,800
Oh, right.

435
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,800
That man with the surname Tang,

436
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,680
he was holding a gun.

437
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,160
I'm going to find Gao Ang.

438
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll go with you.

439
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,720
Check the neighborhood surveillance.

440
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,040
Let's see who these two are.

441
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,280
Sign your name here.

442
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,480
You can leave now.

443
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,480
Officer,

444
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,160
About my car...

445
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,840
Can you help me get it back?

446
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,480
Don't worry.

447
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,680
We'll do our best.

448
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
Okay, thank you, thank you.

449
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,480
Nanyang Criminal Investigation Team

450
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,080
Cheng Feng

451
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,040
Escort

452
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,560
Cheng Feng

453
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,840
I need to use the bathroom.

454
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,160
I'm warning you,

455
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,880
don't try anything funny.

456
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,160
Officer Cheng

457
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,960
Officer Cheng

458
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,440
Officer Cheng, wake up!

459
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,360
Officer Cheng, wake up!

460
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,200
Officer Cheng

461
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
Officer Cheng

462
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,680
Hello, Lawyer Chu.

463
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,600
There's a new case.

464
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,920
I'd like to report it to you.

465
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,600
The Luzhou police

466
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,320
just sent us a message.

467
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,520
Zhao Lingjing wants to hire you

468
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,920
as his defense lawyer.

469
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,920
Professor Zhao

470
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,840
Yes, that's him.

471
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,840
The perpetrator of the 909 major case.

472
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,160
Alright, I understand.

473
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,680
I'll come over as soon as possible.

474
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,040
Are you crazy?

475
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,880
Do you even know how to drive?

476
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,800
It was mainly because of that delivery guy.

477
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't have hit you.

478
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,960
But what if you had hit me?

479
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,160
But I didn't hit you, did I?

480
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
What if you did hit me?

481
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,800
Don't pull me.

482
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Now they're arguing.

483
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,320
Wasn't it because of the delivery guy just now?

484
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,000
Should we try to stop them?

485
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,480
They said it was all about the crash, none of your business.

486
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,160
What are you doing? What do you want?

487
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,560
What do you want?

488
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,680
Stop fighting.

489
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,480
Let's go check it out.

490
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,680
Let's go take a look, come on.

491
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,680
Stop fighting.

492
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,400
What are you doing?

493
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Let go.

494
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,360
What are you doing? Let go.

495
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,320
What are you two doing?

496
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,040
What are you two up to?

497
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,040
He hit my girlfriend.

498
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,120
I didn't hit her.

499
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,000
He didn't hit her.

500
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,800
We all saw it.

501
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,480
We saw it.

502
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,280
Let's go, let's go.

503
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,880
Everyone's leaving, everyone's leaving.

504
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,400
Let him go back.

505
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,120
Tang Jun

506
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,880
Tang Jun is here.

507
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,560
Go.

508
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Tang Jun

509
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,600
Over there, over there.

510
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,240
Chase him.

511
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,360
Split up and chase.

512
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,040
Shout for him to stop.

513
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,240
Why are you running?

514
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,920
My food delivery is about to be late.

515
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,440
Who are you guys?

516
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,400
Who?

517
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,240
Food delivery.

518
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,440
Tang Jun.

519
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,080
You.

520
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,960
Cuff yourself.

521
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,280
Tang Jun.

522
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,960
You.

523
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,120
What are you doing?

524
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Go.

525
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,840
This is kidnapping.

526
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Tang Jun.
